It's increasingly hard for travelers who smoke to find hotels that will accommodate their habit. KBH allows smoking on hotel property and actually sets aside whole floors where smoking is permitted on the room balconies. The hotel staff refer to these floors as smoking floors. Unfortunately for us, we're not a family of smokers. We brought our 4 month old and 4 year old with us on a 10 night stay at KBH in February 2012. Though we had a spectacular ocean view from our balcony, the second hand smoke from neighboring rooms was a near constant presence. Our last 3 nights were the worst, with second hand smoke blowing into our room whenever we opened the sliding glass balcony doors. We did complain to hotel staff and spoke with a hotel manager who politely explained that KBH does allow smoking, but is careful to follow state law. The manager also said that for most of their guests, the smoking and second-hand smoke is a non-issue. Moreover, the manager said, if KBH were to ban smoking on the premises, KBH would lose a large portion of their clientele. Well, you lost this family KBH. Our stay at your hotel left a bad taste in our mouths (literally) and we felt that our health was compromised.

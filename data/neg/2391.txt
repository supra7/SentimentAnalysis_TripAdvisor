This place is trying too hard to be cool, however they forget some basic rules of customer service. I tried to put in my order for breakfast the night before, which I do in every single hotel I stay. This time i was informed that staff tends to lose orders placed the night before so I would be better off calling in the morning. what??? I was speechless. The room itself was OK with pretty thin walls. I could hear pretty much everything that was going on in the hall. Being right next to the elevator didn't help either. We also planned to check out the sky lounge on the top floor of the hotel but they closed it for a private event so hotel guests didn't have access. I beleive that room rate covers access to hotel's facilities. So in a way we were ripped off. Good thing this was just a one night stay. One positive thing was free wi-fi.

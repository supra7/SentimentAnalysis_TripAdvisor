I'm a Hiltonbe Honors member and this was not ahave good experience. We stayed in the north tower in a corner room with a spectacular view but that's where it ends. The room we stayed in was out dated by 15 years and! filthy. Don't take your shoes off here!!! Everything on the floor we stayed was disgusting. The carpets were stained and loose in the hallways. I would not recommend this hotel!

I was disappointed because I read a lot of positive reviews on tripadvisor and was expecting much more for what I paid. The room is... SMALL! At least if you book a standard room. There is non space AT ALL even for the luggage, the bathroom is consisting of just a shower and the room is very warm. No view at all and a bit noisy as well. Anyway, the hotel is clean and the location is good for night life and shopping (but 45 minutes by foot from Old town), the staff is kind. Swimming pool and gym are very small as well. I don't recommend it, at this price you can get better.

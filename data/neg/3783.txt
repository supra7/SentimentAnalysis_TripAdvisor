Using trip advisor recommendations, we stayed here one night on our way to Ensenada Mexico. Very dingy front lobby area, and our room was pretty run down. There was a tile loose in the bathroom, the furnishings all outdated and shabby. Lots of traffic noise from the street, too. Breakfast is non existent - a coffee urn and some dried out pastry. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable. However, we stayed at the Best Western Lamplighter on the way home, and for only an extra $10 - and there were 4 of us, not 2! - we had a much nicer room, very modern, and a super breakfast. Would never recommend the Cabrillo or stay here again.

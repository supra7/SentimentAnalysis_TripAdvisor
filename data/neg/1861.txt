I stay normally once or twice a month at the Millenium Emirates Hotel due to inconvenient flight connections to and from Islamabad. Lately the name was changed into Millenium Copthorn Hotel. The Hotel is conveniently located near to the Airport and a free shuttle service is provided leaving about every 15 minutes. Transit passengers flying Emirates in Economy Class with an overlay of more than 8 hours (STPC) are offered to stay at the Copthorn Hotel. The rooms are spacious, but due to the quick turnover, often housekeeping and maintenance is lacking. Bed sheets are often very old, such as the blankets. Food vouchers are given to the passengers. The quality of the buffet is canteen food; do not expect much; its free. TV channels are basic, not even one English news channel, HBO is there, no French at all, but many in Arabic, Iranian and Indian. In most of the rooms the refrigerator is not working, anyhow it is empty. Internet is prohibitively expensive. Convenient is the free shuttle to the City Centre, leaving about every 75 minutes. Internet is expensive, general service is basic. They want to get you at least 150 minutes before departure of the flight out of the hotel, but with a boarding pass already issued and with no luggage to be checked, 90 minute are sufficient. If I had to pay, I would never stay in this hotel. Good for a couple of hours rest and a shower before the next flight.

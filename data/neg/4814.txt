I stayed at the Sheraton Dallas for 3 nights in March 2009 when in town for a convention. I paid $159/night for a king room in the South Tower (1 of 3 towers in the complex) on the 23rd floor. The hotel is undergoing renovations, and I am only focusing on elements that would hold true outside of the renovations. But my recommendation is to stay at the Westin across the street or one of the other hotels in the area. The Sheraton has a reputation for lousy service, and it is well deserved. The staff lack the sophistication and intelligence of most 4-star hotel staff, including executives. this Sheraton is the Wal-Mart version of a conference hotel: more than 1,500 rooms, dining, and conference facilities to put the show on, feed, house, and bathe convention goers. Do not expect more. The room itself was fine, though the sheets were like newspaper, and there was good water pressure and toiletries. Room service was a bright spot - prompt, well-prepared, courteous. Central Dallas has all the life of a parking lot; stay elsewhere in the city for leisure. At the end of the day, I made all my meetings and appointments, but the hotel contributed little to the productivity of my stay. An excellent 2-star hotel, but not for 4 stars.

The area did not seem to be the best, everything was rundown. The clerk had no idea about anything, but at least tried to be helpful and was always very friendly! The shuttle was not going when we were there so we took a taxi downtown and back (be careful, some drivers try to rip you off!) - the room was very big and nice, there was not much light, so I can't tell if it was dirty. One of the towels had blood stains, so we did not use it. The only disturbing thing was that at 4 am someone knocked hysterically at the door of the room next to us, for minutes and then even started shouting around. I would not stay there again, but it was ok for one night.

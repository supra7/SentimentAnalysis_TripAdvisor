FIrst of all, this place seems nice but it is absolutely disgusting and they have bed bugs!! The rooms are ok but we were bit all over in the middle of the night and the bathroom was not clean. Also, I would not have come here if we weren't here for a convention. The place is in the middle of downtown LA with nothing around but to spend money at their crappy bar. We had come for business and almost HALF of the reservations we had booked MONTHS in advance weren't saved. Clients were very upset. The front desk kept saying they couldn't do anything about it. They were completely unorganized. They claimed we wouldn't have to pay for parking which we DID for $40 a night. The customer service was absolutely horrible! I've never seen such ignorance. We were trying to be so polite the entire time even about complaining about our room. When we were checking out we had boxes that we sent a car to pick up and they wouldn't let us keep them in the lobby or outside to wait for our car! Then when the car came around they wouldn't help us when we had asked politely! I would rather sleep on the street then ever ever step foot in that place again. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. It completely ruined our trip.

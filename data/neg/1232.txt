Better off sleeping in car All I could say is thank goodness we did not prepay. The room was noisy, dark, musty, cramped, dirty. Halls were dark with low ceilings. I was one of the fools who decided to go cheap giving this hotel a benefit of a doubt but I should've have listened to the most recent negative reviews and boy did I suffer thru that night. If you value your sleep and air quality, stay clear away from this hotel. Staff does not uphold company policy to make your stay a better one nor do anything to compensate for your discomfort. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra to stay at a better rated hotel.

We had booked this hotel night for two nights. One was for the night we flew in to Seattle and the other was for the night before we flew out early in the morning. Well, after that first night, we immediately cancelled the second night and booked the Doubletree airport hotel. The place is so rundown, I can't believe it's a Radisson! There were nasty water stains on the ceiling and the location overall was noisy. There was a party going on all night at the ballroom, which we could hear all the way across the courtyard. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if we were closer. The only saving grace about this place was the breakfast which was really good. This is the first and last time we will ever stay at a Radisson.

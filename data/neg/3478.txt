I stayed at this hotel to attend a event at the convention center. The location was great - the only thing great. I certainly do not mind paying more for better service but that is not what we got when we stayed here. The free breakfast consisted of potatoes and oatmeal one morning and some type of tortilla mixture and oatmeal the other morning. They did offer eggs or omlettes however for an additional $5.95. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not include scrambled eggs as a staple for the breakfast buffet. The rooms needed some elbow grease and the furniture some fixing. The high speed interest was extremely slow at best. They only provide valet parking for $22 a day - wow!

I have stayed at MANY hotels of varying types and not have led me to be more disappointed then this one. The grounds are AMAZING and the staff is very pleasant and friendly! However, we went here for our honeymoon and we checked out the same day as we checked in due to the quality of the rooms. We were shown three different room with the same results! They were dirty, dusty, and run down. In addition, decor wise it is very old and motel-like and very dark. We just couldn't bring ourselves to stay there under those conditions on our honeymoon. We are not picky hotel stayers and we really found this one under par! The grounds, i believe, give it the rating of 4 stars but we do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. Hotels in Wailea are worth the $$ (that's where we ended up going and losing out on the money we put down on the Hyatt unfortunately(

Most un-comfortable stay of my life...rooms are damp...fridges in the rooms don't work (despite 2 room changes)...horrible interior...a awful cardboard box for a toilet/shower room! overall disappointed but whatelse to expect from a 2 star hotel! I wasn't able to sleep due to the racket of kids and slamming doors all night...it was just the worst ever! After 1 night I decided to move hotels Pullman Mall of Emirates might have cost 4x as much but it was money well spent! never using this hotel ever again!

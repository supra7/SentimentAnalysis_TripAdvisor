The staff at the desk were terrible. Bordering on rude. No convenience bar key provided, yet tried to charge for soda from room. No vending machines in hotel. The mandatory car parking service was good, but expensive ($28/day). We were given lower floor and had to deal with construction noise across the street and the on-ramp to the freeway. The hotel is convenient to the freeway. Whatever you do, don't go to the adjacent restaurant. We had to track down our waitress to get our bill so we could check out- she was in the lounge having HER breakfast!! Suggest you pay the higher price around the corner at the Crowne Plaza.

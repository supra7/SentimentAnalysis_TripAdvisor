The service at check in was not to good; after it got worse. We arrived in the evening, looking forward to relaxing in the hot tub-- they don't have one! So, we decided to unwind by one of four pools-- Nope, can't do that either- pools close at 5:30.(dark). We complained to the Staff and they were unwilling to even listen- they just continued saying the same thing over and over- sorry nothing we can do about it. We asked to cancell so we could move to a different location and they told us that they had already charged us for two days and we were not going to get it (our money) back. We went to the front desk and asked for a cab, but had to wait until the desk clerk was finished with a seemingly personal phone call. She was also rather rude. At check out, we had to calculate our own bill. Seems the front desk people didn't know how to use a calculator. We tried several time to contact the manager/ Owner- no call back. The front desk did slip-up on that one too. When we tried to reach the manager on Saturday, they told us he was not in; When we brought it up on Sunday, they said, well, he was here yesterday. Which is it? Last year, I traveled for business, and spent 220 nights in several hotels- never did I have this poor service level. Oh, and if you are a smoker- definately forget this place. I would expect no smoking in the rooms, but this place is no smoking on the property! They told us to just go to Walgreens parking lot or face a $500.00 'service charge' and they were quick to point out that they had our AMEX on file. I understand that the owners can make that their policy if they so choose; but, they should make that clear at the time of booking so people can decide what they want to do. I felt like I was held Hostage. I make a decent living, but I can't walk away from a +/-$600.00 deposit.

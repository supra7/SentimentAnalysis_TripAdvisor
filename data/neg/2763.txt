Talk about opening the door and stepping into a horror movie!! My sister and I - two middle aged women - took a trip to see Elvis, and we booked this hotel on line looking at the great pictures! Wow, now that was a mistake. We got there late, about 10pm, you go around a very scary curve, under what seems like a wall in a dark, black area in what I would say is a very run down part of Memphis. The hotel was in a very desolite area, with some lights. My sister stayed in the car when I went in to see if we were in the right place. The two very young girls at the desk were not so friendly, stumbled to answer questions of the area, and seemed very uninterested in anything I was bothering them with. So, I check in and go get all are stuff and my sister, we have to go into this 50 year old elevator that some guy had to mess around with to get it to open. I did not want to even get in it, it smelled like musk. So we get up to our floor and roll out our stuff to bump into about 8 people on the balcony we had to manuver around as they were just drinking and parting and I don't know what? Not happy about that at all, we said ok lets just look at the room, in we go and neither one of us wanted to touch anything, the tub was still dirty, the light in the bathroom didn't work and the toilet was dirty. The only good thing about this was they gave me our money back. Quickly! We spent 2 hours trying to find another hotel in Memphis - which is a bigger story! We finally settled for the Holiday Inn Airport - all inside very clean - nice people, but you can hear the airplanes at like 1am and 5am. Oh well better than Motel 8!

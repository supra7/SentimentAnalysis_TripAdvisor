I would not recommend this "inn" to anyone. The place is old and could use a makeover. Our room was clean but the bathroom was disgusting---tub had rust marks; toilet seat was chipped, tile on floor old. The staff was very nice and helpful. The location is good because it is near the Space Needle and has many restaurants in the area. This is also an area where there are many homeless people hanging around because of all the "foot" traffic. Spend the money and get something decent.

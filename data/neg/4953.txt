Not up to normal Hampton Inn standards. We had a King room with hot tub (didn't use due to hair in it!) Room quite rundown and tatty, bathroom not very clean and dark, accessories hanging off the wall Door lock issues, air con very noisy and uncontrollable. Valet forgot to bring our car around on check out. Not the friendliest front desk on check in.

I'm not a complainer, I'm really not, but I juststaye at possibly the worst hotel in my life. After flight cancellation due to bad weather I booked room online for$100 at this hotel. Granted, the room I got may have been the last room available, I don't know, I can only review based on where was put. To start, the buildings very old, and not in a quaint sort of way, just old. My room did not have a bathroom connected....I had to walk outside my door and go a short way down the hall to get there. I was given a key, but the door would not lock in any case. I find it unbelievable that in this day and age a hotel would rent a room without a bathroom attached....and charge $100 for it. My room was very hot, old, dank, and humid. I did call the front desk to ask them to turn down the temperature (one thermostat to control the entire floor!). I will say that the guy at the front desk (Will) was helpful, he justhasnothing to work with. While true, there was a large flay screen TV, the cable was standard (not hi-def) so the picture was not so great. The morning breakfast was a very light continental, not horrible but unattended and nothing special. I might have stayed overnight at the airport. Unless in a really big pinch (and I don't know what that could be), Don't Stay Here.

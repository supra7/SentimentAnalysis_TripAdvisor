Got to the hotel in a rainy day and my GPS took me to the backdoor and I call to the operator in order to open up, they said simply not possible because our security employees can get wet!!! I drove extra 10 mins to get in the main entrance and two days later somebody broke in to my rented car, surely the security guy cant get wet and the bad guys of course does!

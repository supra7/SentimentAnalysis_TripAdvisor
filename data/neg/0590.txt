1 Since I was going to check out and recheck in 2 days later, I asked Six avenune inn to keep heavey luggage for 2 days because I will come back to check in again but the front desk refuesed. Unbeliable. Othere average hotel always keep the luggage if recheck in 2 days. Six avenue inn is not kindness. I could not go to victoria with easy hand free trip , I had to go to Victoria with carrying heavy luggage. 2 My agency tried to fax to me then asked fax nunber but six avenue inn told first disconnet number, then agency called back for unable to fax, then front desk gave 2nd fax always busy line number , therefore Agency was unable to fax again, Six avenue inn doew not let use customer the fax line because six avenune inn exclude to use internet to other customer therefore unable to receive the important fax. 3 Since unable to fax, My agent tried to call me to the room, but front desk said telephone to the room is not working today then I can imagine to let other customer to use intenet . 1-3 Overall,this hotel does not provide fax service , nor telephone communication service to the room, It is terrible service not thinking for customers. If emergency happen,to family, how guest know the news.? I willl not recommend to ohters to use this hotel.

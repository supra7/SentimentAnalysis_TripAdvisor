Although it is highly rated in these reviews, and you pay a premium price compared with other airport hotels, there is nothing special about this hotel other than its proximity to SEATAC. If you are thinking of staying here, pay attention to the Trip Advisor comments about the hideous views of HVAC equipment from the windows on one whole side of the hotel. Although my room was on the top floor of the building, the view looked like an industrial site, just because of all the equipment on the roof of a lower wing of the building. The room itself was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was functional. But during a rainstorm in the middle of the night, the ceiling leaked. The club lounge, for which I had paid extra, was about as modest as any I've ever seen. But it did have good food at breakfast. The best part of the hotel in my experience was its restaurant. The room itself was extremely ordinary, looking like a roadside restaurant on a freeway, but the food and the service were first-rate. Bottom line: I slept well here. But even though I collect Marriott points, I don't think I'd return to this hotel.

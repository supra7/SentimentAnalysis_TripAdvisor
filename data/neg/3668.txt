We like this hotel. The suites are moderate size. The snack hour in the evening is very good . The only bad thing was the lady in the breakfast room on week days, she is mesn and rude. Sometimes, you hate to go down when she is there. But the lady on the weekend " Lupe" is very nice and friendly. The kids loved her. I won't be back to this hotel because of the breakfast service. They have excellent water pressure in the shower, we loved it!!

This hotel was not at all how the pictures and describtion showed it. There was no A/C in the room. The furniture looked like a few pieces of plywood that were nailed together. I am not sure where the kitchenette was, but it was not in the room. I was afraid that I would be on an episode of Cops. I spent nights in dirty foxholes in the desert and would prefer to spend a night in them over this hotel. Great place for an 1 hour encounter

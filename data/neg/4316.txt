My stay at this hotel started on a bad note: after learning that internet access is an extra $10, I took the bullet and paid for it (this is not the only place to charge for WiFi). But my surprise came when I found that only one device can be connected to the T-mobile hotspot at a time. I wasn't happy to log in and out between my phone and laptop for the rest of the day. T-Mobile customer service (the provider of the WiFi signal) advised me that the hotel management sets the pricing policies, therefore I should discuss the issue with them. The advise I got from the front desk was to buy an other $10 day pass if I want to have both devices connected simultaneously, which sounded ridiculos to me. I know it wasn't a straightforward issue, but the way they chose to handle it left me with a bad impression about this hotel.

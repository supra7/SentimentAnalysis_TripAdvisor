My husband and I travel to Seattle, from the east coast, yearly so I can be treated at a local hospital. What we look for during our annual trips is a quiet place to rest after doctors and tests. This was our third stay for a week at the University Inn (2009, 2010 and 2011) and we were very pleased during our past stays. It is a clean hotel, lots of places nearby to eat, has parking, internet, very friendly staff at the desk, free breakfast. That is all good. However this past visit will be our last. The first night we checked in, our rental car was broken into and trashed--we think it was a homeless person. The rental car had less than 100 miles on it--it was nice, clean, fresh. Very upsetting, taking pictures, filing a police report, trying to clean the urine stench out of the car etc. What was more upsetting, however, was dealing with University Inn management. We were told more than one version of what was seen or not seen on the surveillance tapes, why no action is taken when a car alarm in the parking lot goes off, they did not keep promises as to when management would actually call us back (we got a call 4 days later). But the nail in the coffin was when one of the managers was telling my husband that nothing was seen on the security tape--and then she said to my husband (loud enough so I could hear it from from my husband's cell phone) "WELL SECURITY TAPES DON'T LIE!" I could not believe she would say something that implied we faked a trashed car and our photos--and would be that rude to a guest. It may not be the Inn's fault that our car was broken into, we understand that, but their response is 100% their fault, and being kind and sympatheitic would have gone a long way. They lost us as customers for good.

The hotel is fine, rooms are small but fine, bath products are nice. The steak house restaurant in the hotel is fine too - standard steak house. The pool doesn't get any sun until after 3pm because it's blocked by the other side of the building. And, if you want to use a lounge chair (there are only 4 chairs that aren't "Reserved") they're going to charge you $200! AND... The maid just might come into your room, while you're in there taking a nap, and STEAL your valuable jewelry from right off the table! ...Like happened to me. And good luck trying to recover anything or get any sort of apology. Unacceptable! The complimentary shuttle service might be the best part of this hotel, if that tells you anything. Won't be back.

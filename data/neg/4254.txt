The Eliot is old and charming and we paid $200 for the room, the night after Christmas. When we walked in our room, fresh from the blizzard outside, it was as cold as if the air conditioning had been on. We turned up the heat, but soon cold air was coming out of the air vents again. It was late and I couldn't imagine changing rooms so I slept with a heavy sweater. In the morning, my husband, who normally loves sleeping in a cool room, called the front desk to say HE was freezing. We tried the various things the hotel employee suggested, to no avail. The bathroom was worse; no air vents at all and all marble. Like an icebox. Bottom line is, I think, the walls of this charming old hotel have no insulation and the air vents are way up on the walls, near the ceiling. Would not return.

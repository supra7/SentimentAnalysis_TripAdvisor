We come to london each year for a long shopping weekend and look forward each year to this weekend. Its the first and last time we will stay at this particular travelodge,the reception were very unwelcoming on arrival and it went down hill from there. Our bedroom was at the front of the hotel, which is directly on the main road and directly opposite the firestation, so v. noisy, not helped by the apparent lack of double glazing. We had to ask for towels,pillows,tea coffee etc and were made to feel uncomfortable each time asking for these, the television remote control took 2 days to arrive even though we were promised it would be 5mins each time we asked, and when it did eventually arrive it didnt work. we received the same attitude from the receptionist, and overall poor service from reception whilst checking out, and will never use this particular branch again.

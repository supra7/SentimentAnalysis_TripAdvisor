They call it a hotel but it's not. It's a bed & breakfast without a good breakfast. The information sign near the door stated that they rent out furnished rooms When we first arrived to the lobby we were really surprised. I did not look like a hotel lobby at all. We asked the owner to see the room which see did after a lot of complains. We didn't feel welcome. We had a nice clean room on the front side of the building. And that is like sleeping on the sidewalk. What a noise! But the location is good. Five minutes walk to the Colosseum. We don't advise this hotel. But if you you can't find another place. You will survive.

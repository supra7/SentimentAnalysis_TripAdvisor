I am surprised that as a part of the Luxury Brand Renaissance that Marriott allows this hotel to carry their name. Upon checking in, I was given a room right next to a noisy highway. The room itself was decrepit. Heavily worn out, Scarred furniture and no electrical outlets for a laptop. TV was circa 1985. I went to the front desk and asked for another room and was told there weren't any. I told them I was calling my travel agent. While on the phone, a manager from the hotel approached me and asked me to see if this other room was better. It was on the other side of the building which was quiet, but it was no less decrepit. Old worn out furniture, a very tiny room with occluded windows from water leakage and an iron with a broken handle and exposed electronics. One night is all is all I can stay. At $290 a night I was ripped off.

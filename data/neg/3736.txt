Although it has perfect location and is very cheap, this place is a dump. I currently am staying here as I type. I stayed in room 8 for one night First the A/C is terrible. When its 98 outside its 96 inside. The refrigerator doesn't work, try having warm water and pop on a hot day. It is very dirty,, there's stains on a lot of things plus it is very tiny. Lots of fly's. Also, there is no maid service. If you want new towels you have to walk your old one's down and they also get mad if you use alot of them because they have to personally clean them. There's no telephone's in the room and also just basic cable. The people at the front desk aren't very friendly, therefor they don't care about your complaints. I watched and listen to people coming up complaining about the same things over and over and they just didn't seem to care. Also, there is one microwave in the front lobby that everyone shares. No shampoo, just a small bar of soap. It is very hot!!!!!! The rooms are very old fashioned, sheets don't look too clean. Basically, what you pay for is what you get. We payed close to $90 a night and it seemed as if we were over charged. The parking lot and pool are about a block away and the pools only open 11-5. The only good thing is the location.. I advise you to NOT stay

Got this hotel for a Park, Stay, Fly package. We were leaving on vacation from DFW for 14 nights. We stayed one night in one of their rooms, which can only be described as a shoe box. Ugh it was pitiful at best. At check in another guest and I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to the desk from some back office. We gladly left the hotel for the airport via one of their shuttles (this was a scary trip btw, the driver overloaded the shuttle and it was super rainy. So it fish tailed the entire way to the airport). Now the break in! Half of our party returned to DFW after 7 days to find that both my Tahoe and their Cadillac Escalade had been broken into. I got this news over the phone... not good news when I'm in Hawaii. Don't stay here. This is a sorry hotel. If you can afford it stay else where and definitely don't leave your car!

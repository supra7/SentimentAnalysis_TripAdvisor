It isn't so much the property as it is the customer service ... Hilton Customer Service I prepaid a reservation at Palmer House to have a birthday dinner with my daughter in Chicago. Unfortunately, my mother passed away on March 6 and the reservation was for the day of the funeral. I called on Thursday prior to the funeral to cancel the reservation (out of courtesy and so they could resell the room). Also inquired about any possibility of a refund due to the circumstance. I was told to FAX the confirmation number for the cancelled reservation, along with the obituary and death certificate. That I did. No confirmation of receipt. Called to day to check on the status of the refund and I was told 4 - 6 weeks to process. Asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that none were available and I would get a call back in 48-72 hours. Really? Is this customer service? So I sent an email and the automated reponse says I should expect a reply in 24-48 hours. Really? BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH HILTON ON PREPAID RESERVATIONS. They appaerently don't like to refund your money even with the death of a parent. Very caring company ... not.

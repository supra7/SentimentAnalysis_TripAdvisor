We were greeted promptly and efficiently by the valet and bellman but the front desk person was by himself with a line-up of people waiting to be helped. Lots of noise from outside streets. Eyeglass wipes at turn-down were a nice, different touch. I was disappointed to find the room small and with several items not working, such as the TV or the headboard lights. The headboard lights, we were told by the staff, did not work in any room. The TV was also not repaired before we left. We don't know what was the matter as no one followed-up with us after maintenance attended.

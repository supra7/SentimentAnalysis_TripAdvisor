The rooms are average but i had some issues with the place, nwe booked a one bedroom apartment, which was clean but the 2nd bathroom had a foul smell that even when you complained was never taken care of. We satyed here for 7 days, and the first 5 were spent complaining to the recption about the pool of water in our room. Everytime we reported the puddle they promised to get it fixed. Overalll the staff were friendly but the room always felt dirty and smelt funny, not a giid funny by the way.

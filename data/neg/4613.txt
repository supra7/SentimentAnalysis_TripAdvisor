I have stayed in this historic grand hotel several times, in December of various years, in conjunction with attendance at a conference in Chicago. I have stayed here the past three Decembers, about five nights each time. This time was the deal-breaker for me ... no more Palmer House! First of all, I want to know where the Palmer House gets off charging guests for WIRED internet, at the scandalously high rate of $18/day? You can't use your laptop in the bed. The service drops without warning and can be quite slow. Secondly, could you perhaps renovate and make the bathrooms any smaller? Seriously, anyone over about 180 pounds would have to squeeze and scrunch to fit into the bathroom I had on the tenth floor. Where is the coffee pot now? I realize the mini bar has been gone for several years (I never use those) but how about SOMETHING in the way of amenities? Nothing very "grand" about what I had in my room. The carpet had a disgusting stain on it, and I was actually able to make it "less dark" by doing a little scrubbing. Housekeeping? Anyone there? The room had a tube TV and the hotel receives about 15 channels, most of which are of focused interest. How about some TYLand, TBS, AMC, maybe an alternative to the single HBO channel? And lastly, watch out if you order room service. Read the fine print on the menu ... they want 15.4% state and city tax, a $4.95 "service charge" for delivery, and if after 11pm, an *additional* 18%. Thus, a $15 hamburger quickly become $30. Buyer beware. And the food is so-so, at best. Skip the fat- and cholesterol-laden breakfast bar. 22 bucks (+ a host of taxes) for that glop? No thanks. (And no wonder I never saw anybody in there at breakfast.) I've stayed in Holiday Inns, Marriotts, and even a Days Inn in the Loop or River North areas that had more bang for the buck. Bye, bye, Palmer House. Never again!

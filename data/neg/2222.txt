This place was terrible, I have stayed in Sydney many times and enjoyed the place. This place, however put a dampner on the trip. Staff were almost non-existent, the woman who eventually opened the door to us, immediately wanted us to try somewhere else as there had been a leak in one of the rooms (There was no signs of a leak).We wasn't happy with this and a room was found.Straight away! There seemed to be no one else in the 'hotel' whilst we were staying. Ensuite was the worst I've ever seen and I do Bathroom renovation for a living. Room decor was skanky at best. This place needs to be shut down, fumigated and have some owners that give a s***t installed. It is in a great location, very close to underground, eateries, bars e.t.c. Still not worth staying in it's current condition.

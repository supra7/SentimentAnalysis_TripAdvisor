Check your bill Pros: great location, room service pizza is excellent. Cons: starting to feel outdated, confusing entrance, very tall lumpy uncomfortable bed, heavy lumpy pillows, nickel and dime everything (sensor operated fridge which doesn't even refrigerate, gratuity automatically added to room service, no free wifi), useless cleaning staff (they swept crumbs under the ottoman), not enough water pressure, the gym is so far that you get your workout just getting there and back, very rude impolite staff (arrogant, and supervisors just as bad). I'm surprised they don't charge to use the elevator.

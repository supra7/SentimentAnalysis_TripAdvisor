I wanted to like this hotel given it's history and great location. But the room I had was so out of date. Old TVs from the 80's, equally ancient alarm clock, no wireless internet service, and the world's tiniest bathrooms (even smaller than what you might find in Japan). Middle of the night the thermostat goes wild and the room registers over 80 degrees. A call to the front desk did not get anyone to the room for 90 minutes although 10 minute service was promised. At that point the helper's suggestion was to open the window (with the temperature 20 degrees outside). Eventually a fan was brought, but even that took a while. I turned the heat off entirely, but the street noise then kept me up. With an important business meeting the next morning, this was a disaster! And the front desk the staff didn't even know where my meeting was being held, sending me to the wrong room twice. I know others have had a different experience, but I couldn't be more disappointed with my stay at this hotel, at least in the room I was given. There's a good reason why they were offering bargain rates....!

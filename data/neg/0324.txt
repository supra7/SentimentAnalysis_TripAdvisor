I stayed in this hotel for one night in January 2010 (not May, but I guess TA doesn't go back that far). Haven't been back since, and won't be back, but I remember my impression of the hotel vividly. The website fooled me with it's shiny and well kept-looking photos. This hotel is definitely old, and is definitely in serious need of a thorough update. It would be a pretty cool boutique hotel if this were to happen. My room was around the corner from the elevator, and the noise from that was literally constant. It's true the walls are paper thin. We could practically make word for word of our neighbors conversation. Either it's literally been ages since the walls have been washed, or the no-smoking rule is not enforced, but there was a stuffy, smokey, mushroomy stench throughout the entire hotel. The room, and bathroom, did NOT feel clean and were SO tiny. I was expecting to take a pack of bed bugs home with me. My biggest issue was with the headboard... It was a faux leather material, with huge scratches/gauges scraped throughout, which was pretty sketchy to me. I also had an excellent view of a neighboring concrete building, with an alley of dumpsters below. (If concrete is an unappealing view for you, beware of hotels with online photos of their rooms with the blinds/drapes closed... big red flag!) I personally like things bright, spacious, charming, and clean. If you do too, this is not the hotel for you. It is not at all luxurious. The location is pretty good and central (being from Seattle it's not the location I would want, but close enough), and of course the prices are great for downtown. My stay was pretty basic- just needed a bed- so I have no idea about their amenities if they have any.

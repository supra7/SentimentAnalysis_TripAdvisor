I stayed at the hotel with family to celebrate my niece's wedding being held at a nearby restaurant. My niece, the bride, had her laptop stolen while it was being loaded in a car by the valets & did not receive any compensation from the hotel. I found David who works at the front desk to be extremely rude. We went to the hotel bar after the wedding reception & a hotel employee had to take down a hotel guest, the situation could have been handled better!

My two children and I stayed one night here in October. We only stayed as we had got a good package from Hotels.com for three nights at the Marriott Marble Arch and needed an extra night. We arrived at three 0'clock and our room was ready. It was on the first floor and as you would expect basic. The one thing that struck me was although the bathroom was really clean, the carpet in the room was dirty, and the spare bed was stained and dirty. We made up the bed and there was hardly room to swing a cat. There were party straws under the spare bed and overall it was filthy. The mattress was covered in dirty stains and the pillows so thin I had a bad neck in the morning. This hotel was only thirty pounds cheaper than the 4* Marriott with a pool, gym, executive lounge and feather duvets. It was dirty and the noise of the traffic loud. We couldn't wait to leave and do NOT recommend it to anyone.

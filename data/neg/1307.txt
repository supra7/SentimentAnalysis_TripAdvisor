I booked an overnight stay online for a layover. I informed the hotel that I would be checking in around 10:30 pm and would be leaving at 7:00 am the next day so I would appreciate a quick checkin. I arrived at 11:30 (delayed flight) and the representative at the desk told me there were no clean rooms, that he wasn't sure when there would be a clean room, and that I could just wait. I asked what he expected me to do and he informed me that I could wait a couple of hours in the lobby but he wasn't sure how long that wait would be. I informed the representative that although it wasn't his fault, I was a bit disturbed that I might not get a room until 2:30 in the morning and then check out at 6:30 am. He stared at me with a blank stare and shrugged. At this point I requested that they cancel my reservation (luckily a friend had checked in earlier and had a room in which I could crash) and he so kindly informed me that they would waive the late cancellation fee... Right. I felt horrible for the fellow late night travelers left stranded.... Not once did Hilton's representative act engaged or concerned. Moreover I would expect some sort of apology and perhaps an offer for coffee etc. While suggesting I wait 2-3 hours for a clean room at midnight. That being said, my friend's room seemed clean. The bed was comfortable and the proximity to SEA-TAC can't be beat-that is if you actually get a room.

I recently stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a short business trip. They are renovating this hotel and there is noise everywhere. The elevators in the lobby were being worked on so you had to lug your luggage up 2 flights of stairs. What a nice way to arrive! I moved rooms twice because the noise was either in the walls from the electrical or plumbing, or the banging of construction starting at 8:00am on a saturday morning or outside your window from the train next to the hotel. Every room is a different size - some are like closets and some are huge - very inconsistent. I would recommend staying in more modern hotel instead of this old over the top hotel.

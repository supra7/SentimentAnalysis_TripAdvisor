When we entered the front desk we first thought we where in East Berlin 1973.. The staff was really rude and had no interest in get any service at all. The door to our bathroom had stains of blood and under the bed a mini Sydney zoo was found... The only good thing with this hotel is that it has close location to darling harbour. Dont stay here, you will regret it I promise!

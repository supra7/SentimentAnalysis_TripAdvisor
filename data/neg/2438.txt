Arrived from North England for an overnight stay in London prior to departure on the Eurostar early the next day. Chose the hotel for its convenience to the train stations and innercity location. Traveling with two older children (12 & 14) found the room to be small and very basic as you would expect but the big issue was the street noise and constant noise of sirens and similar throughout the night. Think the hotel could splurge on some double glazing at the very least. Look for alternatives if location is not an issue!!

We stayed here for 1 night before catching the eurostar. I usually go for travelodge when I want good clean comfortable accommodation that is cheap. The hotel only managed to fulfill one of my criteria, it was cheap enough, but that was were the usual comparisons ended. It was not a clean hotel nor was our room comfortable, the bed linen was grubby, when I sat on the bed my bum was nearly touching the floor it sagged so much! The cleanliness of the bathroom left much to be desired and the staff were rude when I asked for an extra pillow, saying they didnt have any! I requested a quiet room as we had an early start, granted it is difficult in London to give you a quiet room but our room was on the first floor, opposite the bus and train station, and the door to the lift so quiet it definately was not. I would think twice before staying here again

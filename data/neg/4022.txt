I agree with other travelers. Although the lobby appears impressive, my room was very small and bathroom was outdated. The door to the room look like the entrance to a refrigerator or casket. I checked out one day early because I was claustrophobic. Hotel staff was adequate. Would not recommend this to a friend even though it is very convenient to Downtown Boston venues. I would rather pay more to stay at a more modern hotel with standard amenities.

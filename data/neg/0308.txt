First of all let me say that we had a Groupon so our rate was lower....I am so glad I didn't pay the full room rate. If Groupons are being offered to introduce the property for recommendations or return visits, they lost this recommendation and I won't be returning. So we had a Deluxe King....small room, small bathroom, itty bitty sink and I couldn't dry my hair without the power going out! I was even using the hairdryer provided in the room! One robe in the closet that was ...well I guess it was a robe. We were supposed to get wine and Sees candies in the room. My husband called down about the wine and about 15 minutes later this guy knocks on the door and says "Here." passing a bottle of $6.99 wine (the wine was supposed to be a $30 value) and a box of Russell Stover candy. After the delivery, we discovered there was not a corkscrew in the room. My husband called down about this and they said that they don't have corkscrews in the rooms, but there is one at the front desk. No offer to come up and open our wine...guess we were supposed to go down ourselves to open it. We decided to save it and bring it home....FAIL! All in all...ok..pretty clean, not what we expected. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to be in center of things downtown which the location of this hotel is excellent for that. Service not so great on many occasions but I don't have all night to go into it. It's too bad. But because it was our anniversary we did enjoy ourselves and it didn't spoil our fun BUT we won't be back again.

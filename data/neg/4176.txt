This hotel likes to give the impression of a grand first rate hotel, the entrance is impressive and the staff are all dressed accordingly to fit the surroundings. All is good until you get into your room, they are small, dirty and noisy. Our bathroom was a disgrace we complained twice, on the first occasion nothing was done, the room was appantly cleaned but the coffee making facilities were left half empty as we had left them in the morning and the bathroom was still dirty, I will not go into details but it was not pleasant, again we complained and eventually a surly maid came and wafted her cloth around all to little effect. The carpets are old torn and filthy. Great central location and grand frontage but don't be fooled this place is a bit of a dump on the inside. Don't book theatre tickets through the concierge, they ask you for your preferences and then get you what is available regardless of your price limit, plus you pay for a courier to do the deal for you. Go direct or use one of the many ticket booths available around the city.

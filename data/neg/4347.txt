My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt following New Year's Day. We stayed in a 'Lafayette Suite'. Overall I was under impressed with the hotel. The location is great - walk to anywhere and our room had a great view of Boston Commons. The room itself was some what dismal - sort of a muted green that was pretty bland with nothing to liven it up. The furniture was early '50s looking with no ottoman for the chair (I need to keep my legs propped up). We were never able to order a movie from pay-for-view despite numerous attempts from engineering to fix the problem. Room service was prompt and not too bad but limited menu. The only redeeming feature of this hotel was the bed. It is by far the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Enough to over come the shortcoming that I would stay again? Probably not. There a lot of great hotels in Boston, many with equally comfortable beds I'm sure.

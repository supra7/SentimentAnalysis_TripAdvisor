This hotel is only for one reason, the RAI exhibition centre. Don't go here if you want to visit Amsterdam as any taxi, if you find any, will cost you 30 Euros to go to the centre. The rooms are impersonal, the air is sooo dry in the room, I thought it transform you into fish tank food... The restaurant is bad, enormous and the dishes are limited. They prepare the food not far from the tables and you end up stinking oily food coming out of the restaurant. Not a good address, despite the nice personnel at the check in counter.

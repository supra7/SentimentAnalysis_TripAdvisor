My company and i have been at the south loop hotel for a few weeks now and during my experience here I have been locked out of my room on a daily occurance which I dealt with at first then it had gotten out of hand when hours have gone by without us getting into our room. The hotel staff tried bribing us with free pizza for the inconvienance and a great review of there staff and security but the facts show that this hotel is one to stay away from there service and hospitality are the of the most ignorance that I have ever seen traveling with the government of the united states of America. During my stay here I've been bribed by the hotel staff and security, I've been locked out of my room on a daily occurance for hours, the hotel is infested with spiders and cockroaces which I had founded out during the last several days here. The motels staff was switching our rooms but no matter what room you stay in there is a problem with each such as the locks dont work or the air conditioning doesn't work or the room is infestested with spiders, the hotel is also infested with hookers. I had never been more humiliated during my stay here with the hotel staff trying to set me up with prostitutes. I was impelled by the motion of this staff at the south loop hotel in chicago,Il.

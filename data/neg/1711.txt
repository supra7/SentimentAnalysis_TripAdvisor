We have been to Hawaii over 10 times, we have been to the tiki bar outside by the pool /=-098several times. The service is terrible!!!! In fact last time when we went we asked if they served food they said the kitchen closed at 9pm, it was 8:45 and they closed the kitchen. Then we asked if we could see a drink menu, she handed us the menu then walked over to the other employees and talked to the other employees for about 10 minutes. I then walked over to her to see if we could order something and she said she would be right over to our table, again another 5 minutes went by, we decided to leave by then. Everytime we go there the service is TERRIBLE!!!! The only reason why we keep going back is the entertainment is really great. We did talk with the food manager and he offered his apologies and gave us his card for a free drink.

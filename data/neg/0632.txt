I chose this hotel for a trip with a girlfriend because it is listed on the Small Luxury Hotels of the World registry. I was disappointed, as the other hotels listed with SLHW have been perfect in every way, and Hotel Andra was truly average. Fine, but average. We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms were fine, but not luxurious. The bathroom was tiny. One of the problems is that no one who works there is over the age of 25. They really need a seasoned, professional concierge who knows what he or she is doing. Here's just one example: I check out early on the morning of our departure, pay a reasonable but hefty bill (after 5 nights) and before turning away, ask the desk clerk for a map to the airport. She proceeds to argue with me about whether I need a map, and how easy it is to get to the airport from downtown Seattle. She finally says, "well, I guess I could print you something off of Mapquest." This should have been a no-brainer.

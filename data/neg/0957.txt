I booked the hotel a week in advance on priceline, received a confirmation, printed out the confirmation and showed up at the hotel. I was promptly told that 'we don't honor that' and that 'if we have no rooms available, we don't care' as I was asking if they could help or look to see what they could do for us. The location was right on top of the expressway, the only way to access the place was if you were on the correct side of the street (as there's no real exit for miles), and once there, they were really quite rude. After standing in their lobby making plans at our backup hotel, they informed us that maybe they could do something, but not the same type of room, and for much higher prices. We ran and I suggest you do the same.

Nothing impressive about this hotel. It's OK if you're on a budget, not looking for anything more than the basics and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room. The down comforters are a nice touch, but that's about it. The rooms are tiny tiny and the walls are very thin. And the bathrooms ... We first checked into a room where the toilet didn't flush correctly. We asked to move to another room, and in this one, the industrial-style toilet handle stuck out underneath the toilet lid, so you couldn't put the lid down. (See photo.) Bad design. The best thing the hotel's got going for itself is its central location -- a quick downhill stroll to the shops and restaurants on 1st Avenue and ferries (for a ride over to Bainbridge Island). Pike Place Market is within easy walking distance, too. Friendly tip: There are some rooms located directly across from the elevator, make sure your room isn't one of them.

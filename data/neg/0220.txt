This hotel was not worth the $150/day it cost to stay there (this price included the parking fees and taxes). The room was a third-floor walk up with old and stained carpeting, a musky odor that never left even with the windows opened, a small and cramped bathroom, old and creaky furniture, and a light near the bed that only worked when I leaned against the wall a certain way. Stay somewhere else. Yes, it's near the Needle and small, ethnic restaurants, but its location does not compensate for its overwhelming defects.

I'm used to staying in OC hotels and never expect anything more than an outdated room and smelly lobby. However, the Royalton had to be the worst. I wasn't expecting luxury, but, there wasn't even an ice machine! You had to walk across the street and buy bagged ice (10% off with room key), but they don't open until 10 or so. Forget hitting the beach early with a cooler. The "AC" is just a portable unit that stayed a sweltering 86 degrees and the fridge was even warmer than that. All three neccesities: ice, fridge, AC, were a no go. We requested room service, never saw them once. Had to get clean towels every day, then wait more than 2 hours until they "came out of the dryer." Pool is across the street, micro sized, under a roof with no sun. Positive points: locations, balcony, and remodled bathrooms.

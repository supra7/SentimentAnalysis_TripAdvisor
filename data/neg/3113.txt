The hotel looked clean, lady at the desk was nice, but when we got to our rooms, the odor was nauseating. Both rooms had a strong odor like body odor. Another person staying there said their room smelled also, but they were going to try to stay. We opened the doors for a bit, hoping the fresh air would take away the smell, but it didn't improve. My mother, 2 sisters, grandson and 2 nephews and I agreed that even though we would lose the money we paid for two rooms, we couldn't bear to stay there. We checked out after 1/2 hour and went to another hotel.

Terrible!!! Dirty. Not maintained. Old, not updated. Looks like sprawling old apartment complex. drawers in bathroom falling apartment. old kitchen appliances. grass needs cutting. hedges need trimming. food is bad. NO WIRELESS Internet connection!!!!!!!!!!! Filthy laundry room. Sign to entrance is burned out and end up driving past it at night. More like an old Howard Johnson's or Day's Inn. Been here five days and moving ASAP.

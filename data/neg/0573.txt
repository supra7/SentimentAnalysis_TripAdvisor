We were delighted with this hotel when we visited it in 2010. However, maybe due to the high occupancy or who knows why, the service this year was much worse. We came back to our room everyday to find some unpleasant surprise, like something had not been done by the maids. We let it go when it wasn't really disrruptive. However, the last day, we found that the beds had been only half-made. We went to the front desk to complain, and had to show the pictures we had taken from the room so as to prove our point. The person in the frontdesk wasn't impressed either, but there was nothing they could/would do about it. He tried to convince us that we might have left the "do not disturb" sign at the door, which wasn't the case. Something had been done around the room like rearranging the towels, and so on, but the beds weren't completely made and the pillows were lying on the floor to our disgust. We were told that the manager would contact us back, but I'm still waiting (since the beginning of July, so I do not think this will even happen). I said last year that we couldn't wait to book with them for the years to come, but unfortunately, I think this was the last time we will have ever stayed at this hotel, as we found that the quality level has dropped dramatically and there are better options around for about the same price. It's a real shame.

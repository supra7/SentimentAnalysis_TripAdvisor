DO NOT STAY HERE! We had a MOUSE in our room! We stayed here St Patricks Day weekend and we discovered a mouse moving up and down from our air conditioning unit. Frantically I called the front desk and they moved us to another room. (alot smaller than our original room). We went downstairs to speak with a manager about this issue and the receptionist gave us 2 free breakfast passes and a manager did not even come out to speak with us. Very poor customer service and they weren't the least bit concerned about the mouse, which shows that there is a problem with them. Im sure they cleaned the room and put another guest in there shortly after. We did not use the breakfast passes because we were completely disgusted and were not going to eat at a place where we know there are mice. This is my first review and I want everyone to know how disgusting this place is. Please do not stay here!

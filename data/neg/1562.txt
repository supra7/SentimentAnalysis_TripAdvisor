Just got back from a 3,000 person conference at Hilton Bayfront and I was very disappointed with the hotel. The staff had no idea what was going on all weekend. Had a coworker locked out of her room because of a mistake the hotel made. Very overpriced. I would not recommend this hotel for personal or business travel. Rooms were clean.

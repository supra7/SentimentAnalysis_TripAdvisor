I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. i wish I had stayed somewhere else but I assumed that the brand would be similar to other Copthorne hotels, it wasn't. I booked a Non-Smoking room but was given a Smoking room and when I complained I was told they couldnt move me as there were no Non-Smoking rooms available. The room was not particularly clean and although it had all the boxes ticked regarding in-room facilities quite a few didn't actually work. If you are planning a sunshine break - also be warned the hotel has no sunbathing area other than around the outdoor pool but the pool is for females only in the morning and males only in the afternoon so you will need to take a taxi to the public beach if you choose to go with your spouse or friends of the opposite gender.

we made reservations for friday through sunday aug.26-28,on thursday the day before we were set to leave i contacted the royalton to say we would not be staying due to the fact that they were evacuating ocean city due to hurricane irene.i was told i would not be recieveing a fefund for the 2 rooms i rented even though the hotel was closeing for the weekend.i couldnt believe it! i cant stay at there hotel but i can pay for it! the lady on the phone was rude when i called back she wouldnt even talk to me she yelled in the back ground i already f/n talked to her!I was dissapointed i wasnt going to the beach. NOW I CANT GET MY MONEY BACK AND I HAVE TO DISPUTE THE CHARGE AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT NONSENSE BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU TO COME ON DOWN TO THERE HOTEL ON THE BEACH DURING THE BIGGEST HURRICAN TO HIT THE COAST IN OVER 100 YRS.O AND BRING A TENT BECAUSE THEY WONT B OPEN!

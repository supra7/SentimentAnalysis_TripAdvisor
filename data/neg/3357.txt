Upon checking in I was not greeted at all as I stood at the desk waiting while they talk about there kids. This was the highlight of the trip it only got worse. I then had to fight to get the elevator to close they told me the door gets stuck but it happened to me twice on 2 different elevators. The first room I got to was closed for maintance the toilet had over flowed it was 8:00pm check it was at 3. I went back to desk where they looked at me crazy and told me they were not sure they had another room. The 2nd room I walked in on 2 ppl getting dressed it was already rented out before they gave me my keys. After going back to the desk I was giving a 3rd room which seemed fine til I tried to take a shower and the tub would not drain and black gunk started backing out of the drain. The 4th and final room had no towel and the floor was dirty. Then we tried to eat breakfast which was served cold and we only received half the items listed on the menu that we order when we told them they laugthed and asked if we wanted them. Oh and I forgot to add the entire 10th floor which all 4 of my rooms was located on smelled of sewage. I will never stay at this hotel again worst service and accomadations I've ever had.

We were at the Sterling Hotel in Dallas for a Todays Girl Youth Organization National Competition and it was not a great experience!!! To start we arrived at 7:00, the first room we were given was a wreck. We walked in and the bed linens were on the floor, there was a rack for an industrial dish washer on the bed. It looked like someone had been sleeping in both beds. We asked to move rooms. We were taken to another room. This room was also a wreck. The beds were not made; dirty towels were stacked on the toilet. There were aspirin pills lying on the table. Food wrappers were in the floor and bugs were crawling in the sink. Across the hall we could hear a dog barking. So again we asked to be moved. This time we were move to a room that had not been renovated. It was so dirty. It smelled like urine. Your eyes burned and your nose itched. The head boards were ripped off the wall and there were holes in the walls. Once again we asked to move!!!!! We then took all of our belongings to the lobby and waited. They informed us that most of their rooms were CRAP!!! That is what the man told us. We asked for the rooms that were pictured on the internet and he said they did not have any of those available. By this time it was getting late and the children were lying in the chairs trying to sleep in the lobby. I spoke with the night manager and asked if he would feel comfortable sleeping in one of the three rooms we had already been taken to and he told us that he would not sleep in any of the rooms at this hotel. That should have been a sign!!! Finally at 10:30 we were taken to a room. This room was better. It did have linens on the bed, it did not have a barking dog across the hall, and it did not smell. We had to ask for towels and toilet paper everyday!!! We would not have stayed at this hotel if it were not for the competition! If you can stay somewhere else, do!!! Pay the extra it will be worth it.

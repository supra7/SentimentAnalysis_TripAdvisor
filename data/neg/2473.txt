I arrived tired and went to my room...only to discover brown stains on the sheets. When I pulled open the covers, low and behold there was a party of bed bugs. I had a sampling kit with me and have taken them back to have analysed for identification. Then I was moved to another room, this time the heating was broken with freezing temperatures outside. No where else in London could I get a room. I stayed under the covers ( they did offer an extra duvet) then I got up to wander Euston and drink warm coffee and snacks..

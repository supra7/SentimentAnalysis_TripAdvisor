While the location was good, pretty much right in Chinatown, that is the only good thing I can say. On checking in we were confronted by a notice saying that there was a 2% surcharge on credit cards. In all our years of business travel, we have hardly ever been charged a surcharge and certainly not 2%. The room was not inspiring - no artwork or anything to break the monotony. The toiletries consisted of one minuscule soap, a combo shampoo/conditioner (1 measly bottle) which left our hair feeling like straw, a shower cap and tissues. There was no mini bar - you had to venture down to reception to purchase anything. The room had no compendium or any hotel information at all. Pillows were uncomfortable. We paid for breakfast vouchers, and what a disappointment - slimy eggs with uncooked white slopping around, anaemic baked beans, the most horrible sausages we have ever tasted, and something that looked like bacon but may not have been. I was woken up the day BEFORE checkout by a call from reception telling me that we had an outstanding balance. We were quite aware of this (internet use, breakfast vouchers) and would have settled as usual on checkout. Why we had to be disturbed and told this is a mystery. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

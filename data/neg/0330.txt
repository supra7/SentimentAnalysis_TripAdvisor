The price was affordable, which attracted us to the hotel. Everything else was downhill. We checked into a room on the 2nd Floor. The hotel promises wi-fi, but there was no signal in our room. We moved to a room on the 6th floor. After unpacking we realized there were no privacy curtains and that our bathtub was clogged. We promptly put in a request to fix both. More than 24 hours later, still no resolution. We promptly checked out, and for a mere $15 more per night, checked into a 4-star hotel across the street (who gave us free wi-fi, complimentary breakfast, room service, and had a gym/pool).

It was convenient for an early morning flight but I'd rather stay at any of the other airport hotels next time I go. The tv didn't work and they didn't have anyone around to fix it. Then in the morning, I was showering and a huge centipede ran down the shower curtain! They told us a manager would follow up with us and one never did.

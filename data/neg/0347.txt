I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a clean experience in the bathroom or who wants to sleep at night without noise. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor and had one sleepless night due to traffic noise and woke up to discover exactly how dirty the bathroom was in the morning. There were hairs on the wall and the floors were brown. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

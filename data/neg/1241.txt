The worst resort in PUNTA CANA!!!!!!! We have been to Punta Cana 3 times before and would always return because each new resort we stayed at was always very enjoyable - both at Bavaro Beach and Uvero Alto - this trip was a total disaster as Sunquest rated this resort a 5 star and with previous experience we would only rate this resort a 2 star - the food was totally non eventful as there was absolutely no variety from day to day ( my husband was very ill as well as Italian soccer vacationers) - I have never been at a resort where the locals vacationed with us - no offense to the people as we really do like the Dominican hospitality but not to vacation with them. Also we had to upgrade to a suite to make our vacation more enjoyable - if this did not happen we were leaving immediately - If it were not for the friends we met there and the animation staff - especially David and Theodore who made our day - also we were very disappointed to learn that our most favourite bartender Daniel was terminated - unfortunately the management does not realize that these people do make a vacation happen.Because of this trip I will not return to the Dominican as my husband was very ill and this would never have happened at a 5 star resort.

Stayed here earlier this week and from the beginning met with annoying customer service staff - Felix especially a drama queen - and less than stellar accomodations. Soap/shampoo (Gilchrist and Solmes) same as used in Navy lodging. Our room came with a 'courtyard' view which is actually facing a brick wall. NO exercise facility, small business 'center' and some construction to boot. Most importantly, the room we held did NOT have a desk so how in the world can one begin to think about working. Would not stay there again...

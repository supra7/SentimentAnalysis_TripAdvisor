I booked this hotel for 1 night (Saturday) - a single room was only 30, which is very cheap for such a central location and many hotels in this area won't accept a one night booking at weekends. On the positive side, despite its central location, it was actually quiet at night. I knew that the room wasn't ensuite and for 30 I didn't expect it. But there weren't enough bathrooms or toilets and the water flow was very poor so that it took ages for a toilet cistern to re-fill once it had been flushed. Also, it's a small hotel without a lift and I had to go down 2 flights of stairs to the nearest toilet, so it's not suitable for a disabled person. The lock on the bedroom door was very flimsy and could easily have been forced with a hard push. The wardrobe had no hangers whatsoever. The hotel website advertises that the full English breakfast is served until 10 am on Sunday mornings but when I arrived at 9.30 I was told that they stopped serving at 9am. I was offered tea and toast but no discount. I'd probably try somewhere else next time. There are a lot of cheap hotels in this street and the adjoining ones, so it's worth looking nearby.

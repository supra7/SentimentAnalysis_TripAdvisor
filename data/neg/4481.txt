If this were advertised as a three star hotel, or even three 1/2 I would have no complaints, but a four star hotel this is not. I was in town for four days on a business/leisure trip. It was my partners first time in Chicago nd we brought our dog. We loved the fact that the hotel is pet friendly and even provided a special dog gift at check-in. We loved the much discussed window seats, they are spacious and comfortable and a great reading spot. The staff was competent but not very helpful. I called from the airport and asked for help getting a car service to the hotel - they woman at the desk told me that she needed an hour lead time and that I'd have to wait for a while; when I protested, she was less friendly and told me that I should have booked earlier. I hung up and called the concierge at the Chicago Intercontinental (I've never stayed at the one in Chicago, but have stayed at the one in LA), the concierge immediately booked a car delivering me from O'Hare to the Monaco without a question, and very courteously. The room was small but pleasant enough; the bathroom was small and the wallpaper and paint were peeling, also no hooks for towels or robes. One afternoon when we were stepping out, I asked the front desk to have our room cleabed (it was 5pm) he said "On a Sunday night? They all went home, there's no one to do that," so I asked for fresh towels and could the old towels be removed, he said "I'll see what I can do". When we returned at around 11pm, a stack of towels was sitting in the hallway on the floor by the door. Not really four star behavior. The food at the restaurant is atrocious, especially the breakfast. Bad coffee, fake syrup, spongy waffles and burnt bacon. Awful! The waitstaff is lovely however and very professional. While I wouldn't stay at the Monaco again, I might try another in the Kimpton chain, though likely not in Chicago.

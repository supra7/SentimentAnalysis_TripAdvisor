Pera Tulip is well located in the Taksim area. The staff are very polite and friendly. However the lights were not working in my room the first night, they resolved it after asking they send a technician, which they were not inclined to do so. The next day same issue, as I left for dinner I asked that it be looked at again. I came back 2 hours later and nothing. I had to wait half an hour for them to fix this, again. In addition the internet went down the first day, and was not working most of the second day.

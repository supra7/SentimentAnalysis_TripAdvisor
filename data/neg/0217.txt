great location,walk to city center, 1 mile walk or bus ride to downtown. building is old and musty smelling, but fairly clean. shower water comes out rusty at first. I stayed 6 days, no pests spotted, but I was afraid to leave food out.neighborhood is noisy at night, I think the mail trucks are loading at 3 or 4 am across the street. lots of cool cafes and bars and a 24 hr grocery in the neighborhood. I paid $82 including fees. I think it is a good place for 1 or 2 days, but after that the musty odor gets depressing and you realize the place needs a major overhaul not just new paint and carpet.staff review is mixed, first desk clerk was very helpful, checked atm locations on internet for me. last clerk was very unhelpful, recommended $45 cab or shuttle to airport, told me bus service was discontinued, but left out that the light rail will take you to airport for $2.50.

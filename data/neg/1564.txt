We booked our room through Priceline and called at 1:00 p.m. on the day of our arrival to confirm our reservation. After driving for 3 hours we arrived at the hotel to be told they would not honor our reservation since they had overbooked the hotel. They wanted us to travel 40 miles to the north to stay in Oceanside on their dime (which certainly has nowhere near the amenities of San Diego) and then return at 10:00 a.m. the next morning to check into the Hilton. That was just unacceptable to ruin our weekend shuttling back and forth in the crowded San Diego County traffic. Justin at the front counter then lied and told us that we could stay at the Oceanside hotel for our second night at the same cost as our Hilton reservation. Needless to say, upon our arrival in Oceanside, the lie told by Justin was revealed. When we left, the bellboy did applogize and said that overbooking happens pretty frenquently at the Hilton. So, beware of Hilton's overbooking polices and for what it is worth, the Hilton San Diego Bayside decor (or lack thereof) redefines austere - it has all the warmth and amience of an abortion clinic. Thumb down for this property and its untruthful staff.

Stayed here for one night. Upon reaching the place, was quite impressed with the decor of the lobby. Staff at the reception was not helpful, seemed edgy and was EXTREMELY rude. She picked up a call on the phone and talked while doing our reservation. When I wanted to clarify some things, her tone was simply uncalled for. I do not remember her name, I wished I did though so I could mention it here. Staffs generally DON'T smile and don't acknowledge you. Rooms look like some budget/transit hotels. For an executive suite, it looked just like their superior room, only exception was that it had a bathtub. Disgusting view of rusty air conditioning vents out our window. Food spread during breakfast buffet was ok. Only 2 staffs in the area, only 1 managed a smile at us. Took a long time to refill the food and clear the plates. We booked the package RE Treat which comes with a massage session. Only 1 could converse in English (like seriously) and others kept conversing in Mandarin to us. Massage was horrible, I don't feel relaxed, and at one point, I know they switched the masseuse for me, hands felt different. The other one, the lady, went to do some manicure on another guest. Huge disappointment though so much hype has been on this hotel in the media and all. Don't go, or you will RE-GRET!

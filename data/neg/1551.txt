the hilton presents itself as a top hotel, but once you take the bait, it reveals itself to be another one of these petty chain businesses that tries to wring a few more dollars from you at every opportunity. did you choose the hotel because the fitness center sounded good? well, you will have to pay to get inside it, even though you are a guest of the hotel. want to connect to the internet? get your wallet out. it took me a while to learn to avoid these places but i will definitely do my homework going forward!

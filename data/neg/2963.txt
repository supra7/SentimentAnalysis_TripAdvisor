First impressions were not bad. The lobby had a pleasing appearance, check in was completed politely and quickly and the luggage handling service was also good. However, the negatives aspects of the hotel began to emerge as soon as we got to the room. This was far smaller than expected, with two single beds, a tiny desk and only one armchair shoehorned into a corridor-like space. The wardrobe and storage areas were not particularly generous either  adequate for a single person staying a few nights but not a couple staying a week. Then there was the awful view from the window  this was onto the roof top of the adjacent hotel just a few feet away, complete with satellite dishes and huge extractor fans. This really was quite appalling for a supposedly deluxe room. On the positive side, the furniture and fixtures were new and in good nick. There were many other disappointments, but Ill mention just three: The entire hotel is serviced by only three lifts, which meant that at busy times the journey from the room to the lobby took all of ten minutes! Breakfast was a grim experience. There were far too many tables packed into a small space, which made moving from the table to the buffet bar something of an obstacle course going on dodgem rink. The food was really nothing special and frankly far below a quality youd expect at a five-star hotel. On one morning we found the milk had curdled and set solid in the jug! So while there are some good things to say about this hotel there is also much here that leaves a lot to be desired. It is certainly not the worst hotel Ive ever stayed in, but at over 200 Euros a night I would have to say it is very poor value for money  hence the two stars.

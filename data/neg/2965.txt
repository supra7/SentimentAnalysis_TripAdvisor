They say it's a 5 star hotel..but with me traveling all around the world and stay at 5 star hotels always.i can say with full honesty i WONT even give this hotel a 3 star..1st ;from the very 1st moment they have no bell man to get the luggages,then from that point,everything is down hill...the front dest service was an awfull experience;they are so very rude,the girl who's been handling my reservation cant even give a smile.anyway..i got the room and it's the smallest i have ever seen..i cant even hang my clothes because it's too tiny.i ask for extra towel they hang up in my face,finaly before the last day i ask to talk to the manager ,i got that chance after a long wait;he was nice and was writing everything i said but at the end his staff did not respond well..when i left the hotel now the bell man ran and put all the luggages in his so called friend's taxi that belong to the hotel;the driver took me from a very long way to the airport that i never been to before ,i been traveling to Istanbul for such i long time for many years..so i know my way very well and usualy it cost me from airport to taxim not more than 50 turkish lira and this time it was a 110 lira when i handle the driver the two 50 lira bills in a second he changed them into a two 5 lira bills and insist that i did not give him two 50's..then i realize that hotel bell man and the girl at the front desk who was so very mean with me had a plan with the driver against me..so plz if you want to travel to Istanbul,DONT ever choose this terrible hotel..

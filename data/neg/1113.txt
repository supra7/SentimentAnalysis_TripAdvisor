My husband and I stayed here because it is across the street from SEATAC, in Seattle. It is a beautiful property upon pulling up. My husband checked in and came back with a map of where our room was. It was in the furthest building away from the main lobby. Once we got to the building there was no lift, ramp, luggage carrier or bellhop to assist with carrying luggage up the stairs. My husband had to go back and forth to get the luggage and carry it down the hall to the last room on the hallway. There was a lobby on each floor and a exercise room on our floor. The lobbies had no facilities nor televisions. There were dingy discarded chairs. There was no one from the hotel anywhere in that building. We felt abandoned by the hotel. It was unkept, spider webs and all on the windows and on the balcony over the water. In the morning when we checked out we had to do the same thing with the luggage with no help whatsoever and inadequate lighting outside. Just not a very personable or client friendly place. Furthermore, there was no free internet access in the rooms. I called down and it was $15 per day. I was told I could come to the lobby in the main building and it was free there. Really??? The room's heating system was confused at best. It would go from air to heat without warning. We froze most of the night and had hot flashes the rest. Slept on the plane home, which I never do.

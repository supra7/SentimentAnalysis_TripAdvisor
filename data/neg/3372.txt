The t.v. in the roomhad doors that would not stay open so coul not view. The bath roon had apiece of carpet cut and jagged from bedroom carpet. The telepnone on the desk could not be connected, no cords. Had to go downstairs to try their business office computer and was told, someone had stolen the internet connection. I complained and they were not interested, said it had recentlybeen renovated. Will not return.

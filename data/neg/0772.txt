I stayed at the Westin this past Saturday night with some girlfriends. I have stayed at this particular location probably about 5 times in the last 2 years. I used to love the place, comfy beds, clean, nice staff. This last visit however has soured me on it forever. first problem: When one of my friends called down to request more coffee for the room, the woman was quite rude, and refused to send more than 2 packets, she asked for 4. When the person brought the coffee to the room it was shoved at her and he stalked off down the hall. Problem 2: During all my previous stays at this hotel I have made local calls from the room phone at no charge. This time I made 2 calls that were each about 15 minutes in duration and was charged 30 dollars. FOR A LOCAL CALL!! It was not posted ANYWHERE in the room about phone charges. I did complain and they did reverse it, first offering 50% off and then when I told them that was unacceptable they took it all off. So yes they did fix the problem. But that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. Problem number 3 and this is the huge one. I have a lovely cluster of insect bites on my leg that look suspiciously like bed bug bites. I am absolutely furious at the moment, because I did not notice the bites until I got home, and now my luggage and stuff has been sitting in my apartment for over 12 hours, potentially allowing the vermin that were in the hotel room to enter my home. It makes me sick.

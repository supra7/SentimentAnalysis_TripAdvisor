don't be fooled by the website We booked our stay at the hotel by phone (as their otherwise lovely website had no way to book online) and were relieved to find a hotel in the city at a reasonable rate and near the central train station. Their website, and the beautiful lobby, suggested that we'd found a great place. Our room, however, suggested otherwise. I know how tiny Tokyo hotel rooms are, but it is reasonable to expect that they are clean and well maintained. Our initial room was dingy, with some peeling wallpaper and the smell of old smoke. We took it, but were fairly horrified to later find a stain on one of the sheets that was either smudged chocolate, dried blood, or something worse. Even more bothersome was that none of these were ours. Further inspection revealed someone else's hair as well. The desk staff allowed us to move our own belongings and selves (including our sleeping daughter) to a nearby room, and this one was in slightly better condition. It was not good enough, however, to warrant another stay next time we're in town. For this price range and room size, I'd recommend a Toyoko Inn. They're in all major Japanese Cities, are often near train stations if this is needed, and are a better value. Sad, because I generally prefer independent businesses.

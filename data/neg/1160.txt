I parked my car here during an overseas trip. When the hotel employee went to retrieve my car a loud noise was heard and when they showed up the bumper was damaged. They refused to admit they damaged it and were extremely rude and defensive. This obviously happens a lot. I make a report to the police but nothing could be done. The police seem to know them well. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE!! These people are possibly criminal and definitely bed news.

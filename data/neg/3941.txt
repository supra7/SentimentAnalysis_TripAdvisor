It started with no heat in the room - literally - there was cold air coming from the radiators. The thermostat behind the TV didn't work. In the morning I make for the shower - shivering: no hot water. I ask them to come fix the heat and the water. I've got to go to work..... I come back, the heat is on but I notice that someone has moved the tissue box. Two sticky stains on the shelf. I'd also asked for a surge protector - only one unoccupied plug for electronics etc - not there. I call the manager. I go to the bathroom to make sure the water is now hot. It is. I notice 2 hairs in the tub - and since I had not yet had a chance to shower they were not mine - they all seemed quite relaxed about all this. I asked to have the bathroom cleaned. It was - eventually. Then there was the cold soup in the restaurant - we had to go because there was only one hour between meetings. The service was sullen. Cindy the manager offered a glass of wine. Apparently she did not hear we were still working.....we paid and left. Her best offer was to come back for a free glass of wine! The management seems neither surprised nor concerned about all this.....

The hotel has been recently renovated but the tear and wear is already taking its tool, and it has more an hostel feel than an 3* hotel. We were given a room in the annexe and were told it was the quietest available: a small room with almost no space for the luggage, and a cubicle size toilet where if you`re overweight you'll find hard to fit in. The room was very hot, we kept the window open for a long time but the traffic noise forced us to close it, and it's so small that it heated up again very quickly. The bed has stains, the sheets were clean but with several holes that should no longer be used (it's simply not right for the price they charge); the same was for the towels so old, hard and with holes that should have earned their retirement already. Every noise in the annexe is amplified in the small stairs so i have been woken up several times during the night and after 7 i could no longer sleep so often the main door was slammed shut. The breakfast was very depressing, no fruit or pastries at all, only cheap juice and cheap ham and cheese. My wife is celiac and she can`t eat bread, so we decided to skip the breakfast and left the room. Reading other comments it looks like we are not the alone in finding the breakfast inadequate. I won`t definitely go back and I wouldn`t recommend this hotel.

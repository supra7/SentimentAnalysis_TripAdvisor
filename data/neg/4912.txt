Probably one of the worst places ever. Our room was ok in size, but was VERY outdated. The bathroom was small, the door wouldnt close properly, the sink faucet couldnt be turned on without getting water all over the place. The bathroom was so dark that you have to shower with the curtain open in order to see. There was dust falling out of the bathroom vent, which indicated how often it is cleaned. I couldnt even use the balcony because it was shared with the pigeons and their mess. I was on a nonsmoking floor, but everything definitely reeked of smoke. The customer service was less than optimal, I would not recommend this place to anyone unless this hotel does some major changes.

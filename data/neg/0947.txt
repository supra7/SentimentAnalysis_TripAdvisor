Stayed in late October, this hotel completely ruined our weekend, holiday, and entire Seattle experience. To begin, the location made us feel like we should have been working on the adjacent street corner. Dodgy characters, frightening passers-by, and so many prostitutes it may have well just been a brothel. Given the price paid, the quality/cleanliness of the room wasnt a complete shock. What really made this awful was the rude, unhelpful and downright cruel attitude of the staff. Immediately upon checking in, we realized we would rather be staying in a tent (as was suggested by another dissatisfied guest in an October 30 review). We called down to inform them of the numerous problems (burnt out lights, drafty windows, filthy bathroom, noise from the freeway, just to name a few) and phoned to complain. Rather than offering any sort of solution, apologizing, or even acknowledging our awful experience, we were met with indignation and rudeness. Nothing was done to remedy our complaints. No other accommodations were available for us in the city, so alas, we were stranded in a weekend of squalor. The Manager was conveniently unavailable throughout the entire stay, and the rest of the interactions with the staff on hand were appalling. More problems with the room presented themselves, including a condom in our nightstand and a crazed out shower head.

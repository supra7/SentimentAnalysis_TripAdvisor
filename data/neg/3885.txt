We checked in after a long drive from Maine. The reservations attendant was rude and short with me. I was quoted a rate a few minutes before arriving to the hotel by Marriott.com. The front desk gentleman argued with me. I had to call central back on my cell phone to prove to him the rate was available. He didn't even apologize. We ended up taking our own bags to our room....not sure where the bellman was. The hotel is undergoing major construction, and it's a HUGE mess. I can't believe they are asking for $359/night for what looks like a low end Holiday Inn. Perhaps when the rennovations are complete the hotel will be better, but right now, STAY AWAY! The concierge floor was horrible. We went for breakfast after a little late, as they were cleaning up, they were unwilling to let my boys have even a box of cereal. The whole thing was not a great experience. The only good part of the hotel is the location.

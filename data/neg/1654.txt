The hotel is very old and outdated. Our "partial ocean view" did include a sliver of ocean, if you went out on the balcony and twisted your neck. Most of the view was parking. The package deal includes a "wonderful buffet breakfast," and with 800+ rooms, and 2 hostes' seating tables at the swan court (small restaurant area) make sure you are not hungry in the morning. You will wait a LONG time! There is a second restaurant if you want a pre-packaged meal wrapped in plastic that you pick up yourself cafeteria style. We were there a week and the beach was closed 4 days with sharks in the water. There isn't much of a beach anyway, only a few feet of sand and they charge $25/chair if you want to sit on it.

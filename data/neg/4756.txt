After reading some of the other reviews I have to wonder if we were staying at the same hotel. I have heard very positive things about this hotel both from associates and this website and am quite confused as my experience was nothing special. The hotel has a very small lobby that is dark in tone and not altogether welcoming. I didn't encounter any service issues, just felt as though the property itself did not compare to other 4 star hotels in the area. The bedroom was a decent size and looked to be recently re-decorated, but the bathroom was just awful. Despite reading on their website, and even in a brochure sitting in my room, that all bathrooms had a soaking tub and separate enclosed shower mine did not. It had a small tub with a shower head on the wall. The tub looked to be old and had been covered with some sort of vinyl covering that crinkled when you stepped on it. The black and white tile on the floors and walls reminded me more of a dorm bathroom than a 4 star hotel. Having stayed in many of the 4 star hotels downtown, I would say this is one of the worst. The "fitness center" is just an old hotel room that they have placed 4 or 5 cardio machines into with no other changes to decor. It was one of the worst I have seen. The location itself is good and there are a lot of opportunities for food close by, but the same would be true at the Sofitel or The Drake. Overall I would not go back.

I had to call housekeeping 3 times the 1st day of arrival. There was a bunch of trash under the sink, no flatware and no bedding for the pullout sofa. The female shuttle driver gave us incorrect information about the time the last shuttle leaves from Ceasars (they will tell you midnight which is incorrect) and as a result I was stuck there with a person with autism until we could finally find an available cab. I called the hotel and spoke to a very rude operator who pretty much told me too bad about my situation. I asked to speak to a manager and was hung up on. Of course the hotel has a vehicle but cutomer service obviously is not their priority. I will never stay at another Trump property.

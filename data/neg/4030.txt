This property is terrible. I stay in hotels 4 nights a week (most of it business related) and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The Valet. Be sure to add $60 a night to whatever rate you are quoted to cover parking and internet. Bell People and Front Desk are all extremely friendly and courteous, unless you ask them for any special request. Then you get, Sorry, I can't help you. The rooms are clean but are EXTREMELY tiny. We were supposed to have a Queen or King bed and got two tiny singles. The hotel would not correct the situation. Don't expect to get your Starwood points at this property. It is a Starwood property that doesn't issue points (I never heard of such a thing before.) The HVAC doesn't work and our defective unit woke us up with blasting noices during the night. The 12th floor didn't propect us from the street noise in this old, uninsulated buildong. The defective fire alarm system went off waking us again and frightening usv for no reason. The bathroom is terrible. The tiny toilet is next to a 50s sink. The bathroom has no counter/vanity space at all and is decorated in 50s' tiny blu tiles. I'm sure some of the rooms most have the yellow and green tiles. The shower trickles water. Stay somewhere else in this great city. The entire property is non-smoking which is a pleasure for me.

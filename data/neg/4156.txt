The only good things I can say about this hotel is it has a nice lobby, is close to the city centre and the bar staff are very helpful. The room we got was described as European - what it really should have said was sub-standard European - it was really small, stank of smoke and the bathroom was the size of a wardrobe. You had to be careful not to bang your leg off the toilet as you got out of the very old shower. Probably the worst thing about it was the smell of stale smoke - heighened by the extreme heat in the room.. this was like the smoke had seeped into everything. Very disappointing and would not stay there again unless my room was upgraded.

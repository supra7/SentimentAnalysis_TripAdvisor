The location was great for my wife and I to slip on over and see the space needle and the EMP but folks, thats about it. The staff was fine at check-in/out, etc. but keep in mind this place is an old college dorm building and it certainly shows its age. The shower was pretty rusted out and there were several sizable holes in the ceiling. The windows are paper thin but the real ticket is the sound from the street which can be clearly heard from holes surrounding the in-window AC unit. Parking is a hassle but hey, it's Seattle afterall; you're best bet is just to pay the $15 per night and park in the hotel's alley. There's no curtains covering the kitchenette window which you'll quickly realize as the sun blasts you through the slats in the mini blinds in the morning. The place was clean but extremely small; for $75 plus $15 for parking a night, you might be better off going with a name brand hotel and one that has parking for its guests. Stayed here two nights before booking at the Ramada for the same price on one of the major travel sites and they offered us overnight parking at no cost.

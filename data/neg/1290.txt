This is an old three-floor, Quality Inn, basement level, ground level and upstairs level. We stayed here two nights on our way to Vancouver for an Alaskan cruisetour. Pluses include good location-very close to Airport, adequate breakfast, inexpensive price, OK rooms with nice front desk staff. However, they do not have an elevator and it was a pain dragging our luggage up & down the stairs. Rooms are basic, staff are nice - it's an old facility, which is fine if you only need a place to sleep with basic amenities.

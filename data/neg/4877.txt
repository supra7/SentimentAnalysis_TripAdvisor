We went to two valet stands to just check in and the line of cars was down the street. The valet told me it was always like that. I have a handicapped son so he told me to park in the handicapped parking down the street! Three blocks away! I couldnt even find a place to park my car by the door to check in. When we went to park that evening the parking lot was full and people were circling around waiting for a spot to open up. Nevermind if you have a handicap person with you. No available spots at all. And I had to pay 7.00 for that. 18.00 if you want valet and wait a half an hour for them to bring you your car. When I got to the room it was comfortable. Just remember this hotel is in the middle of all the party zones. Its crowded with teens,tweens and kids. If you like that you will be great after you find a place to park. There are toooo many nicer hotels for the price with a little more quiet and parking.

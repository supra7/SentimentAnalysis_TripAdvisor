Weather delay requiring us to overnight in Dallas. Hotel room had distinct body odor smell. Bed coverings worn and stained and carpet needed replaced from stickiness and black stains. Small black bugs similar in size to fruit flies but without wings crawling above both bed head boards and above sink in bathroom. Only good thing is the manager refundedour room rate and did not argue the fact the Hotel had bugs. We did not spend the night and ended up at the Marriott which was bug free!

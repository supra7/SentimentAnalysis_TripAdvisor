Our one night here was a huge disappointment. There were dead bugs all over the floor, the room was dirty, the carpet was soggy and smelled of cleaner, and the a/c did not work. We complained and they offered us a free breakfast. Wow, what a deal. We declined and they reduced the room rate, but we still paid way too much. This place is a dump and I would never recommend that anyone stay there.

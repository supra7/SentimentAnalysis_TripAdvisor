We checked into this property due to the convience of the convention center and were quite disappointed with our stay. The rooms are absolutely cave-like, paint is peeling off the walls, and bathrooms are antiquated. Rooms are very small, you must take the elevator to get ice, and lighting in rooms is terrible. Smoke smell was so strong that we had to leave after the second day - and we had a non-smoking room. A/C is so loud and squeeky that you can hardly sleep. Elevators are so slow and breakfast is a joke!! The only high point was they offered a car service that delivered us to the door of the convention (and anywhere in a few mile radius of the hotel). By the time you tip the driver, about the price of a cab ride, however. We had him take us right over to th Joule, where you will be as satisified as we were on our third night!

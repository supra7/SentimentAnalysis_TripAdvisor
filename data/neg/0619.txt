We received a good rate of $175 per night for a wedding. The rooms are spacious, compared to NYC. The toiletries are FACE stockholm and the towels are Frette. However, the service could use some extra training. It first started with the reception. She asked if I would like a map of Seattle. And she asked if I would like a key to the mini-bar. And she knew I was a guest of a wedding party. So, why did I end up going to my room without my map, key or the wedding info packet that everyone was supposed to receive? AND without my credit card!! I was preoccupied with getting my sister checked in that I didn't bother to follow up with the receptionist. And then when I asked her for the wedding packet, she picked up a stack of stuff on the front desk, looked underneath and then disappeared into the back room and then came back, picked up the stack again and found the pack. Our next interesting interaction involved the valet. We were coming home from the wedding friday late evening and decided to tidy up the car a bit before we went up to our room. When we all emerged from the car, I asked the valet, who was at his stand, if i should leave the key in the car, he said, "i wouldn't if i were you." without even looking up at me. Well, "where should i put it?' he requested that i bring the key to him. really? are you chained to your stand? unbelievable.

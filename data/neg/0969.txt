It is a bit pricey, for just decent rooms. The bathroom was really tiny. The charged our card twice, and it took a little to get it worked out. The location is nice, just close enough to the tourist traps that you can walk, but far enough away that you are in a nice, somewhat quite area. I felt dealing with the front desk was an uphill battle.

The hotel's location is great for getting things done in Downtown Memphis and getting on and off the expressway, that is the best thing about this hotel. First of all the staff is very unfriendly, they are not helpful or even happy to have customers. If you ask for any "SO CALLED" amenities, you may get them and you may not, most of the time they don't have anything available. If you need to make a phone call make sure you have a reliable cell phone, the phone in the room may work (barely). Only 1 elevator works, the lobby smells of smoke and dirty mop water. The continental breakfast is a joke, some donuts and rolls, cereal with the milk sitting out on the counter and some coffee. They have 1 housekeeper per floor (there are 5 floors), it takes the housekeeper all day to clean all the rooms on the floor. They also charge you for your room before you check out, your credit card is charged when you check in. Not enough towels, the lighting in the room is dim and the television is old. This is not a 5 star hotel, but no matter how cheep it is to stay here the employees should be glad to have your patrionage and they don't. THIS HOTEL IS TERRIBLE, AWFUL, not a good buy for your dollar.

The service, location, breaky and view were terrible. About the only saving grace for this hotel, is that the air-con works! All the staff we encoutered were rude. Breaky is nothing but stale sweet pastries and cakes. The rooms are all up a min of 4 flights of stairs (ours was 6!). The only way to get near the centre of town is to take a bus or tram....and the hotel is not even on the tourist map given out by the hotel, as its too far out!! The one good thing that we did find, was a great little pizza place about 15 mins walk from the hotel.

The one major problem I had with this hotel was the check-in. We booked online at the beach hotel website - hard to go wrong there. We had the printout (with the name of the hotel and the website printed on the sheet!) and we got a really good price - apparently too good according to the manager that told us that we couldn't have possibly booked with them because the price was too low - since coming home i checked the website, there is another deal only 10$ more than we paid online right now - first they told us to go back into town to their sister hotel (the plantation) and check in there, then they made us wait a really long time (probably hoping that we'd go away) and then they begrudingly gave us a room all the while pretending that they were doing us a favour (I sent them a complaint but apparently they are ignoring me). As long as you can avoid the management the hotel is ok for a cheap hotel (we paid 160$ before taxes and parking) The beach is good - for reference the sheraton, kbh and the whaler seem to have the best beaches, as you get down to the end - i believe it's the westin the beach drops off, the surf gets rough and people sunbath on the lawn. Snorkling - snorkle in from of the sheraton by the rocks, you'll see fish and possibly a turtle. I'm guessing kbh rents snorkle stuff (we had our own), if not the sheraton does. The pool is small - we didn't use it - the sheraton pool looks much better and so do a few of the other hotels. The hotel rooms are standard, the rooms facing the garden are noisy as they have shows during the afternoons and evenings. The breakfast food is pretty bad - and really overpriced, but it was included in the room. In a nutshell, if you want a cheap hotel I think that this hotel is acceptable, but if you want a bit more class go next door to the sheraton.

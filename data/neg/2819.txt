If you do stay at this hotel, be sure to walk from home (it's probably cheaper.) Parking is outrageous, and you will not be informed of this charge until after you check out of the hotel. If I had been informed of the extremely high rates to park my car, I would have taken a train or even parked somewhere else cheaper. Also they offer to check your bags for you, don't do it! It is such a cluster, that its easier to just hold onto them and lug them down Michigan Avenue yourself. Staff seems very disorganized and unfriendly. Great location, and that is just about it.

This hotel is the biggest rip off, the hot breakfast ran out on saturday 12th July at 8am. The drinks in the mini bar are very expensive, 8 euro for a gin and tonic be prepared to drink out of plastic cups. You can not get hot water for a cup of tea. The staff are so rude, no discount for cash. The rooms are so small you have to open the windows to let the light and air in, but it is extremely noisy. Beware the smell of sewerage close to the steps going to the breakfast area. I got sucked in by the comments on the site, which i think they have posted themselves. You can do better in Rome, it is the greatest city in the world do not ruin your time by staying here. Try Palazzetto Degli Artisti Suites a new property where they could not be more helpful, big apartmentys for half the price of this hotel and it is a great location with a fantastic place to eat in the same street.

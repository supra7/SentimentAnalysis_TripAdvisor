We were extremely disappointed at the shabby conditions of this property. Small rooms even smaller bathrooms. Moldy smelling plastic shower curtain. Very dusty and generally not very clean. A chunk was missing from our bathtub, rust rings around the sink faucets. The furniture was so badly banged up it looked like it was a Good Will hand me down. We were treated like children at the pool requiring to give pool cards to receive a tissue thin pool towel. If you needed an extra towel we were told one must og up to the front desk to fill out a form for an extra towel! You also had to wear a hand wrist band to identify you as a patron of the hotel. We had the buffet breakfast plan--what a mistake! We felt like we were in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" as were were attacked daily by birds swooping in to attack our food. Very annoying not to mention unsanitary. I tried on several morning to get an omelet however the line was long and required about a 15 to 20 minute wait. Only one poor chef was trying to make hundreds of omelets. The spa was too small and did not have enough seating in the "relaxation" room--standing room only. Great massage but the facility offers nothing special not even a pool or spa menu. Just a massage and out you go. The fitness center was ok however the air conditioning was broken and the days it was fixed all the machines were taken. Internet a daily expensive charge. They charge a resort fee I don't see what you get besides a newspaper for $15 a day on top of the room rate. For the money go elsewhere. Stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani or the Ritz for the same price.

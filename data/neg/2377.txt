The I Hotel & Conference Center just doesn't meet the standards it promises on the net. We arrived at the relatively new hotel on December 26th to be greeted by an impersonal employee of the hotel. It was late and we wanted to head for bed. When I pulled back the duvet cover I soon realized that it hadn't been changed in a while: long hair on it and dried mucous on the edge. Ick. The evening room service showed up and asked me to show him the dirty piece. After pulling both the duvet and duvet cover off of the bed, he replaced it with a duvet cover only. I asked him about returning the duvet, too. He didn't seem to understand that part. He also didn't know how to put a duvet cover on a duvet. I did it for him. He left and we went to bed. In the quiet of the late evening we learned that the ventilation system in the bathroom was tuned to run all night. Being a practical guy, I closed the door. I had hoped to find a cool hotel in Champaign. Too bad that the I Hotel misses the mark.

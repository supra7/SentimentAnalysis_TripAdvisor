Four nights of hell. There was no airconditioning. Well in the lobby and the corridors there was. But the rooms? The room temperature was over 35. Repeated requests were met with "we will fix it". Then they offered us another room. It had an opening window, but no airconditioning. We asked that the blinds be left closed. They weren't. We felt like ants beneath a cruel child's magnifying glass. Other guests complained too. One poor man was almost in tears in the lift. There was NEVER a manager available (except when we checked out - a bit late), although one night we got to meet a manager who admitted that he was really only the gymnasium manager, and didn't know what to do. Twice we were told that the hotel system 'only heats'. Twice we were told that it 'would be fixed in three hours'. For over 300 euros a night! We had prepaid. THAT is why we didn't leave. The concierge didn't know where things were when we sought directions. And the fresh fruit was canned and the freshly squeezed juice at the dreadful breakfast a type of weak cordial. Management KNEW that there was a problem, but still happily took paying guests in, and put them in rooms in which you could not sleep. We have travelled extensively. This is the first time I have ever written a review.

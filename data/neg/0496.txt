Made and cancelled a reservation over the phone. Received no correspondence or verification regarding my reservation or cancellation because the hotel entered an incorrect email address, mailing address and spelled my name wrong in their system. Not surprising because I was put on hold numerous times during my calls regarding my original reservation and cancellation. Obvious confusion resulted in my reservation and cancellation and my reservation was never cancelled. Hotel charged me a $156 no-show charge for a reservation I had cancelled. Hotel management claims their system is failproof. They refuse to refund the no-show charge; however, they offered me a free night's stay to compensate me for my trouble. Why would the hotel offer me a free night's stay rather than refund the no-show charge that they should not have charged me? Obviously they know a mistake on their part was possible if offering some compensation. Hotel has simply responded through my Better Business Bureau complaint that they will not refund the no-show charge, but will provide a free night's stay to me. They will get away with this again, even if a small claims court awards me the reimbursement of the no-show charge. I recommend not staying here, not necessarily because of their mistake (mistakes happen) but because of the unscrupulous business practices of their management and their unwillingness to admit and correct their error. We stayed at a MUCH nicer hotel (I have stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle Center on two occassions before this incident), Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel for just a little bit more money. The hotel was high class, quiet, room and staff were great and the location was within walking distance of Safeco Field, Waterfront, downtown, many restaurants, coffee shops, Fish Market etc.

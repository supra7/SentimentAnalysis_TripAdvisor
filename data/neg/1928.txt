The rooms and suites were nice. In addition, there are tvs in the bathrooms. So why I am giving this hotel one star? Because the hotel staff stole money from my girlfriend's wallet. I reported this to Trump security one month ago, and the Trump security has not gone back to me. I was in Vegas for a wedding, so I did not gamble. Very disappointed in the Trump.

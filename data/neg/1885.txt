The hotel was beautiful the staff friendly and good, but it had so many faults its unbelievable.. They claim its a 5 star.. but the approach to the hotel is on a dirt road. The reception is a desk with a chair. The staff doesnt understand English and that is a must for a 5 star hotel. The rooms are nice but the showers have no hot water and the floors are slippery. If your lucky you would find a scorpion in there like I did.. The lighting in the rooms is not that great. The plunge pool doesnt have any hot water as well and since there is always a breeze you cannot use that either..The color runs from the furniture so if you sit on it with white damp clothes,kiss them good bye. The food that was a disaster the menu is limited and the food that the serve is inedible and expensive for what they serve you.The breakfast is again quite bad.. The entire finishing for the hotel is just as if the owners have picked out the architect from school and put him to do the job or they got conned.. The beach in front of the hotel is not useable as its rocky. The pool is alright but again would give it a ten on ten. If your driving to the hotel good luck in finding it as there is not one sign on the road that leads to the hotel.. There is no TV in the room as well.. Its in the middle of no where so if you want to go to playa del carmen then you need to get a taxi or drive there. The spa is in the open so enjoy a massage in the open with all the wind..

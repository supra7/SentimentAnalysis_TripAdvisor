Booked this stay on Hotwire. Got a decent rate of $107. (not bad compared to regular costs around SeaTac) Hotwire said it was 3.5 stars. Not likely! Probably 2.5 or 3 on a good day. I was given a handicapped room complete with Hospital/Convalescent Home shower. (Hmmm... did the Hotwire booking have anything to do with that?) Whan I called to get my room changed I was told there were no Kings left but that I could have a room with 2 doubles. OK. But when I suggested to the front desk clerk that they inform guests that they were getting a handicapped room, I got attitude. "What are you insinuating sir?" When I explained that some people may not like handicapped rooms with their high toilets, handrails, low tables and hospital showers, she said, "I'm not going to argue with you." Nice touch, extra friendly! Oh yeah, the ellyptical machine in the gym was broken. Great location though. Right next door to 13 Coins, a great restaurant. Glad I didn't pay the $219 they were asking for a regular booking but for $107, even with the surly front desk clerk it wasn't all that bad.

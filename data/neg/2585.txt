This hotel is relatively new. It is a few blocks from Michigan Ave but is located right next to a Fire Station and above a bar that had a live band when we were there. It seemed as though the windows were open until 3am as the sirens and thumping from the band were terrible. The staff's efforts to move us to another room were of limited value; noone in our party slept while we were there. We also had to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get some satisfaction from the manager and staff; their efforts were far less than we would have hoped for. If location and quality of sleep are a priority, there are many, many better choices in downtown Chicago. I would avoid this hotel if at all possible.

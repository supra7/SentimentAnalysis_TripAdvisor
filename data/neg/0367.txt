I have stayed in far better places in Seattle for less. Room was the size of a prison cell, with a window facing a outside wall. It was quiet until someone showered or flushed a toilet. On the plus side a Seattle Best Coffee is next to the lobby and it is right downtown. If you take the hotel's limo expect to pay at least 30% more than a yellow cab. Hotel staff are helpful and friendly.

We had stayed at the Andra before and really enjoyed the location, the rooms--the whole experience! This time unfortunately the room next to us and the one across the hall were occupied by people who were partying all night. After being asked twice by management to be quiet, they still continued. They should have removed the people from their room rather that allowing them to disturb the sleep of everyone on the floor. We were given credit for the parking charge--big deal! I know it was just the luck of the draw but we won't stay there again. Mike

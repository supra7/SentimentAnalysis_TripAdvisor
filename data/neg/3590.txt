I'm all for supporting unique and individual places and would rather avoid large chains if possible. I was familiar with this hotel before I actually stayed here, and expected to love it. The Hotel Lawrence tried to approach a "boutique" style and ambiance, but unfortunately, the smart bathroom decor and shower fixtures could not overcome the temperature in the "Junior Suite" I booked, which was actually rigged up to a motion detector and would not go below 75 degrees. There was no hot water in the morning. Three unsolicited wake up calls beginning at 5:30 am were not welcome. The demeanor of the staff was marginal, as they came across as more streetwise than hospitable. I used to work in the hotel business and make generous allowances for shortcomings. I do not like to complain, and left a letter for the General Manager about my concerns, stating that if the problems I had encountered could be fixed, I would stay there again and make reservations on the spot. The letter has remained unanswered. His voice mailbox was also full for two weeks afterward. After experiencing these problems, I can only conclude that these are the actual standards of this hotel and they're not all that concerned about it. Since then I've stayed at the Hyatt and the Adolphus for nearly the same price I paid here and received a much finer experience at both places. My honest advice is to check around on the internet for similar rates elsewhere. You'll probably be smart to spend a few dollars more to avoid this hotel, or just as probably, find a lower rate at a hotel known for quality. Sorry to say, but staying here is a gamble at best.

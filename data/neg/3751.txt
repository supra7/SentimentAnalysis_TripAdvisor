First time in OC, reviews were mixed but I figure how bad could it be. I just wanted a clean bed and bathroom since we went for the beach, we can do with out the fuss. The renovated room meant "painted walls", the bathroom was new but not 1 shelf to put your stuff, had to keep our stuff in the bag on the floor, not even a plug for the hair dryer. The first thing we noticed when we got in was the dust on top of the furniture, good thing I had some windex. The lamp on the night table was an ornament since there were no plugs in the room, we had to unplug the fridge and use that plug. Also, they were too lazy to remove the broken tv so they just placed a working tv next to it. The room had little ants and on our ride home we found out that they were tagging along, so everything went from the garage to the wash. The place didn't even have an ice machine so I went next door and offered a couple of dollars every day to get a little ice to keep our water cold. Other things missing were a hose to rinse the sand off your feet, for this we used the hose at the motel next door and hoped no one would notice. If you want housekeeping you need to sign daily and what they do is empty the garbage and give you towels, no rinsing of the shower, give you soap or making of the beds, so we only did it once. The sheets don't even feet the beds and had ripped holes.

The El Cortez was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. One bad experience after another. I stayed there for two days. When we got in the elevator to a pavillion room I knew there was a problem right away. When you get off the dirty elevator you are staring at a dirty window overlooking a dirty roof. This was only the beginning, the air conditioning sucked, not to mention the toilet. We saw people getting arrested and were woken up by a fighting couple in the next room. They also put a hold on my credit card even though I paid cash for the room. The staff was rude, when we saw a bell boy and we were tiredly carryng our luggage he did not even offer to take it. I will never stay there again. It was heaven to get out of there. Lori Canyon Country, CA

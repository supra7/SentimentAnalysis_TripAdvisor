My roomate's grandparents took us to Hacienda for our spring break. After we arrived and my friend's grandpa paid for everything, the hotel told us we weren't staying there but actually we were going to another hotel. My friend's grandparents were very upset but they made us go anyway. I felt bad because my friend's grandma was really upset and sad and cried alot then during our trip. My friend and I were ok though because they sent us to the AZUL which was way more happening for us. The AZUL wasn't so good for my friends grandma because there were alot of stairs and she has pain walking and with her knees. There were even some stairs to get to the beach. The people at AZUL were nice though and tried to help her. Worse things happened though. The Hacienda told us we could come back and hang out at their park and hotel anytime. The first time we wen't to swim in the cenotes it took over an hour for us to be picked up. The second time they made my friend's grandpa pay for our cab because we only got cab fair free for once? This was not what they told us when they shipped us off!! My friends grandparents wouln't let us go after that. That was really ok since the water at the beach was not very nice. It looked like melted chocolate and all kinds of crud would stick to you when you went in it. YUK. I really felt bad about it all and know they will never go back.

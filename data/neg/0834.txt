I just spent three nights at the Westin Seattle for a conference, so I had no choice for my hotel. I was not terribly impressed. The furnishings in the room were good, but the carpet was definitely old and stained. Room temperature control did not work well at all. Room Service menu was VERY limited and VERY expensive. There were few on site dining choices, although there are plenty in the surrounding area. I love luxury hotels, but to me this Westin did not seem so much luxurious as it was simply trying to extract money from you at every turn, while supplying very few of the amenities that would make the extra money worth it. It was like paying Ritz-Carlton prices without the level of service and attention to detail that a Ritz or a JW Marriott delivers. If you are going to Seattle on business, find another hotel, there are plenty in the downtown area. If you are going for pleasure, either save your money and stay somewhere cheaper, as you will be walking the same areas, using the same downtown restaurants etc, or choose another luxury hotel that actually delivers. In my opinion this one does not. It is not a bad hotel, but it is not up to the standard it pretends to be. There is a reason they are not even listed in the top 25 here!

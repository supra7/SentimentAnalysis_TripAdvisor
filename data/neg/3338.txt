Had our car broken into and vandalized, radio pulled out of the dashboard. At least 4 other cars were hit same night. Police said it was a high crime area, and pointed out an apartment building he said criminals probably came from. Manager said they have a security guard, but he "was off" the night we were there. Desk clerk wouldn't even call police for us.

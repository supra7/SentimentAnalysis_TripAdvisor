We just returned from our honeymoon at the Hyatt Regency in Maui. Our initial impression was not a good one. Upon check-in, we were told that our room would be ready shortly and that they would contact us via cell phone. We waited an hour before inquiring about the status of our room. We were then told that they had to give that room away and that our room was now ready for us to check in. The room smelled like cigaretts and the balcony was on top of a roof over looking a parking lot! I complained and was immediately moved three floors up, which was much better except for the remodeling of the hallway. We lost power for a short amount of time, smelled paint, and had workers peeling off wallpaper right outside our room. We were annoyed slightly but thought we had to make the best of it, so we decided to get dinner at Cascades, one of their restaurants. We were seated promptly but the service was slow. I removed the napkin from my plate to notice live, crawling ants!!! I told the server who just gave me a new plate. This was our first night here and I now was afraid to eat at any of their restaurants for the rest of my stay. The pool is huge and the water slide is a lot of fun but the area is very crowded. You practically need to "camp-out" for a lounge chair because people get up early and save them. The pool has servers but they are few and far between. You would be better off going up to the bar your self. The Luau at Napilli gardens (in the hotel) on Friday night was very good!! This is the second show...a must do! This is a family oriented motel but I wouldn't stay there again! I stayed at the Halekalani in Waikiki for the fist half of our honeymoon and it was awesome; Maybe, this is is why I was unhappy with our stay at the Hyatt!!

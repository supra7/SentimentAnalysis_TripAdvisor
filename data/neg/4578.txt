Stayed here in Jan. and was very disappointed in my room. Very small room about 200 square feet and it makes you feel like you are in a closet. The tiny bathroom was about 6 feet by 6 feet you had to maneuver around the door to get in and bend over the toilet to turn the shower on and this was after I had asked to switch rooms. I especially hated the TV and old 24 inch Phillips tube TV similar to what I had in my dorm room 20 years ago. There are much better chooses for the same price in Chicago (Ritz, W) but do visit the lobby it is stunning it just ends there. Also the train runs until late at night so do not expect a nice quiet experience. I was really surprised by all the positive reviews I guess if you are staying it is imperative you pay for an upgrade.

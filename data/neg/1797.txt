I never actually stayed at the hotel so I won't give it the worst rating because I can't say anything about the hotel itself. I booked a room on the hotel's website Sunday night for a stay the following weekend. On Tuesday morning, I called to cancel the reservation because it turned out we couldn't go. The hotel refused to cancel it and said they would charge me the entire amount ($360) because they have a strict policy that you have to cancel 7 days in advance. Their website does not tell you the policy if you go through the "online reservations" process. It's there, but only if you click on the "rates" link and scroll all the way down. Since I wanted to know availability as well as rates, I clicked on "reservations" and the policy was never disclosed. Nor did it tell me that I was essentially booking a non-refundable rate since it was within the 7 days. The confirmation e-mail that contained the policy didn't arrive until two days after I booked (and after I had tried to cancel), but it wouldn't have helped since it was non-refundable from the second I booked it online. They were very rude when I called to cancel, telling me it was my fault for making a hotel reservation when I wasn't sure we could come (to which I replied, if I had known it was non-refundable, I wouldn't have made the reservation). They did not even acknowledge my letter to their management explaining the problem. I got my money back by contesting the charge with my credit card company. The management of this hotel clearly doesn't care about fair dealing or customer service. Beware.

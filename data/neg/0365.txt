we had a quick one night stopover in seattle on our way to vancouver. we chose this hotel as it was recommended in lonely planet. GOD NO! the rooms were TINY, and the walls paper thin, with lots of strange characters coming and going at all hours. we asked to be moved from our initial room (with a great view of car park) as there was the constant sound of a baby crying. our second room (same size, even better view of car park) was even noisier, and we were kept up all night by people in the room next door having very loud and vocal sex. if you want to sleep in seattle, this is not the place for you.

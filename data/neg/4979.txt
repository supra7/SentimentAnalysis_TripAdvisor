I booked this hotel online. the pics look good online, but not the same when i arrived, i can smelled the ciggarate all the time when i was sleeping, and i can hear the other door slam in my room. the room was very small. i will not go back again. i will rather pay more money to stay in a better hotel. not recomment.

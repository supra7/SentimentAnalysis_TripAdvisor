I arrived here today... Service has been horrible. I had to wait three hours for my room and paid 200 dollars extra to stay in a room you cannot even see the ocean in. It is supposed to be a four star hotel but is not. Save your money and go somewhere else. The only good thing was the very accommodating bell hop Orlando.

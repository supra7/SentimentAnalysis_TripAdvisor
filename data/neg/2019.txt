There were three of us using the room, so it was necessary for us to use the pull out bed. When it was opened, it had dirty linen on the mattress. Also, the bath tub was nasty. There was body hair in it, and it felt as if it had only been wiped out. I called Housekeeping and they came rather quickly to change sheets and clean tub. It would have been nice if there were pots and pans to use on the stove. Not sure, but it looked like an induction stove, and regular pots won't work on those. Room was beautiful, but didn't get the Luxury Hotel fee at all. All we got was a newspaper everyday, but I could have gotten it elsewhere far cheaper. It is a good long walk to get anywhere. Hotel did not have vending machines, so you need to bring snacks with you. Hotel was not worth the $142.00 per night we paid. It was nice, but didn't even have shuttle service. Treasure Island had a nice shuttle that was in use on weekends, for free. Next time, we stay in the middle of the strip so we don't have to walk, or take a taxi so far.

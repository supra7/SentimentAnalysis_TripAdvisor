This hotel is very similar to the normal Novotel with the standard rollout desk (I like these very much) and comfortable bed. The Novotel is based out by the ring road, although you can read downtown using the trams in 20 minutes and it's very cheap. Parking is expensive at 22 EUR/day, although you can park next to the hotel (not in the car park) for free. We overslept on the last day and despite Novotel's late Sunday checkout were called and very rudely told we must pay a surcharge of 10 EUR/hours. After much discussion, I agreed to leave in 20 minutes and they reluctantly agreed not to charge us the surcharge, but meant I cannot recommend this hotel.

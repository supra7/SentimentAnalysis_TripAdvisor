I booked into the Sterling for 3 weeks as I am in Dallas for business. The booking was made through the company I work for as they get corporate discounts. However, the discount cannot be worth what I have had to put up with. Let's see: - To get hot water I was told to let the water run for about 10 mins. I wish I knew this before I had to have a cold shower. - The hotel room phone was broken and did not ring so I could not tell when people were calling me. Reception thought it would be a good idea for me to take calls from the lobby instead of my room. I thought that was a bad idea. - I could hear howling noises all night through the window which I assumed would blow in on me. - If the howling noises aren't enough to keep you awake all night, the noise from the heating will. - If the wind and the heating aren't enough to keep you awake, being able to hear everything from adjoining room will. - The wireless internet signal was not strong enough from my room so I could not get online. - Ther were no staff to help me take my bags to the room or even opoen the front door for me in the lobby when I first arrived. Needless to say, I have tried to move hotels but apparantly everything in Dallas is booked out. However, I am moving into the Westin in a couple of days. Can't wait to get out of the Sterling and into a real hotel.

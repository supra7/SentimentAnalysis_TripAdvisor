This was definitely the worst hotel experience we had in years: The room we have been given was extremely dusty, there were lots of hairs in the bathroom and the leather cushion of a chair was completely ripped apart. We complained about the room in a friendly way and they have shown us 4 different rooms, that looked exactly the same (dust, lots of hairs, broken doors of closets, defect refridgerators...). Even the service person who carried our bags said, that he would not stay in one of the rooms for this amount of money per night and said they seem to have a problem with housekeeping. Afterwards we took one room, which was acceptable (although also not in a good condition) and found several bloodstains on the bed when we were going to sleep. The next day we had an appointment with a manager, who reacted quite harsh but at least after some discussion gave us one free night (of our six nights in total). The hotel definitely needs a renovation and we recommend to avoid this place in Seattle until then.

This hotel look fantastic - well designed and up to date. BUT it failed all our tests for an airport hotel. Noisy because the sound insulation from aircraft noise was ineffective. Also, yes believe it!, the bathroom had a glass wall with the bedroom so no privacy. Light from the corridor shone into the room as there were no blinds so we had to use eye masks. Whoever designed this hotel needs to be made to stay there - it look great but does not function well. Our verdict - next time, find somewhere else.

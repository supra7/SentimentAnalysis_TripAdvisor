I saw all the bad reviews and contemplated changing to another hotel, didn't and now wish I had! I even took the precaution of emailing with my concerns which was impressively met with a phone call to me here in the UK with assurances that I would be given a 'very nice room' I mentioned this at check in only to be told that couldn't be guarenteed so I ended up in a pokey little room, albeit on the supposed renovated 15th floor. I wouldn't mind but I didn't book through priceline and paid the full price for a king size bed (aren't they suposed to be BIG ). Well it must have shrunk in the wash! Yes the lobby is nice but I wasn't planning on spending too much time there! As for the staff, well the only decent person I had any contact with was the concierge. I almost got the impression that if they had the equipment they would have photographed and fingerprinted me before they cashed my travellers check. NEVER AGAIN. I paid half what I paid here to stay in a hotel just off Times Square and got a vastly better room.

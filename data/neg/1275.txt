Stayed two days in October 2005 for 5 days of business in Seattle. Despite being a Platinum member of Marriott Rewards (100+ per year) I was not upgraded to the concierge level. This is my 5th time this year to this hotel and previously disappointed. I was told by Janet Burruss, Rooms Operatons Manager Concierge rooms are available for sale to the general public, but as a Platinum member you get first priority when there are upgrades available, but we are not able to guarantee a complimentary upgrade, as sometimes a particular room type may be sold out. Reward members get second dibs on left overs. (Where's your customer loyalty over the almighty dollar?) Room was small, carpet worn out and had ripples. My room overlooked the loading dock and the room was extremely noisy. Had a shower head that had a super saver head. It took a while to get the shampoo out of my hair. The furniture was old and damaged. One of the phones did not work and the toilet ran intermittently all night. It was all reported the first night and a maintenance man did attempt to repair, but with no results. I attempted to change rooms, but was told the hotel was sold out and no other rooms were available. I left and went to the Hilton about 2 blocks away. (HILTON HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ----------) The front desk folks were young and inexperienced. They didn't care I was checking out due to problems and they made no attempt to make the situation right. The parking was OK. A little expensive at 12.00 per day when other hotels in the immediate area are free. The food in the restaurant was good and moderately priced. The bed was outstanding, but the other problems forced me out. I have put this hotel off limits for my employees and have made Hilton SeaTac our Hotel of Choice for the Seattle Airport location.

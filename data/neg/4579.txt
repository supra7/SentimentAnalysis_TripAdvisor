From 1o p.m. for two hours employees made lpud noises in the room next to ours. I called the front desk three times to complain and ask that someone in management intervene. No help came eventually after more than two hours of loud bumping bnoises of furniture being moved, it stopped. By then it wa well after midnight. It tainted an otherwise nice stay over Thanksgiving weekend of Thursday and Friday nights. I also complianed when Ichecked out on Saturday.

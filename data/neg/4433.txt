I would only recommend this hotel if you are a very heavy sleeper. My teenage children slept through all the sirens and honking from the fire engines and ambulances from the station across the street, but I always heard them leaving and returning throughout the night. The front desk will supply you with ear plugs, but that didn't make a difference. As for the room - we ended having a closet door removed because of a broken mirror. There were black scuff marks on the wall paper and the covers on the baseboard heaters were bent out of shape in several areas. We had a corner suite with a kitchen, full size fridge, dining area, microwave, 2 cooking units with dishes and utensils and a few cooking supplies. There was a flat screen TV in the living area and bedroom. It was a very large suite considering we were in the middle of downtown Chicago. Breakfast in the morning was ok. Lots of bagels, toast, muffins, juice, fruit, coffee and tea. I don't recommend the perfectly shaped round rubber eggs nor the biscuit. The staff were very friendly and helpful. 30 - 40 min. walking distance to Millenium Pk, Navy Pier and Water Tower Place.

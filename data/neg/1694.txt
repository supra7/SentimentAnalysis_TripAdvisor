We disliked 2 major things about this hotel. First was the location of our room. Our door faced the inside of the Atrium part of the lobby. The doors SLAMMED and we heard all the commotion all night long. Any time someone talked or walked or exited their room, we heard it. The design of the Sound proofing doors was not well planned at all. I was very upset to have so much sound at night, and no peace. We will not stay here again. Second was Why in the world put the chairs at the edge of the pool so you have to step OVER people to get into the water. Give a little room!!! We won't be coming back to the Hyatt! We stayed at 2 different Marriott's and everything was perfect.

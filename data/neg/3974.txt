The rooms are tiny, tiny, tiny. There is no comfortable reading chair in the room. If you want a mini-frig, it costs $25/day. Lobby furniture smells bad, old, musty. Concierge staff need lessons in friendliness to those asking questions; also they need to learn directions so they can tell people the correct ways. This was a common complaint with numerous guests.

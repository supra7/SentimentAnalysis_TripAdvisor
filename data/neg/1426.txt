With proper attention to detail, and the resolution of some room issues: i.e. leaking ceiling, broken jacuzzi, electrical failures, broken black out shutters...Secrets Maroma Beach has the potential to be a wonderful getaway. Breakfast is the best meal of the day. Perhaps, they try to hard on the rest and fall a bit short. Room service is a bit like diner food, although, in building 23, it arrived quickly. (Again, breakfast is the best.)Restaurant/beach staff were wonderful. Resort looks good, although new design elements added daily...they need to remember, less is more. Would we go back? Not anytime soon.

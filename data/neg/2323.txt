As you all may know the fairfield inn at the airport has an indoor pool great prices and free breakfast. Which in all honesty sounds like Great Bang for your Buck but I had the wworst weekend get away! i went to relax instead after my first of two nights there i beamce very ill after eatting the free breakfast (vomiting, dizziness, headache) you name it I had it. The pool area smelled like if you were walking into a bottle of bleach zero ventilation. So technically all the Great values that this hotel offers were defective. Horrible Stay!

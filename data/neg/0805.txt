My Father paid in advance for a very nice room so that my new Husband and I could have a fabulous wedding night. When we arrived at the Westin Hotel we found out they had given our room away, probably to someone who was willing to pay a lot due to Bumbershoot. They had no excuse, but tried to convince us that there was an even better hotel nearby that they would accommodate us at free of charge. We didn't know what to say so we just went along with it, but now I wish I had fought back. This other Hotel was very dark, had lots of loud music, and full of teenagers and/or college students. The room wasn't much better and after a good cry we decided to go back home. I never did have my wedding night. A year later around our first anniversary I felt reminded of this event and wrote The Westin an email encouraging them to be more sensitive to their guests, because you never know the impact a guest's stay can have. Surprisingly they wrote back, confirmed that my story was true, and to my amazement offered us a one night's stay in one of their deluxe suites. Although this couldn't make up for the importance of our actual wedding day I thought it was a sweet gesture and appreciated their apology, so we accepted. Some time went by, and we never received the certificate we were told would arrive in the mail. When I tried to contact them to see what was going on they never responded. In my opinion it doesnt matter how fancy a place looks or how impressive the food is. What matters is how you are treated as a guest, paying customer, but most importantly a person. To say the least, I would never encourage anyone to visit this hotel.

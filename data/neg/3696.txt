I stay there for a few weeks but to be frank this hotel have the worse service ever...and I travel a lot, in all sort of places from B&B to a 5 stars hotel, for me this is the hotel with the worse service ever, I even wonder if this belong to Best Western. When talking the reception doesnt even try to look at me, she talked arrogantly while doing her work, for me, it is so rude, especially when you are in the hotel business. My personal opinion, theres no family spirit in the hotel. They refuse to answer the call (I made more than 5 calls), Im so angry and I went to the desk to check, there they were there with no customer, Im still wondering why they didnt answer. The internet is so slow, I made so many complaint but still nothing was done. Location wise, its near to the airport, took about 30minues to the airport and they provide shuttle service (in advance). Going to Rome is quite a challenge here, you can took the bus (only running from 6.30am to 8pm) to the nearest metro station, and the bus journey took you about 45 minutes. Coming back to the hotel, you to be at the station by 7.30pm so that you wouldnt miss the last bus. The room is clean and tidy with new furniture and stuff and the garden is beautiful and well maintained.

Very bad experience. Dirty, poor maintenance, poor service, poor security. Pool and spa are dirty. Rooms are dirty. No check in until 4 p.m. no matter what your situation. There were several families here for a wedding with us and we all hated it. Nothing else available in the area because of UW. We would never, ever stay here again!

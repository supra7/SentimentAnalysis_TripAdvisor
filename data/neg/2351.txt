I've stayed at this hotel a number of times. When we checked in after midnight the staff was friendly. I noticed the lobby looked different from what I remembered. I asked about breakfast which used to be a buffet. Now it's  la carte and a bit more expensive. There's not really a choice for food unless you have a car here. The internet is pretty slow too. It's advertised as High Speed Internet, it's definitely not that http://www.speedtest.net/result/1681084220.png On another positive note though, the hotel is close to the airport and I-95 but the noise level doesn't seem uncomfortable.

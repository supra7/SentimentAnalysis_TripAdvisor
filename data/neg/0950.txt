I was at this hotel back in September and everything was fine. But now, I'm not even sure where to begin. This was the worst hotel experience of my life. I made arraingements a month in advance for a discounted room because I would be staying in the area twice a week for the next 7 months. When I arrived at the hotel, I was met by the nastiest man I have ever encountered. I was told that he would not honor my reservation since it had been made by the former manager...He tried to soak me for $139.00 a night for a dump instead of the $89.00 I was promised. He told me if I didn't like it...get out!! Which is exactly what I did. When I arrived home, I found that he had charged my credit card for two nights stay!! Do yourself a favor and skip this experience. The travel lodge up the street is much nicer and know how to treat people. This man should not be allowed to even operate a hotel!

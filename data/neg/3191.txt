Riders lodge is exactly like what the other reviews say: 1. Not-so-clean sheets and towels (stains) 2. Location wise far from town and not very accessible 3. Turf city is nearby but with very few shops 4. Dogs barking in the morning 5. Service isn't wonderful 6. Breakfast was very simple A good place if you need somewhere cheap to stay but if you have the $ choose somewhere else. I enjoyed my stay though due to the company. :D

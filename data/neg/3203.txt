It cannot be considered a Boutique Hotel after you had stayed in Naumi or Wangz for comparison. When step in the lobby, it had a over sweet smell that I couldn't stand. The overall design doesn't give me a Boutique feel but cheap feel that is overrated and overpriced. For a Family Suite, the room is very very small for the high price and without breakfast inclusive. Not worth it. Will not return to try even the theme room. Spend the money in Festive Hotel for family suite more worth it!

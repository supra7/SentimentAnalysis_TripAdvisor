Mission Bay Rv Resort is not a Resort of any kind. It is a slab of cement and just a place to park. The rates are far to high for what is offered. Electricity, Sub-standard Cable, WiFi when working, A Laundry room that only one person can stand in. For 259 sites and only 4 washers and 4 dryers. Zero site privacy. The staff was kurt to say the least.

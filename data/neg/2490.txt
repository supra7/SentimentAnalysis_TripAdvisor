I am a 47 year old GP and attended a weekend conference in London with my wife. I was looking for a simple double room for 100 with a decent bed and good shower in Central London. I thought staying at a fairly new Travelodge might just fit the description - but not so! Location is good, my room (ground floor to the back of the building) was quiet - BUT: (1) the small room smelled of dirty carpet (2) the small double bed had an appallingly cheap mattress on a flimsy base. We had to use our duvet on top of the mattress in order not to feel the springs underneath and were lucky to get the last spare duvet in the hotel to sleep under - I must point out that the receptionist was very helpful, supplying duvet, air freshener and unlocking the window; (3) the shower cubicle floor was very slippery and the short shower curtain kept blowing in and sticking to the legs when showering; (4) my wife deliberately did not take a hair dryer with her as we had been informed that they were available from reception; however on trying to collect one at 8 am on Sunday morning, none were available ... (5) the breakfast room is far too small for the hotel size, and the food very uninspiring. SO: for  99 with breakfast for a double - best avoided!

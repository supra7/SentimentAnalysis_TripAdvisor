I have to laugh (and also get sick to my stomach and very angry) reading the recent reviews of this horror. They should use this place for a movie or on Saturday Night Live trying to depict the worst "hotel" imaginable. We stayed at this place about 4 or 5 years ago. My wife nearly killed me when she saw this dump. Yes, the elevator was a joke. Narrow staircase. Room next to lobby filled with debris. Walls in hall apparently marked up by children with pencils and crayons. Bathroom in the room was too filthy and shabby to describe. I would not have stepped into the shower with my shoes on. Sink coming off wall. Pipes underneath sink exposed and covered with yuck. This is all I remember after many years. We could not wait to get home and take a shower (many showers). I probably forgot many other horrors. Yes, Choice Hotels basically had a tough [--] Mr. Customer attitude. If you have a choice between this "hotel" and a rat infested vacant lot, sleep on the ground in the lot.

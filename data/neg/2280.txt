This sud-standard hotel should not be featured in the AAA guide book at all. Everything about it is terrible: the location, lobby, antiquated elevator, breakfast area. Our sparse room was ok by comparison. Total nightmare. My daughter and I felt unsafe and were totally embarrassed when we were dropped off at the hotel by a friend. Gave us a very bad impression of Philly.

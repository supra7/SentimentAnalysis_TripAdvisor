They have mandatory valet that you have to pay tips for. The bathroom was a little dirty which is one of my biggest pet peeves, but the room was fairly nice. No casino so all other prices are ridiculously high. The hotel itself was ok nothing to write home about. There wasn't a tiny gift shop to buy things like tylenol or shampoo. It is across the street from the fashion mall in the back. We were supposed to stay two nights but decided to go elsewhere after being there for an hour. When we checked out we where so happy to get out of there that we didn't notice that they had over charged us for the nights stay. I called on March 6th to complain. I was told that he would "call right back"! I waited until the end of March and was transferred to someone in accounting and got a voice mail so I left a message. I had to call again the first of April and left another message. I had to call yet again and finally asked for a supervisor and had to leave another message. I told them I was going to write to the newspaper in my message. Boy she couldn't call me back quick enough. I got a call back within five minutes. It took them ten minutes to fix the problem and charge back my card. What an ordeal! This is only have the story. Just be aware that they "secure" your card $200 per person per night. So if there are three of you and you are staying two nights it will cost you a security of $1200. They don't say that anywhere on their website and were a little shocked to find this out when arriving. When we didn't have the full amount on our card and it was declined they sent the manager out to embarrass us saying pretty loudly "You don't have the money to stay here"? The staff was young and ill trained. We definitely will never stay at "The Donald" again.

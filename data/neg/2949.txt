Stayed at this property for three nights - unfortunately this is the first time a W hotel disappointed me. The rooms product is ok - more of a Sheraton feel than the usually cool W style. Arriving at the hotel at around 1 in the afternoon my room was not yet ready and I was promised a call on my cellphone - I waited until 5 only to find out they had forgotten to call. The gym facilities are decent enough, but again compared to other W properties I have stayed at in recent weeks a little basic. The gym was staffed every now again - staff were however too busy playing on the xbox to look after guests. The breakfast buffet at Kitchen looks fantastic - unfortunately the food quality on quite a number of items was not great and the service mediocre at best. My orange juice twice turned out to be pineapple juice, waiting to sign the bill every morning was very annoying and most pastries and breads were very dry and not fresh. The pool on the top floor is very impressive, great loungers, cool infinity pool with fantasic views - unfortunately the usually great W pool ingredients of music, beverage service etc were missing. Though there were plenty of staff they were too busy chatting with each other to notice guests. To me the most disappointing aspect of all was that at 12.30 at night the bar staff would go around and asked everyone for last orders. At 1 in the morning, the bar pretty packed lights are turned on as brightly as possible, the music gets switched off and the drinks at the bar get covered by purple towels. My colleague and I watched in amazement as group after group of potential guests got turned away from about 12.15 onwards - once again service is very slow as staff are too busy chatting. Overall the hotel's hardware has the potential to one day be a proper W hotel - the hotel's service however is very poor.

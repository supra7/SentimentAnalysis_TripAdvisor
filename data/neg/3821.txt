After reading all of the brilliant reviews on The Joule, I selected it for my wedding night. My husband and I booked a suite for three nights. When I booked the suite, I advised the hotel that this would be for my wedding. I again advised them when I checked in. The big white dress later that night was a dead giveaway. What I received is exactly what was listed for the room. Nothing more, nothing less. The impeccable treatment such as thoughtful notes, champagne, or other niceties were no where to be found. All in all, this hotel was nothing special with a high price tag. My stay at the Magnolia around the corner for the preceding two nights was far more pleasant for $150 less a night.

We stayed here for 2 nights during my husband business trip. Since traveling with 3 small children we reserved a 1 bedroom suite. Since i brought my newborn I asked staff to make sure room was cleaned etc. Well, on the second nite my husband slept in attached living room in fold out bed with kids. He awoke with severe allergic reaction and a doctor had to called to take care of him. $550 later and tons of benedryl and prednisone, the front desk offered my $100 discount on my stay. I have since contacted starwoods and was told someone would respond but its been 2 weeks and so far nothing. a cleaning crew wa supposed to come up and check the couch/bed/pillows that were taken from a closet but they said they couldnt get access to the room (there were 7 of us there) The last time my husband had an allergic reaction where he had to be hospitalized was 3 years ago when he cleaned out the garage while our house was being painted/sanded. I am scared to think about what would have happened if we werent staying with him. (oh and he travels alot for business and never had a problem with dust in hotel rooms so I wonder what other chemicals were there)

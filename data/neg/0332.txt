A/C didn't work, and window opened less than one inch. Bathroom door had no latch or fan, so we were afraid to use it and stink ourselves out. Decorations looked circa 1974. Counter at the desk was granite, and fractured like someone hit it with a sledgehammer. Computer didn't work in business center, and noise outside was loud all night long. We left the second night of our 5 day stay. Don't ever stay here.

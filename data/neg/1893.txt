It was a really last minute bloking and I have to say the price was surprisingly low: 2 nights for two with breakfast for less than 120GBP. The room was too small just enough to fit a bed and 1 wardrobe. However I did see other rooms and they looked like recently renovated. Breakfast was probably the best part of it toasts, jam, ham, cheese, coffee, tea, hot chocolate & corn flakes. The advantage was also WiFi in the lobby.

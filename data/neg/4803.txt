This hotel was nice and clean but the prices charged for the extras were ridiculous. I was in town for a large convention and had boxes shipped to me at the hotel. The charges ran up over $500 and I was never told this when checking in. The food in the bar, restaurant and especially room service was terrible and way overpriced. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very nice and friendly and they do have a great "Green" program offered to guests who do not need their room cleaned every day.

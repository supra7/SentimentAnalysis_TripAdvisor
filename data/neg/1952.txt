Impression? Understated luxury, friendly staff, and priced a little high when you consider there is no casino. As to no casino, no problem, you can walk to one nearby. Where the experience fell down sharply for me is that it is not motorcycle rider convenient. You and your motorcycle must be escorted by a valet in order to enter the garage. Leave something on the machine that you want to retrieve? Oops, cajole one of the valets to go with you to the garage where your every move will be observed; they are taking no chance that you might make off with someone's rental car. When I checked in I was told there was no parking fee; however, I had to pay in addition to the room charge a $22.34 resort fee which apparently includes parking.

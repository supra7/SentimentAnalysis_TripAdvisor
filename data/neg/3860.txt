Stayed here for a recent conference. The hotel is busier than Grand Central Station, and the service is horrible. Waited 20 minutes to checkin. Room service arrived cold and order was incorrect. Screwed up my receipt. Forgot toothpaste and called for two hours to have them deliver it - the giftshop was out and they told me to walk across the street the the supermarket. I travel on business every week and have never written a review on a business trip - but this place was bad. I stay in Marriotts almost exclusively so I know what to expect - this one missed the mark by a long shot.

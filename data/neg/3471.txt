Horrible experience. The rooms are cramped & the shades were broken, so we woke up to the sun beating down on our faces. The room was fairly clean, but as far as the beds go, they were not that comfortable at all. I would definitely recommend a Sheraton if comfort is what you desire. The Magnloia is just too pricy and you're paying for the name & the history, not the quality.

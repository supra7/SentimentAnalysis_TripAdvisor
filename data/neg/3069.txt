I was very disappointed in this hotel. The staff are very rude and seem to intentionally be unhelpful in trying to locate anything. I was expecting at least Best Western courteous service, but these folks acted as though they were bothered by even checking a guest in. When I asked for some ice, it took about 20 minutes. The rooms are small, not very nice, and it's just not a pleasant experience.

The absolute only thing this hotel has going for it is its location- right in the downtown core. Upon check-in, we were advised that parking would be an additional charge of $19/day. We were then given a "superior" room on the top floor and were greeted by a cracked and peeling ceiling, dirty walls and baseboards, and a run down bathroom. We complained to the front desk and were able to switch rooms. The only improvement in the second room was that there was actually a dresser and the ceiling was in better shape. But we took it. Let me restate, the bathroom alone is reason not to stay at this hotel. All of the fixtures were ancient, despite the sites' claims of a recent renovation. The tile was also old and the grout stained. The toilet flush, I'm sure, could be heard two rooms down on either side- it was seriously THAT loud. Plus, it was so small you couldn't close the door until you were actually sitting on the toilet. The counter space (or lack there-of) did not have sufficient space for my make-up bag, and it's hardly a suitcase. The walls were thin and we could easily hear conversations next door, along with our neighbors own plumbing issues. The radiator was not working which sucked because the building was freezing cold. One last thing: this hotel is definitely not handicapped friendly. There are stairs leading from the front desk to the elevator. I'm not handicapped, but it was hard dragging my luggage up a flight of stairs. Because my husband and I were so disappointed, we left a day early and drove back home to Vancouver, BC. Thank you, hotels.ca, for the apology and refund!

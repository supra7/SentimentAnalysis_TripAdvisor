We travlled to Key West and were stunned when we arrived. After reading the resort description and other reviews I was not expecting to pull into the resort beside Walgreens and Home Depot. Yes, we had the pleasure of being beside two busy loading docks. The fitness centre is not "world class". It is four machines pushed up against a wall in a very small room with no windows. We ended up running beside the highway smelling fumes from all the cars. Not exactly relaxing. The kitchen is not well equipped. It was really a bit of a joke. You could not cook in ours. Two very small pots, a frying pan for 1 egg, no dish towel, no dish detergent. It basically felt like camping. It was a three bedroom with an eating table with four chairs. We were there a week and our room was not swept the entire time. Walls are thin and the beds are uncomfortable. The staff are nice but under-staffed which makes for long waits. I waited over two hours for an answer to a question. The grounds are lovely. So, if you want to take a long drive and spend a lot of money to be in less than 2 acres, this is your spot. For the price, I certainly expected more.

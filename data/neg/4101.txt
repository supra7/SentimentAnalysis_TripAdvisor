We stayed at the Plaza from June 26- July 2, 2007, Hotel is in a great location, close to the Boston Common and the public park. Close to the subway, and taxis are always waiting right outside. People in this part of town are not very friendly or helpful. Our first nights stay was a bit warm and the next day was the hottest day in Boston since 1941. Our air conditioner was not working correctly. We called guest services and they sent someone up right away. He worked on it for a few mins. said it would be cooled off in 20 mins. and after we returned from dinner 2 1/2 hours later it was still not working. They offered us another room which we gladly accepted. The entire airconditioning system needs a major upgrade. There are no air vents in the area of the elevators which are REALLY slow. It was so warm in the lobby that the fresh flowers were wilting 2 days after the arrangement was put in. The rooms are small since it is an older hotel. The bathrooms are a bit small but managable. The beds were really comfortable and there are lots of pillows. The walls are very thin and the doorways very narrow going into the rooms. You hear alot of street noise inside your room. Restaurants in this area are pretty pricey. For the location, we would stay here again.

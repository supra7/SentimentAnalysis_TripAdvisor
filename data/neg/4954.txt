The location of this hotel couldn't be better -- near to everything in downtown, it seems. Moreover, the staff were friendly, courteous, and BOUNTIFUL (a refreshing find in any U.S. lodging, especially a budget one). EVERYONE I encountered was helpful, courteous, informative, and seemed genuinely delighted that I was a guest in the property. Unfortunately, however, the noise from the busy streets below kept me from sleeping (though when I asked at the desk if I might be moved to a quieter room I was told that "historic" usually also meant "noisy," and that they would provide some earplugs, if I desired. One of the reasons I stayed at this property was because of its "historic" description, which is extremely misleading, as what was probably once a charming building was apparently gutted and outfitted as inexpensively as possible. However, the location was good (splendid restaurants nearby), and the staff are exceptionally pleasant and helpful, as noted below. Yet, I won't again stay at this hotel, because though they've strapped on some new windows to the old ones, whatever they've done in an effort to soundproof this property fails - miserably (just like my attempts to sleep the night I stayed there).

Just returned from Boston with 3 nights at this hotel and definitely the worst hotel on the trip. The rooms were tiny as were the bathrooms - glad I am only small not sure if a larger person would have managed. Room facilities limited - no coffee maker or mini bar and no wireless internet - only wired which was very slow and very expensive. Stayed the previous 5 nights in the Hyatt for the same rate and the facilities were excellent. Despite being a historic hotel it is not worth the price it charges. Also most of the rooms look over enclosed roof space and have no view but very noisy air conditioning units.

Other reviewers must be deep sleepers because I don't get how they could rate this place so highly. Yes the rooms/facility is modern, clean etc but ultimately it's all about the quality of the sleep right? Stayed here for four nights and almost went crazy with the noise. The hotel is basically built between two runways that are active 24x7. It's also nestled between three terminals served by busy roads and a train - if the planes don't get you all the other stuff will. Even worse the hotel is resort style with no corridors - this means your room is completely exposed to the surrounding noise. The windows are only double-pane (should be triple) and the aircon is quiet (so it doesn't mask the outside noises). Bring your own white-noise machine with you (I have got to buy one!)

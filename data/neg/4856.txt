The Hilton Hotel did not stand up to its name. The help was great but the rooms where old fashion, the bathroom showers had mildew. The lobby was the best decorated, but noticed that the cameras facing the south tower elevators had so must dust on it, looked like it was growing hair, also the air vent return on the 12th floor next to the elevators where so dirty. When using the Valet service from the south tower, if you wanted your car and it was parked at the north tower, you had to walk to the north tower to get your car. Pool was nice and servers at the pool were very friendly. Had to pay extra for a refrigerator, microwave and an extra bed, which was a blown up mattress on a piece of wood that had wheels on one end to roll up to the room. Stayed at many hotels with refrigerator, microwave and an extra bed did not have to pay any extra. Will not stay there again. Not worth the money!!!

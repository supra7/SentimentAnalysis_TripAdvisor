I staid at the Candlewood suites two years ago for a extended stay and it was great. This time a big problem has been the head of housekeeping, Mr. Fernando. He is rather loud, nosy and wants to know everything about where I work, at what I am leaving, if i left for work, etc. His behaviour is weird and unprofessional and at often times you find him using the computer at the business lounge.

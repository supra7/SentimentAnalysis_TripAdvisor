Celebrating our 30th anniversary at the Palmer House Hilton. I checked in and gave James W., who worked at the front desk a $20.00 tipp and explained it was our 30th anniversary. He took the money and said to me, I will do something special for you. When you get to your room you will be surprised! YEA I WAS! NOTHING. I called the front desk and asked JAMES W. if I was missing something. He said he was sorry and he would have it sent right up! Never did. Tipping at the front desk when checking in at the PALMER HOUSE HILTON, D O N' T. This really kills it for tipping industry! The hotel was nice. Rooms very small especially the bathroom. Good location. PARKING, I was charged $90. for three nights. The Palmer House automaticlly charged my credit card and put the receipt under my door. When I left the parking structure I had to insert my parking ticket to exit and the meter said $61.00?? Don't have The Palmer House Validate your parking ticket It will cost you more! If any one from The Palmer House wants to verify this or contact me. My stay was Sept. 9/27 thru 9/30 Room 20-131.

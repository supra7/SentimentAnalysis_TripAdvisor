We arrived at 11.30pm and were confronted with being told the hotel was overbooked and they would take us to a sister hotel further out from the city centre. The story was that another guest was sick and so stayed on an extra night, which was interferring with our booking. Being aware this is a common scam we refused to be moved and insisted that they sort somethign out. After a tense 20+ mins we were finally given a room. It was a twin despite booking a double and was in terrible condition, especially the bathroom and was located in the main hotel. The exhaust sounded likea fog horn, the WC barely flushed and there were exposed wires, plus the room faced a busy street and so it was very noisy. As we arrived late we made do and would deal with it in the morning. Upon complaining they immediately moved us to the renovated part of the hotel which is across the road in a seperate building. This was delightful. It is brand new and in an loft style. The room was large and modern and the bathroom was a good size also and again brand new. The view from the little window was of the roofs and to Saint Maggiore Church. The only downside was that the shower cubicle leaked a lot and this then made the bathroom smell significantly. Breakfast in the new and old hotel was dissmal and so we skipped this after the first morning. We paid an average of 61 Euro a night. The hotel was only 5 min walk fromt he train station. and about 500m from the Colleseum. It was very well located. I'd definately recommend the new part of the hotel but would steer clear of the older part.

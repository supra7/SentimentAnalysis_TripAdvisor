I understand why the other reviews varied so much. Let me shed some light... Frankly, If I didn't get into this room through a deal from Hotwire, I'd be disappointed too. Paying over $150, even for being in the theatre district would not have been worth it at this hotel. It has a GRAND feel to it, kind of a throwback to the 1920s. Feels a bit like you're on the Titanic (a sort of opulance and class in a style that you don't see in modern hotels). The hotel has a lot of history and the staff DO try to stick to their traditions... The issue is ... the rooms are showing their age. So until the multi-million dollar renovations occurs, I'd say try it if you'd like to stay at a place where you can kind of 'feel the history,' but do not build it up too much beyond that. My biggest turn-off was that the bathroom floor had mini square tiles that really needed a good scrubbing. If I hadn't noticed that, I would have rated it higher. Let's face it, this hotel is trying to appeal to more demanding market segment, so they need to go over their rooms a bit in more detail. Aside from that, I enjoyed seeing the shoe shine man with the old fashioned platform chairs, the many fine restaurants, a decent gym, and a piano bar in the lobby. It was a short walk to the park. To be fair, there were also some nice touches at this hotel. Cheers!

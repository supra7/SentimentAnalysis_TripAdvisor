This trendy hotel located on the west side of Kowloon is not for the average tourist hoping to see the sights of Hong Kong. More useful for a business man attending a conference at the ICC next door. The Elements Mall also next door is high end and has a stop for the airport express with in-town check in availale which was useful. Despite the trendy image, the service offered was not up to scratch. At check in, we were almost forced to fill in a Starwood rewards card which we didn't want, internet service is not free in a 'wonderful room' grade, I repeatedly had to ask to have a daily newspaper delivered and when one did arrive, it was 12 hours later at 11.30 at night! Some member of staff thought it appropriate to ring our door bell until one of us got out of bed from sleeping.... I am still waiting for the apology. Breakfast is expensive at SGD$40 and not a great selection of yogurt or cereal. The best thing about this hotel was the rooftop swimming pool on the 76th floor and the under used gym on the 73rd floor. I wouldn't rush to go back to the W Hotel and would probably look at another hotel if staying in that area.

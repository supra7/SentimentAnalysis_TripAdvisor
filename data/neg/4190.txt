I want to echo other reviewers that this is an OLD hotel with its century-old elevators, 30's-style decor, and small rooms. The bathroom is very basic and not too different from a $40-a-night motel. The air-conditioner was noisy. We did not bother to order any food service. I paid about $120 per night from priceline in mid-June. What you are paying for it is its location, which is unbeatable. Close to the Commons, Theater district, restaurants, and shopping areas. The subway station is also nearby and only one block away. Try to avoid the more expensive valet and park your car at the nearby public garage ($16 per day). Overall, I would say go for it if location is important to you. Otherwise avoid it if you can find hotels with better quality.

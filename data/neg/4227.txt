On a business trip I stayed at this hotel. Admittedly I thought I was staying at one of the better known hotels in the area. Note that I am a business traveller coming to Boston from Europe and I am on the road over 200 days a year so my experience base is pretty rich. This is the worse value for money I have experiences. I paid $326 per night. Lobby was very trendy as would be expected from a recently renovated hotel.....but nobody was there to check me in (and by the way nobody was there to check me out the next day either). Room was okay (not execeptional which this price would justify) but I had to turn sideways to get into the bathroom shower!!! I would expect this in Europe but not the US. As an overseas traveller I woke at 4 am and wanted to order coffee but guess what room service only works from 6h30 to 23h00. Once I did get my small pot of coffee with a glass of low fat milk it was $20!!!! Are you kidding me!!! In short what happens when you try to be and think you are trendy but are just an overpriced badly managed hotel???????? hopefully you do not get guests.

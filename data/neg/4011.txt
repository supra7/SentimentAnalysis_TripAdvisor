The staff were indifferent, the room was quite dirty and poorly maintained. (broken window shades, broken internet cable, rattling AC vent), the dining room food was drastically over-priced even for a hotel and barely edible. Asking for 2 extra towels was beyond their capabilitythree phone calls and I gave up.

Just been talking to hotels.com following overbooking for first night. To recap Byzantium had overbooked first night and put us in really awful hotel. Terrible experience. Yes they paid for this crap hotel. Yes the paid for taxis. And now hotels.com have offered us a refund on the first night. Now I read some of the other experiences and it is clear that BYZANTIUM HAVE AN OVERBOOKING POLICY. Do they not get it that overbooking is not at all acceptable !!! We had already paid a long time before we got there. Who is going to compensate for the loss of 1 day of our time in Istanbul ? My abiding memory of this hotel is my parents, my kids and my wife getting our luggage out of the taxi and the sight of Ozgur's sidekick waving his arms around hysterically saying ' no room no room'. It was like an episode of Faulty Towers. Avoid this hotel like the plague...

My husband and I were excited to stay at this resort after reading the reviews here and two other travel sites. We found a great rate at Hotels.com. We booked a 3 bdrm poolside house for 4 nights. The actual house was great - four flat screens, two private patios, full kitchen, and lots of room. The other aspect of Parrot Key we liked were the four pools on property. They're small but the greenery surrounding them is pretty and they were clean. The aspects we were sorely disappointed with were the location, service and amenities. If you go beware that the resort is located about 2 miles from Merrion Square and 1.5 miles from the heart of Duval Street. Cabs for two people were about $10 each way to Duval. We ended up renting bikes for the entire four days which was a good way to get around. The biggest downside to taking cabs or riding bikes back and forth was that we couldn't go back to our room during the day or evening to clean up and change. We ended up staying downtown and hanging out at bars or eating dinner in the clothes we'd been wearing all day - lots of times that meant a bathing suit underneath clothes. We checked in on a Thurs night, our room was not made up on Fri, on Sat it was, on Sun they cleared the dirty towels and empty toiletries but didn't replace them. We called the front desk multiple times but never got an answer. Of the four days we asked for beach towels at the bar, they weren't availabe three of them. Also, the tiki bar is open from 11-6 daily and the restaurant from 11-5. Unfortunately the only restaurant within walking distance of the resort is TGI Friday's. Hence the reason we ended up staying downtown and eating in our bathing suits most nights! All in all we were sorely disappointed with Parrot Key. I'd only recommend this place to people who have a car and large family needing lots of room.

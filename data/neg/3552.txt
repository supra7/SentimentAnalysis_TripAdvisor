This is the worst hotel I've stayed ever! A disgrace to the Radisson Hotel Chain, the room was filthy and smelled terrible. I was afraid to let my child walk barefoot on the carpet, spots everywhere, yuck! Same goes for the pool; and cannot comment on the breakfast because I would not eat there for a million dollars. To be sincere, the only good thing there is the front desk manager (Don) who acts very professional and deserves to work at a better place.

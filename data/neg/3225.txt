I travelled with my husband and a 5 year old son and the hotel gave us a 3 bed room but the position of the bed is soooo weird. one of the bed is located in small place separated with the other 2 beds. the bath room is also sooo small and the tile is kinda slippery. the air con is installed right in front of the bed so you can feel blowing wind direct to your head. we actually booked for 3 nights but we cancelled and move furama which is better located and we got upgraded room from them.

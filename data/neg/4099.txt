If you're looking for an old, outdated and unclean hotel property and you're willing to spend $200+ night, this is the place. The customer service was average at best, the rooms (original room we were given had a shower with cracked and moldy (and I mean MOLDY) tiles, the smoke detector was falling off the ceiling, and the AC was terrible. For a landmark historic hotel, I was very disappointed to find that it in such poor condition. I would strongly recommend seeking other hotels in the same area. Buyer beware.

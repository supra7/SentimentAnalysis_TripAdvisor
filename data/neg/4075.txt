I stayed in this hotel for a scientific conference. It was a horrible experience. Our room cost $220 a night, but had only a single queen size bed. Of the three room lights, only two worked, making it difficult to read/work at night. The light in the closet was broken (perhaps to hide the peeling paint on the ceiling) so it was difficult to find anything in there. The bathroom did not appear to have any sort of ventilation, and taking a shower made the entire room excessively warm and damp. Our door was very sticky and required a ridiculous amount of effort to open and close. Even a maintenance man struggled to open it. Internet access cost $10 and our room's cable was broken, so we were unable to access the internet (and it took several calls/discussions to get the internet charge removed from our bill, I'm still not certain that we were successful). Despite directions, housekeeping took old towels and replaced them with new ones (but not enough, so each day we were required to hunt down housekeeping and get an additional towel). The hot and cold water in the shower was poorly regulated and went from cold to hot at random. Also, when booking the room, we asked to have a cot placed in the room. This required three telephone calls and two visits to the concierge before we finally received a cot (which was oddly short). Though we made an honest effort to be friendly, nearly all of our interactions with staff were negative and they all seemed really offended that we were bothering them. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone. The only good thing that I can say about this hotel is that they have lovely flower arrangements in the lobby.

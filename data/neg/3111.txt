We booked our room on line. When we checked in the lady helping us was friendly but kept talking to the other people she was working around. She had asked me to fill out our contact info and then kept asking me the same information instead of reading the paper in front of her. We finally got up to our room and it smelled like body odor. We actually had to go buy a candle to help cover up the odor. The soap dispenser in the room was completely empty and there was no other hand soap in the room. The first night we were down there we called the front desk for extra pillows and were told it may take up to an hour for her to even check to see if the had any and we never got any type of response back. When we went down to breakfast the next morning they were out of everything but dry cereal yet they had no spoons to eat it with and they even had a tip jar in the lobby. This was the worst hotel I have stayed at and I would not reccomend it to anyone. We paid $125 to stay here for 2 nights and I felt it was worth about half that. It seemed the only person doing their job here was the cleaning service. Even when we checked out we weren't asked how anything was and nothing was said to us besides asking for our room number we had to guess when he was done with the checkout. Don't waste your money here there are better hotels in the area.

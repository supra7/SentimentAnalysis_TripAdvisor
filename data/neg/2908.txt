This hotel is defenitely overpriced at +200 euros a night! It is very noisy: the room windows do not have sufficient glazing to keep out street noise and the rooms have very thin walls. This hotel had several bachelorparties which caused a lot of noise as well. When asked to get another room or at least free earplugs, hotelstaff refused to give the plugs that they themselves sell in their shop. Hotel was fully booked, so relocation was impossible. This hotel is part of the Hilton group, but doesn't meet Hilton standards. The bathroom was very small, no bath and the blankets were uncomfortable as well. I have stayed at the Montreal Sheraton prior to this stay, and have slept better and more quiet there, for a lower rate. Pluspoint: free wifi

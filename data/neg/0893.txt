The building smelled like cigarettes despite being a non-smoking hotel. Our room smelled pungently like bleach. I had to take my comforter down to get a replacement because it had large stains on it. The mattress was exposed, old, and filthy. The shower alternated between very hot and very cold water. We could hear everything going on in the halls. I did not feel comfortable at all in this hotel and was glad to get out.

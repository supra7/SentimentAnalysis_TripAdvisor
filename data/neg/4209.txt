Booked through Expedia, no one no where warned us about their "European Economy Class". We've stayed at both Ritz Carlton's, Boston in the past as well as four or five other hotels; and we've booked through Expedia before for rooms at Le Meridien and at the Lenox, and were never treated like this before. Accomadtions is a joke; service at check-in or the Front Desk is ridiculous and borderline rude. It's a dieing Hotel and some people there already know it. STAY AWAY. I'll pay 179/189 a night, and would certainly pay 225/375 too but I'll never step foot in that place again.Go across the street; the Four Seasons has an excellant bar!

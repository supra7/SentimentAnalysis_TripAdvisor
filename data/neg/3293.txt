The rooms are large, but this is an overpriced and noisy resort. We stayed for one night prior to departing Orlando. As we were not staying for at least three nights, they slapped on an extra $40 cleaning fee. Thus, we ended up paying over $200 US for a single night stay. Most importantly, the resort is located beside the 417 highway (to the airport). If you can't sleep through highway traffic, you won't get any sleep here. Not recommended.

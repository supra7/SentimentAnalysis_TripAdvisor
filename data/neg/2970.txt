Come from Italy with another couple for the weekend. Checked in in rooms at 9th floor and in both rooms air conditioning not working. Changed room and the first is too small and very noisy (1421) and we found the other one DIRTY (1417). Jazz company playad music with a speaker left in the road at a loud level (I coud recognize every single song from my room while trying to fall asleep). Forget to stay here, this is not a 5 star hotel, 15 euros for breakfast without the possibility of drinking a proper expresso. Don't waste your money

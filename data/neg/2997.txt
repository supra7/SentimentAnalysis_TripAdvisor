When you reserve online through lonelyplanet/hostelworld webpage to stay on Hotel Domus Preatoria, you only discover you have booked on Hotel Dama when you print your receipt. We assumed both hotels to be the same because they have the same address, they omit their floors- one is in the ground floor and the other in the 1st floor (or second floor, I cant recall). Dama Hotel doesn`t even have a proper reception place. We refused to stay in the place we did not book and we were charged the same way, for we did not give the 24 hours advance cancelling - how could we?! We only discovered the mistake when arriving there. Online customers need to be better protected! They cannot mislead from one hotel to the other. Both Hotels don`t seem to take any action to stop this confusion, for they are profitting with it. CAUTION, be sure of your booking, be sure the HOTELS appear with the same name when printing your reservation!

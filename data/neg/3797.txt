stayed there for 3 nights with my wife.this hotel has been already booked for us by the company which held a congress in constantinople so we did not had the chance of choosing another hotel which definatelly would not be this one or any other titanic hotel. check-in was let's say o.k., room was bit small but was in general well equiped. it was rather cold because the room temperature did not rise enough through the central heating system so the individual heating control panel was practically not much...to control.in the bathroom the in-ceiling light was always falling and we had everyday to call the maintenance for repairing it-apparently not in a good way and always they made a lot of time to come.room service was poor and one afternoon while we were sleeping they came to pick up the tray even though we had the do not disturb sign on.the staff did not speak good english and mnost of the times communication was very difficult plus they were rude most of the times.one day when we returned from sightseeing i noticed that the room was over-smelling of my cologne-aparently the housekeeping liked it a lot and most probably used it ...a lot!there was coffee making facilities but not even once were replaced,the bed was not bad but not great either, the pillows cheap feeling and the covers too. the bed linen of cheap quality.soundproof was so-so.the towels were old and worn out and bathroom amenities of the worst (turkish...)quality.first morning in breakfast even though we booked the room including breakfast they said it was not included and we had at least 30 min. to solved it out , the reasons due to bad english from them, bad booking system of the hotel, rude and unhelpful staff.breakfast was very turkish in taste, quality and variety so not much left to be desired.we had to wave our hand or wait at least 20 min. before coffee to be served of course with no smiles or at least an apology.the spa was extremely expensive for massages for such a hotel.the whirlpool's water was somewhat dirty and the pool's temperature was colder than it should be so we did not swim at all.everywhere there were used towels thrown on the floors etc. general appearance of the lobby- restaurants-bars was o.k. with a fake feeling of luxury.they had a ...fake security booth as you entering the hotel the one that they are using in the airports-definatelly this was simply for decoration! if i ever stay in this hotel again?certainly not and definatelly i will never use titanic chain of hotels again.

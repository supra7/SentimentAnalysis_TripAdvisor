The staff at the counter couldn't communicate in English. That's acceptable when visiting another country, but not when we are here in the States! They grossly overcalculated our bill which took a lengthy amount of time to settle. The beds are not comfortable. The location is good, but there are so many other hotels to stay at in Seattle. I should have just taken a cab home.

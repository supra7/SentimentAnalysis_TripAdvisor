First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business. for the price, it's OK, nothing more. Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls. We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room. Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far. Really abusive. So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice. Phone - don't go near it.

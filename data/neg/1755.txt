My husband and I stayed in Oahu for 6 nights and had a great time. Once we arrived to Kaanapali Beach Hotel, we were told that we were not registered at hotel. We prepaid for 5 nights in our package. After a delay of about 20 minutes, front desk clerk found our reservation under someone elses name. Front lobby has not been renovated since 1960 and looked extremely cheesy. Room decor was outdated. We got two full size uncomfortable beds instead of Queen bed. We asked about Queen bed, but were told that we would have to change rooms the next day which we did not want to do. Room had urine smell for full stay. Aloha special cost us same as a garden view room because our room price dropped a week before our vacation. With Aloha special, breakfast is not included w/ room. However, w/ garden room breakfast is included. Bathroom had a 1/2 shower and did not seem very clean. Safe was already in room, but they charge $1.50/ day. Parking is $9.00/day. This hotel even has the nerve to charge $25-$45 per plate for dinner. I could not believe that this hotel was rated as a three star hotel. Despite all the above issues, we had a nice time in Maui. Kannapali Beach is beautiful and Maui is a great island. I would recommend spending more money for a better hotel.

We enjoyed the lovely big room which had almost no street noise, however, our room had a door to an adjoining room with a 2-3 inch gap under it. Our neighbors for two nights seemed to be having a major party,starting at 2:00 AM. The first night, we did not call security, as things quieted down after 1/2 hour. The second night we called security,which led to toning down of the noise for 20 minutes, but had to call again before people who were obviously totally drunk(or worse) left. The hotel stole our thunder the next morning by calling us to say that $50.00 would be taken off our bill--not really enough to compensate for two nights of disturbed sleep . We wondered whether security was really on top of things. Breakfast was a problem as there seemed to be many tours using the one facility, which had a long waiting time. The hostess told us that the restaurant was not owned by the hotel. We did have a lovely, peaceful breakfast around the corner at the Hilton.

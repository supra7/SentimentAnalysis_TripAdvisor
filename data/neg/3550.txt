I stayed at this hotel for a long business trip. First I will say that the staff was very friendly. I was picked up at DFW in a reasonable time and check in went smooth. The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable, but that was about it. The property is in need of an update. The building is a drab brown color and the hallway floor outside of my room was very dirty as the carpet had not been cleaned in some time and was beginning to pull up. The ice machines did not work on at least 3 of the floors. The outdoor pool was a mess. There was some sand in the pool from the construction on the property. Their way of cleaning the sand was taking a squeegee and sweeping down the pool stairs to the bottom of the pool and leaving it there. I am not kidding as I watched this from my room. Most of the pool chairs were broken and several tiles from inside of the pool were missing. All in all, I would not be back to this property. There are so many more places to stay in Dallas, why spend your money here.

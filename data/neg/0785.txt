I traveled to Seattle with a group of friends to take a cruise to Alaska, leaving out of Seattle. We stayed at the Westin property prior to our departure and I was very disappointed. I am a frequent business traveler and found the accommodations to be sub par to many "business type hotel/motel accommodations" - not what I expected. I found the hotel dingy, old, the pool was not clean (foamy water), the two work out areas very awkward in layout, etc. My prior experiences with Westin properties was quite different. All of this paled to the second night experience when we found a bed bug or tick crawling across our "heavenly bed" - this was the final straw and put a significan damper on the entire trip. The hotel staff was polite and formal, but I truly felt that they either were too concerned with maintaining the "corporate posture" or simply did not understand how disturbing that incident was to us as a hotel guest. I will not stay at Westin properties for a very long time and am still awaiting the report from the entomologist or exterminator!

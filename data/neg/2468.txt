Travelodge's strapline is "Everything you need and nothing you don't". Well, judging by the uncomfortable beds, drafty windows, and worst of all the lack of soundproofing, this hotel doesn't class sleep as something its customers need! Myself and three friends stayed in a family room. Both the double bed and the pull-out third bed were damnably uncomfortable, the pillows were so thin as to be useless, and there was a dreadful draft coming from the window. Not to mention, the sofa and pull-out bed were both stained, as was the floor, and breakfast is definitely not worth the extra charge! But, worse than that, the noise from the traffic outside was so loud you'd have thought the window was wide open, and the noise from the corridor and adjoining rooms was even louder. None of us slept much during out entire stay thanks to a combination of neighbours returning from a night clubbing in the early hours, the uncomfortable beds and the constant traffic noise. The TripAdvisor description of "no frills" is an understatement at best! Worth staying in ONLY if you can't afford anything better.

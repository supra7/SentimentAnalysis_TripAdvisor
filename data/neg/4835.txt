If you're expecting a Hilton go somewhere else. Try the Wyndham ocean walk next door. This place is filthy, rooms are tiny, no fridge unless you pay a hidden fee. Free wifi but the signal comes and goes and is usually too weak to use. Try somewhere else. I wouldn't come back. Also the balcony is more of a glorified window ledge. No screen either do of the door is open the bugs are coming in.

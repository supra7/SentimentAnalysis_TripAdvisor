I can't count the number of times I heard the phrase "Its our policy." as thought that was a sufficient explaination for overcharging, mischarging or providing rude service. It seems it is their policy to have housekeeping knock on you door at 7:30am on Saturday, and at 15 minute intervals until sleep is no longer possible. There were no "do not distrub" door hangers, and a handmade one was ignored. It is their policy to charge $6 for a 12 second wrong-number that their system misdirected to an out-of-state site. It is their policy to charge their guest for a minimum of $25 for a full day of parking while non-guests who use the parking structure for 8 hours can pay only $10. When I complained about the parking fee, the first response of the duty manager was an attemp to intimidate by telling me that they had my license number and could find my room number, and that I was under video surveillance . (The use of video surveillance on the property is not disclosed as required by courtesy and law.) The implication was that they would charge my credit card without my consent, an act of fraud. In this instance, after an unpleasnt exchange with the Duty Manager she allowed me to pay the hourly rate, but offered no apology for the attempt to overcharge. It is no fun to stay at a place where corporate convienience and self-serving policy take precedence over hospitality. I do not intend to do so again

Where to even begin...ripped curtains held together by staples. The curtains covered a giant black mould stain on the wall. The laminate flooring had incomplete gaps. The floor wasn't swept at any point in our 5 days there. Overt and plentiful water damage to the ceiling. The tea/coffee cups provided were filthy. The bathroom was disgusting with rust spots all over anything metal. The shower stall had black mould and rust all over it. There was mystery hair all over the floor and wall behind the door of the bathroom (where clearly they never clean). The staff working the front desk often told me to come back when another (apparently more helpful) staff member was there. Upon request of an extra pillow, I was given a clearly dirty one. The "breakfast" dishes were often dirty...i had to pick and choose which plate and cup I would end up using because so many weren't clean. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom floor. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk, they said that someone would be around the following day to have a look at it. It was a problem for our entire stay. My wife coughed the entire time that we were in our room, so as you can imagine we spent as little time as possible there. I'm assuming it was the mould that she was reacting to.

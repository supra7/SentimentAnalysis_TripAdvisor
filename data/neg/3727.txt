I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world and consider this to be one fo the worst of all time. When we arrived one elevator wasn;t working so we had to lug suitcases up 11 (ELEVEN !!) flights of stairs. The rooms were sparce, not cleaned properly (nor were they on each consecutive morning), the staff we not so bad on reception and the location adjacent to China town were the only lus points. The beds and bedding were uncomfortable, no facilities for food or drink within the hotel - only a supermarket built in downstairs. Very disappointing.

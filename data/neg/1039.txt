The Solo room I stayed in had only a window heating unit which was incredibly LOUD...the room was SO COLD I woke up several times in the night so I could warm up the room with the noisy heater and sleep again. The bed is 1 inch from the window heating system, I could feel the wind coming through the window. I travel extensively & I have never been so uncomfortable in a hotel, EVER. I cut my stay short and checked into the 6th Ave Motel (nice warm rooms) only one block away, for half the price. It was very disappointing and I won't stay again, despite the offers from the Manager. Additionally, the hotel charges premium rates for it's rooms, you should offer FREE Wi-Fi. The bed in this room was half collapsed on one side, very uncomfortable to sleep. I lived in Seattle for 15 years & I remember this used to be the old Vance hotel.... and that hotel was full of hookers and drug addicts in the 80's.... I think those 'vibes' are still in the hotel. You are falling short of the marketing pitches. Nice art work and slick interior design does not make up for a bad nights sleep... very disappointing.

We were badly bitten by bedbugs between Jan 2 and Jan 4. We wrote to warn IC to fumigate room 1208 but received no response. We were not planning legal action, though we have all evidence from our treatment at Northwestern Hospital upon our return to Chicago, but just wanted an acknowledgement that they would do something about the issue. All that aside, I prefer the Hilton in that part of Dallas.

My wife and I had planned this valentine 22 year wedding anniversary night for some time, we had made all the arrangement's for a great dinner, room, romance ect. The room was Awsome with the Space Needle so close and perfect pictures! Without getting in to details we were starting our evening and heard something outside the door. A CREEPY OLD MAN LEANING AGAINST THE DOOR LISTENING!!! this is a $300 a night room no a motel? we called down to the front desk and they said they would contact security ASAP. We heard the 2 way radio directly outside the door. THIS WAS THE SECURITY!!. needles to say we did not sleep the rest of the night. The Manager listen to my issues, did not offer any support however he would look into it. We waited now over a month and still no call regarding this issue so it is important that people know of this. IT OBVIOUSLY WAS BRUSHED UNDER THE RUG. BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE STAYING HERE. The next day we seen this guy again helping with peoples cars in the garage and he just stopped and looked at us like we did something wrong????????? .

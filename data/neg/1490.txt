Good location, but wont be going back there again The location was superb as far as I have. MTR is near by, less than 2mins walk, food is abundant even at night. But expect nothing more than that1) Internet is available/ They have no wireless and go through wired. But they do not have LAN wire!2) The room looks big in the photo, but very deceiving. For those who have stayed in a hostel, right beside the door, it is the bed, and there is less than a 2 AO sized of walking space. 3) Bed is real hard, and no amenities. Very hostel, bunk room feel.4) Room service did not clear up in proper5) Hotel service , u can take it as none. No bell boys, single lift that takes forever, and slow check in and check outWhat is worst? When we decided to take in all these bad points, and decided to go back there in Jan 08, we were being charged of HKD1000 despite what the rates published in the website!(We had it for HKD600)Bad, and will never recommend anyone to stay there.

I chose this hotel because of the low medical rate. I am working in the area and will be for some time. The cleanliness still needs to be worked on. The carpets are older and need vacummed. I have called on several occasions to try and get a room. Many times, even after 8PM, they put you on hold forever. Once I was put on hold for several minutes (long distance) and then told that they would take my number and call me back. They never did. There needs to be management in place to check the cleanliness of the rooms from a customer vantage point, and someone there to show the help what customer service should be like. Really needs major cleanup and change.

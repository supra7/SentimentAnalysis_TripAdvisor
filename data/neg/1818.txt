We stayed for a couple of nights. The room we got faces another building. We are on the third floor and the other building's window is right outside of our window. The other building also blocks the sun. If you ever lived in a room with windows facing a tall wall right next to you, you would understand the feeling of imprisonment. For the time we stayed, we had such sensation of being suffocated. We later changed to a hotel with a window that looks out to the street, with the sea in the far background. When we stand in that balcony, we felt we are finally free! There is nothing wrong with this hotel, but if you get this kind of rooms (which I suspect about half are in this condition), it is very very bad. The second hotel we stayed has larger room and with a view, AND it is about 60% of the price. So value wise, this won't be my choice for sure. There's far better hotels in Istanbul.

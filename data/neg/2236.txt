Read between the lines..... Now I know 2 is a little harsh considering we didn't actually stay the night but...(2 rather than 1 due to friendly staff)I booked this room based on the rating here and on the appearance of their web site. A few alarms bells should have rang, as the room is $60 sing which is very cheap for Singapore. Also the email stated cash only. The taxi driver at Changi looked perplexed when we asked for the hotel, Have you stayed here before?, The Cameron he confirmed, and drove with a grin. The hotel is historic and stays true to this with its appearance. Now the check in counter was very friendly but as we were checking in the stares from the cleaners kinda indicated a few things. (a Western tourist straight from the airport isn't the everyday clientele I imagine). The room could be described as a cupboard with the bed on a concrete enclave and we were a little surprised. The cleaners where cleaning all the rooms nearby (which was weird at 9pm), we also saw many couples checking out at 9pm. The pillows on the bed in the room were all love heart shaped. Now can you read between the lines?The front office man whom I said was very friendly was kinda waiting for us to ask for a refund. He did so no questions asked and we got in a taxi and headed for the Crowne Plaza at the airport for a little splurge. The taxi driver back to the Crowne laughed/grinned when we said the Cameron was no good.

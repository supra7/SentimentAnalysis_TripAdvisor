The first thing I noticed about the Quality Inn at Seatac Airport was that the door from the outside of the building to the first floor hallway was wide open, allowing anyone from the street and MANY mosquitoes to enter at will. When I tried to shower in the morning, I had no hot water. When I went to turn off the air conditioning unit, I found a half-smoked marijuana joint sticking out of the vents. I called the front desk to inform them about the lack of hot water and to ask that someone come down and remove their previos guest's drugs from my air conditioner. When I got back to the room that night, I had been locked out and was met at the door by the desk clerk and a note from the hotel manager. Apparently because I had the nerve to complain about no hot water and DRUGS left in my room, I had to leave the hotel immediately or the police would be called and I would be charged with trespassing. Enjoy your stay, just make sure you like mosquitoes and don't DARE complain unless you want to face possible arrest.

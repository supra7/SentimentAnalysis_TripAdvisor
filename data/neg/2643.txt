we also felt duped by seth sherwood's "save or splurge: istanbul" article in the NY times (august 2009). kupeli was just another blah hotel with no character. granted, the rooms were clean, and the flat screen TV was kind of cool, but when in istanbul, i had no plans to spend my time in the hotel room, watching TV. service was OK. there was nobody in the breakfast area to help with the food, and when the internet wasn't working, the front desk staff was of no use. we paid 65 euro/night for three nights, and we ultimately moved to a different hotel (the side) which charged less (50 euro/night) and was closer to the sites in sultanahmet such as the blue mosque.

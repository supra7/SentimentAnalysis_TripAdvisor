A very disappointing night at Hotel Andra last night. I've just returned home from a six week trip to Europe, and selected the hotel after staying in a SLH property in Estonia (superb.) The room was dingy, with a stained carpet, worn furniture, tatty bathroom, grubby bed cover and cushion, and hair on the unironed sheets. Not having free wifi in the room is completely unacceptable. I found the numerous items for sale in the room tiresome, not least the bottled oxygen on the bathroom shelf with a toothpaste stained card announcing I'd be charged if the wrapping was damaged. The sink and toilet are very low, and the bath tub is old and needs refinishing. The outlet drain is placed too low to allow a deep soak. Chipped paint, peeling air vent and water stains on the wall complete the picture. The location is hard to beat, and the lobby attractive. We've eaten at Lola's many times and always enjoy it.

This Marriott is typical of other large Marriott hotels that cater to large conventions and leisure travelers. If you are traveling for these purposes, the hotel is a good choice. It is similar to the Marriott Biscayne Bay in Miami and the Marriott San Diego Marina. For the business traveler, however, the location is good, but there are some downsides: The rooms are very outdated and in need of an update. They have flat screens, but no digital cable or HD. Gold/Platinum Elite members are not treated very well. For example, I was put in an abysmal room that was small, low floor, no view, and substandard. When I complained, I got attitude from the front desk and had to persist to get a decent room. Concierge level is not any better than any other floor. In general, the "standard" rooms are very small.

We stayed here with friends that own a timeshare . We did not opt for the all inclusive package .Three out of 4 of us are in the hospitality and convention business, one is a chef. We have worked in the NY area, and know food cost and quality, so we quickly figured out that what they were charging for AI is outrageous.We had stayed previously in PDC at hotels where the food was much better and reasonably priced. Members of our party were also treated rudely by staff on on more than one occasion. Be careful and keep your receipts as there were charges we were not told about, and nothing is in writing. Check your cc receipts on your return.If we did business like this in the US, the BBB and the AGs offices would be notified. Would not recommend this resort -getting nickel and dimed to death feels like work -BTW we said NO to the time share presentation .Overall, felt there was deception, especially from front desk staff and MGMT. Most of the services staff very friendly-and should note here-we tipped well when we asked for anything even though we did not use the dining /liquor services and sampled the food at a welcome party for time share owners. If your wrist band comes off - they will charge you $100 US. No one told us this up front and it is not posted anywhere in writing. There are better beaches, better dining at so many resorts in PDC to recommend this resort to anyone.

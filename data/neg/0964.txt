Very dirty, from the carpet to the bed. If you are a very tired traveller who just need a bed to sleep in to make it through the night without bothering to shower at all, this is your place. The tub was falling apart, I have to buy shower slippers before I had the courage to step on it. The bathroom floor feels sticky, the carpet feels mucky. Good luck too trying to reach the front desk for anything! And they don't have internet access from the room as advertised! They have wi-fi connection only if you're at the lobby. As I've said, don't come here unless you badly needed a roof on top of your head.

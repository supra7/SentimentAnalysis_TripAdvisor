I stayed in this hotel in October 2010. What a mistake. First off, the surrounding neighborhood is VERY sketchy. The GPS on my Droid phone brought me through some kind of low-income housing project which just about borders this hotel. I'm a retired police officer (having tangled with some pretty bad dudes in my day) and currently run a large security contract for the US Government and I did not feel safe whatsoever in the immediate area of this hotel. Some of the undesireables that live in this area cut through the parking lot and then through a small park that borders the hotel on one side. A few of them "eyed" me as I walked through the parking lot. I took every valuable I had in the car and kept it in my room at night, or with me during the day in the car. In fact, I'm surprised the car was even there in the morning. The particular second floor room that I was in had cigarette burns on the curtains. Overall, the entire hotel looked like it had not been updated in about 15 years. Even the lobby area was dark, dingy, and uninviting. Not only did I skip breakfast, but I cut my stay short by a day and got the heck out of there. You get what you pay for. Spend a little extra money and don't go anywhere remotely near this area or neighborhood of Dallas.

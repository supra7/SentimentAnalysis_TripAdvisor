This hotel claims to be in the center of Rome, and that was not the case. When we arrived, the room was hot and uncomfortable and they would not turn up the AC and there was not way for us to do so ourselves. We had to open the doors to the balcony which we had to force because they were stuck rubbing on the floor from being too long. They could not activate two card keys to our room so that we could both have our own keys. They would fix one and the other would stop working. Breakfast was nothing more than mediocre. And they had the nerve to charge for a coffee refill. There was no privacy and it appeared that our coming and going was "monitored" and we felt like we were staying at our grandmother's place. I would avoid this hotel. We actually wanted to leave and they held us to our room rate for the entire stay. Very unprofessional.

We stayed at the Ocean Front Hilton in Daytona Beach over the first weekend in August and we were disappointed with a number of issues we had during our stay. First off when we arrived we were early but we expected to drop our bags and walk around the area and have some lunch. The front desk, and valets couldn't handle the volume of people checking in. Cars were parked in the street just waiting to get to the valets, and the bell hops stacked everyone's luggage into a corner of the lobby which didn't seem too safe to us. We were told the front desk would call us when our room was ready, but after eating lunch and walking around for hours with no call from the Hilton we decided to check with them, and were told our room was ready for some time. We then got stuck in an evelator, and later we noticed a different elevator was broken. Later that evening at midnight there was a fight on the boardwalk below, which happened to be 10 floors below, but it sounded like it was right outside our window. We were so uncomfortable that we checked out early the next morning even though we had prepaid for the entire weekend. On a positive note the hotel has a number of different dining options, and an attached area with a half dozen other restaurants, shopping, amusement parks, and a movie theater.The pools were beautiful, but too small to handle the amount of guests that can stay at the hotel. If you're looking for a quiet relaxing get away this isn't the place.

This hotel is the same model as other recent Springhill suites, with the same light green colors and split room feature. Unfortunately this hotel has not kept up with the cleaning; everything is a little grimy. I did a bedbug check when I got to the room today, and noticed many stains, dirt, etc. There are a lot of stains on the upholstered area at the headboard, on the carpets, and walls. I don't see any bedbugs but it makes you wonder how good of a sign it is if they don't clean well. Too bad, because this could be a really nice Springhill Suites like the Houston Intercontinental Airport one- super clean.

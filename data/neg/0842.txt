I've stayed at this hotel many times....simply because of my Starwood status and the relative location of the hotel to business I have in the city. Here is what I will say: -Twice I have arrived to find they have no rooms available and I have been sent to alternative hotels -The elevators are extremely slow -The staff can be very unhelpful and the service is very poor -Not always is your reservation as you request (I have been quoted different rates during check-in than my reservation shows -- make sure you have your confirmation with you!!) -The location is great -The room service is pretty good -The rooms vary, but in general are nice, clean and many have fantastic views I now choose to stay at the W Hotel and prefer to book my rooms early to get a similar rate. Even the Sheraton next door has better service. That said, I have had good experiences at the Westin, but it seems to be hit or miss. A manager there once told me they are understaffed (the same manager that promised me 7500 Starwood points for not having a room and those points never appeared).

I would give this Fairfield Inn a "1" rating but the 'check in" guys were so helpful and friendly, I felt they made this place bearable. Part of the issue with this Inn is the approach to it is through what appears to be an abandoned parking lot...driving through this parking lot gives you and uneasy feeling, and you are approaching the back of the hotel (this also doesn't help). The welcome area and breakfast area in the front seemed nice enough, however the halls are dark and unwelcoming (adds to the creepy feeling)...our room was dark and there must have been a 1/2 inch of dirt under the A/C unit which made us really question how clean the rest of the room was...we couldn't sleep well because we was generally concerned about someone breaking into my car (we carried in everything visible in the car, but since we were traveling across country the trunk was full) To be fair, none the hotels on this particular exit look very appealing...the next morning we realized we had stayed in the Drury Inn on this same exit (other side of the freeway), which was a poor experience as well. Perhaps this is just a bad area overall.

This hotel was booked through work so it was forced upon me. On arriving reception was clean and girl behind reception was friendly enough. i was given a room on the top floor (61 steps up and lift out of order). On opening the door to my room I was greeted with a overwelming stench of stale mould. The room itself was very basic, one cupboard, drawers, a chair and a double bed. On the drawers were a tv with a broken ariel and a heavily limescaled kettle. The bed consisted of a springy mattress and a duvet with a massively oversized cover. The floor was laminated (wipe clean)and the curtains were torn and stained. The bathroom was tiny and was the source of the stench. Breakfast. I've read a few of the previous review commenting that the breakfast was ok or acceptable. I'm sorry , but a pile of cheapest wafer thin ham, a pile of cheese slices, a pile of value bread (you can see the dozens of loaves stacked in the cabinet fridges behind the bar), nasty faux cornflakes etc.etc ....it's just not good enough. Overall i didn't enjoy staying there but no doubt i'll end up there again due to my employers hotel policy, and i gave it 2 out of 5 only because i've stayed in worse in London

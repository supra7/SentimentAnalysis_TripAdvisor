This place is absolutely disgusting. We booked it for a week and ended up checking out the second day. The list of wrongs is a long one: the rooms had black mold growing in them (law suit waiting to happen), the units had terrible smells as well. The pool makes the YMCA look like the Four Seasons and not to mention there was a dead and decomposing rat on the pool deck. The staff had not cleaned the grounds in ages it seems and the person that helped us with our bags actually threw an empty bottle of shampoo onto the ground and drove away. Please, do not book your stay here, they cost us a whole day of our vacation because we called every hotel on the island practically to get another room. It is dreadful!!!!!

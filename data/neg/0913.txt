The fleas wouldn't stay here. I should get paid to stay here! Elevator broken. 24 hour coffee was 30 weight motor oil! Breakfast was coffee and mintire muffins. The travelodge down the street serves a prio breakfast. The guest from this place were all over there. If I had not paid up front for this room I would of moved. What a way to celebrate a birthday.

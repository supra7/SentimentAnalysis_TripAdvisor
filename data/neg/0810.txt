I booked this hotel over the phone and one week later, I received a cancellation notice without my approval for the reservation. When I inquired with the hotel, the receptionist told me that their computers were down but that she would re-reserve my room. She didn't seem too concerned though which led me to book another hotel altogether. An odd occurence but certainly important enough to mention. It would have been awful to arrive at the hotel only to learn that my reservation had been cancelled.

The guy at the desk had recently immigrated from India. Except him there were two other spanish speaking staff and they were the entire staff of that place. Somebody on our floor (guests) was smoking weed, and the smell was in the corridor. Despite what they said, there was no wi-fi internet in the lobby, and the guy lied to me about it point-blank. I requested to be moved to another room (because the window view was partly blocked by a wall) but was told there was absolutely no other room in the hotel. Few minutes later, the vacancy sign was up outside the hotel. The place is in that part of Seattle which is close to downtown but is decaying and being rebuilt. In general, do not make your booking from Hostelworld.com, their site is full of crappy places like this one. What annoyed me most about this place was the constant lying from the staff, as if I would never know the truth. A traumatizing experience.

My husband and I just got back from a weekend stay in Chicago this weekend. The location of The Avenue Hotel Crown Plaza is great; however, be advised if you have any intenion of getting sleep while you are visiting Chicago make sure you are not on the 38th floor of this hotel! The room we had was an adequate room but certainly not 4+ stars worthy. We were in room 3801 which was next to the three banks of elevators. All night long, for two nights, we were kept awake with the wind like sound every time the elevator went up and down. When I menationed it to the man at the front desk he said,"Oh that's too bad!" Also, make sure you contact the hotel prior to booking as the parking rate was $48 per night. We realize that we were parking in Chicago and that parking is a premium but it was an unexpected surprise at check in. We overheard other parties complaining about the parking fee as well so we were not the only guests feeling this way.

After a wonderful stay at Best Western West in Oslo (three star), we expected this proclamed four star hotel to be better. The hotel should drop a few stars. We entered the lobby and noticed five Russian men following a drunk woman who was barely able to walk. The staff acted like they didn't notice this. We needed Wifi to manage some business matters via Internet. That was one of the reasons why we selected Blue Square. However, we couldn't get access to our email. The staff explained they recently "upgraded" their provider and couldn't understand why our email access was blocked. They assured us it would be fixed...it never was during our stay. Our room was never made, linen was never changed, used towels were never replaced, and the list goes on. Even the coffee pot and shelves were covered with dust. When my wife called the lobby, she was told the maid cleaned the rooms every three days. When they sent a maid to deliver fresh towels, my wife inquired again why the room was not cleaned, the maid stated they were "very busy" and normally clean it every day. She did offer to clean the room. Since it was past 9pm, we declined. Couldn't get a good night's sleep. People were opening and closing doors loudly during the middle of the night. Breakfast was bland and average. Comparing it to the "three-star" Best Western West in Oslo, the breakfasts in West totally blew away this so-called four-star buffet. This place is definately not worth its price. We'll tell our friends they'll get a better deal at a hostel.

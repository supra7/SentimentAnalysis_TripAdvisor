Donald Trump, where are you? What are you thinking? You are putting your name on this? I'm embarrassed for you. This is not a 5 star, not a 4 star, maybe a 3 star. Rio Hotel is better than this mismanaged disappointment. Even the official website for this hotel is horrible. I don't have the time to list every single *GASP* moment on my stay here. I hated it. Hated it, hated it. Rooms were ugly, loud, lobby uninteresting, boring, cheap, ridiclous resort fee for your ugly community style pool, wifi wasn't free (even nasty Motel 6 has free wifi), staff was apathetic and ridiculously min-wage snobby. Your wife probably wouldn't stay here. NO,no, no. I will do whatever I can to spread the word not to stay here. Edit Remove Send To A Friend Link to this Review

Wow what a change-for the worse It saddens me to write this. I was one who back in 2004  2005 that raved about this hotel. There is nothing to rave about. I can not think of one positive thing to say. Obviously this managemnet team does not know what they are doing. Dumb- no business rooms, no printer for the compuer center, no sign of decent-consistant signal, they repalce the beds-but the capets are worn out, the furniture is beat up, and the drapes need cleaning. Ah so what they added Bath  Body, but you have the most worn out towls and face cloths, there is no restaraunt or lounge which I thought was a Red Lion no-no-(No roaring start breakfast here). Oh yes, this place puts in Tully's coffee. They can spend money on that but not on a place to eat. The outside locks that do not work half the time, and they have been promising for what ,1 year and six months that we are under new management with a new direction. The new management has suceeded. The hotel is in worse shape than it was 2 -3 years ago, and that mention of promises to improve is nothing but a farce. I will not stay here  my staff will not stay here. Red Lion Corporation is to be blamed for this-its all about the smoke and mirrors.

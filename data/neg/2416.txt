Simply Terrible to stick your hand behind a picture sitting on a ledge in the hotel and find 2 HYPODERMIC NEEDLES. Then after taking pictures i called and spoke with Joe the Manager, he wrote it off because he said probably insulin units.... My reply was are you kidding, what do junkies use and reuse!! They are very lucky that i had no young kids and the units had caps on the needle part. Joe made it up to our room and picked them up...NO GLOVES, weird? he than stated that the GM would be in on Sunday and they would call to discuss what could be done or simply an apology. NO ONE EVER CALLED!! When we went to check out Monday I asked for the General Manager and they said he would be up in 5 minutes, when he showed up he did not introduce himself nor offered any apology, he just stood there like I was some crazy person..... I was very cool but do need to let folks know that this hotel simply had an attitude of not caring and pointing fingers do not work with me when it comes to health and safety. As a General Manager he should have been rolling out the red carpet, they did give us some breakfast coupons of which on Monday we could not use because the kitchen closes at 10am and we got there at 9:58... The waffle bar was already cleaned up..... I guess if I did not have to wait for the GM we would have made breakfast.... O well, not going to change my lifestyle but could change yours.... It is not the fact that I found the needles, its was the poor and very unprofessional manner of handling it and being so lackadaisical about the safety of my family.... Very Disappointing, Very Unprofessional and a terrible way to handle a business especially a home away from home...... Jeff Perrin

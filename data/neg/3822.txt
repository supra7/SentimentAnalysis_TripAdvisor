I'm quite shocked at the inadequate service the Joule / Charlie Palmer restaraunt has. I went there for lunch to enjoy their advertised 'lobster corndogs'. I asked the maitre'd if it could be served at the pool and they said 'yes', but it would have to be ordered from the pool. My friend and I went to the 10th floor pool deck and ordered the corndogs along with 2 expensive drinks. After 30 minutes, we ordered 2 more expensive drinks. Finally, after 1 hr of waiting, we cancelled the order for the 'lobster corndogs' and left. We were told some lame excuse that they didn't know what was going on - 'normally they are so quick about delivering the food'. For a 4-star hotel, it has 1-star service. Absolutely ridiculous.

I was there for a meeting from Fri-Sun. I had bug bites from my stay, I paid for internet service and had to wait 2hrs for them to bring new cables because the ones in the room didn't work, and that isn't the worst of it. I went up to my room to get my credit card out of my purse and found that the room had been cleaned and my purse as well. My bank card was sticking half out of my purse, a few other cards were out of place and money was missing. I reported this to security who said they would "investigate" I had to cancel my bank card, credit cards, and checks. Over a week later I have not been compensated in any way....not even the money that was stolen. and they haven't even returned my calls. They refuse to provide me with a report of the incident and have not shown me that anything has been done. Do not leave anything in your rooms!

We arrived at Miami airport - phoned the hotel to find out where to pick up the shuttle We waited in the wind and the rain for AN HOUR ! finally got to the hotel -room OK but by now we were too late to eat in hotel restaurant - and we left too early for breakfast After a wonderful holiday in Aruba we were back - once again waiting over an hour for the shuttle Arrived at hotel -massive line to check in (airline crew) Room I had booked and paid for (King ) not available - got a room with 2 beds - TV not working Dinner - restaurant only had 3 people in it -but many guys at the bar watching the "game" on TV Gave our order -one soup - 2 red wines -a pizza to share After 30 mins - I asked -any food please ? told pizza will be ready soon "please could we have the soup and wine ? " 10 mins later we got the soup no wine We asked again for our drinks The waiter did not know where to find the wine !! had to get the lady doing the cooking to come out of the kitchen and pour it for us ! Our pizza finally arrived ONE HOUR after we ordered it ! Breakfast however next morning was fine ! If you want an hotel near the airport -I suggest you forget this one

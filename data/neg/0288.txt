The Moore Hotel gives you the option of staying in a great location in Seattle for not a lot of money. Other than that, there isn't much to say. The room was nicely sized but awkwardly laid out so you couldn't really use the space. The bathroom was really small and old. You get what you pay for, though, and this hotel is a clean and a good deal for budget travel in Seattle.

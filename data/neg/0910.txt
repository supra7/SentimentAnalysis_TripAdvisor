My boyfriend and I referred to this place as "our dump" after checking out. The man who took my reservation over the phone was rude, and short when I was asking questions. When we arrived to check in he was worse. I was disappointed when we got into our room, but it was to late. We had to ask for light bulbs for the desk lamp, and ashtrays. No ice, the machine was out of order, and the complementary breakfast was over at 9 am, which we missed. The worst part was that the housekeeper used so much bleach in the bathroom, that my skirt got bleached out when i leaned against the basin of the sink. plus the floor was slippery.

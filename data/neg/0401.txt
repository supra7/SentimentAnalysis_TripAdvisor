Booked through hotwire, thought the four-star rating meant that we'd be well looked-after. Instead, the hidden fees brought the cost from the initially "great deal" of $99/night up to around $158/night. The $22/night room tax, the $30/night parking fee + $6/night parking tax plus the very noisy room facing I-5 ensured that we will not be back. The extra $13/night for wifi was just plain gouging. When we heard the cost, we elected to not bother. Seriously? An up-charge for wifi? Nickel-and-dime your customers much? The icing on the cake was a Saturday night visit to the hotel bar for a drink. Two singles of blended scotch (the cheap stuff) started at $11/drink before tax, and ended up at nearly $30 after a modest tip was added. $30 for two drinks? Booooo. Down with Renaissance.

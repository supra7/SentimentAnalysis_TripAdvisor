Say that you own a space on the 2nd floor (American 2nd floor, Italian 1st floor) in an anonymous building about five minutes from the Rome train station. How do you get people to come to your hotel? Do you put a ton of money into designing the it with high end furniture, Herman Miller, Eames, etc..., get the a first rate staff that are totally in tuned with your guest's needs, clean out the room so well that you don't question its cleanliness, provide local information (maybe a map) and use high end bath products? Or do you just go to IKEA, buy pseudo design hollow side tables, leave blond hairs on the sheets, keep the water pressure in the shower as low as possible and hire someone to write the crap out of the reviews in Trip Advisor? I think most honest people would the do the former. I cannot imagine SuiteDreams doing anything else but the latter. $242 US for one night in Rome and my bride was afraid of bed bugs. #14 should know that its guest do not want to hear a foreign Asian language (Vietnamese maybe) all night. I know its your hotel but if your guest's room is only 10 feet from the check in desk, please be considerate. (I'm Asian by the way) I don't know why they didn't ask us how our trip was or if we needed a map. Or why they do not put the extra comforters in the closet in a plastic zip around bag so it doesn't smell like a cheap wood closet. Why even have pillows if they are going to so thin that all night, you toss and turn, thinking about the inevitable crick in your neck the next morning. I don't know if I should blame this place for being fraudulent or Trip Advisor for allow the forum where a company clearly does not deserve a 14 ranking but somehow attains it. Its not a terrible place for $100 a night. Its not a terrible place for a 500 ranking. But it is a terrible place for what I paid and what its ranked. Shame on you both. Oh, even though its called Suite Dreams, not all the rooms are suites.

We stopped two nights in Boston at the end of a US trip and picked a Hyatt hotel at random as I expect them to be of a good standard. We found the Hyatt Regency Boston to be shabby and run down and not a good advertisement for the brand. Our room was cramped and basic - bits of woodwork chipped, walls marked. Our view out the window was out the back over a rooftop (can't have the good one all the time I guess!). The sports centre was a big let down. The changing facilities are grubby and dated. The changing room shower did not work, the sauna was not hot. And the pool was freezing. My young son had blue lips after 5 minutes in it. Interestingly, there is a van parked across the road from the hotel entrance with a big sign on it denouncing Hyatt hotels. Also not good advertising. Don't think we'll be visiting again.

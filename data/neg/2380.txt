The room was clean, but basic. They charge extra for everything - including getting clean towels each day - that is $7 a week. They don't even give you hand towels, just one bath towel and one wash cloth per guest. That wasn't the worst part. The 5-person (occupancy is supposed to be limited to 4 persons per room) family had a kid who supposedly is bipolar and takes 5 medications. The kid threw temper tantrums and the father bellowed at him, frequently using the f-word. The father's behavior was out of control. I called security several times, and the security person threatened the family with eviction, but nothing was done. Management never offered to relocate us. At checkout, they added $25 to the amount of our security deposit that they gave back to us to compensate us for our trouble, but it was too little, too late. We did not get a single night's sleep, and this made what was supposed to be a much-needed vacation into a nightmare. Lots of other guests complained about these people, but nothing was done. This family should have been kicked out so the rest of the guests could get some quiet.

Our room smelled like wet dog. Rooms were pokey, dark with masculine urban depressing overtones. Aircon noisy. I definately would not class this as a boutique hotel with open space and fresh minimalist lines. If you're bipolar do not go to this hotel! It certainly is boutique in that it is literally small in size. Marketing spin maybe appealing to arty urbanite market...but for us it just didn't quite gel in the execution. Some pleasant aspects of the Max hotel were a couple of paintings in the lobby, its central downtown location, and courteous staff. You can find better hotels for the price and eye candy. Try Mariott Courtyard Pioneer Square.

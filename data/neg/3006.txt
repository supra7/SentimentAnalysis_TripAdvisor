I have never been prompted to write a review before as I am usually not a complainer, but feel the responsibility to my fellow travelers to warn them. First of all, the room was very hot and smelled of urine. The heat did not help the odor situation and there was no air conditioning (this was ok since they didn't advertise that they had A/C). I was traveling with a friend and we had made the reservation for two and requested two beds. When we got there, there was one bed and they refused to do anything about it, stating that we should have let them know earlier. There was no possible way to do so, since when we checked in, they still hadn't cleaned the room so we had to store the luggage at the front desk and then went out for the day. To discover this when we returned at 11pm was a major disappointment. The kicker though was that AFTER using the toilet, we discovered that it did not flush. When reporting this to the front desk, the employee said "well now I have a problem because there are no other rooms and nobody is here to fix it." Uh, no pal, it's not your problem, it's OUR problem since we now have a toilet full of bodily functions and no other place to go. Same guy who refused to fix the bed situation, even though the bed in there was two double beds shoved together and he could have at least just given us a spare set of blankets/sheets so we could do it ourselves. To add insult to injury, the free wi-fi in the hotel lobby only worked with one computer at a time, so that if you were online and someone else signed on, you were kicked off. Great... I mean, what is a hotel room without functional beds and a toilet? They also refused to alter our bill. Like I said, I've never had a worse hotel experience in my life.

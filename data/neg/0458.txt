We arrive late at night, to find hotel had been oversold and they didn't have a room for us (despite guaranteed late arrival with credit card). They tried to put us in nearby hotels -- but none were available. So after screwing around for about an hour, they put us in a function room with fold-out bed. They assured me the next day they would move our luggage to a bedroom. But when we came back after a day of enjoying the city, and went to front desk as instructed, the clerk had no idea where our room or luggage had been located. After calling around and banging on the computer for awhile, they found a room -- and had the bellhop find our luggage and move it there. But when we got there, room was not available, so they put us in yet a third room. Screw-ups, screw-ups, screw-ups. When all finally settled, the room was extremely small. I stay in New York city regularly, and this room was even small compared to New York rooms. There were several other screw-ups during our stay. A bellhop told me he was trying hard to find a job at another hotel in town that is better run. This hotel needs better management.

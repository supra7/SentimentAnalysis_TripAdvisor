My wife and I were looking for a Disney weekend without spend a ton of money. We booked this hotel due to the rating here. We thought it was cheap due to a lack of amenities not cleanliness. It lacks both! The guest service people seamed nice but not any nicer than a normal hotel. The rooms are very small, smaller than most master bedrooms! Again all ok for the price. However the room was disgusting! The sink fixture was not bolted down, mildew everywhere, dirt and grim in all corners of the room, plaster falling off the walls, and a dirty smell everywhere! The bed was lumpy and realy not that comfy. The breakfast was free, however some of the worst i have ever had, could not even eat anything but cereal. If you stay here bring some cleaning supplies! I would avoid even for the money!

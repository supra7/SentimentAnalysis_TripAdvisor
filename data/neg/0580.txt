I was fairly satisfied with my stay at the motel--nothing fancy but OK for the pr;ice. The bathroom was really small but the room size was OK and the bed comfy. When I got home, however, I had an email from my credit card with a $25.00 (extra) charge from the motel -- itemized as SIxth Ave. Inn --Restaurant. We didn't ever step foot in the restaurant, never ordered any room service or anything else from there, so why the charge ? I immediately contacted the Inn (by email) asking about it and haven't heard a thing back yet (and it has been over a week now). This has changed my opinion of the place from OK to POOR. Maybe this review will get me an answer.

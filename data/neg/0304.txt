This is a very historic place. The rooms are clean and the location is convenient, but hotel ammenities such as shampoo, notepaper, coffee-maker are missing. The radiator clangs throughout the night (when it's cold outside) and there's not even a clock to tell what time it is. If you're on a budget, I would recommend the Moore Hotel, just don't expect any luxuries.

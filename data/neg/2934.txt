The Devil is in the Details This was our first and last trip to this resort. While the rooms and the resort are beautiful from a distance, little thought and effort has gone into the details. We had problems with our room from the moment we got there. There were holes in the ceiling, the sliding glass door to the deck would not lock, the light switches fell off the wall when you pushed them and our favorite, the ENTIRE room flooded when you took a shower. We asked twice a day for four days to get things repaired and they always assured us someone would be right there. We saw one maintainance man the entire time and after agreeing to fix some of the problems, he disappeared, never to be seen again. We finally gave up trying. Our elevator did not go to the ground floor and our friend's elevator smelled like sewage.Outside of the Japanese restaurant and the steak house (which we enjoyed), the food was bad. Everything on the buffet was cold, and all of the sides we ordered al carte always came out cold. It was even hard to find a hot cup of coffee.The amenities are far from done. There is no spa, water sports are currently non- existent and there was no signage anywhere to tell you where things were.On a positive note, the pools were great, the beach was clean, the drinks were plentiful and the staff extremely friendly. The gym was also one of the nicest we have seen at any resort. This place has incredible potential, but they are far from realizing it.

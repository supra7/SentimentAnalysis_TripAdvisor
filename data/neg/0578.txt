We have stayed at this hotel before in 2003 and '07. It was good then but it looks like the owners have not invested a penny in the property. Very slow internet, carpets worn, signs of plumbing repairs visible in the room. Biggest pain was the key system. This one was very picky. The only staff who could consistently open the door on the first try were the maids. Everyone else either failed and got so frustrated that they ran to get a Master key, or something that wold get us in our room. Were we never able to successfully open the door!! We won't be staying there anymore. Friends said we should check out the Holiday Inn Express.

Check in was great. Shuttle service is great except on weekends when they ususally have college teams stay here and then al lthe attention goes to groups and not family nor individual travelers. There is availability of adult programming on the TVs, but don't weaste your money. The walls are very thin so you can hear EVERYTHING!!!! I mean, you can almost see the couple in the next room "doing it." Man, something really wild was going on, I thnk I even heard a dog bark... It can be very entertaining. :) In the AM... (Let me tell you that I am a sound sleeper) Even though I was very tired, I could not sleep past 7AM. Noise coming in form everywjhere...people leaving, doors slamming, vacuum cleaners and people talking. It was unbelievably clear as if they all were next to my bed. Ac in the room is very noisy... I think the same is in all rooms. You set the ac to your desired temp, but about every 15 minutes it will run into gear loudly for 5 minutes... Then you will have that 4 times per hour throughout the night. It should be fine if you are not going to be in the room that much or you don't plan to sleep at all. :) Good things: Coffe makerHOUSEKEEPING IS SUPERB!!! NICE PEOPLE AND VERY ATTENTIVE. great soap, work desk and fridge in room, comfortable beds, shuttle services Mon-Thursday. Not much to do around the hotel unless you have a car.

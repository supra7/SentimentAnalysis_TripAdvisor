We got in late to the hotel (1230pm) and they gave away my reservation for a king sized bed though I had travel/business for four days booked at the hotel. The girl at the reception desk was asked if that was b/c we were late she blamed the day shift for giving away the room since 4pm. Then the first thing she said was "There's nothing else I can do for you" proceded by an offer for breakfast and to change our room in the morning. She was rude, could not make good eye contact and I had to ask for her manager's name. They didn't have a manager until the morning. The next few days people were much more helpful and pleasant to deal with. But I found the hotel accomodations itself so so. It seemed old and in need of a lot of renovations. For example, the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off. Once we got into our king bedroom, they gave us a corner room probably for our inconvenience. However, the furniture did not seem to fit the room. The TV was small and the dressers were small. We tried to use the safe in the room but it was broken. We immediately called the front desk and asked for help. Three days later we checked out and it was never addressed. One good thing about it though was the food. The breakfast buffet was healthy and very good. We had lunch there too (the manager was trying to make up for her poorly trained employee) and the clam chowder, salmon and spinach salad and crab cakes were really good.

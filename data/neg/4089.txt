I stayed at Boston Park Plaza Hotel for a week, in an upgrade Tower Room. For over $300 a day, I couldnt even get hot water for shower in the morning. I also experienced billing error and loss of item at my room. The staff was trying to help, but the hotel is so overwhelmed with problems that they either couldnt do anything or did not care. I checked out with an erroneous invoice, and the security manager (service manage was not in on duty) promised that a fax copy of the revised invoice will be faxed to me. As of today (more than one week later), I am still waiting for the correct invoice. I emailed the security manager; she did not reply. I called the security manager and the hotel, and nobody picked up the phone at the front desk, or at the accounting. Apparently, nobody cares in the hotel once you leave. The lesson I learned from spending more than $2k? Stay away from Boston Park Plaza Hotel!

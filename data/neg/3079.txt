This hotel is about a 20 min tram ride out of town and convenient to get to. There are also various bus routes, etc. but you will need to email the hotel for these. The front of the hotel can get noisy when tourist buses are there (trundling cases, engines, etc.). I was moved to a room at the back (ground floor windows do not open) which had a lovely view of a skip full of dirty rubbish bags. The furniture is dark and retro. The padded chairs seem to have been recycled from another hotel and are scruffy. The building seems like a recycled office block. There are no door numbers  just handwritten ones on sticky tape. There are gloss paint streaks every so often on the carpets. The rooms are clean and bearable but there are no instructions r.e. the phones, etc. All phones are blocked because of tour groups, so check at reception if you are a solo traveller. Plumbing can be very noisy. Overall, it is bearable. The worst thing about this place is the breakfast. There is a limited selection of badly prepared food (stale muesli, cheese hard at the edges, bacon in a puddle, etc). The coffee machine blocks every so often. There seems to be no dining hall manager. There is no trolley to clear the tables so that each table cleared means a separate trip from the kitchen. For people who want to fix their own packed lunch the lack of supervision is a gift. We watched one family of 4 adults make a loaf of sandwiches plus umpteen packets of jam, biscuits and liver pate and they werent the only ones. I was very surprised to find that this hotel was a Best Western. Good reception staff but overall badly run, lack of attention to detail and un co-ordinated.

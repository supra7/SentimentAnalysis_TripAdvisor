My husband and I stayed at the Park Plaza for two nights while visiting family in Boston because we got a great online special. From our experience, however, we will not be returning. PROS: Great location. It is surrounded by great restaurants, theaters, shopping, Boston Commons and Boston Gardens. Comfortable beds and pillows, and good water pressure in the shower. Easy check in and out. CONS: The bathroom was very tiny and a shelf overhanging the sink made it impossible to bend over to wash your face without banging your head. There was no way to control the room temperature. Our room was so warm the first night it was impossible to sleep. The second night we figured out that we could open the windows, but the street noise was so loud that we had to close them again. The walls are paper thin. On our first night a party in a room down the hall ended at 3:00AM when it then spilled out into the hall waking everyone. The room itself was of adequate space, but the furniture was very worn and the radiator was falling apart, part of it hanging on the floor. Maybe that's why there was no temperature control! Two nights of no sleep and no free wifi left us with very negative feelings about this property.

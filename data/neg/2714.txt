Do not be fooled by the previous reviews of Hotel Smit. It's convenience to the museum district is it's only (barely) saving grace. The double bedrooms are two single beds pushed together which is not very couple-friendly. The staff was odd and unenthusiastic. There were ants in the sheets, we were only provided 2 towels for two guests, the shower sprays water all over the bathroom, the hallways are cold, and the street noise is very disruptive. The buffet is NOT as gourmet as it has been described. It is a spread of lunch meats, not very good cheese, some bread, hard boiled eggs, and juice. At least the breakfast was free. I have learned from this experience that 4 or 5 Star is the only way to stay in Europe. If you are going to Amsterdam for the first time, spend the extra cash and stay in a nice boutique hotel along a canal in the Jordaan or off Rembrandt Square. It really makes a difference.

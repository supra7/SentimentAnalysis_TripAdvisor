There are two good things about this place: location in the heart of Chicago and beautiful historic lobby. As soon as you step away from the lobby, it's a shame. Dirty, worn out carpeting and walls, everything in dire need of renovation. Old shabby furniture in the room, worse than in any cheap chain. And they call themselves Hilton! Awful view from the window, more like a prison. Nothing for breakfast. And, as usual in American hotels, deceptive pricing: you don't know how much you pay because they don't include taxes in the quote. I wonder what will it take to end this rip-off. Stay at Palmer only if you can get a really good price AND want to be in downtown.

Didn't get the room we paid for. Room we did get was smelly and air con did not work. Woken up all night by road noise and noise from within hotel, doors banging etc. Staff rude and ignorant, pushed past us out of lift, manager not on site to resolve complaints. Complaint still not resolved, manager never seems to be at work or is too busy to respond to us. Breakfast muffins were mouldy. When told receptionist that we would complaint to head office she laughed and hung up!!!! WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER SEEN!

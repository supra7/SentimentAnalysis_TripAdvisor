Arrived late, they had given our room away. Diamond members get a small gift...it was three pieces of fruit on a stick and two pieces of cheese...can you say cheesy!! Cookies were good, as always. Went to breakfast and got some french toast. Then there was this set-up for the syrup which was under a sterno can and full flame, the syrup was boiling. It was so liquified that it spilled all over my hand and burned me terribly. If it wasn't for Pam the waitress quick actions and bringing me ice, I am sure it would have blistered terribly. I am grateful she was quick. Keep your children away from these set ups, they are going to injure someone terribly!

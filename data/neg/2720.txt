Very, noisy at night and I do mean all night! There are no insulated windows and the street noise is terrible. There is a building next door under construction and they work at night also. There are no washcloths, hand towels in the hotel at all. ( I asked the maid and the front desk clerk) I really expected this in a 3 star hotel. EXTREMELY HOT WATER. in room 401 and it was hard to regulate. Just a shower no tub . The bar of soap was miniscule. Anyone with small children should be aware of potential scalding. Breakfast buffet amounted to raw under cooked bacon and burned scrambled eggs for all 3 days I stayed there. We chose to eat breakfast elsewhere rather than risk getting sick from under cooked meat. I wish I hadn't prepaid for the room on Eurobookings, I would of checked out of the room the first night. The desk clerk told me the owner and his partner own two hostels and are building a third close by. . I must admit I've had BETTER stays at hostels than this hotel. Definately overpriced. I would not stay here again.

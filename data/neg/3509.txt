This hotel is in the heart of Dallas. It definitely has a lot of charm. We went for a weekend getaway, and it was great to actually see the place. The hotel architecture and structure is truly inspiring, but the decor is a little HD Expo. But it had coiffered ceilings, the Pegasus, and 5 working elevators from 1901. The bathrooms are minimalist with almost medium hot water, the drainstop did not work, so I had to rush through my bath while the water trickled out! And the phone was a pain and there was a charge to make local calls. But absolutely loved seeing the place.

This hotel is terrible. I picked it because I was working at the attached office park. I am a Platinum rewards member and was very disappointed in the package. I almost always stay at Hiltons so was shocked to find out I didn't get free breakfast or even a discount. The room furniture was very old and the carpets in the halls were stained. I talked to several people at work and they all talked about how they avoid the hotel. I am in town every week for the next month and am changing hotels next week and will drive the extra distance for a better stay.

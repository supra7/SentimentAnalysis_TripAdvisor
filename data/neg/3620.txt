I got the hotel thru hotwire usually when i reserve with them the rating was pretty good. This time they missed it. They give candlewood hotel 2.5 but it is a 1 star hotel. Dirty room, leaky air condition and restroom fan is not function. I asked to chage to another room they said i have to wait 4 hours. I paid the full amount and i do not have any choice to finish the remainder of my two days stay here. I alredy have staffy nose and headache. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL PERIOD.

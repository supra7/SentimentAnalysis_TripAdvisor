My husband and I rented an ocean view room for our honeymoon. One day, we returned after the housekeeping had been through and the door was open. Luckily, nothing was gone, but it was alarming. Another day, they took my swimsuit cover-up (a wedding gift) with the towels hanging on the back of the door (which they were not supposed to take). The staff was friendly and apologetic about it at the time, but I just called back two weeks later (it's still not found) and Kirsten, the front desk manager, was extremely rude and unhelpful. She asked if I wanted to be transferred to housekeeping, with whom I had already spoken. I said no, she said OK, then hung up. The pool was also extremely crowded and it was virtually impossible to find two chairs together. There is no beach to speak of. If I had to do it all over again, I would have spent extra money and stayed somewhere nicer.

this was my last stop after a week in europe. i really liked my room and the bed was very comfy. but the walls were obscenely paperthin. i could hear what my neighbors were watching on TV. the ice machine on my floor did not work and had bugs on the bottom of the inside. my toilet was clogged. location was close to the light rail and close enough to other attractions to make it worthwhile for 1 night, but i could not get to sleep due to the noise. ill pay more next time for a hotel with thicker walls.

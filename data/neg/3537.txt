The Manager has serious issues Everything was pretty good on check in evne though it was late at night, however one thing that annoyed me was getting knocks on the door from the maids at10:30 well before it would be normal check out time to clean the room. But the kicker is I had called the night before check out and asked for a late check out with which the clerk who answered the phone said was fine but the next day while taking a shower, the manager or asst manager pounded on the door and my gf said he told her we had to leave immediately and that any late check outs had to be cleared thru him, stupid me, I should have known that right, because obviously Im psychic. Upon returning home I noticed that he charged my card for an additional day even though I hadn't stayed so now as we speak Im disputing this with my bank, and I called Ramada's customer service to let them know and within 30 mins later I get a call from the manager person who basically calls me a liar and tells me I can drive down there anytime to review the video for whatever reason, anyways, avoid at all costs unless you like getting screwed over.

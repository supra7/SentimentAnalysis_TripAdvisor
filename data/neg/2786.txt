I will never attempt to stay at this or any other Super 8 Motel. The rooms were not kept at all, the water was hard to adjust, the things that were supplied, such as hairdryers were faulty. The toliet worked but was broken and rocked because it was not attached to the floor, the water control in the shower was really hard to adjust because it was not properly installed. The baseboards were not sticking in most of the room. Was it clean?? I really don't think so, but could not really tell due to the poor lighting. This was a truly disappointing venture!! If I use Hotel(-) again, I guess I'll have to go with a truly expensive room to make sure it is kept up to par! When this information was reported to Hotels(-), it was met with hostility and not very much understanding. Didn't want to watse my time or money with photos.

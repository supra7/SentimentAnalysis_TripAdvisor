A friendly staff greets you and ensures that you understand the "resort fee", which includes towels at the beach, Internet and parking. However, don't get confused, this is NO RESORT and NO CLUB!! For the price I expected an above average hotel (not Kimpton, but something around a Hilton Garden Inn level). To begin, the restaurant was closed at my arrival at 915pm, even though the signs indicated it stayed open until 10. The room was not a kitchenette as advertised...it had an old refrigerator with a microwave on top...neither of which I would consider using. The floors in the hallways were disgustingly dirty and that continued into the room. The room was so nasty that I made sure no clothes ever came close to the floor or bed...argh!! Not a good sleep either, bed was very old and very uncomfortable. The shower was also gross and the shower head I have not seen since I was in the Army. I think it is some kind of low flow, but high pressure that will just peel the skin right off!! I think years of Spring Break parties have taken their toll on this place. Staff kept this from being a Terrible rating.

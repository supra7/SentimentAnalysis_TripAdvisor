Overall me and my wife went to Madrid on vacation. I decided to stay at theBarcelo Hotel because it seem the price was right. Eventhough the rooms were clean and the staff was eager to help we found ourselves in the middle of commercial industry. It felt I was not on vacation. We did rent a car and went all over. The sorrownding area was a bit noisy due to the industry at work. I felt I was not on vacation. I don't mind the noise, as long as it was noise from people going about their busness. Not trucks loading and unloading during the day. This hotel is a nice place but, not for vacationers.

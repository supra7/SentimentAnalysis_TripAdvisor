Room: no practical Design, small sink water splashes everywhere, Toilette in close proximity to the bed, tv from the ceiling in the middle of the room so you easily bump your head into it and disturbing LED Night lights which cannot be switched off. Hoovering the floor during the breakfast. Staff without training and helpless. One positive side the Location is very good.

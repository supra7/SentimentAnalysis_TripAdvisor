I recently stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers while attending a conference in the hotel. When we first arrived to hotel's main entrance, we waited in our car as the doorman carried on a personal conversation. When we finally got his attention, he looked angry that we had interrupted him and told us to park around back. We drove to the back of the hotel only to find that THERE IS NO PARKING, unless you're willing to valet it for $42 a night. As we drove around shopping parking options, I called the hotel to see if they offered any discounts at local garages. Again, I was dealing with another rude hotel employee with absolutely NO customer service skills whatsoever (oh, and by the way, no discounts at garages but he basically scoffed at my suggesting such as thing). And so, we arrive and check in and head up to our standard guestroom (with one single king bed). The room is very small, stuffy, and the looks dated. The TV is huge (and not nice, flat screen tv huge either but a big box). Even though we were on the 10th floor, the noise from the street was so loud that we barely slept all night. Further, the noise from people in the halls didn't help either. All in all, a stuck-up hotel that has no reason to be. Save your money, go elsewhere and actually enjoy your stay in Boston.

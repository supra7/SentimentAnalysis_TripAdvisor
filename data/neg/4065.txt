Staff is rude and incompetent. Upon arrival key didn't work to get into room, 30 minutes to get someone to even meet us in the hall, the employee, couldn't get us in the room. He recommended telling the front desk to move our room. Moved to another room, with new key, which worked for one use. Key didn't work again in new room. Front desk sent another employee to get us into our room...never asked for ID either. TV in room was fuzzy. Made a complaint, found out from their engineering staff that the room wasn't equipped with cable tv. Phone in room didn't work. Concierge was supposed to make dinner reservations, never made them. Upon check out front desk charged $10 more per night than what was quoted. All in all service was horrible, rude staff. The only competent employees were the valet staff, who retrieved our car in 10 minutes, just like they said. Wouldn't recommend this hotel.

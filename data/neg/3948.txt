Just checked out and decided to write my first review. For $493 dollars, I would expect a bath tub, free wi- fi walls thick walls enough to hide the sounds of our neighbor crying all night, and no bare wires near the toilet. I gather they have "modernized" the bathroom heat by running a thin, bare wire from the radiator in the bathroom to a manual control switch. A piece of plastic edging type material covers the wire halfway. Hope your rear end is not wet should you brush against it while taking care of business. Parents please watch your kids!!!

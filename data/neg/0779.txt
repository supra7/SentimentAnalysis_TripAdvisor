Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at this hotel the last time I stayed there. I'm originally from Seattle and my husband had never been, so I wanted him to stay somewhere nice and close to downtown. We got there later in the evening and when we went to bed, we pulled bad the comforter and there was a blood stain on the sheets. It was absolutely disgusting. We called the manager and she came to look at it and moved us to another room. We were fine with that until we received our credit card bill and they had overcharged us for our room and then took it off and then recharged it again! It was about a two week process and we talked to numerous people before it was finally reconciled.

Rooms are very small, bathroom is so small and old, that it felt dirty. The staff were less than helpful or knowledgeable. Would never go back, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Only redeeming amenity was a coffee shop on the bottom floor, where the staff were absolutely incredible, but in reality, how far do you have to go to find a coffee shop in Seattle?!

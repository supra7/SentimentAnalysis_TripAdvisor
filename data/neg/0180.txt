This is an honest, yet appropriately devastating review. It's actually tough to pinpoint exactly how this hotel drove me to the point of rage - it's more of a 'straw that broke the camel's back' type situation. We'll go with a 'Pro' and 'Con' approach. I travel to Seattle for business on a regular basis, and so am familiar with similar properties in the area. I used Hotwire to book, and so didn't actually choose this location, it came up on Hotwires rotation. Cons: - After leaving my car with the valet, learned that parking is $37 a night. $20 is the going rate in this area. - Checking in, learned that an upgrade is required for rooms on 'club floors' which contain amenities standard in other similar properties, such as a mini-fridge, etc - Heater in room is so loud during operation that it is impossible to watch tv, listen to music, etc, without constantly changing volume whenever heater turns on. - There is a $10 a day charge for wi-fi. A ridiculous fee considering every hotel I have stayed at for the last few years provides this as a complimentary service. Also, after paying the fee, the connection was almost unusably slow; impossible to stream movies via netflix, youtube, etc. - Room service fees were exorbitant. The $14 chicken on the menu was $37 with delivery fees. - Bathroom has one of the strangest toilets I've ever seen. The seat rim is approximately 6" from the floor, which puts your knees at chest level when seated. Also my balls were hanging in the water when seated. I basically had to lean sideways on one leg to use the toilet. - Hellish fluorescent lighting in bathroom - Window does not open - Etc, etc... Pros: - Good food in restaurant. - Clean room - Cute Bartender

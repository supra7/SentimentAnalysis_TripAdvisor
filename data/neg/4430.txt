I reserved this hotel in october 2009 and was told it would be totally remodeled by march 2010 , so I told my group they were going to be in a newly remodeled hotel and they weren't ,so needless to say I was embarassed ! If you stayed on the fourth floor you heard all of the construction . I was supposed to check in on june 25 so i went pay for my room in advance and when I got there they told me that my presidential suite I paid for in advance was not available ! No apology No explaination! The general manager of the hotel was assisting me at the front desk when I checked in and was not concerned at all ! I should have got a call telling me that the construction was not done and I feel very bad for the group , Some of them weren't even in new rooms ! Paying in advance doesn't get you what you pay for there ! Bad Experience !!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE !!

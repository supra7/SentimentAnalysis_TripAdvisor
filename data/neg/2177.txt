This resort is a time share nightmare! They do not give you the room you were promised. Their charges are endless and costly. Their only objective is fresh meat as the sale rep. described new customers. If you have deep pockets maybe you will over look all the charges they have but for every one else it is a rip off. Really, how good can it be. You get there on a dirt road!

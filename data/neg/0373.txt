Firstly, I want to express that this hotel was horrible. Our room was match box tiny, you couldn't even breathe, though that was expected because we only paid $120 per night for the room. We were charged an extra $50 dollar parking fee for two nights. It was actually supposed to be $40 but they seemed to tack on an extra $10 for a "deposit" (Phone and Television were not included, but were probably an extra $50) The room was only worth 100 dollars. We had an "executive" view of the dirty brick building across from us and we had holes in the walls. Nice huh? Oh yeah and we were basically threatened at the desk. We were told "If there is ANY noise or disturbance we will evict you." We were also discriminated against because we were "under 21" I feel personally offended that they discriminated agenst us. We are paying customers. A word to the wise, if you are looking for a nice place to stay with nice people, DON'T GO HERE!

A disappointing room in Rome. Overpriced for the stay. The room is incredibly dark, must have every single light on to see at all and very loud in the night. The staff was not especially friendly, and gave us no information upon arrival re: perks, etc. Somewhat snooty staff. Location was close to Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori, Vatican City. Many good restaurants in the area. Location is quite a walk to ancient center and other historic sights. Also, be warned there is no subway stop nearby. Well the hotel does have free internet, it often did not work.

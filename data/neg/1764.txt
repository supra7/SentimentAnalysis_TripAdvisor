My wife and I decided to stop in Maui on our way back from New Zealand and decided to stay at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel because it offered a location on Ka'anapali beach for a lot less than the other hotels on this beach (As we stayed for only 3 nights, we did not look seriously at any of the condo locations.) Our room was located on the ground floor of the Maui wing and included breakfast each morning and a car from Dollar Rent a Car for $240/night. The room was quite large and had a separate sunken sitting area connected to an outdoor patio area overlooking the hotel's gardens and the ocean about 150 yds beyond, but our entry door looked out on the parking garage. The furnishings and the decor are beginning to show their age, not broken, just worn and dated. As a whole the hotel felt dated and in need of a facelift. The Mixed Plate offered a basic ,blah tasting breakfast buffet with the ambiance of Burger King. Because of this we didn't try the other restaurants in the hotel. The staff was helpful in all regards and recommended the luau at the Hyatt. It is a 15 minute walk down the boardwalk. We sprung for the VIP access to the luau which gave us front row seats, a drink waiter, and first access to the buffet dinner. The show was quite entertaining and the food was decent, not great. All in all the hotel is a good value if your primary interest is staying directly on the beach, but I certainly would not say that this is anything close to a luxury hotel, so don't be surprised that you will be charged to use the cabanas and lounge chairs on the beach.

I stayed here recently, it is a BIN, aviod at all costs. I checked several reviews and did not take it's advice and booked it. The front lobby is the only decent thing about this hotel, the elevators and halls are disgusting. The carpet in our room was stained and the room was really old and grotty. I do agree for the 6th Floor museum it was good, but check if other downtown hotels offer shuttle service and use them, this is not a nice hotel, we felt quite uneasy staying here, we checked out after one night. The food was poor as well.

Arrive Friday afternoon: no hot water...90 minutes of workman in room to change a mixing valve. Come back from dinner...room 95 degrees and heat will not turn off; workman in room at midnight. Wake up next morning...NO HEAT. Workman in room at 8am Return for day at 4pm to get dressed for a wedding....95 degrees and heat will not turn off. We had two rooms on the same floor (one for us, one for kids age 7, 12 and 15) and they could not accomodate a move of both rooms to the same floor, so we were stuck. Front office was rude, said they "went above and beyond" (since when is hot water and 72 degree air considered "above and beyond" and that we refused to move rooms. A lie. PLUS, I don't get how people can say the decor is clean and modern. It has not been changed since the building was built 20+ years ago, the bathroom tiles are chipped with dirty grout, and there are NOT flat screen TVs in every room as their website advertises. It is a great location near Michigan Ave and the pancake house, but find another nearby hotel. Repeat: AWFUL!

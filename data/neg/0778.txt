My stay was overshadowed by my experience with the valet service. The day started with the Valet Service breaking my key in the door upon arrival and check-in. While the Valet manager acknowledged thier mistake the incident was unfortunate. The very next day upon check-out, as I tried to leave the hotel my car would not go into 2nd gear. Upon returning to the hotel, I told the manager about the trouble I was now having with my car, and he said, he told the employee how to take the key out of a manual SAAB Turbo 900 but it was obvious that he did not get it right. Now I am out of $5500.00 dollars (Auto repair/Rental) and not even an apology. Maybe I should have walked their and stayed in the most expensive suite facing the space needle.

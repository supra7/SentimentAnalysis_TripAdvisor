Absolutely the worst service I've ever - I strongly suggest that you do not stay at this hotel. We arrived at the Elite World late at night - no assistance at the door so we had to drag our bags up a steep, slippery ramp on our own. At reception, we're told that all floors above ground have been flooded so we're can't stay at the Elite for our first night. This is patently untrue - besides the fact that a flood of this scale could not be fixed overnight, we can see other guests going upstairs normally/checking in. We find out later that this hotel frequently overbooks and that when this happens guests who have merely guaranteed their booking by card (as opposed to paying in advance) get "bumped". Reception completely ignored the fact that moving from place to place would be very difficult for us as we were travelling with a 6 month old baby, besides the fact that it would take a lot of time from what was already a short trip. When we went to look at the other residence offered, we found out that it was much further than the Elite had said (10 mins drive as opposed to 5 mins walk!), that the only rooms available were doubles (we had booked a triple) and there was no cot for the baby. When we raised this with the Elite, we were told this was the only option available - if we weren't happy with it, we'd have to find another hotel ourselves - given that it was now after midnight and we were three girls with a baby, this was clearly impossible. Thankfully, the staff at the alternative residence were incredibly helpful and with their help we managed to get things sorted out - no thanks to the Elite, who did not even bother to give us any compensation for the trouble and inconvenience they caused to us. In the circumstances, all I can say is do not stay at this hotel.

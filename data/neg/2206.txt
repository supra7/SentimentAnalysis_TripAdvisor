I stayed here in December 2010 for one night in room 9. The hotel was easy to find and in a great location for kings cross/st pancras stations - no more than a five minute walk even lugging a big suitcase. I just wanted a cheap hotel room to sleep in as I was only in London for one night and was so busy out sightseeing that I was only in the hotel for a few hours to sleep, which to be honest I was pleased about. The room was freezing, probably due to the fact it was snowing, minus 5 outside and the single-glazed windows were blowing through a draft - but after turning the heating up as high as it would go it eventually warmed up. A thick blanket that was on top of the bed had a stain on it but the actual duvet cover, pillowcases and sheet seemed clean. The door to the room had an inch gap at the bottom so light shone in from the hallway and you could hear everyone walking around. My room looked nothing like those on the website and it wasn't the best nights sleep i've had! The staff were the best point of the hotel, very friendly and helpful and as I had to check out at 11am they looked after my suitcase for me while I attended a job interview. There was no hairdryer in the room but you can request one from reception along with the code for wifi. Breakfast was in the basement room and when I entered there were no staff around. Assorted cereals, milk and fruit were out on the tables but anything else is made to order by the staff in the kitchen - to be safe I ordered coffee and toast which was fine. I personally wouldn't stay here again but for one night just to sleep for a few hours, good location and for the price it was ok.

I am an independent road warrior who travels all the time and this hotel has two major flaws to beware of: 1) The hotel is excessively "piggy" on the costs of Parking.. $20.00 a day plus tax to use their garage, while directly across the street you can pay $8.00 a day. Which is what I ended up doing. 2) The hotel, also, has one of the worse layouts I have experienced in my travels...Very difficult to navigate around the hotel property compared to comprable hotels. It was designed with little attention paid to ease of reaching various locations within. For the price and star level there are other choices near by.

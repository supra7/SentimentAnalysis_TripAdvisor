We decided to stay in this hotel because of the rates and the Hilton name but now i know the not all Hiltons are good, first thing that happened to us was one morning i had to go out for a couple of hours so my wife ordered room service for her and my 2 year old son, it took around 45 min. to bring the food and when my wife opened the yogurt to feed my son she noticed a bad smell and checked the expiration date it was expired a week ago, so she called room service and explained this but they only said sorry we will bring u a new one right away, 40 minutes after she called and ask what was going on, and they apologize again and said that they don't have any more blueberry yogurt would u like a different flavor?, that same day we were out all day and got back to the hotel at 10 pm. the little table,sofa and rug area where my son had breakfast was completely dirty full of bread remains, we were tired but didn't wanted to sleep in a dirty place so i went down to the front desk to ask them to come and clean my room immediately, i also mention to them about the morning incident, and the answer was that they were gonna talk to the restaurant manager to check all the yogurts, and that for the inconvenience they were gonna take care of the $40 breakfast. But what if my wife didn't check the expiration date an my baby got sick!. In general the cleanliness of the room was bad especially the toilet was completely dirty i don't think that in the 6 days that we were there the maid ever clean it. The Internet is only free if you go down to the lobby area,and the parking is expensive, $28 per day this is for valet parking, if you choose self parking is $25 a day but if u take the car out you have to pay $25 each time. The day i left the hotel i noticed that the car i rented was used by someone from the valet parking staff, they drove it 11 miles the night before, i always check the odometer i found out about this but couldn't say anything because i didn't have time,had to get to the fort lauderdale airport.

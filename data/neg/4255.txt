I stayed at the hotel for 1 night. Booked the hotel through Expedia and paid for the room through Expedia. When I checked into the hotel - they asked for a credit card for miscellaneous charges -- pretty standard operating procedure. When I checked out of the hotel, the front desk indicated that since I hadn't incurred any additional expenses, there was no real need to print out a bill. I foolishly said ok. 1 week later -- checking my credit card statement -- noticed a $36 charge from the hotel above and beyond the room fee. Called the hotel and they said the charge was for valet parking -- which was a bit odd since I didn't have a car. Asked to have the charge removed immediately. Transferred to "accounting" where I received someone's voicemail. Hung up and called the hotel back -- they tried to transfer me to accounting again -- told them "no way", just remove the charge. They then told me that they had to verify that I hadn't had a car valet parked. I told them that there wasn't anything to verify because I didn't have a car in Boston and that I wanted the charge reversed immediately. To me, this is all paramount to fraud -- I'm sure plenty of people don't scrutinize their credit card bills -- nice way for the hotel to make some extra money. The room was nice, bathroom small but okay -- the hallways were pretty shabby (frayed rugs, marks on the wall).

Stayed the 1st and 2nd of Oct. room was average at best. Torn fabric on chair one bar of soap for 3 days and two nights. Ordered room service and they brought part of the order had to call back and they brought most of the rest but still no dinner rolls and I got charged for soup that never arrived service in the restraunt was almost as bad. Had tickets for free breakfast and after being seated the first day never saw a waitress again and on the second day they didnt bring any coffee or juice until I was almost done. This hotel is out of the way for downtown and certainly not worth staying at if that is what you are looking to do. If you are going to sight see stay downtown. And I am a Hilton Diamond member so if I was getting preferred service I would hate to think what they give to regular guest.

My husband and I stayed there last night, and it was a horrible customer service experience. They have Kiosks to check in in the lobby but they didn't work, one half-worked but you still need a plastic card that you have to wait on line for, so the kiosks are essentially useless. (We guessed that the desk workers do this on purpose to save their jobs instead of the kiosks taking over their jobs). We asked the first reception worker for a quiet room away from the elevators and ice machine. We go to our room, and it is directly across from the elevators. We go downstairs and ask another clerk for the same. We go to our room, and it is directly across from the ice machine. Then they lied to us and tell us that all rooms are near the elevators the way the building is configured. We go to the third room they give us and it is away from the elevators finally! There are many floors to this hotel, and it take a long time to get an elevator. When we woke up in the morning, I wanted to make coffee with the room coffee machine, only to find out they give us only decaf. I called the front desk for the coffee, and then had to wait 45 minutes, No coffee, I asked the cleaning people on the floor, they hardly spoke English and said they were out of regular coffee. I called the front desk again, and they started complaining to me that it was housekeepings' responsibility. I had to go down to the front desk, wait on a long line, and finally get some. I would have thought at a Hilton, the service would have been better. Frankly, the people were idiots, and I wasted a lot of time on getting my quiet room and coffee. That said, the rooms were clean and a decent size.

My wife and I booked one night in this hotel in September 2006. I booked the room by corresponding directly with the hotel via email. I booked the room in April 2006 and confirmed it before we left Australia in early September 2006. You would think that, having booked it so far in advance, there would be no problems. Needless to say, I was surprised to find out when we arrived that they had overbooked and we did not have a room. To their credit, they had booked us into their sister hotel around the corner, the MarQueen Hotel which, were were told, was a higher class hotel. It appeared though, after further questioning, that the MarQueen Hotel did not provide breakfast whereas it had been included in our initial booking. After waiting a short time to see the manager, we obtained approval to walk back to the Inn at Queen Anne the next morning and have breakfast there. We did that the next morning. Unfortunately, the breakfast was pretty hopeless. It was set up in the foyer near the front counter. It was VERY basic with tea/coffee and pastries. There was little variety.

Average room--nothing exciting. Housekeeping is very loud in the morning with chatter and equipment. I had to listen to a full morning gossip fest while laying in bed. Also had the pleasure of listening to music from the room next door until 2am--who really needs sleep during a business trip? I called the front desk to complain about the music and a constant crackling noise in the wall (went on all night)--nothing they could do to help me out, the hotel was sold out. Bring earplugs is you're planning to stay here. I won't be coming back.

Not a place to stay for the customer service or the price. I hope this keeps at least one person or more from staying here. Maid service will knock on your door at 7:30 regardless of Do not distrub sign. I stay mostly at Hilton properties (Hilton Honors Gold Member) and this has been the worst. I called the front desk to have the maid comeback and she continued to try to get into the room until I opened the door and said go away. When I checked out they were no apologies or resolution. I was told that they were busy and wanted to have the room ready for the next guest. Checkout time was 11 and I was not able to check into the room until after 4pm when I arrived 3 days earlier. It was a total lack of respect that was undeserved. Hotel Management was no help and did not speak very good english. They would not return calls and I registered a complaint with the Honors line. Even the Hampton Inn has a policy of 100% satisfaction. This does not extend to the Hilton Garden. I work for a major Vendor and attend the RSNA every year. I will not stay there again and have instructed my travel agent who books room in June for this conference not to place anyone there if at all possible. Gold Hilton Honors Member.

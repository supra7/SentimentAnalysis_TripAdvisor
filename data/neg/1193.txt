Not as Bad as it sounds Booked through Priceline..then read the reviews and wished we hadn't. After dropping my dad off at the Sleep Inn by the airport we headed to the Red Lion Inn ready to make a bee line back to the Sleep Inn and pay 2 x's our Priceline price if necessary. The young girl working the desk on Thursday 9/13 was very friendly and had us checked in in no time. When we entered the hallway there was an odor, but not unbearable. The hallways were very dimly lit, but we had expected this. Our room was open when we got there and they key didn't work. We called down to the desk and they brought us another one that did. It also worked on the security doors - which were locked - but not on the second night. Had to go to the desk and get a new one. Seems each key is deactivated each night, no matter how long you are staying. The room was clean and the bath products were nice. No smell in the room. Had read about the curtains being sheer to that was expected. Woke up to blinding light on the first morning, only to find out that night - through some persistent looking and poking - that there are heavy curtains behind the sheers. You really can't see them because of the decorated panels on the end, but they are there, strange place to put them. Hadn't been told there was any breakfast so not disappointed there. Who wants to eat in the hotel anyway, with all the other great choices available downtown. Overall not the best, but not the worst. Only paid $45.00 a night, so I guess we got what we paid for. Never felt unsafe and it really was a very comfortable bed with tons of pillows. I guess we either got lucky or they are making some improvement.

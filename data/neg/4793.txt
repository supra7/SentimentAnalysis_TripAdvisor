This hotel has too many good things going for it to be this bad: Clean rooms, fantastic gym, proximity to convention space and a very good lobby set-up for the business set. Made it all the more otherworldly when elevators that stopped working Thursday weren't fixed by Sunday; when false fire alarms go off at all hours, including 2 and 4 in the morning; when the concierge sends you to restaurants that are closed, or recommends places that aren't, frankly, that good; when you spend 10 minutes begging someone to let you out of the garage because your room key won't work; when they charge a criminal $15.95 for internet service on top of a $235 nightly rate; and so on, and so on. In a word: Overmatched. At least when the big show comes to town, a la the Super bowl.

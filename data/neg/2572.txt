I have stayed at this hotel about 4 times in 4 years . Each time it kept getting worse. On my second visit, someone backed into my car and damaged the front bumper. Not a quiet hotel at all. One visit I had the entire team of the AAA baseball team; San Diego Padres staying in the room above me! They were so rowdy that the screws in the light above the table was backing out and drywall dust was falling onto the floor. I called the front office and she said that she would speak with their coach. I checked out the next morning, so who knows if that happened. The only reason I ever stayed here is because they accept big dogs. They do not however, have any kind of grass for your pet to use. I had to go almost to the highway so my dog could get some kind of natural ground, instead of asphalt or cement. The area where this place is located has really gone down hill. If you stay here, lock everything! Walk in groups and hide any kind of valuable in your car. The price really isn't that great if you take into consideration the area and the undesirables that stay there. The staff, including housekeeping, could use an attitude adjustment.

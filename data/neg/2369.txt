No satisfaction at all My wife and I stayed at Fraser Shinjuku for 3 nights. Unfortunately, their service was not satisfying us. We moved to Oakwood Shinjuku with just a 10-minute walk from the Fraser. Oakwood was much much better than Fraser.Our room was assigned in a normal room with a small kitchen. Bathroom was average, but the amenity was small. Housekeeping was not working here. Our room was unclean.Front reception agent was friendly, however, their hospitality was much lower than I expected. When we checked in at desk, I heard many voices and laughing from the front back. Some agents worked with no smile. The information cabinet was not well-organized. I saw a lady talking loudly to a guest. She looked very angry. Fraser was not a great mid-class hotel. It was an economy and budget hotel.

I stayed at this property after spending 3 weeks at the Downtown Residence Inn(which is VERY nice), so I had some expectations of what to expect. When I got to the room I immediately noticed that it is seriously in need of updating. They don't use the new Marriott bedding program. There was a draft in my room so strong that it was blowing the curtains. The windows had dead bugs, cobwebs and dust. It obviously hadn't been cleaned in a very long time. I couldn't figure out where the draft was coming from so I turned up the heat and went to the closet to get the extra blanket. When I opened the package it was wet and the pillow had black mold all over it! I took a picture. I could hear EVERY footstep of the people in the room above me ALL NIGHT LONG! When they used their sink, I could here the water gurgling in my sink and my plunger even moved!!! The stove was too close to the refrigerator, so when I opened the oven door I had to lift it out of it's hinge to get it passed the refrigerator handle! Stay here if you MUST but only for a short period of time. It's not good for a long term stay.

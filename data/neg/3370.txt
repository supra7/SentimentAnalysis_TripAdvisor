My friend and I stayed at The Sterling Hotel in Dallas for her birthday in March 2004. The hotel was not even close to full yet the room we were assigned was on the one floor that rennovations were being done. Because of this loud hammering woke us up by dawn in the morning. We were also awoken several times in the early morning by phone calls asking for someone who we did not know. As well as a key being issued to a person not listed on the registration who tried to enter the room while we were sleeping. The lights in between the beds did not work, and the air conditioning went out...then suddenly the lights mysteriously come on. Which calling a maintenance man to repair the air conditioning ruined the $10.00 movie we paid for. And as if this couldn't get any more unusual we went to the top floor which has a night club and bar to have a few birthday drinks...little did we know what world we were entering. After a little while we were informed that what we thought was an average hotel lounge was frequented by couples seeking other couples. This could make for an extremely uncomfortable situation for the common traveler. All in all it was a totally mind warping experience out of The Twilight Zone.

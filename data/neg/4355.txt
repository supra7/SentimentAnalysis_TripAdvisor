The Hyatt Regency is a beautiful hotel and in a great location to see all the sights of downtown Boston. However, except for the helpful, informative, doormen the service is awful. When we checked in we were told that the hotel was overbooked (we had made these reservations 5 months+ in advance) and they would need to move us to another hotel for one night. After reviewing our reservation they changed their mind and our room suddenly was available. After we were checked in, we left a message at the concierge desk for directions that was never returned. The front desk couldn't help with directions or local sight information either. We went to the lobby and had driving directions basically thrown at us by the concierge, who was too busy talking to the other members of the concierge desk to help us. Lastly, there isn't a jacuzzi and the pool was cramped.

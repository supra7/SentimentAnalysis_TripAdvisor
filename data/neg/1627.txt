This hotel was not worth the money..the only thing going for it was location. I cannot believe they classify themselves as a hyatt!! If you close your shades you would have thought you were in some broken down travelodge. We had mold on our walls, pubic hair on the toilet seat, and saw many a cockroach..ewww. Anyway we were on our honeymoon, and when I opened the hotel room I actually cried. We checked out a few days later, and that was only because we had prebooked activities in the area. The all included breakfast buffet...more than once we went down to find that there were empty servers, and when coffee was being pured out a carafe there was about an inch of dust on the top..Call me picky but we were spending a lot of money for this!! When we called our travel agebt she was apologetic and we got a cll from the resort manager to meet her downstairs to talk about it. We found her and she listened for about 30 seconds before telling us she "had to run, she was late for a meeting". We were here for our honeymoon and were quite dissapointed. Not to mention we never "collected" out bottle of champagne that we had to first go get our coupon for and order dinner first because " it just worked better for them this way": Whatever, this place is a dump and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone for the money. We checked out stayed in the Htel Hana Maui and the Four Seasons, and we enjoed our honeymoon the way it should have been... Please take my advice, dont stay here..enjoy your time elsewhere, they will just treat you like you are a room #... and I promise I am not a picky person, this place is gross...

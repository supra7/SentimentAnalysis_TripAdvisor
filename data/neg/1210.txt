1970's outdated worn former Holiday Inn under renovation This was rated as a 2* Sea Tac airport hotel on Priceline. The location is not even close to the airport, it is difficult to find and is located in a industrial/warehouse area near Boeing. Traffic could be a real concern when trying to make a flight. There are no restraunts close by. This is a outdated, well worn 1970's former Holiday Inn . Low 8' hallways, vey dark inferior lighting in hall. Thermostat didn't operate properly . Very dirty worn carpeting in hallway and room. Doors banged when guests went in and out during the night. No other rooms were available and no upgraded rooms either.Tiny bathroom with noisy fan and found long black hair strands on shower wall and sink area. Poor housekeeping. They have replaced the bedding and also new 25 zenith tvs. However they have not yet purchased new bedding and the mattress pad did not fit and the bedspread was at 10 too short. The new mattresses were very comfortable.They have a free airport shuttle that runs on the hour.  I felt very unsafe , due to the dark hallways. My husband didn't even want to stay there but we had prepaid with Priceline. We were only there for one night and had a early AM flight.I think this hotel should be reevaluated to a 1* and taken out of the Sea Tac Airport zone.

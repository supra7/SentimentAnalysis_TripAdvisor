I took my family for a Boston weekend vacation. I found the hotel to be in the perfect location for shopping, theater and food. For the most part the service was good. The room was rather small and cramped for 4 people and the bathroom was unusually small. You could not fit 2 people in there at the same time and the door would not open all the way due to the shower curtain bar. My son had bought some souvenirs with his own money and accidentally left it behind the window curtain. I telephoned the hotel as soon as I got home. Of course they did not find the bag and would call back after questioning the housekeeper. They called back the next day and I was told the housekeeper would not be in for a few days. A week went by with no phone call. When I called there, Bernadette, whom I've been speaking with still said that no bag was found. No explanation as to why they did not call back. I asked to speak to a manager but they were all in a meeting...conveniently. It seemed like she could not be bothered and didn't care. I will never stay there again just for the treatment I received from her and their dishonest staff.

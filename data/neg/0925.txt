The hotel is rundown and although it is near the Space Needle there is almost nothing else nearby. Aurora Ave is a nightmare to deal with! The breakfast was marginal at best. This place is a 1950's era Holiday Inn that has been taken over by newer management and has not been maintained very well. There are other hotels nearby that are much nicer for less money. The management has been completely unresponsive. We were promised a credit to our account by their employee and it never happened. The manager has refused to take our calls or return them. This has unfortunately ended up in a huge legal battle. Stay at this place at your own risk!

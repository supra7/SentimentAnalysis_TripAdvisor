We recently stayed here during a trip to Rome to celebrate my partner's 30th birthday. I emailed the hotel in Italian, prior to our stay, requesting the nicest room possible and if there was anything else they could do to make the stay extra special. On arrival, we were given a room with twin beds, (not a double as booked), the room was dusty, noisy and shabby with stains on the wall above the bed! I complained at reception and mentioned my email but was told that there were no more free rooms available as we had checked in late in the afternoon. The receptionist somehow managed to find an available room 20 minutes later which was larger and cleaner, so thanks to her for saving the day! Although not in a central location, we were aware of this and didn't mind the 25 minute bus journey into the centre. Wifi and the breakfast at the hotel was good and would meet most peoples needs. The hotel bar was non-existent though, a few bottles on shelves but the lights were off! In summary, this hotel is not a 4 star, it's 3 years old and in real need of a lick of paint and scratched furniture replaced. My advice, pay more and stay central!

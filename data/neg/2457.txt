I booked this as a crash pad to sleep after evening meetings mainly on the basis of its closeness to the station. It was as expensive as a full service hotel and lacking in faciluties even by normal travel lodge standards. You check in with a machine and struggle through a jail type door into a small lobby. The room was clean but very spartan. Although a double it only had pillows for 1. No chance of sleep with multiple flashing red lights and a window blind narrower than the window to allow plenty of light in. Checkout by machine presumably so the staff dont get to deal with complaints. Avoid unless available very very cheap.

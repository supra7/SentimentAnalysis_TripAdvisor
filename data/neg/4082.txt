Stayed during a major conference in town, so place was heaving but even so.... Very pricey. Room tiny and run down. "wardrobe" too small to fit my case in and had to remove ironing board to corridor just to hang my shirts. Shower same height as my chest despite there being 2ft of space above. Breakfast was chaos - they didn't clear tables (customers just stacked the stuff on the floor in the end) but still managed to bring the bill before we started! Nice splintered woodwork around my door where it had obviously been kicked in Checkout farcical. They told me when I checked in that they had a corporate account to settle to....but insisted I paid in full on my card. Location is ok...but would never stay here again. To be fair, other colleagues said when they've stayed when it isn't busy, that it's quite nice.

A group of us stayed at this hotel for a wedding, which was also held on the grounds. We were put into a room that had not yet been renovated. The room smelled of urine and was beyond disgusting. We complained to the hotel staff, even a manager, and it took them 2 nights to move us into a new room - we were in no way compensated for our inconvenience. As soon as we were moved, they put new guests in it. Don't stay here if cleanliness is high on your priority list. I would definately not stay here again and would not recommend it to anybody!

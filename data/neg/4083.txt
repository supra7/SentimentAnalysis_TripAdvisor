I was able to get a special package deal on Orbitz combining my air travel to Boston with 3 nights at the Park Plaza. I would say that the experience overall was positive, but I would have been disappointed if I had to pay the full price. I had a standard room with a comfy double bed, but the carpet was dusty and stained and there was a mysterious leak in the bathroom. I found a puddle of water near the tub every morning... before I even started the shower. The bathroom was also quite snug... not a whole lot bigger than a telephone booth. The staff ranged from helpful to inattentive to somewhat brusque. There were some voicemails on the hotel phone for me, and the main desk was no help at all when I called them to find out how to access my messages. I never was able to retrieve the messages that were left for me! As I said, the room overall was comfortable but a bit threadbare. Even the sheets were so worn that they had holes, probably from being laundered thousands of times. Park Plaza is very conveniently located in the Back Bay/Copley Square area, and so it's perfect for both business and tourist travelers. But I would only decide to stay there again if I had a discounted rate. I would look elsewhere if the hotel only had full price rooms.

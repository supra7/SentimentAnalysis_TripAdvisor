Quoted by their staff as a 6 star resort i would struggle to give it a 3 star. The beach is not bad it is disgusting There is no swim up bar The all inclusive fee is a rip off since the menus and food are terrible There are no water sport activities available Do not go on the membership tour it is high pressure sales for 2 hrs. The resort is in the middle of forest so watch out for the mozzy's Hair dryers are a waste of time so plan to go out with wet hair at night No straws, sodas out of a big bottle only so always flat Pizza man is very rude and we waited over an hour for a pizza You can't get a drink before 11:30 around the pool BUT..... Rooms are very nice Gym is great with good equipment Yoga instructor is very nice Pools are great Most of the staff are very helpful and friendly But, I will never return!

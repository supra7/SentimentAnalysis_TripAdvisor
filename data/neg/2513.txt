Starting off positive. Most of the staff was friendly and the price was reasonable for NYC. The conceirge folks were utterly useless and not friendly. This hotel lobby was under reconstruction with dust flying everywhere. It hurt my eyes just to check-in. The staff tried to make the best of the situation with Magnolia cupcakes and a 20% off discount for a future stay. The small rooms did not feel very clean and were not vacuumed often enough. We got some crumbs from our cupcakes on the floor that were there after the cleaning staff was in the room a day later. I was here on business and was not able to use wireless internet! The speedtest on their server was dismal and even though I talked with their technical staff it did not seem that any improvements could be made in the short term. I had to walk to the end of the block to work at the very busy Starbucks. I actually moved to multiple rooms to see if I could get internet better on the front side of the building. It only slightly improved.

Avoid Trump at all costs! Gee, where to start! For $265 a night, I had the pleasure of having a sink that would not drain, an iron with a cord that would not stay detracted and music channels on the TV that didnt work. I ordered room service and was told it would arrive in less than 30 minutes, After an hour and a half I called to find out when the meal would arrive (mind you I placed the order at 2:00 PM, not exactly a busy time for the kitchen) and I was told "they are putting the finishing touches on it." When it arrived, I ask the servant what took so long, and was told it had been prepared on time, but "got lost" during the shift change. I wasn't charged for the meal.....but then again I shouldn't have been when the BLT contained a whopping ONE slice of tomato.........I am NOT kidding! The noise of the trains that run at night is deafening. I used to live in a suburban town that had 3 seperate train tracks within 2 miles and it was JUST like a homecoming. DO NOT ACCEPT a room facing south. Doors in the hallway are entrances into 2 adjacent rooms. When ANY door within 50 feet is closed, the sound is so loud that it muzzles the trains!!! The decor is good and the staff pleasant, but if you want value for your dollar, this is NOT the hotel for you! If you have no desire to get a decent nights sleep or a meal when you are hungary, then this is your place!

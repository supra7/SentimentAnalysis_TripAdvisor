Absolutely horrible, but I will be fair and start with the positives: Friendly check-in staff Housekeeping obviously tried their best and the rooms were fairly clean Plentiful breakfast Free internet access (except one of the PCs had the letters worn off its keyboard!) Close to the Space Needle. However- the only word I can use to describe this place is grotty. Carpet in the public area is filthy, and the lift floor was disgusting. No thick curtains in the bedroom. Unbearable heat in the public areas. Only one machine working in the gym. This hotel needs updating, or rather demolishing! It does not deserve even one star, let alone two. We will never stay in a Travelodge again. A truly awful experience

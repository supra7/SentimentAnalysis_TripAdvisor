My wife, who has never been to Vegas, booked us in the El Cortez thinking it was "on the strip". It isn't. It is in seedy downtown Las Vegas - an area where you might not feel comfortable walking after dark. Although my wife called ahead the morning we were to arrive confirming her request for a nonsmoker room, they did not save one for us. We were given a "vintage" room (code word for a room that has not been updated since 1950). At five AM the fire alarm went off for 20 minutes. The announcement said that evacuation was unnecessary, but they allowed the alarm to continue anyways. The next morning, we checked out, abandoning our already-paid next night. This was the most horrible experience we have had at ANY hotel ANYWHERE in the world. Too bad Trip Advisor does not allow a "zero" rating.

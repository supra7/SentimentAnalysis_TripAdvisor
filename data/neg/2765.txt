The building is located near some creepy run down things. It was very loud, dogs barking, people talking, train noise, you can hear right through the walls. Carpet and walls reminded me of an old rundown basement. Towels are naaaaasty. Toilet takes super 8 minutes to flush. Furniture is worn, broken and glued back together. Internet is slow but Hbo is great!

We made reservations for a 7-night stay at Worldquest in Orlando. Even though we had made our reservations in January, I called Worldquest a week before our vacation, just to confirm our room reservation. I was told there was no problem. We arrived at 10 PM at night and were told that the hotel had been oversold and we would have to locate to another property for the evening. They sent us to Mona Lisa Suites with a voucher so that we would not have to pay for that room. We were told to call the next afternoon to see when a room might be available that day. We had no other choice (due to the lateness of the hour) but to stay at Mona Lisa Suites. While we were there, we actually ran into another family group of 6 that had also been 'bumped' out of Worldquest that night. The next day we called the hotel and were told that our room was ready and that we could check in. We checked in about 1 PM. This incident was inexcusable and ruined the first day of our 7-day stay in Orlando, as we had to wait around to see what Worldquest was going to do about our room, and then get settled in all over again after moving over there. Very disappointing. One more side note is that the pool was very cool at Worldquest. Several people began complaining about it, and only then, did they increase the temperature of the water in the pool. This took about 2 days. Once the water had warmed up, the pool area was nice.

Barcelona was a nice city with great food but a lot of thieves. We got "robbed" by the hotel making us pay for an extra night (checked out an hour to late) even thoug we had been told i was ok to cancel the room. We were stuck due to the ashcloud and it was no problem to cancel the room (they were so understanding) until it was time to leave. Got no help from the hotel on how to get home. They kinda reminded me of Manuel...."Im from Barcelona, i know nothing".

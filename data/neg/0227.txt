Quaint hotel, but uncomfortable because of no air conditioning. Seattle was in the 80's when visiting. Some rooms have "air" but not all. It was filled so we could not be moved. No privacy when you open windows and curtains to try to get some outside air. We finally had to move to another hotel at 11pm. Good location and price.Pay for parking.

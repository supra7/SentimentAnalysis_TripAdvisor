First let me say that my husband and I are 50 years of age, and the W should have a disclaimer that this hotel is not suited for anyone older than 40! When we walked into this property we thought that the hotel was experiencing a "Power Outage".. no lighting except for candles-- we were told that it created an ambience, and for which I agree. The problem is, that it is way too dark in the hallways and the common areas. There are steps leading to the lower lobby--steps that you can barely see. I can only imagine that one day, the ambience will be quickly changed due a lawsuit. Even the hallways leading to your room was dim...ridiculous!

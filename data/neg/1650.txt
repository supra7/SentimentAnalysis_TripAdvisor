I am writing this review after having given the Hyatt a chance to respond. Since they have not responded, I am publishing an honest review of our actual experience. My Partner and I vacationed in Maui from Nov. 10 through Nov. 16 at the Hyatt Resort on the Kanapali coast near Lahaina. First, when we checked in between 7 pm and 7:30 pm on our first night, they did not have our King bed available. The front desk told us they would put us on a waiting list for a King room and for checking in that night they would put us in a queen and full-bed room with an upgraded partial ocean view room. After eating, it was dark so we pulled the curtains and went to bed. To our utter amazement, the front desk neglected to tell us that our "upgraded" partial ocean front view was blocked by a construction crane that stood taller than the hotel and that roofing material would be hauled right past our balcony. There was no warning of construction and no warning that we would receive such a bad room. I called the front desk the morning that I saw and HEARD the crane and found out they were repairing the roof and asked very politely to be switched. I asked them to please transfer us to the king room. The front desk stated that they would call us as one became available, but none were. I called everyday for 3-days until more than halfway through our 5-night vacation, they transferred us. We spent sizeable sum of money at the Hyatt that week, using the Spa for multiple appointments, eating in all of the hotel restaurants, and when we checked out, saw our bill, and there was not even a courtesy credit for the rooms, my partner told me not to ruin our vacation and just write a complaint letter after we leave. We selected the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort because we thought that it was the best hotel on the Kanapali beach. Clearly we were mistaken. I am afraid that neither of us will be able to recommend the Hyatt Regency Resort at Kanapali in Lahaina, Maui.

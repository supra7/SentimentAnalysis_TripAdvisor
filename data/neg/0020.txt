This hotel is horrible! I stayed for valentines weekend one night until I could move into my time shares, and it is NOTHING like the pictures it promotes. You do not get flat screens or a view. We stayed in a room that looks like its from the eighties with a twenty dollar TV! Also, our view was a balcony that you cannot step out onto with a huge eight foot concrete retaining wall. I called down right after we checked in and got the "we cannot refund your money or do anything about it" response. We called everywhere we could to not sleep there and forget about our money. Another thing,You do not get free breakfast either and the hospitality was far from professional. Expedia went as far as sending us a hundred dollar voucher in exchange for the pictures we took of worn down room! don't believe the star rating I would never stay here ever again!

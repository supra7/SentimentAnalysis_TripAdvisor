The streets are under renovation, but the hotel isn't... and it needs a good one. Towels are worn-out and have holes, there isn't a shower cup in the bathroom, the shower courtain is quite old, the reception has two sofas and a couple of armchairs, but no bar. The hotel has a very smal pool and a very small fitness room. Is not worth the price they charge you. You have better options in Chicago.

I stayed at the Max from March 3 - 5. I had two double beds in the room. The room size was fine for two people. The bathroom was tiny. You could never have more than one person in there at a time. There were three issues with regards to the hotel: 1. You can hear everything that goes on outside. They need to have better insulation for sound. I could hear people yelling outside in the middle of the night, trucks in the morning. I come from a major city that has lots of noise so it usually doesn't bother me. I was up all night with the noise. 2. When I informed the checkout desk about the noise, the woman laughed and said they should have a sign saying no yelling. Not a very good response from a customer service agent. 3. The beds were very uncomfortable. They seemed to slope towards the middle. I found some of the employees to have a little bit of an attitude. I really liked the stylist decor and the price, however I would not return to the hotel.

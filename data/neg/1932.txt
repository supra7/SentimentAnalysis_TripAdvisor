The accommodation was ok, however we had a never ending saga regarding a stolen Ipad and believe it or not we still have not received a return phone call in 6 months after logging a security report. We pulled up at the motel and handed our keys to a trump parking attendant who parks the car for you. As we lined up in reception my wife realised she had left our iPad on the back seat, I looked out and our car was still sitting outside, when I walked outside to get the ipad i realised they had not locked the car. I asked them to move and lock the car. When I checked the car our iPad which we had left on the back seat accidentally was already gone in the space of less then 5 minutes. Well, while its not ideal, the worst is still to come. We logged a security report, and have contacted the motel about 6-7 times both from the US and then back in Australia (at a cost), each time they promise to get the head of security to call us back regarding our report and feedback. While they are apologetic we still have not received a call in 6 months and still no feedback. Not good enough service and security given you pay the money for this service. If they at least called us back even if we could get no compensation we would have appreciated it. Sorry guys but I'd be staying somewhere else!

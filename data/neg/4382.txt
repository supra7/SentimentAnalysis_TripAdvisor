found other peoples' stuff under the bed - very dirty under tv table even had old traces of food. very noisy out side of room did not sleep through any of the four nights, trucks, buses, garbage trucks throughout the night. staff was very stuffy- unless you flashed a lot of money. not a good stay. the building is very pretty and very old that was the nicest thing of the stay. very over priced at over $400 per night - not even a doughnut for breakfast.

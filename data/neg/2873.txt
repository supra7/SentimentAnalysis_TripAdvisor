A very basic hotel This hotel is not near the airport by road - it is approximately 20 minutes away. The pickup service from the airport picks up from the departure floor, which is very confusing. The service cannot be pre-ordered, but once you arrive at the airport, phone the hotel, and wait 15 minutes for the car to arrive.The non-smoking room smelled very strongly of cigarettes, particularly the bedding. The bed was very hard, and there was only one pillow provided for each of us. The bathroom was small and very basic - no luxuries here! The shower had a shower curtain, which I haven't seen in a hotel for a long time.The lighting in the room was so bad that we used a torch to pack our things when we left.The breakfast was generous, but had been mostly prepared the evening before, the juice was lukewarm and the bread stale.On a positive note, the receptionists we dealt with were very friendly and helpful.We chose this hotel because it was an 'airport' hotel, and were very disappointed in the position and the facilities. Certainly not worth the price we paid.

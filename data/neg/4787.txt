I stayed here for a recent work conference and had a terrible experience. My room was in the renovated North Tower, but I found crumbled and missing bathroom tiles, torn carpet and... worst of all... bed bugs. On the second night of my four night stay, I noticed small red bumps on my arm. The next day I had tons of itchy red bed bug bites on my arms and stomach. Ugggggghhh. I contacted the hotel to notify them and super-washed everything in my suitcase. Housekeeping is obviously lacking - two days out of the four, I didn't receive any washcloths and the bath towels I put on the floor to be replaced were folded and rehung (damp towels were the tip-off). I finally left a note with an extra tip asking for washcloths -- arrived back in the room to find the tip gone and no washcloths. Nice. Beyond the rooms, the food and service are average. The meeting space seemed okay. Downtown Dallas isn't the best location, but at least some nicer parts of town are a quick cab ride away. Leave yourself 30 minutes to go to and from the airport. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If you stay here, check for bed bugs.

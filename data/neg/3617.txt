Needed to stay in area for hospital. Made reservation through Expedia. Reservation was for king and double. They tried to give a king and sofa. Finally got two doubles. He told me he couldn't reduce the rate below $120 because the two double beds were actually supposed to be more. Person ahead of me got a suite for less than I paid ($99). Room didn't smell good. Air conditioner didn't work good. Finally got TV working, but it was not clear. (Snowy). Beds were clean and bathroom was clean. Will not stay there again, though.

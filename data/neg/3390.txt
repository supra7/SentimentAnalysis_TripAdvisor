A "Gentlemen's Club" is right next door. I was tired and needed to fly out early so I settled on this hotel. There were meth-heads in the parking lot at 2:30 a.m. I had read about the smashed window on Trip Advisor, but could not remember which hotel. At least the front desk clerk did not lie. He informed me that they often have vehicle windows broken through out the area. I would not rely on the hotel for shuttle service to catch a flight. They didn't follow through with a wake-up call. The facility is a little smokey. All the hotels seemed shady with nafarious characters off of Stemmons I35/Mockingbird/ Reagal Row area. However for the price this seemed to be a little cleaner and newer. Next time I will stay further away and probably pay more.

I've stayed at this hotel many times for business and this was the worst. My room was on the 5th floor over Whisky Park which is an in-hotel bar/nightclub. It's right next to the check-in area. I checked in at 10:30pm and when I got in the room, I could hear and feel it vibrate from the bass from the music in the bar. At 11:15pm I called down and asked when the music would stop. Very soon I was told. At 12:30am I went downstairs and the music was so loud I could hardly talk to the person at the front desk. They said that nothing could be done and the bar closed at 2am. I spoke to someone at the front door of the bar and I think they actually turned the music up. 4 floors above the bar and my room was vibrating and I could hear the bass. The hotel will do nothing. If you want to sleep before 2am, avoid the Park Plaza.

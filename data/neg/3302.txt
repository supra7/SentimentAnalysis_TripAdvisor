As long as everything is in your room then you should not have a problem. I was missing bowl, corkscrew. The DVD was never connected to the TV until the night before checkout. Several attempt was made to the front desk asking to have an engineer look at the DVD and TV. I gave permission for the engineer to come and look at it while we are away. I do not want to wait in the room for someone to come for something that was supposed to be connected. No one came only until the night before I checked out. I checked in on 8/2 and schedule to check out on 8/7. I was in Sea World on 8/6 and around 4:30 pm, Front Desk called me and said that I was supposed to checked out already on 8/6. I ask them to checked and confirmed the check out date and they said it is 8/6. I had to leave Sea World and head back to World Quest to fix the problem. I showed them the parking passed which show departure date as 8/7 and apparently their is a paper that all guests sign during check in which show the check in and check out date. No one bother to look at that paper which is the first paper staple to the bill which they looked at. My building is also very close to the wetland so animal make sound in the middle of the night.

This hotel seems to be in dire need of a complete renovation. The lobby is very nice, so I was very excited about what the room may look like. Once we got up to the room, we were dismayed to find that not only did we book a double and what we got was a very tight single (I visited extended family in Boston and was staying at the Park Plaza with my brother.) The bed in this room looked like someone just layed on the covers and got their dirty shoes all over it, and there was a half-drunk can of Mountain Dew on the nightstand. We went back downstairs to remedy the situation and the front desk manager was very accomodating. We got a different room (a double this time) but were disappointed with the dirty carpet, lack of working outlets in the bathroom and last but not least: skidmarks, yes skidmarks, in the base of the toilet bowl. Gross! There is a Whiskey Pakr bar, au bon pain, Bonfire restaurant (one of Todd English's), and a place called "Finale" where they have desserts and dessert wines, liquors, etc. which are all just a few steps from the front door of the hotel lobby. If you plan on only spending 7-9 hours of sleep time and barely any time getting ready, then this place is ideal. The hotel is close to many of the coolest places in Boston. I can not imagine going there with my fiancee for a relaxing "getaway" weekend.

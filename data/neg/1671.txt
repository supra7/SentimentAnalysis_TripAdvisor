My husband received a bonus in the form of "hyatt bucks" so we stayed here for 3 nights of an 8 night trip. We stayed the 3 nights before at the Marriott at Ko Alina on Oahu (which we LOVED) at $279.00 a night. We booked a non view room at the Hyatt, and believe me, we had a great view...of the parking lot. The price for the view? $369.00 plus numerous fees, bringing it to around $410.00 a night. I was told that I could upgrade for another $100.00 a night. YIKES. When we checked in, the parking lot (our view) had 2 large semi trucks (delivery trucks) with the engines running and the smell of gas in the air. I thought "great"...all this for only $400.00 a night! The rooms were smallish, not a great bathroom, needs serious upgrading as far as I was concerned. My husb. and I thought the grounds were dated and not 4 to 5 star material. Our lanai was tiny.. but we didn't even use it due to the "non view" Pool was OK, didn't use spa, didn't eat at the restaurants. Husband couldn't wait to leave and he said he would never go back. Waited 45 minutes for luggage to be delivered to room after check-in...wanted to get freshened up and hit the beach. Had to call down and ask for it. Upon check out, tried to use the Hyatt bucks, and get a refund of deposit held on my credit card, was told that they could not refund my credit card for the deposit even though I had asked this when I booked and was told yes. Had to come back a day later and clear things up with accounting department. Best part of the hotel is the location...and kids would like the pool...but we didn't have kids with us.

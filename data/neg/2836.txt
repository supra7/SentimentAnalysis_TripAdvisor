Checked other reviews and they mentioned you get moved to another hotel apon arrival. This is exactly what happened to us they mentioned the boiler was having trouble then mentioned the air conditioning wasn't working after asking further. After arguing for a few minutes they said we could stay across the road in the town house rooms. Got there and the room was tiny, could barely move! We decided this was terrible and checked out after an hour, was promised a full refund however have now been told by them this is not possible!

The hotel closes at midnight and if you dont reach there before, you stay out. Can you imagine? A city that excels at night, the hotel forces you to be back and spend it in there rooms! We booked a double room and what we got was a bunker. They didnt mention any such thing on the website. The place is beside some cathedral, so the bell sound will never let you sleep. But the most annoying part remains the timing. Overall very dissatisfied with the stay.

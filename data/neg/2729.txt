The Hampton Inn Southwind at Hacks Cross Road has bedbugs. A group of work buddies stayed there this week and found the bugs all over the room and themselves. They had to throw away everything - clothes, luggage, make up - all of it. They even took pictures of the bugs, they were huge! Management at the Hampton Inn did not seem surprised when informed of the bugs - they did comp the room but no way that will cover the cost of the infested items or the terrible experience. DO NOT STAY HERE. BEDBUGS EVERYWHERE!

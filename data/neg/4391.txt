First the good points, a wonderful old building in a great location, but it's geared up for corporate & weddings, there's no where to relax as a tourist, the price's for drink & food are extortanate, they boast of the best steak house in Boston, that's ok if you want to pay $150 each for a 2 course meal and a couple of glass's of house wine (we chose not to)

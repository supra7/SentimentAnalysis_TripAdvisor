We were doing multi-city traveling so decided to make sleeping arrangements lowest priority. This definitely was low. Southwest Airlines recommended this motel and we made reservations for 3 nights. We drove in late from Vancouver (1:30 a.m.) and boy were we surprised. There is a sliding barrier gate that is locked after a certain hour to keep out non-guests. They needed it as two guys off the very noisy entrance street tried to get in "to visit a friend" when we checked in. When they were made to leave they were shouting discrimination because we were getting in. People were wandering around the hotel all night making lots of noise. The room was musty and needed renovation. Remote control missing from it's anchored spot on the nightstand. At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out. Sleeping arrangements have made a huge leap in our priorities. We lost half a day of seeing Seattle by sleeping the next day out of exhaustion. Comfort, quiet and security were only $40 more across the street.

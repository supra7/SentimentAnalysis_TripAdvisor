I was looking for a Maui Hotel that had a great location and just the right amount of amenities. I wasn't interested in paying for "show," but I didn't want to feel like I'd missed something either. Who knows, this could be my only trip to Maui. We wanted to relax, be treated well, and get a feel for the Maui experience without spending more than necessary. We also wanted to be close to the "off-campus" things we wanted to do (sa. scuba diving.) We were blown away. This "campus" has enough going on that you could stay on site and be entertained for weeks! But, it's still understated, elegant, and serene. You can walk to other hotels/restaurants/entertainment along the river walk, take part in the Cirque show, shop, drink mai tais in the lagoon-style pool, stroll (my favorite) through the bird sanctuary/gardens, hang on the beach,..... and much more. Or, just be at peace with the beautiful scenery, ocean breezes, and room service, all at a competitive price.

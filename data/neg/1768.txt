When we arrived at this hotel for the start of our first year wedding anniversary, we couldn't have been more disappointed. The rooms are old and grubby and smell strongly of damp and mold. The beds are very uncomfortable. The grounds of the hotel are unkempt and shabby. The lobby area and 'restaurant' are filthy. The hotel calls itself the 'Most Hawaiian Hotel' on Maui. What a joke. We had to get out of the hotel early and book into another property nearby. For the price of the rooms, it is the biggest rip-off I have ever come across. Don't be fooled by its cowboy marketing on its website like we were. This hotel has no redeeming features and should be shut down.

This hotel has gone down hill since my last visit two years ago. The service is not very good and the carpeting smells moldy in the hallways. My room had a bathroom with two swinging doors and a 1/2" opening so have fun sitting on the throne in full view! I was there for business meetings but we will not be doing this again. There are many alternatives in the area that are much nicer. The Westin is next door and better, The Lenox, The Mandarin Oriental - beautiful... all within 5 minutes walk. Stay elsewhere!!

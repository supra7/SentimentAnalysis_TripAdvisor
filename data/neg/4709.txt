As you read this review, remember, this hotel claims to be a Hilton category 5 and a priceline 4 stars. So my standards are high - and so was the cost. They should call this place the house of NO. Everything amenity we asked for was no - no newspaper, no bathrobe, no free late check out, no queen size bed, no you cannot have a non-smoking room (watch out priceline customers, Hilton hotels are really discriminating against you.). The lobby was impressive, large and ornate. Fine - beautiful lobby. But that isn't where I am sleeping. I'll give you a quick run down. Carpets - dirty. Bathrooms small, beds - twin ( not great for a romantic weekend). Wallpaper faded and peeling. Service - what service. I get more amenities and help from a $39 Econolodge than from this overpriced glitzy tomb. I have stayed in other Chicago hotels (Hyatt, Embassy Suites, Marriott). And I didn't walk out of those feeling ripped off and pissed off. I am also going to write to Priceline tell them they need to remove one of the stars from this place.

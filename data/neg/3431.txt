The poor experience starts when you check in. I was alone while checking in. There were two people behind the reception desk, both on their phones, one attending to a new reservation and the other on a personal call. It took exactly 25 minute to check in. No apologies were offered for the delay. The rooms are totally outdated. There is no safe in the room. The food sucks. I ordered a hamburger and spend two hours throwing it up. The gym is awful. Breakfast is served in temporary location with space enough for half the people eating there. What else can I say. FIND ANOTHER HOTEL. THIS ONE IS A HORROR STORY.

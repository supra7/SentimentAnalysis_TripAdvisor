The Hyatt Regency is in a bad location; the area is being "gentrified". Best to come back in 20 years or so. Security is tight at every level. The hotel is tired, very tired. The Hyatt beds are so high that you require a step-stool just to get into bed. On the other hand the baths are low; no more than 8 inches of water possible. The staff are pleasant enough, but cannot be heard over the monstrously loud elevator music that pevades the lobby. The temperature controls in my room did not work, but the hotel service desk reassured me that this was not unusual; none of the controls work. It was freezing!!! Pick anoter hotel until they renovate.

On a recent US trip we probably stayed in about 10 hotels and this one wouldn't rank in the top 20! This is a very large and confusingly laid out hotel. When we found our room we discovered that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there were dirty towels lying around. We advised reception who promised immediate action. When we returned about 10 hours later nothing had been done. We were offered a change of room and the assistance of a three man team to move. We began loading our luggage ourselves and when no-one arrived I headed to reception to be greeted by one man with our new room key. He made no offer to assist. No facilities were open early next morning when we were headed for our flight (surprising in such a location where there were lots of people headed for early flights) and although there seem to be a lot of valet staff around, none of them made any effort to assist. We had decided to go with this hotel to save a small amount of money and as a change from the Cedarbrook lodge we had stayed in a couple of weeks before. Big mistake. On the basis of this experience I will never choose a Doubletree hotel again. It is just not worth the money.

a fire alarm went early in the morning, the stairwell was hot and elderly people could not make it down. No one helped, told us it was a false alarm and when I got down I told security about the children and people with health problems stuck on the stairs - still no help - told the door man and front desk - still no help - no managment staff and the bar profiteered by charging the guests for drinks while we had to wait a long time to get back up the elevators. sent an email to Trump corportation about the problem and they ony sent an automated response. Profiteering and no emergency help - not even an appology

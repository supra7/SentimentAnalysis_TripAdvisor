This hotel has slid downhill. The room had smoke detectors that would make noise periodically even though the batteries were not low. There were bare wood doors hanging on the closets. Management refused to return 5 separate contact attempts to resolve an issue. Service has never been this bad in the past, but it appears that all good things must come to an end. WIll not return and advise that you do the same.

Well it all started when trying to get checked in and it was pretty much the same from there on out. I get it, they are trying to be trendy, but after a long flight and day of traveling I just want to get to my room and relax. Upon walking into the lobby on a Wednesday evening, all I could here was obnoxiously loud house music coming from the bar just down the stairs. It was hard conversing at the front desk trying to get checked in, the young man working didn't seem to care if I stayed at their hotel or not. The room was ok, nothing special. You could tell a lot of time was spent to make sure everything was in its place, but you had the feeling that if housekeeping had to vacuum they would charge you for it. Turned out to be pretty much true, random charges for the in room mini bar(that I never touched), $.75/day for a newspaper I didn't want. The room and bathroom were pretty poorly lit. I'm surprised I was not charged for using the soap and shampoo. The customer service was the same at the front desk throughout my stay as the first night I checked in. I'm sorry the conference I was attending happened to be stationed in the hotel(the only reason I stayed there). This place has great potential, but to be honest I've been to Motel 6's with better class.

The good: Brilliant for Euston station and the underground ( a minute away - you can see the station). Rooms were basic and ours were clean. The shower worked and was hot. The bad: rotten mattress - i woke with a sore shoulder due to a battle with a rogue spring. The noise - the outside rooms are very noisy - I took earplugs which helped. The inside facing rooms are much quieter. There is no left luggage so you either hope to do an early check in (10) or go to left luggage at the station. The pillows are wafer thin and you get one. (Although I note my daughters' room had a spare on a shelf). The mixed: The staff were friendly but their IT system seemed to be lacking and got the better of them.

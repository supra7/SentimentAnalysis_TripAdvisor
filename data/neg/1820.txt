I arrived later than anticipated due to some problems with my car hire. The Receptionist did not speak English, and just repeated "No Reservation!" Even though my fiancee double confirmed, confirmed the free internet and has a series of email correspondance with Essam Elkomy, the manager. So, despite a bad bout of food poisoning, I had to find a usable wifi connection in Deira so I could book in somewhere else! And all this in between the hours of 2:30 and 7:00 in the morning. Never stay here, no guarantees!

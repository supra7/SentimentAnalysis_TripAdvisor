I won't ever stay at a W hotel again. Not even for free! The place is a downer. Dark hallways, dark carpet, subdued lighting, dull rooms. If I wanted to stay in a funeral home I would just die. Across the street is a nice hotel for about the same price as the W. (The Olympic) The staff is nice, but they can't make up for the "dead zone" dcor. Maybe the Goth crowd will keep this hotel alive; or maybe the vampires will find it a peaceful place to camp out when the sun is shining.

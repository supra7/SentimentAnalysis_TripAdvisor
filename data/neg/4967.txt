not really a nice place,nor an evil place...just o;d. thus cheap (35 us) so nothing to complain especially. if you stay in the tower which is newer it might be kind of brighter.the windows opened to an interior ward (yes...jail atmosphere) ,but noisy from the outside beggars and roomstaff carts that had to be moved permamently in front of the cells...oops rooms :) noisy!!! and awful nordic smoking and screaming tourist in the hallways :) and bums on the street. better avoid this paty of vegas.fremont street is kind of run down and very thirdworld like. i changed the hotel and went to palace station later. this one is okay for 35 bucks but try to avoid it. ahhh....rooms are clean and have coffe e maker, room service is efficient and staff is friendly....but tn total between poor and average....avoid it:)

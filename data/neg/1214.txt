The Place Needs Work We arrived after dark and this place is close to an industrial area and there were absolutely no lighted signs on this hotel which made it very hard to find. We passed it a couple of times before we spotted their sign. Another gent at check in said he had the same problem. Front desk said the sign is on a timer and doesn't light up until 9:30 PM! But wait - there's more. The room faced South and the sun and it was 90 deg in the room according to the thermostat. Of course the air con would not work, there was a small window which did nothing to cool off the room. So we slept on top of the covers. The air con came on at 0830 the next morning. Front desk said the air con was also on a timer and there was nothing they could do. There was no suitcase stand in the room (a first for me). The free Internet of course was not working and the front desk said this was the first time this had happened - a likely story. The desk clerk the next morning said there was a new owner who was going to upgrade the place. It was supposed to be a three star hotel but it's really a two star.

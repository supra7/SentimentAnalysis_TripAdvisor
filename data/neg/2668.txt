My mom and I stayed here for one night during the NCAA Final Four because our cruise was leaving the next day out of the Port of New Orleans. The hotel, while being on Canal Street, is further away from the "touristy" area (Bourbon Street, Harrah's Casino, etc), but my mom and I are walkers so it did not bother us. Check in was easy. I confirmed myu reservation with the hotel directly as this was Final Four weekend and there were absolutely NO rooms. We got our keys and waited for the elevator. And waited. And waited. Even though the hotel had two elevators, both were very slow. I want to chalk that up to the fact that the hotel was to capacity (?). We got to our flor and at first we weren't sure if we were in the same building as the hallway was very "hospital" looking. We got to our room, which had two double beds, a bathroom with the tiniest sink I have ever seen, and a kitchen area with a sink, microwave, and refridgerator. We left our things and went sight seeing. There were a number of people hanging around on the opposite corner, but nothing we haven't seen in our hometown (Philadelphia, PA). We came back after sight seeing and called it a night. The next morning, we ate breakfast (good selection including eggs, muffins, bagels, and waffles). Check out was easy and we took the streetcar to the Cruise port. Everything was great until later that night when I started itching on my right forearm. I pull up my sleeves and my arm was so red and I couldn't believe it! There were bite marks all over the place. It put a realy damper on the first two days of the cruise because I was itching a lot and my mom and I had to go to the infirmary to get antibiotics, anti-itch cream, and alcohol pads to clean out the area. Eventually, the bites went down and I enjoyed my trip. All in all, if it wasn't for the bed bugs, this hotel would've gotten three stars.

DO NOT,I repeat, DO NOT ever stay here! What these people are doing is fraud. Online, their motel looks decent and doable, we thought, "how bad could it really be?" Well, we answered our own question. When we got there, the pool was small but that wasnt a problem. We checked in, got to our room and it smelled like mold and must. So we opened the window. As we looked over our room, we found mold on the walls, in the bathtub, on the floor, in the fridge, and in the cupboards. In the bathroom, there were pubes, yes pubic hair people! in the toilet. If that wasnt bad enough, under the blanket on the bed, the sheets were stained and there was human hair all over the pillows and sheets. Not to mention the dirty, used, snotty tissues on the floor. It also looked as if a vacuum was never used! I think you get the picture. we will NEVER stay there ever, and didnt stay for even 10 min.

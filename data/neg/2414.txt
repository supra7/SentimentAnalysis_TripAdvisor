I went to Courtyard Marriott and no problems going in and going up to my room. I finally get there, go out to eat and realize that my card has been declined. I booked the trip on travelocity and so everything was already paid for, but apparently Courtyard decided to run the card again by "accident" for $1200. Since I had about $1000 in the back, basically my card was declined and I had no money to spend. When I told the front desk, they said they would release it after the weekend when the banks opened back up. So because the hotel made this mistake, I was stuck not able to spend any money and not eat for the weekend, and I got no gesture from the hotel as well.

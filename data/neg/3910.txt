The hotel itself was very nice -- nice beds, lots of pillows of various kinds, down comforters, nice sheets, clean, nice shampoos and things. The tub is small; I'm 5'3" and I just fit. Plenty of hot water, and there's this neat system where the towel rack is *inside* the shower, and the towels don't get wet and they get nice and warm. The buffet meals were very good. My complaint is about the Internet connectivity; first, they don't even tell you there's wifi, just give you two one-foot cables that can only be used from the desk. I did a search for wifi and did find it, which cost $10 a day. I was surprised, though, when I went to the conference facility, and couldn't get wifi. Oh, I was told, the wifi is only for the rooms! In fact, if I wanted to use the wifi in the lobby, that was run by Starbucks and I'd have to pay an *additional* $10 a day. If I wanted to use the Internet in the conference facility, I'd have to pay $300 for the first connection and $100 after that! They said this was due to performance, and I can believe it; even in the room, the wifi kept dropping. So, don't come here expecting to be able to work during a conference...

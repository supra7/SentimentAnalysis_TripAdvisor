I was charged twice for parking. I had trouble getting that settled during check out because I had to wait multiple times for the right person to take care of double charges. I am a Diamond member, the wait for Hhonors line was terrible since no one was at the reception desk. I had trouble getting to the manager on-site; she blew me off by me telling to wait even more once she came to the front desk. So I just left. Also, the password for WiFi was useless, there was no WiFi signal on my floor. The elevator didn't work on the ground floor; I had to go to the 1st floor to catch the elevator. Overall, it was an inconvenient stay.

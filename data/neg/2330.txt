Let me tell you this the worst area in the hotel!! First of the they have the worst Customer Service reps at the front desk. They are rude and inpersonal. When i walked into the hotel, I was surprised to see that this was a Fairfield Inn, the place seemed run down and old. My husband and I do a fair bit of travelling and let me tell you, I have never seen anything like this before. When I got upstairs to my room, the room was filthy, carpet was moldy, bathroom had mold and when we checked under the bed, there was bed bugs......YES YOU READ CORRECT BED BUGS!!!!! At that point my husband and I decided to leave. There are 3 other hotels in the area, The Hampton Inn, Microtell and Staybridge. From our research the Hampton Inn's scored the best! So we went across the street and reserved there. The Hampton Inn's provided us with such a warm experience of Philadelphia. The Manager Chris is outstanding and truly values the Customer Experience! It might be a few dollars more but for your health and sanity, trust me stay at the Hampton's. DO NOT GO TO THE Fairfield Inn. The Manager Paulette -- should not be in business!

I stayed here twice within a week and wish that I hadn't. While the location of this hotel is brilliant, as a hotel it is not good at all. The rooms are 'trendy' but uncomfortable, the beds are far too hard for comfort, and the rooms have insufficient lighting. The service is poor, apart from the people on the concierge desk who are very helpful. There are no clocks in the rooms (! - for an airport hotel, this is bizarre), although if you ask for one they will bring one. While it is nice to get out of the airport, you can't actually get any fresh air or go for a walk, as when you walk out of the front door of the hotel you are immediately under a freeway flyover. The hotel is very expensive, as are internet charges in the room and you even have to pay to use a computer in the buisness centre (which is not open at the advertised hours)!. I don't consider that it has many advantages over the transit hotel within the airport, and if you have time to do more than sleep I would recommend the Changi Village hotel which is only a short taxi ride away and is much more pleasant.

Tired and tatty and the words that immediately came to mind when we arrived at this hotel. There are some good points - its location is excellent right on the beach with a decent size garden. There are sufficient loungers dotted around the garden, which means that no matter the time of day you can be sure of finding some free. However, the rooms are in drastic need of refurbishment and the accommodation blocks reminded me of an army barracks. The worst point about this hotel, however, was the attitude of some of the staff. It sells itself on the 'Aloha' spirit. Their concierge staff certainly missed out on this part of the training as all they were interested in was selling trips (for which they doubtless get commission) and were not very willing or helpful when it came to giving information about the area or island generally. The person I spoke to was rather rude, giving the impression I was wasting her time when she could be selling trips to other people! Whatever you do don't go to the Plate restaurant - it is probably the worst food I have ever had. It is school/works canteen at its worst. Would I go to this hotel again - absolutely not. Would I go to Ka'anapali - yes definitely.

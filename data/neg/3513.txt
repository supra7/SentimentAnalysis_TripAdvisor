We booked this hotel based on ratings and virtual tour. We asked for high room, when we got there at 4:00PM we were told all the rooms with good views were already filled. We were put in a room above the 15th floor but it was next to the elevators and the noise from them was intolerable. We requested a quiet room and were moved to a lower floor, away from the elevator. This was close enough to the street that the street noise could now be heard. Being too tired to move again we gave up and stayed where we were. The noise finally died down and we were able to get some sleep. The bed at least was comfortable, and the sheets, although the fitted sheet was inside out, were clean. The continental breakfast didn't look good, eggs appeared under cooked and the sausage over cooked. We checked out sooner than expected.

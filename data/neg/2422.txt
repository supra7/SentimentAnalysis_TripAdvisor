I don't expect miracles from bargain accommodation, great at 15 to 20 but when the start smacking on New Years Eve premiums, it looks poor value. Room was OK, pillows were really poor, although we did get more from reception. Bed certainly showing signs of wear and now not that comfortable. Reception reasonable but a cheery smile and welcome doesn't cost anything. Breakfast, although reasonable value, why do they have to spoil it with silly ideas. Watering down orange juice to the point of oblivion is just plain mean and why, oh why, do we have to have a large screen TV blaring out football at breakfast. I'm good at rising early and found it objectionable, how those who don't like mornings cope I do not know. Use it, if you can get a bargain and have breakfast at Euston station.

I stayed for 2 nights and oh my goodness, I thought I was in a terrible dream ! The elevator was broken and when I asked how long, I was told by the staff "for a couple MONTHS', the vent in the bathroom was falling out the ceiling, the only sconce in the room was falling off the wall, the television did not work...when I walked downstairs and informed the front desk , I was offered another room ON THE FIFTH FLOOR ( remember the elevator is broken ) the drapes were VERY dusty no dirty, the carpet was visibly filthy, I dared not leave my suitcase open and on the floor for fear something may crawl in, the closet was unusable, the ironing board was filthy ( at least the iron worked ), seems like all the air conditioning was in the lobby, the room was very stuffy with no thermostat, the desk needed to be cleaned, I wouldnt think about partaking in their "continental breakfast" as I may come down with something...and I could go on. This was a true dump. We were astonished that they are allowed to keep their doors open. It is my mission to find some way to have the authorities whip them in to shape or shut this roach nest down. I am not very picky but I felt the need to write about this messy place. A Hotel with five floors and no elevator ??????? C'mon now !

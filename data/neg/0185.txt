If you have an unlimited budget to purchase amenities provided free at many other places, then the Crowne Plaza is the place for you! My husband and I, along with another couple reserved 2 rooms for 3 nights. During our occasional 2 and 3 day stays in Seattle, we prefer a hotel that provides a microwave and refrigerator. The Crowne Plaza has no microwaves available, but will rent a refrigerator to their "guests" for $25/night. Don't look for a free breakfast here. Not even a beverage in the lobby. Local phone calls cost $1.25/each. We emailed the manager before our stay expressing our concern that there was no complimentary wi-fi. We didn't get the courtesy of a reply. Upon check-in, the same manager told us that a room was not yet available, but that she would call us on our cell phone when it was ready. She didn't! I was directed to the "business center" to access online information. There I found that the hotel charges an exhorbitant hourly rate for internet access. I chose to live without internet access. The room was well appointed, clean, and comfortable. The location is within reasonable walking distance to most downtown attractions. But we won't be staying at the Crowne Plaza again.

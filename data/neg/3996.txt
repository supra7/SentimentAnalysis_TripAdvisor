We got to the hotel at 9:20PM and after a long wait at the reception line where two staff members were working, ever so slowly, completely ignoring the waiting line snaking around. We were told that our room was not available becasue it had not been cleaned. The receptionist offered for us to freshen up in another room and then move to our king bed room after it being cleaned. However once he consulted with his senior colleague, she said that she would not be able to put us in a clean room first. After we pushed back really hard and questioned why a room was not cleaned at this hour, they finally conceded and offered for us to dine at the lobby restaurant on the house while the room was being cleaned. And yes, the dinner bill showed up on when we checked out, as feared. Having to explain the whole experience to a different receptionist was a painful and embarrasing and agnizing process. When it was said and done, we were very turned off. Oh, that is not to mention that the plastic-wrapped cups were so misplaced in a hotel of this heritage and opulance, and the doors and bathrooms and furnishing were so tired and the layers of paint=-on-paint in the bathroom was quite unsightly. Spartan at the best and awful awful service. Even Hyatt Regency delivers wall street journal. The "old world charm" doesn't have to resist the better media.

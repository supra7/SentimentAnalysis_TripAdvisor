hotel looked fine in the foyer till you paid for a room. went to check the pool out no water in and absolutely filthy, at night there were all sorts of people on car park fixing bikes and revving car engines didn't feel safe to leave hotel after dark especially being senior citizens. hotel in a run down area of memphis would not recommend it at all. pay that extra ten dollars it will be worth it and find somewhere else

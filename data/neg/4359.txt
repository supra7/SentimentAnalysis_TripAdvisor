I am going bullet the highlights it's much easier to read: * I was with two (2) co-workers for this trip and a client. We had a nice rate for being right in the heart of Boston. All of our flights arrived early , so I had called ahead two days before our arrival to arrange an early check-in for myself (Co-worker and my client) * Hotel is hard to find if you are looking it up on anything online because of the name change and it's not that easily seen from the street. * Parking layout is interesting and does not look so good * We arrived at 12pm and the property looks great very clean, but we were welcomed by numerous signs on large boards explaining they were sold out the night before and check-in might be a little slower and early checks were not allowed. Their intentions might have been good by communicating this sold-out problem ahead of time, but every person I saw (including myself and co-worker) were put on edge the moment they read the sign a lot of "oh great were in trouble now" kind of feelings...So your angry before you even get to the desk * When we went to the desk I informed them that I requested an early check-in and it was confirmed two days ago I was out of luck cause the rooms were not ready. * They took my cell phone # and told me they'd call me when the room was ready (almost four hours later)(called at 4pm) * Food in restaurant was "okay" service was excellent , Soup was really really bad (their special chicken noddle) , told the waiteress and she took it off the bill * Got to my room at 4pm , looks great I think that I was put in a larger room based on the problems at check-in cause my co-workers all complained their rooms were super small. * My client did not get into his room until 8pm (all the rooms were still not ready) , only to be woken up at 12am by a false alarm fire drill , hotel desk/security people forgot they were outside and never advised them to come back inside.......Which is really strange cause nobody knocked on my door to let me know their was a fire alarm....(that made me feel safe)...no alarm speakers in the hotel rooms * Hard beds ...very very low to the ground * No bath soap in room regardless of how many times I called and asked for it , they have the dispenser in the shower with three types of soaps (mine was broken) * Bellmen took forever to deliever luggage , they were busy so I'll cut them some slack on this , but I did need to call and remind them they had my luggage twice * Internet is all WI-FI by T-mobile , you need to log on to their site and pre-pay to them. If you do not have a wi-fi card you can get an adapter (make sure to call ahead on this I got the last one) , a $250 refundable deposit is taken until it's returned on checkout * Overall great looking hotel (except the hard beds) , but you get the feeling the staff is new and just learning how to deal with being busy....So ...great product without the customer service to match it.

This hotel is dated. Noisy, huge. If you are looking for a Hawaiian retreat - keep looking. There is no beach, it has been washed away. You feel like you are on a school camp. You need a ticket to get a beach towel and once you have lined up and received the towel they tag you! Yes, if you don't want to be tagged - no towel. They have huge birds in tiny cages and poor birds with their wings clipped sitting all day doing nothing the poor things. I thought we were more aware these days about animals - obviously the hyatt needs to update their ethos. Flamingoes living on tiny areas of grass. This place is disgraceful! On top of all this jackhammers are going from 9 - 4! The room rates should be halved! Even then I wouldn't stay here. The only small thing here is the business centre..2 computers for the whole 3 tower resort! At least they don't tag you while you use them. The rooms themselves are comfortable and clean. Bed is comfy and good pillows. The bathroom is dated and dark. The view from the ocean view room is lovely. The air con works well. Really I think this is one of the worse hotel experiences I've had! Also they charge $25 resort fee on top of the bill, per day. Not sure if this is advertised, I didn't see it. Without the jackhammers may be ok, if you don't like the beach and you don't mind massive, impersonal hotels. With the construction work...stay away.

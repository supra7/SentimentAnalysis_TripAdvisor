I was scheduled to stay at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront as part of a business conference in April 2009. I was unable to make the conference, but received a charge on my credit card of almost $300 for a "no-show" fee. There had been a mix-up with the cancelation of the reservation and I called to try and get it sorted out. My assistant and I called for three weeks, and left messages with several individuals, none of whom ever returned the call. When I finally got hold of someone in early June, they told me there was nothing they could do if I did not have a cancellation number to prove the reservation was cancelled. Even though I am a Hilton Honors member who often stays at Hilton hotels, they would not even explore the option of giving me a credit rather than requiring me to pay $300 for a room I never used. I found them to be very unaccommodating and difficult to deal with, and completely unconcerned with the satisfaction of the customer. I will likely stay at hotels other than Hilton hotels from now on, where possible.

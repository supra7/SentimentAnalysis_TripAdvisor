We stayed here because of a "free mini vacation" . So, this hotel was chosen for us. We were early but were told we could not check in until exactly 3:00. When we did, the room stunk like BO. We went and bought air freshner ! The fridge was dirty too. did not use that. The vending machines were broken. After son swam I hung his shirt on balcony to dry instead of dripping in room. A staff member came by and took it. Both days the breakfast was empty by the time we got there . One morning we were there at 7:00 AM . did not eat there ! To top it all off, when we checked out, they would not verify our stay so that we could get reimbursed for our "free mini vacation" Ended up paying for a lousy hotel !! Go somewhere else !!

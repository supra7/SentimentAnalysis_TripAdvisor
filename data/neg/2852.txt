A remarkably quiet hotel on the edge of a residential district and a redevelopment area. Standard Holiday Inn. The only criticisms were that despite the 30 C heat , the ice machine was broken for the whole week that we were there and the rugby scrum that takes place after 8.30 am at breakfast. Too many guests in too small a breakfast buffet area.

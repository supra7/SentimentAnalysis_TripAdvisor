Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of "name your price" at priceline. I have rarely had an issue with the hotels that I have "won". However, on my most recent trip to Vegas, I "won" or should I say "lost" cause I ended up staying at the TRUMP in Vegas. I will start by stating that the rooms were nice and the lobby was pretty but boring. The hotel does not have a casino. They also charged me $15 + around $2 tax for two very small bottles of water, access to a swimming pool which was closed most of the time and "free (according to the attendent) valet parking". The fees were manditory and I could not check in without agreeing to pay. I was not happy, what was the point of naming my price if I was going to be forced to pay more to check in? That aside, I would also like to point out that the valet was very very slow, taking up to 20 minutes for the car to arrive. Also, the hotel was quiet but the trains outside were very loud. I was on the 40th floor with nothing between my room and the trains. yikes!

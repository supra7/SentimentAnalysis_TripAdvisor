Hotel itself is not bad, room is comfortable, the breakfast are OK, but it was the first time that my items were stolen from my room. I arrived in the evening, checked in and went to my room. Next day I was having a meeting and I left my bathing items, cosmetics, etc. on the table, together with my book. After the whole day I came back to the hotel and my stuff was missing. I've contacted the reception desk, but the lady was only surprised, no action at all. I suggested to call housekeeping to ask them about this, I suspected they found my stuff and brought it to the reception desk, but they did not. So, the only thing I could do is to write them a letter asking if they find the items to sent them to my address, but that was a few weeks ago and no response so far. It is good I didn't leave my laptop there. I am aware, that it might be an isolated case, but it happened to me and please be aware with this hotel. I hope they are checking now if the inhabitant stays in the room for another night or not, in my case probably they didn't and clean the room to be ready for a new guest, however, it shouldn't happen that my stuff is missing. Other hotels gathering left items and contact recent guests to ask what to do with the items, either trash them or send them somewhere. I do travel a lot and stay in various hotels, but this was the first time something like that happened to me.

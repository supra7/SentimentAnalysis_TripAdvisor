Worst hotel experience ever! I stay at hotels about 1.5 months a year nver had I experience an overbooking issue that I was involuntarily been asked to use another hotel. I am an SPG member and booked with AMEX as GUARANTEED room about 3 weeks before arrival date. Went to the hotel at 9PM .. alot of ppl still checking in everything seems fine. Agent took a while when back and told us it was overbooked and they will accommodate us at the Fairmont. I was okay with that as I am a FQTV member at Fairmont and it is technically a higher graded hotel, Just the location not as preferred, the only reason why I chose the Sheraton. I asked if it was a 2 double bed as I booked my room as 2 double. Agent said no, it is a King bed but can get a rollaway bed in the room. I asked to to call Fairmont again and see if they can get us 2 Beds. After 20 min the Manager with the agent came out and told us they tried calling all the hotels in seattle and no one has 2 Beds.. he then said Hotel Monaco is my only choice. I was wait... didnt the agent said there was one king bed at fairmont.. he said not anymore. Hotel Monaco i asked... i have nver heard of it and the logo looks like a hostile .. he said it was part of the kimpton hotel and the room is a "suite" king bed with rollaway bed. He then pointed out my hotel rate was only $119 and the hotel monaco "suite" is $260.. he told me the difference is the compensation of this ordeal.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I dont care if i payed a dollar to get your room.. I paid for a SHERATON room for SHERATON central location.. now your sending me 5 huge blocks away that is not walking distance and the hotel was CRAP... monaco looked like i went to a tacky mexico resort and it was definitely not a suite! Called RES and they couldnt do anything..... NEVER BOOK SHERATON SEATTLE! I do not believe the hotel was 100% booked.. they could have UPGRADE others who've paid more to suites .. or those in suites to president suite.

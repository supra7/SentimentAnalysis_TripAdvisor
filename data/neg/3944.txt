On arrival I couldn't be checked in as there was only one name on the room list. It should have been two names. After showing the front desk lady my reference nr I was finally checked in. When a friend of mine staying at the same hotel tried to call my room nr I was not registered and after complaining, again they forgot to register me, as then my family tried to call me. The room was dirty, especially behind the tv set, it needed a good vacuum cleaning, walls paper thin and bathroom very small. No coffee machine and when asked for one it took a whole day. Very unprofessional staff at the desk. I give it a miss.

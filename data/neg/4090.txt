We were a little deceived by the lavish luxury and splendour of the reception hall of this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights in what was described as a king-sized bedroom on the 9th floor . We could hardly move in the room it was so small. I would describe it as functional rather than comfortable and certainly no hint of luxury. The only place to hang our clothes was a hook on the bathroom door - we couldn't believe it but there was no wardrobe! Just a few drawers. The bathroom was ok, clean, but nothing special. We were out sightseeing most of the time so we weren't too worried about the room. However it could be quite depressing if the weather was bad and you spent more time there. The window was quite close to the building opposite, so the room was dark , even on a sunny day, and the lighting was inadequate. I would recommend this hotel purely for its central location. There were several restaurants very close by and the Common and start of the Freedom Trail were only a few minutes walk away.

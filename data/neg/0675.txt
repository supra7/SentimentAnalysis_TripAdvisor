Talk about lipstick on a pig! The rooms on the water have great views; the rooms on the other side enjoy the railroad tracks. The rooms are so small if someone sits at the desk others cant walk behind. The desk is about half the depth of normal in an attempt to create more room but it doesnt work. You can always tell a hotel with a lipstick job by the room doors, the doors here are several generations old. The lobby has a cathedral ceiling but still feels cramped, hallways are narrow, and elevator doors look like 1965 Holiday Inn elevator doors repainted 20 times. The neighborhood is industrial and not inviting after dark. The hotel is too far from Pike Market and downtown shops to walk. Beds are OK except bottom sheet are not fitted which means you may enjoy sleeping on the mattress pad.

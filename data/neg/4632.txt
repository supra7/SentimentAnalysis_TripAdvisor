We checked in at 8pm, waited in line for a half hour - obviously due to the shorted staff. By 9pm we were in our room (handicapped, but smoking). The wall paper was peeling off the walls and the showerhead was coated with lime. We ordered a pizza from the room, costing $1.50 to use the hotel phone, waited an hour and it never came. By 10 pm, we were exhausted from traveling and starving so we ordered room service and paid $50, twice, for our meal -- 2 cheeseburgers at $12 a piece including a rediculously high gratuity -- AFTER we had spoken with a hotel associate, making it very clear to him that we were going to pay for our room service with cash at check out and not to charge our credit card; he assured me our meal would not be charged to our credit card. Our burgers were ordered a medium well -- they arrived cold and cooked rare, my fiance woke in the morning, spending an hour in the bathroom with a stomach ache. Four days later, our checking account is overdrawn because the hotel withdrew $50 for our disgusting cheeseburgers -- after I had specifically discussed with the hotel associate not to charge our account. At 2am the smoking alarms went off in our room, ripping my fiance and I from our sleep; two and a half hours later, we were awoken again to the sounds of loud screaming and banging on walls and banging through the floor beneath us -- this went on until 6am. When we called the front desk, nobody answered the first two times and then I was placed on hold for 10 minutes. We were not impressed by our stay and were so happy to leave; we finally got a good night's rest at the Marriott in Burr Ridge, Ill. I will never return to the Palmer House again -- I have traveled all over this country and many times to Europe and the Palmer House was the most wretched and stressful stay in a hotel I have ever experienced.

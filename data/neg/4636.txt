I found the staff to be surly, aloof and very unhelpful. I discovered my room rate when I checked in was higher than the printout the hotel sent me ahead of time. When I contacted Guest "Services" to discuss it, I was greeted with, "So whatta you want?" My room was huge, with not one but two tiny bathrooms. I paid their early checkout fee and moved to the Hotel Burnham down the street and had a superbly wonderful time, aided by friendly helpful staff at every turn. (The room cost less, too.)

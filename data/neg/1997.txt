If you value your sleep, do yourself a favor and don't stay here. Our 3 night stay was interrupted every night by the unbelievably loud horns of the freight trains that run past this hotel day and night. On a good night you might be woken once, on a bad night it could be 3 or 4 times. I consider myself a fairly heavy sleeper but was woken every single time. If we were staying any longer in Las Vegas we would have had to switch hotels. On the plus side, the staff here are all very pleasant, the rooms are fairly nice (great jet tub), and the distance to the strip just a few minutes walk, either via the sidewalk or through Nordstrom's across the street at the Fashion Plaza mall. We have stayed in many different hotels in Las Vegas and decided to try the Trump for a change of scene. Unfortunately the train issue was a really big deal for us and we will unfortunately not be returning.

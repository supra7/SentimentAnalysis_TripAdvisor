Unfortunately a conference, sponsored by a local university, had taken place for two days prior to our arrival and the students left the hotel hallways, lobby and elevators full of trash which was still there the following morning. Plus, once checked out, the students hung around the lobby in groups apparently waiting for flights, again leaving trash on tables, etc, which also was not picked up by the time we returned from dinner later that night . Perhaps the hotel staff was overwhelmed. Its the only excuse I can think of to explain our experience. Our room had a very dirty heating unit which meant that when the heat was on it blew dust into the room. The shades were ripped. The bedskirt, which was ripped from the bottom of the bed to the headboard, was held together by safety pins. The Keurig coffee machine was filthy. We wiped it out with a tissue but decided to go to Au Bon Pain next door for coffee in the morning. I didn't expect a newly renovated hotel room but I also didn't expect a dirty room/hotel either. I was very disappointed and can assure you that next time my friends and I go to Boston, we will not stay at the Park Plaza. I must say that the hotel staff behind the desk was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, that is the only positive comment I can make about this hotel.

This hotel should be condemned. paint and plaster peeling off walls and ceilings, threadbare sheets, views over;looking a derilict building, no public transport, breakfast ran out daily by 8.30am not even any bread and no restaurants nearby. Hotel provided shuttle into Beal Street and airport but charged. One room was sealed by police for being used as illegal drug lab! Add not too pleasant staff. It was the worst place we have even stayed in anywhere in the World!

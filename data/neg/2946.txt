Pretty cool rooms, kids not welcome in pool area (apparently the pool is a "the pool is a very sought after venue ", bar was dead on Sat. nights.... Would be a fun hotel for a 20 something looking for a home base, 30+ with kids I do not recommend - feel like I am at a exclusive night club where the staff is pretentious.

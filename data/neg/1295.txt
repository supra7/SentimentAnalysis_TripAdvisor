Our initial impression of this Quality Inn is that the facility has been heavily used for several years with no investment in upkeep. There were stains on all the carpets, no elevator to get luggage to the basement level, bedding that was worn out, and the odor of cigarettes permeated everything, even though our room was "non-smoking." There are other hotels in the same vicinity that looked like far better choices. Even though the staff was cordial, I would not stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.

We planned a night away for our 6 year anniversary. It's not often it happens with young kids, so we were pretty excited. We checked in and although it was really busy, (it was the weekend of the Seattle International Film Festival) the staff was fairly attentive and checked us in not too long after we arrived. We had requested a room w/ a view, which we got. It was beautiful and we were impressed they had remembered. When we entered the room, this is where the great impression stopped. It was dirty, walls were heavily scuffed, the furniture looked worn and droopy (best word I could come up with). The glasses and water bottle seemed as if they had been sitting there for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer. The bathroom was fairly typical and not luxurious like I thought it might be. So all in all, I was a little bummed. I guess with paying $35/night for parking and having to pay for high speed internet access, we just expected more. The bar and restaurant service was amazing, although expensive. So all in all, it wasn't a horrible experience, but for what we paid, we just really expected a little bit more.

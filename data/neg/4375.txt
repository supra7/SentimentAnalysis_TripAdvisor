To begin with, the website that is posted for this hotel is not this hotel. I showed up with a group, ready to check into the hotel that I had seen online, and was confronted by a shabby hotel with threadbare carpet, tiny smoky rooms, windows that did not open, and worse, body hair on the sheets of the beds. The towels were gray. My students checked their rooms and reported the same experience. We all slept on top of the covers with our clothes on. (We couldn't go someplace else because of the lateness of the hour and because we were exhausted from all day travel to Istanbul.) The breakfast was adequate. The staff were friendly, but the hotel was simply one of the worst that I have ever stayed in. A student with asthma was sick in the morning from the smoke in the room, and we were all disgusted by the hair throughout our rooms. Never book this hotel.

I stayed there in May for a business conference and was appalled at the condition of this hotel. I entered my room to find it completely filthy with no linens on the bed and dirty towels in the bathtub. Our trip coordinator called the front desk to rectify the problem and it was fixed but I noticed that the yellowed window shade was hiding the chipped paint around the window and the dead insects on that sill! I went to plug in my laptop and noticed also that the outlet was literally hanging out of the wall. When I complained to the meeting coordinator she tried to get me another room but to our astonishment they were booked solid. I felt embarrassed for the person who booked the hotel and many in our party shared similar experiences. I would rather sleep on the street!

Buyer beware! We booked this hotel on one of the name your own price sites as one that is next to the SeaTac airport. Well, it is in the general area, but way north in an industrial zone. I thought I got a good deal online, I did not get a good deal at the place. You were directly categorized as the ... [name your own price] guy?at check-in. We noticed two disgruntled guests, one was complaining about the room and the other had no power. And indeed, the main light was not working in our room, there was conditioner, but no shampoo, there was coffee, but no spoon, no sugar, no creamer, no tea, etc. The TV reception was fuzzy, although the TV looked new. The bed looked new, but the carpet is well used and the bathroom has that 70 style to it. Room was small, but you just stay a night, right!The hotel needs an overhaul, looks very dated, 70's, very low ceilings. Pool was closed. Restaurant was closed. If you need food, you have to drive around for a few miles!At check-out in the morning they told us that the room was already checked out at 5:45 by us. Well, we were sleeping at that time and they did not want to admit a mistake was made there at all. And, since we booked thru a third party site, they do not give a a bill. It says it is Under New Management, but they have to step up to the plate. I would not recommend this hotel. I stayed at better hotels/motels at the Seattle Airport that I got thru ame your own price?

I must say for a 4 star hotel, the sheraton in seattle is clearly overrated. i was annoyed by the fact that there was no information or brochure provided in the hotel room that described the amenities of the hotel. we didnt know whether there was a pool, what restaurants, bars etc. the hotel inlcuded. of course we found out, but were hardly impressed. the pool is tiny, and since the hotel itself is huge, it is usually overcrwoded. the hotel only has only one restaurant (with the creative title daily grill...) ane one little bar. what angered me was that you have to pay for internet - in my opinion a classy, 4 star hotel should include internet for customers and not charge 12 dollar a night and that movies on TV were even more expensive, i.e. 16$ ! we stayed in the sheraton for new years this year, and were once again disappointed when we came home after midnight, as did many many other hotel customers, and were informed that the bar had closed already. it would have been nice to sit down in your own hotel bar, after seeing the fireworks outside, and have a glass of chamapgne or a cocktail. however, the bar was closed to the dismay for many customers. overall, the stay was hardly impressive. the hotel has a great location and the inventory is ok, but for a 4 star hotel with a great name, one can except more.

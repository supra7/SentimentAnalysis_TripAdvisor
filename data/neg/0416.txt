The Good - Availability of good rates. But guess why the rates are so good...read on... The Bad - HIGHWAY NOISE. I stayed on the 10th floor of the hotel - room 1013, which unfortunately faced the highway. Wow, the highway noise was breathtakingly loud. With the constant roar of traffic and the grinding gears of semi trucks, I convinced myself several times over that a window was ajar, but nope, the closed windows simply had little to no noise insulation. This was true also of the walls between rooms; conversations from the next room over were clearly audible in our room. Earplugs are an absolute must. - Location. Right in the heart of Seattle's highway on-ramp district, this hotel was a significant hike from the attractions and neighborhoods that a tourist would be interested in visiting. This might not be true for business travelers. - Internet price. Ugh, $12.95 for wired internet every day? Please hotels, just build that cost into the hotel rate. - Sliding bathroom door. Probably not a problem for a solo traveler, but when sharing a room with someone else, it's annoying how the bathroom door is on a sliding rail rather than a traditional door hinge. It means the bathroom door doesn't close entirely. Instead, the door squeaks on its railing and doesn't provide the same privacy as a door in terms of sight or, sorry, smell. The bottom line - Even at such an inexpensive rate, the negatives associated with staying here clearly outweighed the positives. I'll definitely choose another hotel in Seattle next time.

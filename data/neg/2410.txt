Imagine a cement coffin with two small windows and room decorations selected by a 7th grader throw in every imaginable noise from down the hall or above and youll have a night in hell compliments of the Aloft Montreal Airport! My wife and I spent over $100 to stay at this trendy as some would describe it but for me its much easier just to call it what it truly is horrible. The rooms are like a cement mausoleum, the ceiling is raw cement and any and every noise from the guest above is echoed through your torture chamber. The only thing louder than the sounds from outside your room is the screaming from all the fake wood or design ala wood laminate. The sink has no visible control to adjust the water level and until you by chance figure out that you must reach down under the water and push it physically to release it. You just cant get away from the feeling that you are in a cold four walled cement tomb it is by far todays version of the shagged carpeted no-tell motel that you visited in college only now you should know better. The only good thing I can say is that there is a nice TV for the hours youll be awake because you wont be able to sleep! So just say NO to this poorly designed excuse for a hotel. Ive traveled the world for over 30 years and I have never stayed at a place Id rate any lower than the Aloft Montreal Airport

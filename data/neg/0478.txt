I don't expect much when I book a Quality Inn. Two stars should mean a clean, comfortable room and not much else. Our room was fairly clean and this place isn't a dive. But the owners cut corners where they shouldn't. The towels are awful, like scratchy sandpaper. We skipped our showers this morning to avoid them, they're that bad. My husband couldn't get a hot shower all day New Year's Day. I assume they were close to capacity, but shouldn't they be prepared for that? The walls are paper thin, which is to be expected I guess. A child's coughing woke me up this morning and I am not a light sleeper. The elevator is so slow, we saw more people simply give up and take the stairs than wait 20 minutes. We ended up carrying our bags up to the 3rd floor. I am writing this review from a coffee shop because I could not access the internet for 2 days. What's the point of free WiFi if it doesn't work? There's a Hyatt Place and a Best Western nearby that are probably a lot better than this place. Don't waste your money. The owners needs to take the ridiculous fee I was charged for a New Year's Eve rate and buy some towels. They clearly don't take much pride in this place which is too bad because it's in a great location.

Possibly one of the worst Starwood properties I've ever stayed in. While the lobby is convincing enough that this is a worthy hotel, immediately upon entering my room, I realized that this hotel was completely overrated. I'm usually pretty laid back about this sort of thing, but I'm pretty sure my first apartment in Chicago, after I graduated from college, was nicer than this. Bathroom is decaying and its clear there's been no attempt to even attempt an upgrade (the fixtures are all cheap and old). TV is circa 1990. Room generally feels old and dirty (see attached pictures of bathroom and window shade). Gym smelled and many pieces of equipment were rusty. Other comments on this site regarding the general lackadaisical attitude of the concierge were right on, although the front desk staff was helpful. Overall, I fully understand why the other Starwood properties were sold out and this one wasn't (even at almost half the cost!).

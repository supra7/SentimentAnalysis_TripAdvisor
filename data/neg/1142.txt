Stayed one night here after coming in late, before leaving the next morning. Used points, so I don't know the regular room rate. Overall, it was OK - decent room, nice staff, convenient to airport. but had some issues too. Details... GOOD: --Rooms, in the tower where we stayed, are pretty decent. Plenty big, nicely kept bathrooms, bed was fairly comfy. --Rooms have a small deck, but the view is of the airport - nothing spectacular. --Staff was friendly, both at the desk and in the restaurant. --Location is very convenient to the airport, and pretty quick access to I-5. --Cookies at check in were good. ;) BAD: --YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PARK HERE. This is a pet peave of mine - if you aren't in the middle of Manhattan or the Loop or somewhere that its ultra-crowded, there is NO good reason to have to pay for parking. This place had a gigantic parking lot. I think parking cost $12 or so. Ripoff. --Restaurant staff seemed to be overwhelmed during breakfast, so they fell behind a bit. Food was good, but a bit overpriced. --The doubletree is not just a hotel, its like a little village of condo buildings too, which makes it very crowded and hard to get around the property. --Common areas could be kept up better and cleaner. --The doors to the rooms have a huge gap at the bottom - allows a lot of light and sound in from the hallway. If you are coming late and/or leaving early at Sea-Tac, this is not a bad choice. But you may want to consider other places as well, shop around a bit.

This hotel was awful! Our room was tiny and the bathroom was miniscule. The walls were paper thin. I could hear conversations from the rooms on either side of mine as well as everyone walking in the hallway. We had no television reception the entire 5 days I was there. A service man was sent up but was unable to fix it and nothing further was attempted. The elevators are HORRIBLE! 6 for over 900 rooms-one of which is an express to the 15th floor. There was always a huge line to use the elevators and you were unable to use the stairs. The most annoying thing was that I made 2 toll free (1-800) calls and was charged $2.00 each. The bill clearly stated that they were for toll free calls. The $4 was simply for the privilege of using their phone which had poor reception. Do not stay at the plaza!!

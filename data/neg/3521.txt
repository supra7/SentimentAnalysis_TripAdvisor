I have stayed at this hotel for a tournament the past three years. What was a relatively nice hotel, is now a VERY tired and not clean property. Furniture in rooms are stained and beat up as are carpets. Bathroom is okay, but areas where floor meets wall in rooms are dusty and dirty. Complimentary breakfast is above average. Free internet in room is good. Great location, but loud, live music from the West End Restaurants bothered some of the people in our group. Also had incident where another guest was given a key to my room. They evidently took it back to front desk and then were sent back up to my room with a hotel employee who used a master key to walk in my room. Didn't realize it until that happened that the security bar that I thought I had latched on my door was broken! Hotel front desk apologized when I complained and did replace the security latch by the time I came back the next night.

Got this on Hotwire at a good rate. Listed as a 3 star hotel by Hotwire. I personally think that this is a glorified Motel 6! Away from most everything. Difficult to obtain a cab here. Plain barren rooms. A nice flat screen TV though. No restaurant on premises. No room service. No wireless internet, but they do have hard wired internet. I ordered pizza and had to go to the lobby to get it. That is not a nice touch when you cannot even provide me with a restaurant. The bed was very hard. I nice pillow top would be nice. The hallways were cold. I would not stay here again if I have a choice. This should be listed as a 2 star max.

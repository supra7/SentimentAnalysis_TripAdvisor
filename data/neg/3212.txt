Complaints In point form  Rooms a little small, walls are thin  Average food  Indifferent service at the massage and during dinner  Dishonest marketing  Location not great Booked a package with dinner, one night stay and massage. DO NOT go for their promotion package as you can get cheaper rates and better deal if you book their services individually online. Disappointed at their marketing gimmicks and dishonesty In summary, not worth the money i paid, possible to get more value from other hotels in Singapore

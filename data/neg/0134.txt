Unbelievable! This is a great place to stay if your into drug trafficing, prostitution, and hanging out with people who are high on who knows what!!!??? My girlfriends and I came to stay for the weekend and were mislead by the online ad for this Motel (which was advertised as a Hotel). As soon as we pulled in people on the lower levels shut out their lights and started peaking through the cracks of their curtains... Too high to realize that we could see them! We unloaded our things onto an elevator and were surrounded by about 5 men covered in pock and track marks! We witness two GI's (who happened to check in when we did) go to their rooms with two (i'm not kidding!) noticible transvestite prostitutes. We finally made it up to our room and realized that the door didn't lock! The front desk gave us a hard time about switching up to a room that did lock. We were on the 3rd level and as we looked down into the parking lot people were wondering from room to room. One room in particular had people roaming in and out, while friends waited in the parking lot. We had people knock on our room door asking us if we had a cigarette, matches, a lighter? We decited to leave to go get a drink (we had to be atleast a little tipsy to fall asleep in this hell hole!!!) We went to pull out and realized we were totally locked in! Not a security gate where we could use our room key to enter or exit... But seriously... a full on gate that was padlocked shut. The manager had to come out and unlock, open and lock it back up. We asked why we were locked in like that and they said to protect us from the people out there! We couldn't help but ask... What about the people in here????!!!!! This is the 1000% truth about our experience at this hotel. We only stayed one night and I am surprised we survived!!! (ha ha ha... we did hear one gang member looking guy mention that we looked like cops... We went with that!) The only good thing about this hotel was the free parking!!!!

When we first entered the busy hotel lobby, I thought there was a prom or wedding taking place as music was blaring at an uncomfortable level. It turned out to be the evening's entertainment for the bar on the second floor. Our room was on the tenth floor, and although it was clean with a partial view, the mismatched furniture had seen better days. For $360.00 per night, I expected that the room would have a mini-bar and toiletries in the bathroom, but it didn't. The housekeepers started early in the morning and were quite noisy in the halls, but the most annoying thing about the stay was the flea bites I got from sleeping in the bed. I'll go somewhere else next time we're in Seattle.

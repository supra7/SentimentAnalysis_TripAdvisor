We stayed in this hotel and left 3 golden-diamond rings in the bathroom. During check-out time they told us everything was fine. After couple of hours I realised that my rings were left there. When I called the receptionist and asked about the case he was unhelpful and rude and said that nothing was found. Finally we were contacted the housekeeping executive who told that he checked with the staff and nobody addmited that they took them (but Im 100% assured that rings were left in the bathroom near the sink).....its sooooo sad and unprofessional........Watch out your valuable things if still want to check-in in this thiefty property....:-((((((((((((((((((((((((

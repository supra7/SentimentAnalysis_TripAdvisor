We chose this Hotel as we read that it had been modernised over a year ago... Although it was modernised we found the rooms very small, not very clean (glass marks on the beside table maybe from last guest, bathroom with broken glasses on the floor and bedsheets broken). The best thing was the location ... but look for soemthing else if there is available.

I stayed in a single room for 1 night before a job interview. The room was acceptable - small (but that's what I expected) and clean. I didn't have any problems with the bathroom - from reading other reviews I think maybe I just got lucky, but I had a really good shower in the evening and nobody else was around when I needed to use the bathroom. 'Tea and coffee facilities' means 1 tea bag and 1 coffee sachet which I thought was a bit stingy (but maybe I'm just fussy and I didn't try asking for another). I couldn't have breakfast because it started too late (8am) so I can't comment on that! The woman who worked there was a bit abrupt with me - I had booked the room the night before but she seemed really surprised to see me and a bit suspicious, spending ages checking and photocopying my ID and going through the booking, and she also seemed surprised when I asked to use the internet, as if I wasn't supposed to. Just didn't particularly feel very welcome. She was OK though when I checked out at the crack of dawn (the '24 hour reception' basically means she slept in reception rather than going to bed.) I didn't get a very good night's sleep - you have to ring the bell to go into the hotel because the door is locked, so people kept ringing the bell all through the night and traipsing up and down and there was also quite a bit of noise from the road outside. In all it was an OK room but I didn't particularly feel it was worth my 45 - could get a nice hotel room and own bathroom for not much more.

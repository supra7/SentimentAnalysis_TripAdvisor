This review is a couple years late, but my wedding anniversary is approaching and I started thinking back to my wedding in Maui and how KBH tried their darndest to ruin my experience. I had booked a partial ocean view room for my then-fiance and myself, as well as three rooms for our wedding party. My fiance and I arrived and were sent to a room that absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke - I didn't even make it over the threshold. Reminding the front desk that we had requested a non-smoking room, we were told that since we'd arrived late in the day (um, 4pm?) they were full and we could either pay up for the next room class or take a smoking room. ?!?!?! We ended up in a room that they claimed was a suite, and that boasted a view of the side of the next building over. How romantic. I was told the manager would call our room to discuss options, and shocker that call never came, even when I reminded them I was still waiting for it. Our wedding party's rooms were to the booked specifications, but were located down an enclosed, carpeted hallway that smelled strongly of mildew and looked generally unclean. I was completely embarrassed that my friends had to stay there (although they were staying for free, so they weren't about to complain!). The front desk and restaurant staffs were surly and I don't understand where this "most Hawaiian" reputation comes from... unless most Hawaiian means most bitter toward tourists. However, the maids, bartenders, and beach staff were extremely friendly. The beach is lovely and the location really is tough to beat, but I would give up a lot of location to get something better than Motel 6. The better bet (for a better price) is the Mauian in Napili. Oh, almost forgot - a giant LOCUST flew into our room (from the interior hallway) on our wedding night. Good thing we have a sense of humor, because we found this hilarious and still laugh about it today.

There were several problems with this motel. let me first tell you about the pluses: it was very conveniently located. It is inexpensive for the location. Now the minuses: poor upkeep, everything looked used, dented, broken, smudged, or dirty. The room was very small, so small that one of ran into the table every time he got up in the night. And worst of all, the carpeting was sticky. When I was getting ready to leave I looked at the soles of my feet, they were black! Unless you have nowhere else to stay, spend the extra 20-30 dollars and stay in a better place!

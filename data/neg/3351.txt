This is a comment about their general hospitality. I saw a man walk in go to the bar and request to have some water because his car broke down. Mind you this is in 100+ degree weather where people are dying of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. They REFUSED to get him water since he was not a guest he could not have water. They made him pay $2 for the water after telling him no. He clearly wasnt some weirdo or homeless people he looked like he was a working person and they refused him. I am sorry after my below average stay of one night musty room dirty floors and rude front desk this was the final straw. UNBELIEVABLE.

In the hotel precinct behind Sirceki Station. Quite a good location near to the old area old town and the light rail service. THere is a large smoky foyer where drinks are served and there is a large screen TV.Staff were friendly but not overly enthusiastic. Our room was small and drab but clean and comfortable. Twin beds with a curious mix of blankets. There was a small colour tv and a little fridge. The bathroom was a tiny, dingy room containing a toilet with a dodgy cistern and a shower with no shower screen. Breakfast was very ordinary with just a handful of choices.

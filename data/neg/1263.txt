We stayed at this Marriott last night, self-parking our car for $19.00 in the gated lot. Our car was broken into during the night and our in-dash GPS/receiver was stolen. We were parked just a few feet away from the southeast entrance, in a well-lit area, directly under a lamp. Evidently this is a high theft area near the Sea-Tac Airport; however, this parking lot has insufficient surveillance. The other disappointment was that we didn't get a good night's rest. When booking we requested a high floor, Concierge level. What we got was ground floor facing the pool. We asked twice to have a quiet room and were told "all of our deluxe rooms face the pool."

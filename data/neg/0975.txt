I had always been eager to stay at a Kimpton Hotel, the marketing and the hype always makes these hotels sound so wonderful. The Vintage Park was a disappointment. The room was TINY. I barely had room for my few pieces of luggage and the bed was about 12 inches from the wall. The bathroom was equally TINY, with a very small sink/vanity area. There was mold in the grout in the shower. See picture. The view was non-existent, as the first 5 floors of the hotel face a wall, which is about 6 or 8 feet away from the one small window. The small window and the proximity of the wall meant almost no natural light in the room. There was a crude mural of a vineyard on the wall, a poor attempt to hide the fact that the only thing you can see out the window is a wall. See picture. I complained about the size of the room and the fact that the room faced a wall. The desk clerk agreed that she knew the room was very small. She told me that on my next visit I should book a more expensive room, which is larger and does not face a wall. The room I was in was over $250 per night! I would expect better for this rate and for a hotel that markets itself as a premium property. I advised the desk clerk that I would not consider paying an even higher rate to stay at this property on my next visit to Seattle. The only positives were the l'Occitane bath products and the bed linens, which did seem nice. Overall, I was very disappointed and would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they could get it for under $100 per night.

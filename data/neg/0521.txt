The location of this hotel is hard to beat. Great lobby and friendly people working there. Room service lacks big time. It was horrible. Both times I tried it. I travel mostly for business so my time is valuable to me and room service saves time. But not when you cannot get what you want - cooked how you want. One huge plus if you get stuck here is that 1/2 block away is Morton's and 1.5 blocks away is Ruth Chris. The place is outdated and over priced for somewhere needing as much updating as this place does. I travel a lot and I will not be back to this location. I am gold SPG. Diamond with Hilton and Hyatt. Platinum with ICG. For those that know what this means - they will know I spend a lot of time in hotels.

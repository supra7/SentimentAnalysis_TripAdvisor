I spent last night in a Plaza Petit room at this hotel. Besides being ridiculously small and cramped, the room backed up to the elevator bank on my floor. It literally sounded as if a subway train was passing through every few minutes. For $450 (including tax), I expected more. A bathroom that was literally 4'x6. Check. A shower stall that was 2' wide. Check. A view of a brick wall. Check. No cell phone signal. Check. A standard def television that was 10 years old. Check. Did I mention that this match box cost $450 with tax. I've stayed in Hampton Inns that made this place look pathetic. Spend your money elsewhere.

I visited this hotel based on reviews. What a mistake. The only positive thing about this place is its location, it's smack in the center of everything. Rooms are tiny, there was no fridge where you could put at least a water bottle inside during really hot days. Rooms are not soundproof, you could hear everything!! There is no storage space, no cupboards, just a chair and a couple of hangers on a steel rod. The mattress was horrible and furniture in general was on the cheap side. Bathroom was tiny... tiny... tiny... and the shower leaked. The room was very dark and because we were in the back part of the hotel we had to keep the light open at all times. Breakfast was really lame nothing was really fresh. Staff were were utterly and highly indifferent. The problem is that I did not get what I payed for and mind you this hotel is not at all cheap!!!! I've been to 2 cheap-so-to-speak-hostel type hotels like this one, one in Berlin and one in Madrid and they are of the same standard but half the price of this place!!! I'm trying to think of something nice to say, but I can't. Overall I would not recommend it.

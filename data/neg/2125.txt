This hotel is clearly in big troble, as is the entire chain if these places. Under staffed, poorly trained, not housekeeping to speak of. I paid in advance for three bed room ($2200.00) three monthes before hand, but was downgraded on arraival with NO explaination. On check out, the front desk clerck presented me with a bill for $1300.00. I told him I paid and he tried to take the bill away and say it was all Experida's fault. I have been trying to get a refund every since. There is NO ONE who will answer or explain the reason for this. Clearly, when you cannot get a hold of a book keeper, you know the place has BIG problems. Check out all the complaints with the owners on Goggle. He has some real problems-like JAIL time problems! Hope all the bad reviews I'm going to write are worth the $1000.00 bucks, guys!

I have not had a more unpleasant business hotel experience ever. The hotel is undergoing major renovations, and the staff does little to help compensate for that. Where to start? 1. My room had no power from the outlets or the phone on one wall. Despite several trips downstairs (remember, no working phone), they didn't fix it all day long. Finally, I was given a new room. 2. The gym is awful. The locker rooms are under renovation, there are no towels stocked, etc. 3. Their coffee shop does not take credit cards. In addition, to bill it to your room, you have to fill out multiple paper forms (inconvenient). 4. Their bar has limited service and we had to chase down our waiter every night to pay our bill. 5. The restaurant must be under renovation also. They have a make-shift restaurant where we ate. One morning, we had 4 for breakfast and it took over an hour to get our order. 6. My bill was damaged in our copier so I called them to get a new copy. It won't be a surprise that it took multiple phone calls across a 5-day period to finally get them to send a copy to me (via email) I have stayed at ICH hotels in the past, but this is absolutely the worst one I have visited.

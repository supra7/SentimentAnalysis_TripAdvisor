This experience was an absolute NIGHTMARE! Paid for 3 nights and checked out after the 1st night. We entered the room and it was so dark you could barely see. Now I know why. Hair all over the bathroom and what appeared to be blood stains on the bathroom door. The walls and carpet were discusting. Items rolled off the bathroom counter due to leaning. OLD, RUNDOWN, TERRIBLE! Locals told us leave...VERY UNSAFE! The doors to the outside had been broken into before. A credit for 2 nights had to be approved by the Owner. After 4 days I was able to reach him and he did not approve the credit and said "I" was telling "STORIES". Very rude and mean. He said his staff told him what I said at check out. I did not offer any information at check out because I wanted to speak to him. Now who is telling stories? PLEASE AVOID! Hotels.com could not help and I lost $130.00 on this hotel. Spen the extra money and stay somewhere safe, clean, and friendly.

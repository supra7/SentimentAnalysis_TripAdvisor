The hotel room wasn't bad. It was a little outdated and the air conditioner was pretty noisy but got used to it. It was nice that it was so close to Love Field and plenty of restaurants. The drivers were very nice and good about getting you to and from the airport and to restaurants around the hotel. The thing that spoiled it was the front desk worker at the end of the trip. We had to be at the airport at 6:30am. So left the hotel 6:10am. After insisting that they would not open breakfast a minute or two early just to get a bagel and juice for the road (when the food was all sitting out and ready at that point), they ended up not even opening it for us before we had to leave for the airport when it was posted that it would open at 6am. He was very rude about the whole situation too. I definitely wouldn't think this is a four star hotel. Coworkers of mine had an earlier flight so they left the hotel at 5:30am. The hotel informed us the day before just to let them know when we want to be at the airport and they would drive us. The same gentleman that insisted we could not have breakfast, also told them that they can't drive them to the airport and that they would need to call a cab. It was pretty disappointing to be treated like that. I would say go to a different hotel if you want to be treated like a human.

Arrived just before 3 pm with a confirmed reservation since October 2010 for double beds. The hotel could only give us a room with a king size bed and then a promise with a room change for the next day. The first room was the smallest, dirtiest room I believe in the hotel. The bathroom was lacking enough towels, only had a shower and the shower floor was dirty. Having stayed at the hotel last year we were amazed how worn it seemed- from the service, the rooms, to the presentation of flowers in the lobby. The second room wasn't much better- dirty rug, bathroom walls, bent lamp and an unusual shower curtain- two uneven halves and colors not matching anything in Marriott that we have seem before. It appeared that excellence is not what this hotel is all about.

We stayed at the W Seattle for four nights and had plenty of time to study this interesting hotel. First of all, the staff at the reception were not only unfriendly, but even snobbish. Same applies to the concierge that showed a similar level of (in)competence as the reception guys and seemed to be more interesting in surfing a bit on the internet than making a reservation at a restaurant... The hotel is definitely overpriced for what you get. I'm staying at Starwood hotels pretty often and in general appreciate the service and comfort you get. W Seattle was definitely a big disappointment and honestly doesn't merit to be called a "W" hotel at all. Beside of far too small rooms, the hotel's general business policy towards guests seems to be "grab everything you can and run!". Parking did cost more than in New York and Wifi rates were just a rip-off par excellence. Better go to the ACE hotel where you get for the same price a room twice as big and much more competent and willing staff!

As far as i'm concerned, first and foremost, the room is what i am paying for, so at the very least, i expect cleanliness, space, and quality, in a $300/nite room at a 4 star hotel!!! That is NOT too much to ask for. Room 15-259 (at the Palmer means floor 15, room 259), was small and the decor took some getting used to, not at all great in anyway. See attached photos. The location was okay, right by Millenium Park, restaurants, trains, shopping. However, i will NOT be staying there again at their ridiculous prices.

I was placed at the property by a magazine I was shooting for and they pre-paid my room. When I got there they asked me for my credit card. I don't give hotels my credit card because I've had bad experiences with the situation. I told them I did not need charging privileges or they could use the c card already on the reservation. They said they couldn't do it and they could not check me in unless I give them a card. They finally agreed to let me leave $50 cash. Not sure what for. The room was small and there was no heat when I arrived. I finally found the thermostat behind the tv but you could not reach it or see it because the TV was bolted to the table. I attempted to call the front desk but when I picked up the phone it was so filthy I couldn't bear to put it up to my ear. The bathroom saw so small I couldn't turn around in it and the shower stall had insect holes with debris in the corner. I have to say our maid did do a good job of cleaning except for the phone which looked like it hadn't been used in 10 years. Parking there is a scam $46.00 a day. When the there is a garage right across the street on Saint Jame's Street for $14.00 on weekends or check with Bestparking Boston website for better rates. The St James Garage is great because you can go back to your car if you need to as it is self park but heated and you do not pay till you leave so it is more secure. Also, it was very noisy and as I put the key in my door two huge sounding dogs barked and scared the Bejezus out of me, but I didn't hear them the rest of the nights because the constant sirens drowned them out but I have NEVER heard of dogs being allowed in such a hotel. PS Maggiano's & Finale across the way are great!

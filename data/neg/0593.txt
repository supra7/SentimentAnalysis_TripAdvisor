I was booked into this property via Clipper Vacations. It was on their list of budget motels close to the pier and downtown. I had read TripAdvisor reviews, but not knowing Seattle and on a limited budget, I agreed to the booking. I am sorry I did. I was traveling with my tween daughter and reserved a double double. The elevator was cramped with worn carpet on the floor and walls. Upon entering the room, we both noticed an odd odor. The carpet was worn and had stains. The bedspreads had stains. The beds were somewhat comfortable, but lumpy. The fan was so squeaky, I had to turn it off by unplugging it from the wall. There were no polarized plugs in in the room. The TV was plugged in with an adapter and on a extended outlet addition. The paint was worn and chipped in several areas. The bathroom had chips in the paint over the tile and the shower/tub wall had peeling paint. To top it off, all double double rooms overlook a 7th Avenue business called "Little Darlings" "an intimate gentleman's club". When I asked to be changed to another room, the staff informed me that the best they could do was to put me in a queen room with a roll away. They did give me free parking ($14 - $12 plus tax) for two of the nights I was there. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is a decent selection of TV channels. There is a blow dryer available in the bathroom as well as an ironing board and iron. It is within a few blocks of Westlake Center, the monorail and downtown shopping. Overall, however, I will not stay in this motel again nor recommend it to anyone. I did contact Clipper Vacations to let them know about the problems with this property they recommended.

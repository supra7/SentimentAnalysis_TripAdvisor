We booked the hotel with Southwest vacations. The hotel is beautiful and nicely located. The rooms are moderns, the bathroom are a bit small. The worst experience was the noise, you can hear everything that is happening in the hallway! We got to change room cause ours was right in front of the elevators and we could hear people chatting and coming back at 2am... Checking was very long and not pleasant, only one person was attending a line of 12 people... Even though they changed our room we had to make numerous calls to get it done, our luggage was moved and our key disconnected without us being notified, spent another half an hour at front desk to find out what was our new room. Service is definitly average and rude

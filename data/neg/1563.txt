Hotel is nice, however staff is horrible, rude, and just don't know what is going on. Overpriced, bad location, no one at the front desk knows what's going on, keep passing you on to different people. Puts a 2500 hold on your credit card for a one weekstay that only cost 1900. Avoid at all costs, so many other better hotels that are in the same area with better locations.

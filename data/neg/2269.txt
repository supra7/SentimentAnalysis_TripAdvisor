This Rodeway is one place you need to stay away from. I spent one night here and NEVER will go back, even if every hotel in Philly was booked. It was filthy, badly lit, and decrepit, and way too expensive. I read most of the reviews here agree with me (wish I would have read these before going) and the only good review is probably from the owner of the place-- believe me, there is absolutely NO REASON to stay at this hotel unless you are hiding from the law or something. Stay away!

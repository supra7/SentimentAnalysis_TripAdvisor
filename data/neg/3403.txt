I have Gold status. I wonder how they treat people they know would never come back! No towels in my room. Worst front desk service ever. I called the desk to get the name of a cab service. "Mike" tells me the number, but when I ask for the address of the hotel (it's not listed anywhere in the room), he tells me "I'm busy here, there are a lot of people here!" Really?! That's his answer? Definitely will never stay here again and wouldn't recommend it either.

This hotel is a typical airport Hilton-clean, comfortable, simple breakfast in the morning. Price was affordable. Customer service was horrible. The shuttle took 45 minutes to arrive after calling for it (you have to call for the shuttle, it does not make scheduled stops, even though they say it does)...the drive to the hotel is only 12 minutes, so not sure why it took so long. We sat on the curb watching other hotel shuttles go by up to 3 times while waiting for our shuttle. The next morning, our scheduled 630am shuttle back to the airport actually left the hotel at 628 (per the front desk clerk)-without our group and another traveller scheduled to be on the shuttle. After arguing with us and why it was our fault that we missed the shuttle that left earlier than the scheduled time, the front desk attendent finally called a cab for us. The restaurant was out of half of the food items on the menu both nights that we stayed there. The rooms were fine, as one would expect with a higher-end chain hotel. The only shining star was Catalina at the front desk, she was the only redeeming quality of our stay! We definitely will not be staying there in the future, due to the ridiculous shuttle and poor customer service.

There is absolutely no way this property should fall into the category of a 4 star hotel. We have stayed at numerous "4 Star" properties across Canada and the US and this one did not even come close. The entire place is dark and the ceilings in the guest rooms are low and claustrophobic. Our only view was straight into a guest window at the Faimont across the street. The staff albeit friendly, seemed to lack maturity and did not present in what we have come to know and appreciate in a four star property (ie: westin Seattle). The lobby full of young travellers, had the feel of a high end youth hostel rather than a 4 star hotel. So...if you are of a less discerning taste and can find a great deal on this property then the W Seattle is for you. If not, skip it!

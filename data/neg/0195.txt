I am a member of Hilton Honors and Priority Award (Intercontinental Chain). Although I use Hilton properties more, I chose not to pay over $250.00 a night for the Seattle Hilton. I was given a gold hotel room key at checkin for a room on the 32nd floor. Although the view was quite impressive, that is where the good experience ended. The 32nd floor is "reserved" for Priority Members and has a lounge for complimentary appetizers in the evening. My room was adjacent to the elevator as well as across from the lounge. After dinner I returned to my room around 9:30. Between 10- 12 Pm/Am the lounge is cleaned up by the hotel staff with vacuums going and the employees chattering and making incessant noise, as if they were cleaning up a commercial office building with no regard to guests (Priority Club, no less) on the floor. Management should take a clue and have the lounge cleaned up between 8-9- common sense. Finally, as other posters have indicated -- when you are right next to the elevator shaft, you will hear it. Also, I waited for 10 minutes for an elevator to arrive around 5:00 PM. Should have taken a clue when I saw the earplugs and sleep kit on my bed at check - in.

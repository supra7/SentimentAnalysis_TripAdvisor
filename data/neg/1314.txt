stayed for 1 night and the service totally sucked at front desk, housekeeping, and more. The only good service was at the restaurant. Checked in late, requested high floor - got 1st floor Asked for a bathrobe (which in other hiltons, it's already in the room) took them 2 hours to bring it. And the person who brought it had very bad hygine. At the gym, there was no water left, 2-3 people called for water - i was there for 1 hour , they still didn't bring it. The room is mediocre at best - not worth the money

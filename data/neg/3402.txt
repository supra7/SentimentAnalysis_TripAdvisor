Pros: Inexpensive; airport shuttle service Cons: Lower-class version of Residence Inn (Marriott) or Homewood Suites (Hilton); dirty carpet; housekeeping service once per week, so if you check in after the scheduled day for your room, you don't receive housekeeping service; you are told at check-in if you need fresh towels to bring your dirty ones to the front desk and they will exchange them for you; pillows were so soft they provided no head support; NO food provided...there is a pantry where food can be purchased. I stayed at this hotel because it is across the street from where I was working. However, in the future I will pay the difference to stay at another brand.

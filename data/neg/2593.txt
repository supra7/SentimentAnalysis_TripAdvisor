We stayed in this hotel in early October. We booked very last minute and had limited selection. The location of the hotel is convenient. Only a 5 min. walk from Ottaviano metro station, and only 15 minutes from the Vatican. There are a couple of great restaurants very close by. At first glance, this hotel looks very modern and chic as it has a spa on the main floor. Staff was friendly. The rooms and main areas were kept very clean. Our room had some deficiencies though. Our bathroom door didn't open all the way. We had to squeeze in sideways. The shower didn't drain properly. The toilet seat was also half falling off. We mentioned our concerns to the front desk staff who said they would look into it, but it was never taken care of.There was a lot of noise from the street and the room next door. Walls are thin. We could hear every conversation next door perfectly. Breakfast was very minimal. Most days they had run out of ham and salami. It didn't seem to matter what time we had breakfast. For this price, I think you can find better in the same area.

I did not find this hotel to be as nice as other Hilton Hotels that I have stayed in. I had to wait for the receptionist to finish a personal phone call on her cell before she checked me in. I found the room to be outdated with a very dirty comforter. Other than the comforter, the bed was comfortable. The drain in the shower was clogged so we stood in a few inches of water. There was no refrigerator or microwave for use.-- I stayed in the older tower (I did not realize there was a new tower until I arrived). We had an oceanfront view which gave us a great view of the fireworks on Saturday nights from the pier. On the downside, it also was very loud as people are on the beach all hours of the night. Parking was ridiculous. It was either $15 for vallet or you could park in a lot behind a BBQ place across the street for $8/night. This was not mentioned to us until arriving at the hotel. -- Breakfast was pricey for the buffet at the hotel--about $18.95 or so a person, but it was decent and our waitress was pleasant. Overall, we would not stay here again, nor will we return to Daytona. We actually visited Daytona for a wedding but did not find it a place that we would ever vacation again. A better hotel choice would have been a hotel in another beach town nearby.

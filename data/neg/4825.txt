I travel every week for business, this time I chose the Hilton Daytona Beach Resort. I went outside my corporate travel agency since they required a deposit for reservation and in addition I was offered an upgrade to oceanview for a minimum price. I got a corner room on the10th floor in the South Tower. I had not been here in along while. The room looked clean and bedding smelled clean but, upon takin a closer look; my balcony opened to the Theme park which was operating to late hours at night. One of the sinks in the bathroom was craked. the rug dirty. The entertainment cabinet has the oldest TV set I have seen in a few years. I called the front desk, and complained about the overall condition of this room. The receptionist said that next time I should ask for a room in the North Tower, since they were remodeled. Since when do I have to ask? If I am part of the Hilton Honors Program!! I expect for you to know me as a loyal customer. She mentioned the deal bargain I got at the web site of $145.00 plus tax per night. I explained that the rate was not a deciding factor for me to choose a hotel. I chose a full service Hilton and I expected to pay that amount and more, but with that name I expected service and quality. She said she will give me a rate of $114.00 plus tax which I got, plus valet parking of $20.00 per night. Really? this place and in this condition is NOT worth even that price! I do not intent to come back to this property. In case you wonder my HH Member No. 369164543. I am glad I have options when traveling! This would not be my option again.

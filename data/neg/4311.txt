Recently stayed at this Hyatt. As Gold Passport member I was so disappointed with the hotel standard as compared with those I have visited in Europe and other places in the world. I understand this is not a franchised hotel but actually owned by Hyatt. Paper cups for in room tea/coffee facility, no robes, no slippers bathroom extractor not working thus all mirrors steamed up.Unhelpful and bordering on rude front desk staff. Waiter requesting I retain the knife used for cooked breakfast to spread my marmalade on the toast!! Am I being picky - yes and why not at a cost of $2700 for six nights. I expect certain standards from Hyatt and this hotel is far below norm. We requested many times for the red indicator light on our phone to be extinguished without success. On our last night we eventually covered the phone with a towel. As we checked out our friendly light continued to wink at us as we left the room. Incidentally Mr. Foster (Guest Relations Manager)room 1024 on the 19th of June was being hoovered by housekeeping at 10.00 pm. We were in room 1026 the noise was definite disturbing. Message to Management " get a grip of this hotel standards" Take a trip to Europe and see how a Hyatt should be run and then send your staff, particularly "front desk" for a visit to Cologne,Dusseldorf,Hamburg, Mainz and Berlin all of which would put this hotel to shame. Finally the hotel is long overdue a total refurbishment and decorating. It's looking tired and scruffy. Sorry Boston but the answer to your obvious problems are in your own hands. Not a good reference fo your world wide organisation. Regards Mrs. Christian UK

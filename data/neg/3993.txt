yes it is a nice hotel - history abound - but ther comes a time when there is only so much BS one can take. Small rooms with no wifi or bar fridge. I am on the 6th floor as I type this . The walls bewteen the rooms are very thin ... and when your surroundred by chatty cathy's it can be annoyining. So much for a good nights sleep. The room I am in is 618 - its in the back, above Whisky Jacks - a nightclub for the weekends??? anyways the boom boom music is present in the room. Having to get up at 6 am and getting a good nights sleep has its challenges. Don't get me wrong - the hotel staff are great and the hotel over all is good - just beware your room is.

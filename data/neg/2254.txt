This is by far the worst accommodation we have stayed in anywhere within the US. Hotel room was scruffy/rundown Hotel staff at front desk (3 ladies throughout the weekend) were EXTREMELY unhelpful to the point of rude and yet we did not complain just when we asked questions in check-in, and checkout they were non-communicative. Worst was Security. Hotel safe did not work. Hotel desk would not provide a code to unlock the safe door so we could not use it - despite trying to charge us for safe privileges. Biggest and shock was we came back from a full day away only to find our hotel door open - housekeeping did not close it after them once they brought in new towels. This is UNACCEPTABLE!!

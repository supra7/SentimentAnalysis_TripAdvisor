We were so looking forward to staying here. We'd heard so much about the Ace Hotels. The room rate was more than Hotel Moneco and I felt like I was a backpacker. The room was tiny, the person at the front desk couldn't recommend a good bar and there was no place to park our car. I appreciate the concept but it really wasn't valuable either through financial benefit or "funkiness". Wouldn't stay there again.

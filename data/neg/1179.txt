As a business man I live out of Hampton's. For the most part they are pretty nice but there is nothing more frustrating after a long day and you have to get on the internet to finish your job and you sit there waiting what seems like forever for a page to load. When a hotel asks well over a $100.00 a night the least you would expect is an internet speed that reflects the times. We left dial up 10 years ago, however this is one Hampton that still doesn't get it. For this I will have to down grade the review to a 2 star.

While the Ritz deserves praise for its location and service, the dated and charmless decor and rooms would be more appropriate of a 4 star sheraton than a 5 star hotel. My two specific concerns are: - Lobby & public spaces: Compared to the other hotels in the area, including the Sofitel and Peninsula - and other top tier Ritz properties such as the Tokyo or Half Moon Bay - the Ritz Chicago seems steril and dated. While the views are nice, the overall space has as much charm as a regional airport. - Bathrooms: I stayed in an executive suite, and given the size of the overall room, I was surprised how cramped the bathroom was. And if you can imagine the kind of bathroom / shower you'd see in a standard 3.5 star hotel, that is unfortunately what you'll get here. Other rooms may have better amenities, but for a suite, its hard not to be disappointed. Some of my favorite hotels in the world are Ritz's, but this one just doesn't measure up. I don't know if they have renovations planned, but I'd look forward to trying this property again if and when they are complete.

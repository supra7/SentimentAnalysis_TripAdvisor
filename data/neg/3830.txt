Called the hotel because we couldn't get through all the traffic and were told that a manhole blew. Took us over an hour and almost not allowed in to parking garage once we were within reach. Just wish the Copley concierge had informed us of how serious the situation was. Wasted lots of time in traffic and then on the T trying to find dinner because everything in Copley, Prudential, Newberry St. were closed. Couldn't take a taxi to dinner because of the traffic. Had one night to spend with our college age kids, but wasted time in traffic, on T, and walking around cables and generators. We would have changed hotels without hesitation if we were informed of the situation. Also, couldn't use the pool.

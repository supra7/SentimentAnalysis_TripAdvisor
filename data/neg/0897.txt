This lodging was obtained through priceline.com. While the room was clean it was cramped for 2 adult women. We had to share a double bed, request extra linens, and no luggage cart or elevator was available. There was some sort of event and was told to make sure we had a lodging indicator in the car windshield because the also cramped parking lot was going to be full. It is too far for downtown sightseeing, especially with heavily announced I-5 changes due to putting in light rail from downtown to airport. This may have been better for a single person having business at UW, or someone accompanying some one to the UW hospitals which are close. There was a nice mall across the street with shops, Starbucks and grocery. No microwave or minifridge in room.

This hotel offers a cruise and park special - 238 dollars, excellent package considering they include up to 2 weeks parking and the shuttle back and forth to the ship. We stayed at the Maxwell for three nights before moving here so we were a little spoiled. As we were already in town and were told that the parking was limited we arrived early. Rooms were not available so we waited in the lobby. The lobby area is run down, outdated and dirty. Our room 219 was ready at about 1:30 which was fine - it is a very busy hotel. We took the elevator up - slow and creaky! Room 219 was disgusting, the carpets filthy and badly stained. I quickly looked down the hall at some other rooms, as they were being cleaned, and went back to the front desk. I asked the women for another room at the other end of the hall. She asked if the room had been cleaned and I said yes but that it was still disgusting and I was not about to sleep in it. She moved us to another room that was a bit better. The hotel has great potential ! Good location, indoor pool and work out room. Large breakfast area and parts of it have been updated. They need to update, clean and get new furniture for the lobby. The rooms and hallways all need to be completely refurbished. The elevators also need to be updated - they literally creek and are very slow. Stairs are easily accessible, but when you have several suitcases an elevator is necessary. They have laundry facilities but when we used the dryer it ruined two white shirts , they came out covered in grease!! For Seattle this is the best cruise and park package available but if I weren't going to use that particular package I would recommend you go somewhere else until this place cleans up its act!

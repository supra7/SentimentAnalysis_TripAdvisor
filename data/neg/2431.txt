We arrived too early to check in, even though the room was ready we had to pay 10 to have it early! Receptionist not very friendly at all. Rooms very basic, we booked a family room for 3 and the spare bed not even made up. One flat pillow each and few towels. We stayed for 3 nights, rooms weren't cleaned properly, not hoovered at all whilst we were there, bin not emptied everyday.

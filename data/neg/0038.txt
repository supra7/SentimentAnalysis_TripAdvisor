We hit Seattle late (5 in the evening), and tried a few places, landing at the Warwick, an old friend. It is simply sad. Our room was not well-kept (a beer bottle cap on the floor; grout in the bathroom was filthy; furniture and coverlet with stains); the balcony door was left open; the mattresses had long since seen better days. Given the extraordinary cost of parking ($27, plus tax), there are so many less expensive options in the area which offer as much if not more. We must say a permanent adieu to any future stays. The only plus? the charming restaurant.

This is our second trip to the Hyatt and we will never return. We checked out after 2 days and it was a complimentary stay. It was horrible even when it was free! The room smelled, it was dirty and old. We had stayed previously at the Hyatt on Kauai and it was fantastic. We have stayed at Motel 6s that are cleaner. The Hyatt needs to completely RENOVATE the rooms including the bathrooms. Here is short list of some of our observations from our stay: Room smells of mildew and dirty socks Handles on sink faucet were loose and fell off in my hand Shower/tub extremely slippery. Theres no traction and rubber mat disgusting. Water cut off at least 6 times during our showers There were stains on walls and ceiling of a body-fluid content nature. That really made us nauseous. Asbestos ceilings All moldings and woodwork severely damaged and worn. Furniture old and worn Sheets stained Carpets dirty Elevators had no air conditioning and smelled Save yourself grief and do not stay here.

I have not stayed and will certainly never stay in this property due to very strange business practice which is close to extorsion. I booked a room for 3 people for 4 nights. Unfortunately it was during the problem with the Eyjafjll volcano, when all air traffic came to an halt ... I booked the room on Sunday but realized very quickly that travelling to Berlin would be next to impossible so I called the hotel this very Sunday to inform them and advised them that I would confirm or cancel the booking the next morning, the original booking was for Monday to Friday ... I was told that the booking was considered as firm and if I did not turn up they would charge 80% of the first night ... the booking had been 30 mintutes before on internet ... the next morning I called to advise them that I would not come, the airports being closed ... I got a bill for 80% of the first night, with the excuse that the cancellation had been made too late and that they were not able to sell the room ... therefore the charge of about 80  on my credit card. We will attempt to go to Berlin in the coming months but will definetly select another property. I HAVE BEEN DISGUSTED.

I've read several reviews that attempt to equate the small rooms and "quaintness" of this hotel to a European boutique hotel . . . well I've stayed at such hotels and this is not one. We reserved two rooms for two nights several months ago and when we checked in we were unable to get rooms next each other. When we got to the rooms, we were disappointed in the size, dcor and the amenities for the cost of $189 a night . . . we immediately went downstairs and asked to leave but we were told we would be charged for the night; so faced with a $400 bill we went ahead and stayed and checked out the next day. This hotel is way over-priced at $189 a night; however, most of the staff we dealt with were polite and the desk clerk on duty when we checked out honored our original reservation price of $149. I am really astounded that this hotel has so many positive reviews based on our experience.

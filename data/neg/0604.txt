I travel with family a lot and stay in a lot of DISCOUNT hotels. I know what I can get for the money and I have stayed in some pretty basic places before. But the stay at this hotel was so unsatifactory that we left early. We got to the hotel before check-in time. So we explained who we were and left our bags. When we arrived in the evening, there were hardly any rooms left and the 2-bed room that we reserved was gone (I don't know how this was possible since we pre-checked in before anyone else even got there). The front desk service was completely unbending in their uncourteous and non-helpful nature. THE ROOM: I was pregnant and my husband and I had to share one bed with our toddler. The brass bed was so unstable that we were rolling off the edges and it creaked, rattled and shook all night long. No roll-away was provided and my husband ended up having to sit in a small wooden chair for part of the night to sleep in. I got a total of 3 hours sleep because of it. The bathroom had disgusting unsanitary remains of the last people to stay there (smears along the sink and tile). The toilet was shotty. The carpet was scary to have a young child walk, sit or play on. WE got up early that morning and checked out 2 days early. Luckily the manager allowed us to get a refunded amount for the two nights we would not be there but was in no way wanting to make up for the night that we did stay there. We went out of the city center to stay in tukwila and had a great time the rest of the trip. Overall, it made my husband's first trip to Seattle a bit tainted with the memory of that place and I was very disappointed.

I came to Memphis for a Women's Conference with my church on June 27 and stayed two nights at Sleep Inn in Memphis on American Way. I must say the room was surprisingly nice; however, during my last night there I lost my $1200.00 Movado watch in the room. I advised the front desk of my lost. I had pulled the watch off in the room that evening to take a shower and discovered the next morning while I was getting dressed for church that I could not find my watch. I didn't make a big fuss about it because we were in a hurry and I thought maybe in my haste I may have placed it in my personal belongings. I did let the attendant at the front desk know to check the room thoroughly for my watch because I knew really in my heart of hearts it was in the room and may have fallen behind the night stand or just fell somewhere out of my eye sight. It wasn't possible for it to fall under the bed. Once I got back to Illinois and cleaned out my suitcase and personal affects, my watch was no where to be found. Just like I thought it was still in the room. I called back since no one bothered to call me and the guy at the front desk really didn't believe I had lost my watch in the room and he had a very nasty attitude and got very loud with me. The watch was very sentimental to me and I have had the watch for over 8 years. I cannot believe that it wasn't returned to me. Someone at this Sleep Inn hotel on American Way has my watch. I want to say to this person that found my watch, honesty is the best policy and nothing good will come to them. God sees all!

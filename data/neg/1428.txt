The Good and the Bad.. The Bad 1. Do not book an ocean front view, they are not built yet!!! a. Do not book your trip through secrets.com/secrets official website its double the money!!! 2. The pool was closed in the morning until 12:30 noon for pictures twice during my stay. 3. Shower water is cold. 4. Bring plenty of Mosquito repellant...You will get hit hard if you go to the gift shop... Mosquito's are every where!!! 5. Be prepared for a long check in. check in is at 3:00 but could be @ six..Have your swim suit ready so you can enjoy the pool instead of waiting around to get checked in... 4. Get to the pool early, Seats go quick!! 5. Power to the room went out twice because I used a steamer on my clothing!!!! 6. The asian resturaunt is not open. 7. The spa is not open. 8. The shows and nite life are boring!! 9. I need change $$$..Bring plenty of tip money/small bills before you get there. I am a great tipper but the resort has no change!! I was stuck not tipping some workers because I had big bill's on me....I guess they didn't want us to tip the workers... 10. Maid service was not every day and @ different times during the day. 11. Not my room but heard of air conditioning problems with other guests. 12. They still have a brown water issue with some guest's.. 13. Not impressed with the infinity pool.. 14. Took 3 day's to get honeymooners banner on door. 15. Never posted our names as honeymooner 's in the twice a day published newsletter. 16. Didn't get our free spa credit..Spa is not open but they have rooms set aside for massage's. 17. Front desk is sort of a mess..If you run into a problem Demand,Demand, Demand!! 18. Bathrooms look good but are not private!! You'll see! 19. The resort just opened and they are still working on it but the tree's and plant life are a little colorless.Needs more life and color. 20. Wait till Feb 09 to go. It will make a difference. 21. Ant's were a problem from a couple that stayed on the jungle side of the resort. 22. Some people were happy some people were mad. Inconsistent all across the board. The Good 1. Beach was great. Beautiful water and sand. 2. Beach bar was cool and service @ the beach was great!! 3. Dinner on the beach is a must do!! 4. Food in all the resturants were good and most times yummy!! 5. Pool's were great. I usually hung out by the pool bar area.. 6. The infinity pool was just ok. Didn't hang out there @ all. 7. The worker 's were happy and helpful... Oscar was a blast with activities....Jose the concierge for my part of the building was fantastic. Marisol and Bambina @ the pool area were great to us.. 8. Cool security safe's in the room. 9. The rooms are awesome looking but??? See above in The Bad for details.. 10.Showed the Bears football game in the activities room for the bear fans that stayed here..

The Seattle downtown Crowne Plaza hotel is a very typical average business hotel without amosphere. It is situated near the I90 / I5 and even on the 23rd floor where I was, you can hear the sound of the highway considerably. Rooms are large and clean, beds are OK. Breakfast is reasonable, but typical American style (fat and sweet). Bar and restaurant are quite expensive, but a rich choice of downtown bars and restaurants are within walking distance. If you arrive from the airport, bear in mind that you cannot checkin before 4 pm.

I am a young professional, and was astounded by the lack of service at this starwood hotel. I am a starwood preffered member, I enjoy staying at 4 and 5 star hotels, and have stayed at several. While down stairs around 12ish at night having a cigerette, the vallet and a local vagrent exchanged money for bottles of pills. When I told the security they didnt' seem very concerned. I recently had another issue at their hotel, they dented my car in vallet, and then the front desk person was so rude and flagerantly condisending, I didn't quite know what to say. When I lodged my complaint the manager made excuses and made it feel as though I was wrong in letting her know I was dissatisfied, and said that if they were unable to provide me with the level of service I require then maybe we shouldn't patron their hotel. She was right, the level of service I require is respect, and to be treated as if I just paid 500 dollars for a room in a hotel. If I wanted to see drug deals or have rude staff be condisending to me I would have stayed at the super 8 or the HO JO, but I didn't I chose to pay the extra money for a nice hotel experiance, unfortunatly I did not receive it from this hotel. My suggestion, stay at the El Goucho INN, it's a little more expensive but, the staff is wonderful, the rooms are clean and beautiful, and the front desk staff is friendly, and respectfull to all your wishes.

Eventough I asked for a non smoking room when we entered the room you could feel the smoke all over the sheets, curtains and pillows. there is no non smoker room i guess. even the common areas are smelly. the stuff smoke for 24 hours. cleanliness is an other issue. cant tell it was clean at all. breakfast was ok. actually it was more than I expected.location is a bit over the hill so u need to climb.rooms are tiny and shower is not well covered so water comes inside of the room. stuff is ok but cant speak english. in general if u r going to such a place u dont expect much. it could be a bit cleaner but its fine. ok for value of money u give.

I stayed here for one night. I was really unimpressed with this Hilton property. For one thing, the entire place was somewhat "dingy" and in need of renovations. There was trash in the elevators, handprints on all the glass, and overall, the impression of dirtyness. The room I received was in need of major renovation. The furniture was outdated and stained. I couldnt believe how dirty the bathroom tile was,, which even made a cracking sound as I walked across it. I had to switch rooms due to sand that was all over the sheets on the bed. The second room I got was a little better, until I took a shower and the shower drain was backed up. I couldnt beleive I was staying in a Hilton. Overall, I was extrememly dissipointed in this property. I generally enjoy Hilton's and stay in many of their propertys across the country. This Hilton is not like the rest and is in need of some major impovements, For starters, the overall cleanilness of the place needs to improve. I would not reccomend this hotel or return.

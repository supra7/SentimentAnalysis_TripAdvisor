If there are redeeming quailties to this hotel, I hardly find them worth mentioning based on how disgusting our room was. First off when you are staying at a "premier" hotel you have certain expectations, one of which is that you have a clean room to sleep in. There was brown stuff on the toilet, dirty tissues on the made bed, holes and dirt on the laundry bag and grease smears on the headboard. That was the worst of it, there were other less offensive issues throughout the room that were more dissapointing than totally disgusting. I will never stay here again.

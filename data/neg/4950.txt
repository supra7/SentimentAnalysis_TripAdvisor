My fiancee stayed here for his bachelor party. He used his card to hold the room and in the morning his groomsmen gave him cash to pay. He paid, thinking nothing about it. Later he discovered they had charged his debit card also. So he called the hotel and talked to Simon the manager. The manager said he would ask the clerk if he remembered the transaction. Of course the clerk didn't remember and Simon said there was nothing else to do he would just be out that money. REALLY??? Could he not check the books and see if they were over $122????? Our wedding is coming up in 9 days and we could have used that money. Now we are just out $122 because of his laziness of not getting to the bottom of it. I'm very disappointed!!! Keep your receipt if you stay here because they will steal your money if they can!!!!

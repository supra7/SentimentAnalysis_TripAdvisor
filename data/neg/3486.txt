Check in took a long time even though I was the second person in line. Only one person was working the desk and my reservation was messed up when they finally got it pulled up. While at the hotel, the elevators were continually out of order. It would take up to 20 minutes to get an elevator. The breakfast buffet and nightly reception were very crowded and it was difficult to find somewhere to sit. Had stand arond one evening as no seawts were available. I must say the nightly cookies and milk were great. Valet parking was very inconvenient and it took an exceptionally long time to get your car. The complimentary shuttle was fully booked every evening so did not realy get to venture out.

I stayed at this hotel last year and it was an okay stay. The hotel is a lot older than it looks in the pictures. The location is good, right near the train station and the convention center a couple of blocks away. The views from the room were also nice. The problems I experienced were that the wireless internet was down the entire time and the staff was not concerned about getting it fixed. Also the bathroom was very small, literally inches between the sink, toilet, and tub. I guess this is to be expected of a hotel this historic. The bath drain was also very slow and I was standing in inches of water waiting for it to drain. The staff noted the old plumbing as the culprit. Besides the problems with the building it was an alright stay.

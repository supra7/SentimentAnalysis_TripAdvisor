From the reviews on is sights, as well as the photos, I had high expectations. We had a 2 bed, 2 bath suite. The lay out was nice, but we had no acces to the gardens/pool area or to the "beach". There is no water access at this resort, watersports area is owned by an outside company and quite pricey. There was no kitchen in our room, not even a sink. If you want a 2 bedroom suite, the views from the decks are obstructed with trees or you ar looking at a parking lot or your neighbors less than 5 feet away. We were in need of a 2 bed/2 bath unit, which is why I booked here, but I would not sat here again, and I would not recommend it either!

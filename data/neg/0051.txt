one of the worst nights ever at first our room was across from elevator and we did not want to listen to the "ding" when the door opens. we asked for another room we were given a 3rd floor corner on the street side. view of market and closed down theater. was woken by drunk and disorderly people on the street. bed was so uncomfortable must of been the original mattress from opening day. If was the worst night I think I have spent in a hotel. Staff did not care to listen to our complaint and charged us full price anyway. We traveled with another couple and they were on the 5th floor two floors above us and had the same problems.

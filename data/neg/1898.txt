My husband's cash and mobile phone was taken from the room while he was in the bathroom. The room key and his bag were "found by a cleaner" on the landing. Disgusted at the police response who were initially not going to call til Monday 22nd Nov (the incident happened the evening of Saturday 20th!) No doubt this was a staff member and we later learned another room had been broken into as well as two rooms in their sister hotel, The Pembury. Disgraceful.

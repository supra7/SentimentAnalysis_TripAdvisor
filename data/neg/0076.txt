We had a post stay at the Warwick after an Alaskan Cruise. We stayed pre-cruise at a different establishment. Checkin is at 3pm. we arrived earlier and they were happy to store our luggage and told us we should have rooms ready by 11:30 or 12:00. They were. We however were given wheelchair accessable rooms so I can't comment on the regular accomodations. The rooms are average size and comfortable, although the bed frame sticks out a bit on the ends leading to stubbed toes if you get too close. The bed was comforatble, and the room contained all the ammenities you would expect. TV, alarm clock, coffee maker, mini-bar. There are small balconies with sliding doors. The decor is typical of a high rise hotel, but the leather headboard makes a statement. Ice machines are available on four floors only. The pool and gym are located in the basement. THe pool is small and 3 feet deep, but very nice. The hot tub was broken so I cannot comment on it. The gym is well stocked with equipment and towels. There is also a two person sauna available. The mens room has lockers and showers for changing. Although I went to turn on the shower and the fixture fell off. I was blasted back into the wall by a stream of hot water. The bathroom was set up with a handicap shower, no tub, and a hand spray fixture which had very little water pressure. The hotel is VERY convenient to shopping and walking around. There is a shuttle to the airport for 10.25 per person that leaves every :25 and :55 on the hour. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the airport and is very comfortable. I did notice the staff recommending the private car service to the airport for $35.00 but this is about the same if not more than taking a cab, especially after tipping the driver. I leave that to personal opinion. Would I stay here again.....Most likely not. Although the staff was friendly, and the restaurant good, the hotel lacked the comfort and personality factor that I look for when I travel.

This hotel is past its prime and is improperly maintained. Service from cleaning staff is poor. Heavenly shower useless gimick as it is set so low on the wall if you are over 5'6" you have to duck to get your head under it. Ventilation is not cleaned hence every time it turns on room reeks like a gym locker, and rooms have constant unpleasant odour as a result. We asked to be moved once as a result but discovered it is through various rooms. We booked via discount site and was not worth the money even then. They charge for parking charge for internet and onsite restaurant and cafe keep very limited hours.

If you are looking for a place just to drop your bags, fine. If you are looking for good service and quality for your money, move on. Said they would call us when room was ready, did not. Tried to get our bags, three people got theirs behide us when I asked was told to follow him and identify my bags in a room full of bags,then would not let me use cart, told me to wait there he had to use the cart at valet,I did not. Very small room, poor aircondition.Ask twice for wash clothes, in four days did not get them,had to use hand towels. Our room keys did not work, let us in after 20min, repair man said we would have to go back down stairs and see what they could do. Dirty dishes outside our room from 6pm until sometime after 7am. What got me really angry was when I ask if I could see the famous ballroom they advertise, "no it's just for those who are renting it for events" Best thing I can say it is in central location. We really loved Boston.

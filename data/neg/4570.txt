I feel the rooms in this hotel are desperately needing an upgrade. As well as being tiny, the interior is dreary and the walls seem as thin as paper - I was lucky enough to be able to hear conversations and televisions from nearby rooms until late into the night. More of a hinderance was the lack of wireless internet in the rooms. Being told that they had no wireless routers left without an apology was frustrating - especially when one of the few perks of Hhonors Gold is free Internet access. On the plus side I guess the gym and the gym staff were nice, it's just a shame about the Internet when I had some work emails to send (luckily Starbucks saved me).

First off, my wife selected this hotel, not only because of its great historic nature, but, because they assured her that, I, who am disabled, would be amply accommodated during my stay,especially for my birthday. Well, this did not happen! Our room was located extremely far from the elevators and was very difficult to orient in; it was set up very poorly! It was not at all "disabled friendly"! For example, no curbside ramps, no commplimentory valet parking for the disabled, which incidentally I had to have; valet parking was a whopping $51.00 a night! Additionally, no cable or satalite TV, no free internet access, no wet bar, no free coffee in the room, not even free continetal breakfast was offered. A mandatory 20% gratuity for room service is automatically added to room service charges. And this is only a few of the disappointments; there are many others! "Pet friendly"; wrong, there was a steath and outrageous $75.00 fee added to the room rate, if you possess a pet; this was never mentioned until we checked-in! We opted to spend good money ($259.00 a night) hoping to be catered to, but all we experienced, was a money sucking vacuum cleaner, with strong suction! Everywhere we turned, there was some sort of charge! On a positive note, the hotel had comfortable beds. Overall, I will never stay here again and I strongly do not recommend this hotel, especially, if you are disabled. Chicago has myriads of fine hotels that do not fleece you; opt to choose them!

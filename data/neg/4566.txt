I stayed at this hotel during a visit to Chicago for business. I also stayed at the Intercontinental and the Omni. This was by far the worst of the three. Yes the lobby is amazing but the rooms are so small and stuffy it killed my stay. A small tv, no wifi, and out dated decor. On top of being the bottom of the three I paid the most to stay at this hotel. I will not be returning.

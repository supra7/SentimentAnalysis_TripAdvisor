Had a comfortable 2 night stay at the Euston Travelodge which is one of the newest in London. It has a great location and the rooms are modern with funky lighting and a flat screen TV but extreamly small even by London / Travelodge standards. The rooms do have AC but the windows do not open at all so this makes AC essential.

The hotel is old, with very slow elevators. The rooms are small, though well kept. The location is only 2 blocks from the Space Needle and related attractions, so it is in a good place. As others say, the carpet is outdated and worn, though the beds and water pressure was good. The breakfast was fine. We are a family of five. We paid $75 for one room and $103 for another. In retrospect, for less money we could have stayed at a Westin Suite in much nicer accommodations for less. Few frills, high prices. We won't be going back to this hotel.

i was really excited when i was going to get stay in the new hilton in baltimore for otakon. but after i got there, i was just saddened. Firstly we got a room with two beds and paid for that months in advance. they didn't have any and gave a room with a single bed and didn't change the price. Well this meant i had to sleep on a cot, which we had to fight to get it for free. good luck trying to get some peice and quiet, those walls are paper thin. i heard hole conversations through the wall. The air conditioner is horrible. we couldn't get it below 70 and i woke everynight in a dead sweat. The internet horribly slow, slower then any hotel i've ever stayed in. The tv was horrible too, the channels were either green or had no audio and we were told it's the hotels problem and to deal with it. when i left the hotel i found my self itching alot on my left arm. it seems there bites there, which i would belive would be from the cot i had to sleep on. all in all the worst experience i've ever had in any hotel period.

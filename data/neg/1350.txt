We stayed 7 nights here and in 2 different rooms - one a twin (5th flr), the other a king size (3rd flr). Good things. Location was good - Close to the Tram and SultanAhmet tourist area, some good restaurants a few streets behind the hotel. The rooms were clean and well presented but quite small. The beds were firm but reasonably comfortable. Better than some hotels. Staff were friendly, spoke some English but not enough if you have problems. The wireless internet was a bit slow but did work on all floors unlike many other hotels. Bad things In both rooms we could smell cigaratte smoke every day, coming from the room next door through the bathroom ceiling. We could hear the tv and conversations of people in the room next door and the floor above. The included breakfast was so bad (tasteless plastic cheese, pink sausage like Spam and orange juice that was watered down) that we stopped eating it after a few days. The bread was nice and fresh though each morning. On the 3rd night there was no water to the bathroom all evening and when it did come back it was a dirty brown. The swimming pool on the roof was empty and out of action Both our suitcase wheels were damaged by the hotel staff dragging our cases side ways when they changed our room half way through our stay due to problems of the cigarette smoke. The hotel caters for large Russian tour parties and had a very noisy English student group who seemed to run riot in their rooms and spend most of the night being sick in the bathrooms - thin walls made it sound like they were in our room.

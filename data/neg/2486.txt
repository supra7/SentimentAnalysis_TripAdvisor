I have never been motivated to review a hotel before, but the travel lodge in Euston has achieved this. I know it is difficult to get a good hotel at a reasonable price in this city, but I cant recommend this place. It cost me about 170 (stg), for which I got a room on the ground floor (complete with such street theatre as vomiting man at night, man rowing with partner on phone at night and traffic chaos from 5.30 am). The rooms are spartan, but clean, but sadly lacking in things which you might be expected to take for granted: an iron (I was on a business trip) shampoo, or a phone even. They did have a bottle opener, which maybe is an indication of what they are aiming for. My bath towel had some sort of brown stain on it and the wall was discoloured. They were actually overbooked (the chap on the desk explained to someone that they tend to overbook, although in this instance it seemed to leave someone standing around at 11pm wondering if they would get a room somewhere else. I had to pay an extra 10 to check in early, which I understand is their policy, but seems to be a little cynical, considering the price I had paid for the room. So, in short I would urge people to avoid this place; it seems to adopt a RyanAir style attitude, which is not what the hospitality trade is meant to be about. I can't say whether it is indicative of the TravelLodge chain generally though.

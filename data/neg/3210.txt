Where can I start,when we arrived we were made to sign a declararation that we would not smoke in the room & not bring in some local fruit.On arrivingin ourtiny room it stunk of cig. smoke.Wecalled reception who sent up the maid whocould not smell thecig.smoke or so she claimed. Therooms are really tiny,not recommended for couples only single.In our 5 day stay sheets only changed once! No curtains in room only cheap roll up blinds that let the light in through the gaps at 7 AM! Some towels & our once changed sheets had yellow stains on them.The location is really very inconvenient on top of a hill far from anything.And the rate is very expensive for what it is.I also never heard of a 4 star hotel with NO POOL!!Dont stay here!!

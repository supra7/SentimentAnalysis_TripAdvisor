Just got back from a business trip to Boston. We stayed for three days and every time we wanted to get a shower there was no hot water. We had to call every day and ask them to remedy the problem. I would then proceed to get a call from maintenance saying they turned a valve and we should have hot water. That valve turn seemed to do the trick. But everyday we had to call and repeat the message of no hot water and they would turn the valve on again. What kind of hotel turns the VALVE OFF!!!! Plus, if you are looking for a spacious rooms, count this place out. The rooms are small and the bathroom is the tiniest bathroom I have every been in with hardly any counter space. Oh and one more thing, the hotel is on some busy roads. So if you are looking for peace and quiet, this hotel is not for you. The street noise is overwhelming. You can do much better that this hotel in Boston.

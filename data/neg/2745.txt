So, I booked this hotel after reading the review on TA and was looking forward to my stay there. Arrived after a LONG bus ride (12hrs), and were greeted by an extremely friendly gentleman in reception. He talked about the room, and said that the economy room we had booked would be on the ground floor (?) and mumbled something about a problem with the air conditioning, so we would be staying in 'Block B'. We were taken to 'Block B' which was actually the Angel's Home Hotel round the corner. My suspicion is that they were able to move us to this hotel, and resell our room for a higher price. The other hotel did not seem anywhere near as clean or modern as the Best Point Hotel, but as we were only staying for a night and were shattered, we did not bother to complain. It was ok, but nothing to write home about. I could not recommend booking this hotel to anyone else, as you may not actually stay where you are expecting to.

The grounds were nice and the staff was very friendly. Located not too far from Lahaina. There is a beachwalk connecting all the hotels in this area and a shopping area. We could walk to other restaurants and to the luau at the Westin or Hyatt. They have a welcome orientation breakfast on the morning after your arrival. There is a magic dinner show at the resort. We enjoyed the show! The first room we were given was not nice. I would not recommend it to anyone. Especially not for the price I paid. The bathroom door kept coming off the rollers when I tried to close it and the bed was hard as a rock. I complained and was moved the next day to another wing. This room was much better and more in line with my expectations and the price I paid. The bed was softer and the bathroom had a regular door, with a tub. From the lanai I could see the whales. Much better, too bad I wasn't put in this room from the beginning.

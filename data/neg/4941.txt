I paid too much for a dirty and dated - badly need of repair room! And apparently there was a soccer tournament going on. There goes our weekend getaway! There were a lot of little girls in their soccer uniform everywhere from early in the morning to late at night. Mind you..not all of them were well behaved. I took some pictures of the dated furnitures, the unfinished sink, dirty bathroom, peeling wall, and cracked ceiling. you be the judge if you want to stay in this hotel!

It's been a long time since I stayed in a hotel like this, perhaps 30 years ago when I was a poor college student. I chose the hotel based upon proximity to the Walnut Street Theater. Reviews here were mixed, as they usually are but I usually throw out the best and worst and arrive somewhere in the middle. The price seemed more reasonable than others in the area and that should have been a tip-off, but in the end with taxes I ended paying $160+ for one night. When I first arrived I was put off by the shabby lobby and reception area. The elevator was so tiny I barely fit with my luggage. The doors were manual and I needed instruction from the staff how to open and close them once upstairs. The carpeting throughout was beyond disgusting. I knew I wouldn't be taking part in their free continental breakfast. The bed was made up with a white duvet and comfortable, no complaits there. And there was a flat screen TV attached to the wall that you couldn't turn or adjust. The bathroom was so tiny you had to lean out from the toilet to avoid the sink. And the bathtub would certainly never be used for anything but a shower. I was impressed that they had a Keurig coffee maker on the desk, but nowhere to plug it in. I had to read the cord around the bathroom door and plug it in there. My laptop had to be plugged in on the floor in the corner. The view was of a flat rooftop cluttered with ladders and tools and chimneys. Friends of mine stayed at the Holiday Inn Express not too far away. I believe I will try that one next time!

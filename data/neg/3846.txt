I guess I just expected a lot more from a Marriott. No complimentary breakfast. No wifi (seriously, what is up with that, it is 2010). There was a coffee maker in our room, but it was missing the cup that you put the coffee pod in. We left a note for the cleaning service that we needed another coffee pot, but they didn't replace it. Beds were uncomfortable. The room was clean, and we never had a problem with noise, but that was about the only good thing. Also, the location was very convenient for us.

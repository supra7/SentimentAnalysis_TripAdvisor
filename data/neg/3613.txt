I stayed at the Best Western City Place in Dallas and I was overcharged on my credit card for my stay. It's been over 3 weeks now and the manager is still giving me the run-around about crediting back my credit card for the overcharges. I've had to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General Office and the Better Business Bureau to get them to refund my money so I definitely would never recommend staying at this hotel. Bad people!

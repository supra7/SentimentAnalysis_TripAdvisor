We much needed a break, and were looking for a hotel where we didnt have to spend all our money on accomdation. Admittedly we picked the wrong weekend (Mardi Gra), which we didnt know was on until after we arrived. I did wonder why there was not much in the way of accomdation, and why all the prices were ramped up, but the airfares were cheap, so I thought it was a good deal at the time. The room was disgusting. There was mould all through the bathroom. The toilet was jammed between the shower and a wall, not great for hygine. The room had 2 double beds jammed in it, so 2 people had to sit on the beds, so the 3rd could walk round the room. There was a 20+ yo TV with most of the buttons missing and no remote. The aerial socket was broken, and you kicked the cable out everytime you went into the bathroom. The TV was sitting on a very old wooden table, with a 4 set dinnerset & cutlery, jug and tea/coffee just sitting on it. There was a very old small bar style fridge in another corner, that had leaked before we arrived, it took 2 days to dry the carpet (we actually left before it dried). I think Noah used the microwave to heat up food for the baby animals. The beds were very saggy, no mattress protector (too scared to look under the sheet), the sheets though clean (again, too scared to look too close) were well worn. The TV power cable and extension cords also ran across the room, including the door to the bathroom. There was a fan on top of the ancient TV, plus the extra one that had been supplied, but all they could do was move the hot air round. The room was smelly. We were booked for 5 nights, but found alternative accomdation after 2. I dont think hotels have to come up to any standard in Australia.

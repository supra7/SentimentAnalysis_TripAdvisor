Managed to secure a room for one night on a weekend as a fren recommended this hotel. Had to wait for 45min. Counter staff was not cooperative, seemed like he was having a bad day. Paid $153 for plain room Slightly bigger than my own toilet at home. Only had 2 choice of rooms to choose for the same price, either a double or twin. Noticed that bed was nicely made, but bed sheet was very thin atop of PvC bed. Blanket was also thin with fleece-like layer above it. Pillows are so thin, I actually got a headache when trying to sleep on them. LCD tv only have sports channels n 1-2 local channels, the other 20+ channels are just static which was very irritating. No wardrobe available, only wall hangers. Toilet was weirdly put together. Toilet seat was actually located below the shower head, so that means you can take a poop n shower at the same time. Even the shower head was loose from its joints, almost got burnt by the leaking hot water when turning on the shower to bathe. Really need to reprimand my friend for recommending me this hotel. Damn!

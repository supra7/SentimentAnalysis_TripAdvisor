Rude front desk manager This place is ridiculous!!! $89.99 for a hotel that smells, is old as dirt, and whose customer service is very rude! This hotel is NOT at the Airport as was reported, and I was given a room that had BEDBUGS all throughout my room! I complained to the lady (who did the best she could) at the front desk and asked to speak to management, but they were very rude and told me that there was nothing they could do but change my room! Nice job, after all the bites!

I stayed there with my husband for 4 days end of May / Early June. We requested a room with king size bed, we didnt get it, we had to change the next day for a room with a king size bed. the Air conditioning was not working only fan mode, or actually the staff said they need to ask the manager's permission to turn the AC feature on as according to them its still not hot !! the bathroom was really small. They offered free wireless interenet in the rooms, which was in a quite good spped. The reception man gave us the map of Istanbul in exchange of money, while as we later discovered it is for free .. that was not an appreciated attitude, I mean in Istanbul you should always expect people to rip you off and always try to bargain the prices, but we didnt expect that from the hotel and for a map !!!!!! The breakfast was Okey, I liked the fruit salad , and the staff in the restaurant was nice and cheerful. The Pool in the roof top is really tiny, I would not call it a pool (probably a big bath tub !) and the water did not look clean at all, so if you are interested in the swimming part then its not a good place, however the sun bathing part is good, and the view from there is nice. the Only advantage of this hotel is the location, its in a popular shopping area, close to Beyazit bazar and not far from the attractions of the old city of Istanbul (Blue mosque, Topkapi palace...etc) its just a 10-15 min walking distance or 2 tram stops, however we could not find the hotel easily as its in some side street and we had to ask few times before we was able to find it However, dont expect it to be a quite location.

A review of the hotel will follow this WARNING: This hotel inflates the exchange rate on bookings made in USD which increases the cost of the nightly rate you will pay. This exchange rate inflation is not disclosed on Marriott.com and the estimated cost provided by Marriott.com understates the amount you will pay. Even more disgracefully, this practice is not disclosed on check-in. And what a shame since the hotel itself is rather nice. The front desk clerk told me Mexican hotels are legally able to inflate their exchange rates by up to 8%. Be sure to take this into account when comparing the Marriott Reforma against other options. Apart from the above, this hotel is rather lovely. Its well located near the Independence Angel which means its roughly halfway between the downtown Zocalo area and the Bosque de Chapultapec / Polanco area. The room is standard Marriott fare; comfortable and well appointed. Maid service was spotless and prompt. I did find the wireless signal to be very weak in the room, but theres a strong signal in the lobby and the executive lounge. The standout feature is the executive lounge which has a spectacular outdoor balcony overlooking Paseo de la Reforma. The staff annoyingly require a signature even on a zero dollar invoice which smacks of fishing for tips, but apart from that the staff are very helpful and friendly and the food and drink options are very good. Overall a lovely hotel, but the experience was marred by the hotels distasteful practice of inflating the exchange rate which is really a cash grab designed to make you pay more than anticipated for the room. What a shame.

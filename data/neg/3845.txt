This hotel was awful. The lobby is loud. It stunk like beer because of the sports bar attached to it. I can't even believe that there isn't wireless internet. I have a MacBook Air, so I couldn't plug it into the antiquated modem they had set up. There are no blackout curtains in the room, so I was up promptly at 7 this morning. The elevators took forever, and if you were going down you had to stop at least 3-4 times to pick up more people. I haven't stayed at a Marriott in years, and I won't be staying at another one any time soon. What a horrible experience. The room was clean. That was about the only thing I was pleased with.

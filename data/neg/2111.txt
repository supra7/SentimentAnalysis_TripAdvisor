Paul Arthur Labombard a.k.a. "Pritam Singh" has cleverly created a cash cow in his so-called "resort" named "Parrot Key Resort". The powerless and scared "managers" at the front desk are clearly under the hocus pocus spell of "Singh" when they dutifully extract the hidden resort fees and additional "damages deposit ($200)". Parrot Key LOOKS like a resort but to quote "Singh", I think the thing I do well is that I see things that arent there. Expect to pay bid bucks to "Singh" for Things that Aren't There! Hint to "Singh": Unplug the nonstop poolside elevator music.

Having read that this hotel won this year's T&L award for best small hotel in a major city, I was quite excited to got to Boston with my husband for a long weekend. We did the "Touch of Paris" for the first night.....Cleo's having won a James Beard award....needs to have better waiters. Our waitress was not very attentive and often very blase....for a weekend, you'd think this place could do better than a Plastic Flower arrangement in the center of the dining room. They need to hire a new beverage mgr. as I had to go to a 5th selection of vodka before they said they had it in stock. The Bakery Breakfast for $40 was a lot for a bagel and cream cheese.....the full breakfast actually turned out cheaper. This place "nickel and dimes" you for everything.....rooms are very outdated and need to be 'odorized'......

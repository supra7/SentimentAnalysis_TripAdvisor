This was honestly the worst hotel experience that I have ever had and I can only encourage potential guests to avoid this property. We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February and everything was ok for the first day; however, when we got home Saturday nights, the hotel had thrown an urban rap party for Mardi Gras which encompassed the entire lobby, lounge, bar and restaurant area on all three floors. The rap music was literally so loud that it hurt your ears to even walk through the lobby and I had to scream at the front desk host to get my room key fixed. I asked him when the party was over and he had to hold up his fingers to tell me 2am because it was too loud at the front desk to even speak. Fellow travelers told me that they could hear every word of the music on the 10th floor until 2am. The irony of the whole thing is that the hotel guest were not going to the party, it was local ghetto warriors that came to invade the hotel by the HUNDREDS. The hotel reportedly made $8,000 by hosting the party, which shows a COMPLETE LACK OF RESPECT FOR ITS GUESTS that it would allow something so disturbing to occur until all hours of the night. Honestly, words cannot describe the scene that was taking place and I have no desire to ever travel to this property again. Why the management would think that it is acceptable to allow this to happen until 2am and keep all of its paying guest awake all night in their rooms is utterly beyond me. I hope that they go out of business, which won't be hard if they keep this stuff going. There were also 6 armed guards in the lobby for the party - generally when this is necessary, you shouldn't be staying at hotel. I am surprised there wasn't a stabbing or shooting given the crowd. As a side note, I am from Atlanta and this was even a shock to me. AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS. We moved to the Marriott city center the next morning which is quite nice and the staff is very friendly.

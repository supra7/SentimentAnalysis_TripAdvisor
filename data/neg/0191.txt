The Good: Good Location. The rooms are pretty good and a decent size, beds comfortable and the place was clean. Generally friendly and helpful staff. The Bad: The Elevators are a real problem. We had more than 4 hours where the elevators were not working at all. People were standed on every floor. We had to take the stairs from the 31st floor. It was endless waiting the entire week. The club lounge is pathetically small and there was no where to sit for breakfast (so don't bother upgrading to the club floor). The room air conditioning keeps you awake (even with the supplied ear plugs). For the price it was a very average hotel.

Currently beginning our second day. We travel with a nine-month old, and my wife had had an amazing experience at the W San Francisco so we hapilly signed for a five-day stay. Experience so far: Hotel fitness center is undergoing renovations for the next month and a half, a fact the hotel neglected to inform us of until we arrived. When asked what other ammenities the hotel offered, we were informed that there were none. When we arrived at our room, it turns out to have been smoked in recently, so we requested another room. which they to their credit took care of quite fast. That some staff obviously had knowledge of the state of the room (during room prep if nothing else), and the hotel still was not able to avoid this problem is an indication of little care. We had requested a crib for our baby, but when we returned from a day of walking the city, there still was no crib as requested in our booking so we called down to reqeust one. The hotel then sent a person who seemed like he needed to check the room before believing that there was no crib. It was then brought in with no crib blanket. We called down for one, and a blanket that looked just like an airline blanket was delivered. The hotel's tagline is "Welcome to the W, what's your wish," Well, I wish they would provide customer service.

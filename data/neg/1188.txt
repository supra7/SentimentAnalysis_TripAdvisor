Not impressed - dirty. We went to the red lion for the park fly and stay deal since we were going to be gone for 3 weeks we couldn't beet the price $130 plus $100 for the extra parking...total 230 for parking 3 weeks and a hotel cheapest price that i found. The front desk was very friendly and helpful but the room was dirty. Duaghter pulled back her sheets and found a hair on the bed..yuck, could tell they just sprayed the blankets ( a common practice with alot of the hotels if you don't know) not clean. My 12 year old was turned off so that tells you there...she doesn't really care about that stuff. Not impressed at all, made it look really nice online but rooms definately were gross!

I had to stay here for a business trip as my boss is a Marriott rewards member and we needed a hotel with meeting room facilities. I arrived before him and had pre-arranged a taxi to pick me up from the airport .and charge to my room. I was quoted a price by the hotel - and when I arrived, the cab driver tried to over charge my be MX$300! I queried with the hotel and they sorted it - but it seemed to go downhill from there on in. My room was on the side facing another building and was very dark - even at midday - so I had to have my room lights on all the time. I tried to move rooms but the hotel was full. When my boss did get there, we had a drink in the bar - which was really loud due to a live act. We were ignored by the staff and I had to go over and get someone to take our order. When we paid the bill. as we walked away a waitress (who hadn't even served us) ran after us saying we'd forgotten something. Not realising what it was we'd left behind - she then informed us we had forgotten to TIP and proceeded to thrust the bill back at us until my boss added a tip and signed it again! Flabbergasted to say the least. We were constantly made to feel like we had to leave a tip to anyone who dealt with us. The Concierge were generally very good and apologised for the taxi incident, and for the waitress but other than that I would not stay there again. I arranged a taxi with the hotel to take me to buy souvenirs - we agreed a price of MX$300 for an hour. We went and came back within the hour - guess what - the cab driver tried to over charge me! Definitely one hotel I will NOT be going back to.

My husband and I were very disappointed in the Hyatt Maui. This hotel is highly overrated and very expensive. The grounds are lovely but the rooms need updating. Our room was average size but the bathroom was very small (shower is in the tub with a plastic curtain) The maid service was lax. Our floors were dirty and we had to ask for soap and turndown service...all this for $500 a night! (be sure to inquire about additional hotel taxes) The balcony was VERY small with a tiny triangle-shaped table...not a relaxing spot to sit. The pool is nice but too small for such a large hotel. The chairs were so close to each other it was difficult to put down your pool bag and inconvenient for people to walk around. If you're looking for a nice beach walk toward the Sheraton. The parking was frustrating. The spots were small requiring most people to have assistance when parking. We frequently had to drive around waiting for someone to leave. My suggestion is to walk through the grounds but stay in Wailea.

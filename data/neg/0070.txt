Stayed here for two nights as part of a tour package. The location is great and the hotel has a good restaurant. However, some of the staff seemed to be haughty. The pillows were hard and lumpy, bedding needs to be replaced. The room was stuffy as the ventilation fan switches off whenever the room temperture approached the temperture set on the thermostat. There was no way to override this feature.

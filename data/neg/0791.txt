In a nutshell, this property is in no way up to normal Westin or 4-star hotel standards. Rooms are worn out and in dire need of renovation. Carpets stained and tattered, mold and mildew in bathrooms, smoky and musty smelling rooms. Most amenities such as bath robes and slippers are only available upon request. (you will want slippers if walking on the carpets) We viewed a total of three rooms on all different floors and each one was in the same sub-standard condition. My husband and I moved after one night due to the lack of cleanliness and machinery noise right beneath our room. There are so many other 4-star options in Seattle that are better value for the money. We spent the remaining nights of our vacation at the Pan Pacific - great! The one positive is that the management at the Westin recognized these deficiencies and made it easy for us to leave.

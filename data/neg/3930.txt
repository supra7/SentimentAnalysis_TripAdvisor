We are a couple, so we booked a room with one bed, but got a room with 2 single beds, with no fridge, microwave, or even a hairdryer. The room was booked as for the participants of math conference, but there were no free WiFi, no notepads and pens in the room. The fan in the room was making loud yelling noises, so we asked management to fix it. They offered another room next day - and that room didn't even have a bathtub, just a little shower, and it didn't have an iron, (but it had an ironing board, and a little bag with the parts of a hairdryer, hanging on the back of the bathroom door). The shower in the bathroom was smaller than we saw in European hotels. It impressed me so much that I took pictures. There was a piece of some plumbing on the floor in the washroom when we entered, which was not picked up by the cleaning lady even next time when the room was serviced. Even student residences have free WiFi and an iron in the room, so we expected more from Bostons hotel. The parking was 46$/day  the price of our day stay in the hotel in Orlando 2 weeks ago - we wish we knew it before handing the keys!!! The entrance to the hotel is however impressive, well decorated.

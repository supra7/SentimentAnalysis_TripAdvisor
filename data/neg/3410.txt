This property is exhausted. A major make-over is past due. The concept is great. The layout of the rooms are excellant. The managers reception and breakfast are above average. The staff was very helpful and professional. The biggest problem we experianced was charges on our credit card, after we paid cash upon check-out. After calling back to this property and explaining the situation, the clerk we spoke to assured us this would be taken care of. The next week a new charge was added to the credit card along with a credit which still did not fix the problem. The following week the credit was made correctly. Even with this mix-up I would give the staff an excellant rating. They were very helpful and respectful any time we had contact with them. Although, I have to admit with the price of our stay, using our AAA discount, I would stay here again even if the property is in the same condition.

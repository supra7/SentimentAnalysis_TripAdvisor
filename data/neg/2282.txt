Lets see where do I begin? I stayed in room 114 9/20-9/22. There were two double beds, and 4 lamps in the room. Only 1 lamp worked, the box spring on both beds were tattered and stained and the frame was not attached to the wall. Its supposed to include eating utensils and pots and pans. There were two plastic cups so worn and stained my wife and I refused to drink out of them. Just for the heck of it I opened the oven and it looks at though it had never been cleaned. There were unknown stains in the bathroon in several areas along with a big wad of dark colored hair in the corner near the bath tub. It looked as though the maids were either on strike or just didn't give a damn. The staff was friendly but that was the only positive about my two nights in this filthy hotel. The television is from the 1980's and there was only 1 chair in the room. I cannot imagine this room being an extended stay. I've seen jail cells with more ambiance. Do yoursel a favor and stay away from this extended stay hell hole!

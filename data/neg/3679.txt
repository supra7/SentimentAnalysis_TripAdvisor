This hotel has enough issues that it ends up being annoying. $38 for parking, free internet in the lobby, but $13 in the room (why is it that hotel paying guests pay for internet, but walkins off the street get it for free - hotels need to fix this), elevators that require the room card to be inserted before selecting a floor (but only on one side of the elevator, you can't insert the card on both sides - so you are all crawling over each over in the elevators trying to get your floor 'approved'), bad connecting door soundproofing - plenty of noise travels between rooms - very annoying, check in isn't until 4pm, and even then rooms weren't ready, and lastly LA Live - there really is nothing to do here - you are just stuck in downtown LA with views of parking lots and freeways with just a few chain restaurants around you. Truly, go somewhere else.

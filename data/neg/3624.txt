This was the first time me and my wife were in dallas and we wanted to stay near a good location and we tought this place was the deal. The price was ok and we also choose this place because we travel with our dog and is listed as pet friendly. The room was ok, but the doors are very thin and don't isolate the noise from outside the room. Imagine that, we had to deal with the sound of planes every hour or so and also with the guy next door who was having a lot of fun, yelling and laughing, we could acctually hear the conversations, that was so frustrating. I called front desk and complained about this unfriendly neighbor, someone from staff went to this guy room and ask him to keep it down but they didn't care. Around 1am we called again and they say that they cannot do anything about that, but they offer to change me to another room (why change me and not them??). I had to move in the middle of the night to another room to try to get some sleep... If you want to get some sleep stay away of this hotel.

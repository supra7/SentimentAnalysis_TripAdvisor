The Hilton might be a good place to stay during the high season, but there are better values to be found during the offseason. I am currently staying at the hotel and, despite the fact that the hotel is over half empty, they insist on the mandatory upgrade charges on their rooms. The vast majority of the oceanview rooms are empty. Wouldn't it make good business sense to put customers in those rooms when they're available so that it increases the likelihood that they would stay at the hotel again in the future? If the hotel was even half way full, I could see the need to hold the good rooms for last minute reservations. But the hotel is dead empty, and the front desk attendant wants to nickel and dime for a room above the third floor. It's unfortunate that they don't take advantage of the opportunity by spoiling the customers they're lucky enough to have. Also, one other pet peeve of my stay so far, we valeted our car overnight. We dropped the car off at the south tower and are staying in the south tower but have to walk a city block to the north tower to pick up the car when we need it. Once again, if the hotel was busy, I could see the need to force the flow of traffic in that direction, but there is nobody here. The hotel and location are good for daytona beach, but the lack of customer service etiquette is ruining this hotel's chances of thriving. Trust me, look around for other hotels. Instead of getting nickel and dimed like crazy, you can stay in any other of the oceanfront properties here and probably have a balcony overlooking the ocean for less. Feel free to message me with any questions.

In all fairness, this was the third of July and the hotel appeared very busy but we experienced an unfriendly front desk clerk who could not give our family two rooms next to one and other. Okay, fair enough. But the unforgivable problem was that the hotel did not have any double rooms left and gave us only a room with ONE small double bed to use for three teenagers! They could not allow a rollaway so one child slept on the floor and two shared the small bed. Being July, that evening things got warm and stuffy but the hotel has no air-conditioning so we opened the window. Problem is that the freight train line is right out the window and they run all night....loud horns! Finally, the kids had hot water but our shower did not get above Luke warm, uhg. This is a four star hotel, $34 a day parking, luxury spa products, they problems we experienced were unforgivable in my mind. Admittedly, we had one bad experience followed by another but I can see that if you had a room of adequate size and oceanfront you could have a lovely evening. The hotels common areas are fresh and relaxing. Sad to have had such an unpleasant experience.

I only stayed at the Palmer House Hilton because my meeting was being held there. The hotel is old and shows its age. The bathroom is small and the sinkpost was ducttaped. The walls are paperthin, every night I could here the crying baby in the room next door. Saturday night, a drunken guest a few doors down woke everybody up with his loud screams, throwing of stuff against the walls etc. It took the security guys a long time to subdue him, needless to say, I was up at 3 am and couldn't go back to sleep. And to top it off, I had a room in the front of the hotel where I could here the trains going by every minute, until 1 am, like they where right next to me. I will never stay there again!!

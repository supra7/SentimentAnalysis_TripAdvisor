We are a family of 5 , 2 adults and 3 children and we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights too long. The food there was like vomit on a hot dog. The beds are full of bed bugs and insects.The keys to the rooms don't work so you will probably have to change rooms every night (what we had to do). Don't let this put you off Ka'anapali beach because it is great but just make sure you don't stay at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. There are some great looking hotels at Ka'anapali besides from Ka'anapali Beach Hotel so try them before you even consider staying at KBH. P.S there was a massive poo in the pool when we were staying at KBH.

We stayed at the Eliot on 10/27/11 for 3 nights. Our original trip for our friends wedding to Mexico got ruined by Hurricane Rina so we (veryyy last minute) decided to take a road trip with another couple that wasn't able to get to MX. We tried the "unpublished hotels" option on Expedia. It guaranteed us 4 stars and within the immediate confines of Bean Town. Fine, we got 4 stars and within the confines of Bean Town but we also got an extremely hard bed, a weird shower with only 1 door that let the cold air in and water on the floor, a crabby and cheap (with the alcohol) bartender, and nooo parking. We spent $60 on 3 drinks and 1 ended up being a double because the bartender poured less than half the glass. My fianc asked for more and he said he'd have to charge us for a double. Go figure?!?! We're guests at the friggin hotel!! Either way, we wish we had been in Mexico and not in cold, rainy, snowy Boston. We would recommend the hotel if you're middle aged and stuck up. The Eliot is definetly not a place for a young hot couple looking to have a laid back and fun weekend. If you're looking to spend lots o' $ and get no perks (not even free wifi or a continental breakfast) stay there. One more thing.... Breakfast will run you about $25 per person. We opted for Dunkin Donuts and Mike's Diner while we were there. Hope this helps.

I read the reviews but chose to side with the ones liked it (btw, that has to be the staff giving those reviews!!). I thought it was a decent deal but when I realized I paid almost 150 a night for what is essentially an overrated roach motel, it was too late! To their credit the staff is very friendly but completely unorganized. They got my mixed up with another one in valet, then proceeded to not put the valet ticket in the window so the parking garage issued a ticket to my vehicle! Yet, they still charged me for valet (as a seperate charge done after I checked out because they originally forgot to charge me and had to run my card twice!) The rooms are super small, they sell it as a "deluxe queen" but they only have one type of room and it is has full size bed and an old school RCA t.v. I don't even want to talk about how small the bathroom is. I can appreciate older hotels and actually even prefer them, but this is not just the "character" of a building, the carpet needs to be replaced and it's dirty EVERYWHERE! In short, listen to what others are saying about this hotel and save yourself the trouble!!

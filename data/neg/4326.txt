I stayed in 3 hotels on this trip to Boston. Hyatt was just awful. From the moment I arrived in the pouring rain, no bellman in sight. I dragged in 4 suitcases (I was moving my son out of his university) and when i got to the front desk (stairs and an elevator ride away) the bellman had the nerve to try to load up my suitcases on a cart to take to the rm. No way i was going to top a bellman AFTER I had to drag them down stairs and elevator. When was leaving hotel to go out to eat, bellman SCREAMED down the hall at me, "WHERE YA GOIN?" - I guess that was his way of asking if I needed a cab. No greeting, just screaming at me down the hall. Hotel looks like 1970s, dark carpet, not luxurious at all. TV is an old clunker, no flatscreens, worst TV I have ever had in a hotel in yrs, terrible picture w/lines in it. I am at the hotel now and dreading having to leave because I have to deal w/the bellmen again. The Omni Parker House is close by and is a wonderful hotel- STAY THERE. The only thing I liked about the Hyatt was it is right on edge of a nice Chinatown for dinner. A couple of nice shabu shabu Japanese places in Chinatown also. Oh, and they charge for internet.

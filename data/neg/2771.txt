If you are a budget conscious traveller, save your money and sleep in your vehicle! After spending 1 hr in my room, I checked out, got my money back and slept in the car. The bedding was stained, the bathroom was dirty, I shared the room with cockroaches, the lamp short-circuited and stopped working, and the room smelled horrible.

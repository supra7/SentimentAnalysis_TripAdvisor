In my opinion, these people were trouble. I travel throughout the US and I have never experienced such poor service. "Dirty linen" was left in the middle of my room floor (for days), and garbage was left dumped over as well. Then they left linen with "throw up" in the middle of the hallway. No toilet paper -- the front desk told me to "go find the cleaning lady [on one of the floors] and ask for toilet paper." VCR broke, lamp broke, TV did not have a battery. In front of me, the housekeeper threw the comforter on the floor, stepped on them with her sneakers, then placed the comforter back on the bed! Mold was growing on the seal and wall. Foreign hair was in my shower throughout the stay, even after they "supposedly cleaned the bathroom." I was unable to connect to the internet for 3 days of my stay. The Manager does not manage the properly in a professional way -- it is more like a "mom and popp" shop, as opposed to a hotel for the corporate or leisurely traveler. I CHECKED OUT and found a much better place in Texas -- that is clean, with much nicer people. And now I have no complaints. After all you are spending, and you do deserve hospitality and good service. (Try the Crowne Plaza, Marriott, Best Western, Days Inn -- you are better off and the La Quintas if you are tight on money). And some of these places keep discount coupons -- so I would call them direct to knock a few $$ off. Paying the extra $10-$20 is worth not staying in a dump!! I spoke with their headquarters, and I have not even heard so much as a simple "apology." or even an inquiry. NO CLASS.

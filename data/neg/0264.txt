I have stayed at this hotel at least eight times- usually chosen because of its great location. This New Years Eve, my husband and I got a room that was more like a closet- it was clean enough, except that it had a musty smell with the addition of the aroma of old food and dirty carpet. The bathroom was in need of a total- gutting. Mold, broken tiles, chipped paint and altogether way too small to get dressed in ease and comfort. My toiletries fell off of the little ledge into the toilet, which by the way was jammed up against the wall- not comfortable or hygenic in my opinion. This hotel should shut rooms down and revise the floor plan- the rates they charge would then be realistic for the room size and better set up.

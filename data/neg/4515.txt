Had a good price so couldn't really complain but the hotel was overun with screaming kids. We called reception one night at 10.15pm as the corridor was full of kids yelling and banging doors. Security came and the mother just said "so what"! We asked for a slightly late check out but were refused as the hotel was full (we only wanted an hour and they didn't even check our room on the system) Nightmare leaving - we eventually reclaimed all our baggage from the store (5 bags including skis and boots) then had to move it ourselves - we'd just about finished loading it into the airport express van (with the drivers help) when a "suit" asked me how much longer we'd be (still not offering to help). Only worth it if you get a very good price, location excellent.

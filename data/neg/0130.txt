My boyfriend and I wandered in here late one night and managed to book a corner room on the 3rd floor for $60. The King's Inn is one of the only downtown hotels where I haven't been required to put a credit card on file. The pleasant fellow at the front desk did take a cash deposit for the old school metal room key he provided us. I asked about amenities and he mentioned a TV in each room. When I got to my windowless corner room I was appalled. The room was dingy, dirty and below the standard of all but the most flexible of travelers. The bed made us cringe, the door kept opening by itself and the portable space heater kept buzzing. The bathroom was very similar to the ones in an airplanes in size and the water pressure was awful. The linens were of the lowest imaginable thread count. It's really too bad, the place could be really cool if the owners spent a bit of money on it. Originally the Town Centre Motel, the hotel was considered the best located in the city in the 60s and features a cool mid century motor inn design. The location is pretty great... right under the monorail, close to the downtown/ retail core, Belltown and the Seattle Center. Unless you are stranded in downtown Seattle with no credit card I would not recommend staying here!

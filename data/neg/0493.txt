I wouldn't stay here again. The hotel wasn't very clean and none of the employees seemed to care about anything. The room was tiny, noisy, and smelled bad. I had reserved a crib, reminded them when I checked in, and then still had to call the front desk after I got to the room to ask them to bring one up. The internet connection was too slow to use and disconnected before you could complete anything. The vending machine on our floor was out of water so I walked to a gas station about a block away for some. I think I was the only sober person at the gas station except the clerk. I didn't feel very safe walking at night (late, but still light) in the neighborhood. Parking was free but there weren't enough spaces for the number of guests. If you didn't get there early and leave your car parked, you were out of luck.

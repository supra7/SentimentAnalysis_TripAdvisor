This Doubletree has a strange design, rooms are accessed from a huge central open space from the lobby to the top of the hotel...trouble is this big atrium echoes with noise including a squeaky escalator. There is also lots of traffic noise from the freeway intersection that surrounds much of the hotel (railway yards on the other side...only one side looks out over the river). The suites do have two separate rooms but no kitchen. Wireless internet costs $10 / day. We had twin beds that were terrible...very poor mattresses. The restaurant in the hotel has a nice location looking out over the river, but the food is poor (baked potato was rotten inside). Great cocktails so, and a lively jazz club next door. Parking is expensive $25/night.

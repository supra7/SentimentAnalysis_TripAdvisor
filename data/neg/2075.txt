Booking a trip & planning on staying in this seemingly nice, conveniently located hotel? [BUZZER]. This place, while typical in terms of rooms & public areas, takes a seriously huge dive when it comes to customer service. I cannot tell you how many times we received nasty jeers or sarcastic backhanded comments from EVERY LEVEL of service personnel. Room service? According to one employee, "You order it & then you come down & get it. You aren't in Beverly Hills." One night, when coming back from the city, the security guard treated us like convicted felons & PHYSICALLY escorted us to the front desk so he could "make sure you are who you say you are." Nevermind HE WATCHED US LEAVE THE HOTEL! When asking if the pool would be open at any point during our stay (an honestly OK question, I think), the employee behind the front desk stated, "Does it look like summer outside?" WOW. Just wow. Really. & God forbid you want anything EXTRA while you stay here. If you do, plan on emptying the contents of your entire checking account. Bottom Line-- the rudeness of the individuals working at this hotel left us with a bad taste in our mouths, both for the Hyatt company & the Memphis area. We might go back to Memphis, maybe, but you better believe we're making a beeline for the nearest Marriott.

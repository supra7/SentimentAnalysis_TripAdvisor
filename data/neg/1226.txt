Cheap, noisy The positive: $45/night, good for budget travellers. The negatives: thin walls, noisy rooms. The first floor rooms adjacent to the parking lot are really bad. You can hear people walking and rolling their luggage at all hours of the day. Someone was getting their car battery jumped at 2am and shining their headlights straight into the room, the curtains didn't help much. If you have to stay here, ask for a second floor room on the inside facing the courtyard.Loud parties and sketchy people walking around the halls.

We stayed for 3 nights for the weekend of the Regatta. Boston was expensive that weekend so we paid average of $500 dollars a night. I was expecting a luxury hotel at those prices. I was very disappointed with the hotel and was a disappointing end to our 3 week holiday in America. For a start we had a drink in the bar and there was a mouse running around the bar floor - I don't like mice as I imagine running up my leg. This may be an unreasonable phobia but for $500 a night - are you kidding me?. The waitress was aware and didn't flinch - he may of course been a pet? the food we ordered in the bar was pretty poor. The room was very small. We had 2 double beds but the double beds were very small compared to other hotels we had stayed with. The big things for me was the noise from the club which didn't stop thumping until 2 am in the morning on Friday night and then you have to wait an hour before the noise clears of people leaving. I don't understand why this hotel gets good reviews - I was so disappointed.

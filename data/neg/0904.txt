What a dump! The door to the room was warped and the room and hallway stunk big time. The bedding was stained as was the pillows and the box springs. Dirty room. The other one they offered was not any better. Was supposed to be a non-smoking room but couldn't tell it by me. We had reservations for 2 nights but could only tolerate one and that was only because we couldn't get our money back. Will never go back!

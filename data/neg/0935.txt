This hotel is advertised to be newly furnished. Yeah, about twenty years ago. But that is not the worst of it. The building was built for the World's Fair in 62 and the structure itself needs work. I heard the guests up stairs from 3am until 7:30am when they checked out due to the squeaky floors. It was horrible! For $100 per night AND additional fee to park in thier parking lot, it is a terrible deal. I stayed there due to thier dog freindly policy, but there are better places to stay, like the La Quinta Inn.

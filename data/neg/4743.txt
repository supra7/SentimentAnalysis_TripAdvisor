If you are expecting Ritz Carlton standards then do not stay here. The rooms are very dated and worn. The white paint on the doors and walls has started to turn yellow. Antique televisions stuck in a corner of the room. The staff switched our room 3 times, but moving us to a lake view room does not make up for the torn and stained rugs. They finally moved us to the Four Seasons around the corner which was excellent in comparison.

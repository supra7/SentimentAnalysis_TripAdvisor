I stayed for a convention -- although the rate was no doubt discounted, the value is poor. I stayed on the 32nd [top] floor and could hear (too well) the elevator motors on the roof. The restaurant was able to produce an espresso but they have not yet invested in appropriate cups. I ordered a beer from the menu but they were out of it. And they charge a ridiculous $2.00 for a toll-free call. If your convention takes place in the hotel then maybe that's a reason to stay there.

I am writing on my experience of the spa. The spa is located on the 72th Floor but you have to walk upstair to the 73th F to get change. The decor is blue and is like to department boutique store rather than a spa. The spa receptionists do not seem to understand their own services can have difficult time to explain. For all of the time they just stay inside the counter just like they are selling goods rather than service. The steam room and sauna room are quite small like a home sauna room. The jacuzzi has an open bath facing outside. As it is situating on the 73th F, there is a nice view of the city and the adjacent skyscraper residential building--I trust the bath is visible from outside as well. A very unforgettable experience is the service of the locker room. The locker room staff allow all the towel on the floor and ask the client to pick them up and clean the floor. I believe he may be trying to "train the client" instead of serving the client. This is very unusual in Asia where the service is normally good. Unbelievable is that there is no Q-tip in the room. When I ask for the Q-tips, he ask me one or two Q-tips!!! I guess he should know at least I need 2 for my 2 ears. On the other hand the massage is good and better than more hotel massage. But I have to say I will not be there again because of the attitude of the receptionists and the locker man.

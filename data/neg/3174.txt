this is by far the worst place i have ever stayed in my life, they have a serious problem with bed bugs, half way through my stay we changed rooms but it made no difference, my entire body from head to feet was covered in bites, i counted over 40 separate bites, constantly itching for days, absolutely disgusting, the showers don't even work properly so what chance do you have of getting clean, if you are considering staying here my advice would be get yourself a cardboard box and head to kings cross it would be heaven compared to the HELLingbury hotel!! oh and breakfast was a piece of toast and the rankest coffe the world has ever produced

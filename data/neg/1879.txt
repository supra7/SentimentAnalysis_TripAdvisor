We had a horrible stay at this hotel. Had the owner/manager told me on the phone that there were 2 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO ENTER THE HOTEL after I told him we had 2 younger children, one in a stroller, I never would have chosen this hotel. Of course he knew that and so opted not to tell me. The other aspects of the hotel were fine including the room and cleanliness. But the owner and his assistant said they would always help us with the stroller and bags but did only once or twice in our several arrivals and departures throughout our stay. One last note, the air conditioning broke after our first night. The owner installed a very noisy and not so efficient portable unit in the middle of the night and we slept horrible that and the next night. (It was a very hot weekend and no a.c. was not an option. Plus the room opened on an ugly public access roof top and we were not ready to have unexpected "visitors" enter our room if the windows were left open.) He was apologetic, but only to a degree. And if you can believe it, after our horrible stay, with not one concession after all of the trouble and we went through, while he was "helping" us get into our cab to leave, he offered to make us a deal on the price the next time we come back and stay at his hotel! HA, you can bet that will never happen! A LOUD WARNING TO ALL, THIS HOTEL HAS NO ELEVATOR! THERE ARE 2 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO ENTER THE HOTEL AND THERE IS ONLY ONE ROOM ON THAT FLOOR, MEANING THAT THE OTHER ROOMS ARE ANOTHER ONE OR TWO FLIGHTS UP! Wonder what he would have done if I showed up with a friend in a wheel chair. I advise him to risk loosing business and warn people that his hotel is filled with stairs. He would perhaps loose a small profit, but he would have happier clients and not risk having a review like this one to taint the image of his hotel.

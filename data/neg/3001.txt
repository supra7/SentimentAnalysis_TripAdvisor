I just got back from staying at this place. There were four of us in a room, and we each paid $120 for a Friday and Saturday night. I guess this is cheap for Ocean City during peak beach hours; however, I would have happily paid several hundred more to stay somewhere decent. While the hotel is in a prime location located on the boardwalk and across from the Jolly Roger amusement park on the boardwalk, the hotel is a total dump. Upon entering the room, I was immediately worried that the place would be infested with bedbugs and/or cockroaches. The mattresses were as thin as a crib mattress and the sheets and pillows were stained. The towels were the size of a hand towel and only one per person. If you wanted additional towels, you have to bring your soiled towels back to the front desk and they'll give you more. The sink is located in the room and the shower and toilet are enclosed in what feels like a tiny half bath. Be prepared to dry and change in the room, not the bathroom. The management was rude and they don't allow you to use the elevator. So be prepared to lug your heavy suitcases up a couple flights of stairs. I would never stay at this place again nor would I recommend it to any friends. This is the perfect place for newly graduated high school students on senior week, but not for a group of late twenty-something women.

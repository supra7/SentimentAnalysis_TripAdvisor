Oh my gosh -- I haven't seen this filthy of a hotel for . . . well, I can't remember when! The parking lot was a preview, but my wildest imagination couldn't have prediccted what the hallway carpets looked like! The elevator was abysmal. I'm not talking about new dirt or litter -- I'm talking about ground-in crud that would never ever come out! The rooms are old and not much better -- tho the bedding was clean and crisp. The closet was the smallest hole I've ever seen (smaller than a tall locker!) We stood in the room, recapped the clients that we saw on our way in -- and said -- we're out of here! I was afraid for the safety of my suitcases while we went down to try to get out of our non-refundable reservation. The office staff (the oriental young man) was especially kind and graciously did not charge us after all. Don't waste your time even THINKING about this hotel!

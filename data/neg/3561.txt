When we checked in we were told "Happy Hour" is 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. The sign on the door to bar/resturant said 4:00 to 7:00 "Happy Hour." We went to the bar at 6:25 and was told "Happy Hour" is over. We didn't argue with him and paid our tab. I would like for someone to inform him of the times. Also, no comforters on beds so ask for blankets at check in. Bathrooms are way too small. Our remote control for the t.v. went out and we took it to the desk. They had no replacements or batteries.

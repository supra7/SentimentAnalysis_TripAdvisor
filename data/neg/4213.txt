My visit to the the Boston Park Plaza was a disappointment. I read the reviews prior to my visit on Aug 11, 2003. I doubted if it were all true. But to my dismay it was right on target. Apparently the money spent on renovations was spent on the lobby. When the elevator doors opened to the floor to where my guest room was located, it was liked I stepped into the "Twilent Zone". It was a bezare feeling because it was such a sharp contrast from the lobby. The hallways was in need of new paint. The guest rooms were small because its an old hotel. But it is still not an excuse for dirty walls and sparce decorating. There is insufficient storage for clothing and toiletries. The bathroom was antiquated and hair found on the bath towels. The air conditioning was very inadiquate.and did cool the room. In fact it was leaking water that made the carpet wet all the way to the bed. As a result, it caused a musty order in the room. The only positive experience was that the housekeeper called the problem in, and to our surprise the front desk called with another room assignment. Of course, the bellhop never showed up as promised to help us to the new room. We moved ourselves. Beside this, my husband was annoyed about the $34.00 fee per day to park our car at the hotel. Otherwise, the hotel is in a good location.

The advertised ocean front rooms - aren't. There is no beach and the only view from the second floor unit was of trees. There are very steep stairs in the king suites. The housekeeper had no clean washcloths and said she would return with some in 25 minutes. We never saw her again. The bathroom had two hand towels and two bath towels. The mini-bar had a coffee pot, teeny refrigerator and a microwave but no sink and no towels. To make coffee you had to walk down the hall and into the bathroom to get water. The entire resort is non-smoking and people were smoking on their porches and at the pool. There was no place to set a laptop computer except on a low coffee table. The vegetation around the resort is very lovely. The rest - not so much. One has to wonder if the management is writing the reviews for this expensive resort.

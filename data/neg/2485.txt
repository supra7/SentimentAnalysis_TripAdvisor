Stayed here with my mum. Booked on line - but called before to check that they had family rooms, they said all of their rooms had pull out beds. Oh no they don't. Turned up and they only had rooms with one double bed. So had to sleep in same bed as mum. The mattress of the bed is SO thin you can feel the springs and the bed base through the mattress. The Carpet looks filthy. You couldn't open the windows, so the air was not clean and I felt ill after my stay. The hallway is very narrow, so much so that you can smell the other guests rooms as you walked by them. It is noisy - however my mum snored so loud that was the least of my problems. Totally understand that you get what you pay for - however I suggest you spend a few pounds more and go to the premier inn 200 meters away or the Hilton across the road.

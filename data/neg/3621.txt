I stayed here three days during a business trip. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible. They offer full kitchen facilities in each room. However, they only offer housekeeping services on a weekly basis. If you wanted clean towels or sheets, you would have to "exchange" them at the front desk. They offered snack items on the "honor system" in their room they called the Candlewood Cupboard. They weren't too expensive, but I usually went to the CSV next door because there was a better selection. If given a choice, I would not stay here again unless it was a last resort. It was better than a motel, but not as nice as even a Holiday Inn.

When we arrived at the hotel, our room was not ready, so they offered us another room, which was OK. Upon first entering our room, we were very pleased. It was all that we wanted. Large king-sz separate room, plenty of space in adjoining room, lots of cupboard space, etc. All seemed great. The pool was never packed, so the children had lots of privacy and space to play. Later that evening, we found a few ants crawling in the bathroom, which we killed and ignored. By next morning, the bathroom was full of ants. We went to the front desk and they said we could move into the room we were originally to stay in, which we did. No apologies offered, no discount offered - nothing. The morning we were checking out, we went to the main lobby for the continental breakfast, which by the way was wonderful - hot breakfast every morning - and on the way there, there was a huge bug in the hallway. When our son came down, he said that that was a cockroach (I had never seen one before). He had stepped on it to kill it. We were back and forth from our room to the main lobby and pool several times that morning; the cleaning lady had been down that hallway several times; but the dead bug remained. I also agree with some of the reviews regarding the location not seeming that safe. However, we did receive an excellent room rate and the room was what we wanted - just did not want the bug problem. I contacted Choice Hotels, who then forwarded my concerns directly to this hotel management, but have heard nothing to date.

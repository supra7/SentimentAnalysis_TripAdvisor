This was the worst, most maddening waste of money I have ever experienced. For nearly two hundred dollars, I had the worst hotel experience I have had in years. The hotel bills itself as an upscale hotel. The only thing that is upscale is the price! This hotel feel like a college dorm (a freshman dorm at that). This is clearly a very old, run-down hotel which has seen a few cosmetic upgrades  but its pretty easy to see beyond those cosmetics. The hallways are dirty and poorly lit. The room doors are beat up and do not give one a feeling of being secure at all. I was very nervous about my safety after walking down the hall! The room proper was okay but the bathroom hadnt enjoyed any updates and made me feel like I was staying at a 1950s motor inn. Yuck. The hotel is a walkable distance form the airport yet it took the shuttle over half an hour to pick me up. I stood in the freezing cold late at night and waited and waited and waited. While the other hotel shuttles came and went many time, my shuttle took a ridiculously long time to arrive  even after I called twice. The Holiday Inn and the Double Tree are just as close and they both looked just fine. Please check out one of those two and dont waste your money on this dump.

After reading shining reviews on this 'hotel' (which should actually be called a bed and breakfast) my partner and I booked the Hollingbury Hotel for our stay in London. Upon arrival we soon realised that most of the shining reviews were probably made up by the manager (who was NOT the most welcoming person) Location: The website mentioned that it was 'an ideal location' which is quite the contrary. At the time of booking, the website also mentioned that Madame Tussauds was a 10 min journey away and that it was close to all other London attractions (I see this has now been changed - perhaps because others who were decieved like us complained.) It is situated in Harlsesden, suburb far from the center of the city, which takes 40 mins to get to via the tube (and another 10 to walk to the station). It is therefore NOT close to London attractions as the website mentioned. Contrary to the website, the journey to Madam Tussauds takes at least 30 mins, not 10! Harlesden is not a pleasent suburb either - I would not have liked to wonder those streets alone at any time of the day. Room: Room was small but clean, as was the bathroom. The room did have some downsides though - firstly the 3 lamps in it did not even have lightbulbs in them, and we had no control over the heating.

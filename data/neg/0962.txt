We also had a reservation through expedia at the Vagabond (with a confirmation #) and arrived Friday Sept. 2nd to find a lobby full of angry people who also had reservations and had been told there were no rooms available. The manager was rude to everyone. After contacting expedia we were all transferred to another hotel. The other hotel was nicer but charged $21 US a night for parking. The whole thing took hours and we missed half a day of the music festival we had come to see.

This hotel should not be called a hotel. It is utter filth and I would not wish this mess upon anyone, not even my worst enemy. The rooms smell like mould and the bathroom is even worse. I have felt distressed the whole time staying here. Upon arrival we found dead cockroaches on the floor with more popping up throughout our stay. The only good thing about this place is you want to leave the room all day. No air con/ dirty microwave and toaster. Do not stay here!!!

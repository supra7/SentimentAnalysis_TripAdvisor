From the very beginning, we were disappointed. My mother is disabled and she looks forward to her annual Christmas visit to the Palmer. This year, when we arrived no one was there to help with the bags and we carted them inside ourselves. The elevators were unavailable, and we were told my mother had to climb the two flights of stairs. When I protested, a security guard was called and he unlocked a door & pointed us into a construction hallway. Again, we hauled our own bags and wound around until we found the elevators. Once up on the main floor, I had my mother sit in the overly crowded and dirty lobby. I am very shocked at the changes. The lobby looked like a bad bar scene with all the half drained wine goblets & beer bottles sitting on tables and even in the chairs. The grandeur of this promient lobby is now dwarfed with over-sized booth-like chairs making a horrible maze to get to the check-in desk. The young european lady who check us in spoke very little english. I wanted to confirm that the handicap accommodations for mother were in place. She "yes"ed us away so she could move on to the next patron. We were treated like a number not like a family meeting to spent a lovely long weekend in Chicago. On to the food accomodations, ONE restaurant! What has happened to all of the hotel's restaurants? We breakfasted in the new "Lockwood". Would you believe the hostess tried to seat my disabled mother in a round booth? When we explained that this booth, though lovely, would never work, the young lady lead us to a pub style table with elevated chairs!!!! Finally, we were seated at a traditional table with chairs. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the only reason I did not rank this visit "terrible". I would recommend this buffet to anyone, no matter what. I am not sure we will repeat our Palmer Holiday season visit next year - it might be time to start a new tradition. I hope your visit goes better than ours did. KMG

We recently booked a large block of rooms at the hotel for a wedding and brunch. The group reservations girl offered a suite for the Bride and Groom for the wedding evening. After getting the bill, it appears that our Group Reservations girl is no longer working at the Sheraton, and they refused to honor her commitment. We also booked a per person brunch with the hotel and had 70 guests attend. They presented me a bill for 96 persons on the basis that they had to set more place settings (as people moved to visit with others) and that rather than counting the actual number of people, they counted place settings. Not a really good idea when you have people going back for more food and moving to other seats to visit with other family and relatives. I would not recommend another event at this hotel.

I had a prepaid guaranteed late arrival reservation but was bumped when I arrived at 5 p.m. Other guests were allowed to check in after I arrived. To make matters worse, I had a sprained ankle but had to stand at the counter for 15 minutes while the clerk wasted my time insisting that she go through all the possible restaurants in town even though I told her I just wanted to get to my room. I was moved to a low rate hotel that was two miles away from my colleagues. The Hilton didn't even offer any compensation for failing to honor my guarantee.

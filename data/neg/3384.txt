I stayed here on business. The neighborhood is not so great. (strip clubs and "cabarets" are plentiful) They are very understaffed and the phone rings for a VERY long time before it gets answered. The rooms have a chemical smelling air freshener in them. The staff tells you NOT to walk in the area. Do Yourself a favor....drive two exits farther and stay somewhere nice.

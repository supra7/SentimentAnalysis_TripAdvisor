We stayed there for 3 nights in May last week. Everything is only the worst about this place. I am a hotelier myself so things seemed more out of place. Electrical socket was jammed, W/C (Toilet) was choked, no toilet rolls, no shower soap, no staff service. We changed the room from 804 to 904. Even the other room had the same kind of toilet. We went down to use the toilet in the lobby, even that was unclean. Worst pf all, one of the beds had the spring coming out, it was not at all appropriate and fair. But we did not want to take it any more, so spent 2 nights on the same bed. It is like a road side Sarai rather than a hotel. The karaoke on the 3rd floor is so noise, carpets are stained, and the staff there does not even speak/ understand English. Breakfast has very limited options, infact nothing for vegetarians, even the rice has eggs. Internet is also expensive and not free.

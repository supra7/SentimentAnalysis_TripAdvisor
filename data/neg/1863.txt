Booked & paid for a suite, initially got given a room. When I asked I was "upgraded" to a small 2-room apartment, where the bedroom was appreciably smaller than the previous room and the balcony was now missing. No hot water in either bathroom / turn on the tap in one and the pressure drops in the other. Rooms and common areas dusty and looked like they had not been cleaned recently - I would photograph if I had a camera on my phone. After a long day at work I couldn't be bothered to argue so asked to check out and refund security deposit. Checkin desk guy blanks me, woman in a suit asks if I have a problem. I later find out she is the Assistant Director of Sales, but not before she has walked off. Bellhop comes over and asks me if he can help and I explain that 2 people already nominally helping. Fourth guy walks up asks what the problem is and tells me to use the water heater - only need to wait 15 minutes and the water will be hot .... I am too tired to fight - just want a [hot] shower and a bed - but never, NEVER again! Why do so many places in the UAE get it so wrong? My requirements and expectations are modest but apparently unrealstic; all I want is an easy life, I'm not staying here for the luxury, just the basics. or rather, next time I'm not staying here at all. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this place; the Crowne Plaza is the same price and far better

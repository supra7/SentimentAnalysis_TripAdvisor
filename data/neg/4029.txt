Although this is one of the "Historic Hotels of America", it is definitely in need of a facelift. Good points: comfortable beds and pillows; courteous staff; good location to shops, restaurants, subway. Down side: no coffee maker in rooms; rooms are very dated and poorly maintained. The bathrooms are very tiny for American standards, along with dirty, cracked caulking, poorly draining tubs - you get the picture. Also, they appear to be very stingy with toiletries. I went two days in a row with one bar of soap for the shower and sink until I swiped another from the housekeeper's cart. After four days here, still am not provided with another body lotion. Time for another swipe...Rooms are noisy. On the 11th floor, the traffice noise is quite noticeable (and there are a lot of sirens in Boston). The fire alarm system malfunctioned - although it DID NOT AWAKEN us to evacuate (which is worrisome), the very loud announcements that it was OK to reenter the building did. Then we were in bed thinking what the heck - what if there had been a real fire??? Obviouisly, my first choice for another stay.

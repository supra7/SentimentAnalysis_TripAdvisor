I stayed at this hotel December 6 - 9, 2010. I was shocked how much it differed from other Hilton properties, although this was my first stay at a "Garden Inn" property. The room was so small that the bathroom door had to be closed before the door from the hallway into the room could be opened. Also, there was not enough room to even use one side of the 2nd bed because it was wedged against a chair and the wall. And parking.... guests must park at a public parking facility with a separate entrance... very hard to find, and the hotel's communications didn't contain this information. I circled the hotel, in rush hour traffic, several times before finding a place to pull over and call the front desk to locate the parking. When I was checking in, the woman in line behind me had had the same problem. The location of the hotel was difficult to get to, making the commute to and from the job site difficult. I elected to check out a day early, to move to a hotel near the departure airport, and it was a major relief to get out of this place. The front desk mis-handled the charges for parking, resulting in the need to locate the parking garage attendant and have him separately confirm I had paid all parking charges for my visit. When I initially called the front desk about checking out a day early, I first reached an obviously indifferent clerk who said she didn't have my info and couldn't help me. A 2nd call reached a clerk who did provide the help I needed. The only thing positive was the pub located across the street from the hotel. Each night they featured a happy hour menu that made for a very inexpensive, but good, dinner. If you are going to Baltimore, I suggest you stay at the Hilton on W. Pratt St. They are great; vastly different than this location.

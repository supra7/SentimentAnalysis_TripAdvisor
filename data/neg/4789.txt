Check- in was easy and fast. I stayed on 25th floor (Preferred Guest rooms) North Tower 5 for five day government conference. During my stay, I had to rekey the room key twice (security guard was rude at first but after a short talk he came around), noise from the elevator can be heard from the room all day all night, pillows were too soft for me, concierge lady (no greetings or a smile she was very dry when I asked for information on restaurants in surrounding area) and gift shop ladies were very unfriendly and unprofessional (they were too busy complaining about their coworkers while I and four other customers were in line to pay), quality of the food was not in par with the cost but service was excellent. I would opt to stay in Hilton or Marriot in surrounding area not this hotel.

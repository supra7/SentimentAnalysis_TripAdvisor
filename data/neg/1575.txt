Piccadilly is the word for [-] The hotel Piccadilly was not a good hotelthe only good thing about it, was the location in downtown Florence. The rooms were somewhat clean, but the bathrooms were disgusting. They smelt very bad, and the showers were just a shower head in the middle of the bathroom. The beds were decent, but the sheets were not clean. The windows did not shut, and the heater didn't work. We had no electricity one night, and there was a dog running around the hotel all the time.

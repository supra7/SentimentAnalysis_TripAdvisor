Although our booking was confirmed, Eris had only half the number of rooms available when we arrived. So they shipped half of us off to nearby hotels that were scary dumps. For example, the hall light was down the hall and about the size of a Christmas tree light, so i had to feel for the keyhole. Room had no trash can or drinking glasses. Bathroom smelled of sewage. Only one sheet on the bed so I took one from another bed and saw the blood stains on the mattress. There are many good hotels in Istanbul. Tonight I've moved to Hotel Ada and it's wonderful at a reasonable price - and much quieter and closer to the major sights Stay here instead of at the Eris.

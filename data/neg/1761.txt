Locked in the 60s. Maybe the 50s. It's a glorified motel. The rooms are Holiday Inn-ish at best. I had a "garden" view room. Make that a room facing the property line and the backside of the adjacent hotel. And dark... I needed every light on in the middle of the day. And because it was so close to I had relatives in a beachfront room... and that meant, a patio that opened onto the walkway parallel to the beach. It was loud, day and night and you felt as if you were sitting in the middle of a public square. Which, I guess, you were. The walls are paper thin, and I heard more than any decent person would want to, as well as the rumble of the elevator. I asked to be moved, but was told there were no alternative rooms. I was there for a family wedding, and really only used the room to change clothes and sleep. Otherwise I would have checked out. They had a bunch of tacky "real" Hawaiian experiences, such as a Spam cooking class and a jumbo sized chess board with three foot high playing pieces. If you want a safe, convenient place to shower and change your clothes, go for it. Otherwise, stay home, or spend the money for a decent hotel where they have put money into making a more comfortable property instead of cans of Spam.

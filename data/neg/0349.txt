Terrible, dumpy old hotel. Worst hotel stay of my life, and I've had some doozies in my hosteling years. In a bid to save money the management had shut off the AC for the season and the rooms were stifling. The front desk told us to open a window. Thanks, Einstein! I had to roll up a magazine to prop the window open. Still stifling. We tried wedging something under a hall door to the outside stairwell to try to create a draft. I spent most of one night trying to sleep in the lobby because it wasn't as hot as my room until the night clerk made me go back to my room. The bathroom was so tiny you couldn't sit squarely on the biffy because of the toilet roll dispenser being in the way. The trim around the floor was coming away from the wall. paint is peeling everywhere outside. The carpeting looks filthy. Good location downtown and the SBC was handy, but that's about all. They have WiFi which is nice but nowhere in the rooms to sit a laptop - except on your actual lap. Avoid!!

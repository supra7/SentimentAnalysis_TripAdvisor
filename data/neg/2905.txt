What horrifies me is that the pool has either sharp edges or glass in it. My son went in for a swim and came out with a deep cut on this toe! Considering suing the hotel Was very disappointed with room service too. Exorbitant prices and very meager servings. Except for the location and the helpful staff, nothing much of worth here

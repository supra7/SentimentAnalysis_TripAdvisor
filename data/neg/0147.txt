Easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Only stayed there because Holiday Inn screwed up our reservation and this was the only place in the area that had a vacancy. Upon arrival the room nex door was being fumagated by guys in white coveralls and respirators, spraying chemicals (probably to kill the cockroaches or to clean up after someone got snuffed the night before). It was noisy, cold, etc. Only stayed there 5 hours, checked in, returned at 3am and left at 8am. Couldn't get out fast enough. Larry, Canada

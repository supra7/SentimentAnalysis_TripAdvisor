This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff is friendly, but doesn't make up for the poor condition of the hotel itself. To start off with, you have to either go up steps or down steps to get to the elevator so forget about using a cart to take your luggage to your room. The rooms are small and furniture is shabby. The walls are very thin and rooms noisy. In the bathroom in my room, you can't put the toilet lid up without it hitting the handle to flush the toilet so you have to kind of sit down and lean forward so the lid doesn't go back and hit the handle or you have an instant bidet. I've stayed in better economy hotels than this is. The location is great, but the hotel is not worth the price.

The price was top-end but the hotel itself was lower than that. In the downtown area one would have been expected to get more with the money spended. The images of the hotel rooms at the website were nice, but in my case the room was without floor-to-ceiling windows. Actually there were no windows at all, the only thing was a door with a window to the balcony. In the room there was cold all the day due to balcony door. Quality/price ratio was poor, unfortunately.

A so called boutique hotel but many aspects are not functional. For example, the basin in the bathroom has no plug and nowhere dry to leave the soap. The first room I was shown was very very dark and the second very small, both smelt damp - I think because the showers don't drain properly. Wi fi didn't work and the business centre only has armchairs not desks! Breakfast good but zero atmosphere in the bar - I was on my own. Very poor wine selection.

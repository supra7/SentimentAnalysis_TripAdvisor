We made reservations and pre-paid 4 months ago and when we arrived our room was mysteriously not available. I heard every excuse in the book from we have a convention to we are a new hotel. Being open 1 year and 1/2 doesn't constitute a new hotel. We stayed in a room the first night that was not what we paid for or wanted, then by agreeing to sit through their high pressure sales pitch the next day we were given the room we originally paid for. Not the kind of experience you want to go through on a vacation. They promissed a couples massage which was never provided and the room smelled and the door was very hard to close and wouldn't stay closed.

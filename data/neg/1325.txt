I needed an airport hotel to stay overnight so I would be pre-positioned for an early flight one night when an ice storm was pending. I chose the Hilton for it's location (right across the street) and quality (I could get some work done). I booked through the Hilton website, where I am a silver member. This hotel, while clean and well-appointed, is far below the standards set for the chain for service and amenities. It is a sprawling horizontal building, rambling over a hillside with very poor markings. We drove around it several times trying to find the entrance. The checking was slow: they were understaffed and lingered over the many questions of confused travelers while the lines grew longer. The room that I was given turned out to be literally a quarter mile away: across the lobby, around the restaurants, down one long hall, through the convention area, down another hall (at this point a hotel employee pointed me onward as I studied a map), around the fitness center, up some stairs, an elevator, another long hall...amazing! The room was huge but spartan. Internet access was extra !! well over $10 for the night. There are lots of outside lights from signs and traffic, parking lots and streets. Bathroom was as-expected, good hot water and pressure. The morning was the same in reverse, a long trek to checkout, endless lines that didn't move because of chronic under-staffing, and no breakfast snack or coffee offered. The shuttle bus was confusing: but was on time. I'm sorry, this experience was rough, and well below Hilton standards.

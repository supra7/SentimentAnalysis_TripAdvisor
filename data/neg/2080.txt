uThe Hyatt has established an excellent name for itself, but there is always a sour apple, and this hotel in Memphis, TN at the Wolfchase Galleria is the sour apple. We made our reservation way ahead of time and confirmed with them that our room was GUARANTEED and that no phone call is necessary to confirm our registration. Upon arrival, which was later in the evening, we were informed that the hotel was full and that our reservation was given to another client. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND that they were still going to charge us for the room without checking or notifying us. We never informed them that we were to cancel our reservation. This is horrible service, and a true inconvenience. How can one rely on a hotel with such prestige and great service when they treat their clients like this. Additionally, we reserved directly with the HOTEL, and willing to pay the full price, and not some discount online price. So to those who are traveling to this hotel for business which is in a great location, be cautious. Memphis is not a safe city, and when you expect great service for an expensive price, you WILL NOT get that with this Hyatt. Oh and the best they could do was to put us into a Best Western nearby (which is cheaper, and not the comfortable room that we expected, and we were not given any additional coverage for inconvenience). This is not an apology, this is just a way to shove a client like us away. I will not be staying at this hotel again because I expect to arrive to a GUARANTEED RESERVATION without complications. And for other business travelers, a GUARANTEED RESERVATION matters when you are focused on relaxation after a long trip. Truly unprofessional and unreliable. The very least that they could have provided was a an early phone call informing us of overbooking and difficulties with reservations. Instead they were willing give us no notification and still take our money. Truly unprofessional.

The new hotel is beautiful, chic. The rooms quite spacious and pretty, very nice bathroom. But --and this is huge-- I had one of the worst experiences ever. I had a room with a connecting room door. all night I could hear the television the other room's guests were listening to: not the muffled sound of a television, the word for word exact dialogue of the program. And the tv was not on loud. I could also hear the exact conversations of the guests, who were not speaking loudly. I could not sleep, as every sound, cough, grunt, from the room next door sounded like it was in mine. When I told the check out desk of this they told me they have this problem with all rooms with connecting room doors and lowered my bill, which did not return one minute of rest or comfort to my stay. Really dreadful.

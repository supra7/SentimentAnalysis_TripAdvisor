I tried to save money on this trip and thought by cutting hotel costs it would be the best way. Unfortunately I made this decision and my family and I suffered. The rooms are all non smoking, or so say the signs on every door. The first room we had was Ok until we turned on the A.C. The air coming out of the A.C. smelt of cigarette SMOKE. We waited a few minutes to see if it would maybe go away, it didn't. The second room they gave us smelt of MOLD and very musty. The third room they gave us smelt of a book store. Because we already prepaid the room , we could not just cancel our reservation. We stayed in the third room and ended up spraying it with a room spray that was unexpectedly packed into my bag. The hallways also always smelt of cigarettes. Next time I am paying the extra $$$ to get a better room and no worries. Also parking seemed to fit exactly one car per room and had very tight spaces.

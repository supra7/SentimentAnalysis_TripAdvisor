After we booked a room 6 weeks in advance we were contacted 3 days before our trip and advised that the hotel was overbooked. The employee offered to "hook me up"' on my next trip to Seattle. A lot of good that does me now right before a trip, as of right now 90% of the hotels in downtown Seattle are booked, unless I want to pay 400-600$ to see a baseball game.

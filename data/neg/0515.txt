The Sheraton Hotel in downtown Seattle has an excellent location and the staff were all very friendly. However, my husband and I were shocked at how thin the walls were at this hotel. We could easily hear our neighbors on both sides of our room. In one room, there was a woman with a very bad cough - totally not her fault but we felt as though we were sharing our room with someone with a bad cold. We could hear her coughing literally all night. On the other side of us, we had a group of people who were in party mode. Finally at 1:30a.m. my husband called the front desk, and they had to send someone up to deal with the situation. We will not choose to stay at the downtown Sheraton again - the next time we decide to take a night off, we will be staying elsewhere. The other disappointing thing is that the hotel charges $44.00 per night for parking. We are completely used to paying for overnight parking but this amount seemed very high to us.

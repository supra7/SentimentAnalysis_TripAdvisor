Staye here becaus eit was close to McCormick Place attending a convention. Rooms were clean, food was average. Service terrible, took 60 minute to get breakfast. The beds are hard, people rude almost to where they don't care. Everybody is slowwww here. Stay at a Howard Johnson, Best Western, etc. You can't walk any where because of the area. Train goes buy every 15 minutes so bring ear plugs and valiam to get to sleep.

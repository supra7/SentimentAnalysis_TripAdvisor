I stayed here for a business trip and will probably avoid this hotel. It really is beautiful, with incredible eye-catching decor not just in the lobby but also tasteful pieces in the guest rooms. However, it's not worth it when it comes to the service. Every person I encountered (front desk, concierge, etc.) treated me rudely or coolly. By far the worst part about it was when I was checking out--they handed me my hotel bill in a SEALED envelope at the final moment and then started serving the next person in line, so that I couldn't review the charges before leaving. I have stayed in numerous hotels and NEVER have I encountered this before at any hotel--usually I am asked to review the charges before they actually charge me, in case there is anything amiss on them. I thought that this was really strange. So, just to make sure, while I'm standing there, I open the envelope to review the bill, and lo and behold, find a charge on there that wasn't mine, for pizza. I had it corrected, though it was incredibly awkward with the person after me being helped, and the staff member behaving as though correcting a charge was a huge inconvenience for her. The other downside about this hotel is that they nickel and dime you for little things that other hotels would not charge you for (internet, use of the gym, etc., and I didn't even use the parking garage), so it appears to be cheaper but in reality is probably just as or more expensive than other hotels in the area. In addition, it is a busy hotel--when I was there, there were probably two different meetings going on simultaneously, so the lobby was often crowded and full of people. The location of the hotel is both good and bad--it has great views of the water, and is right next to the convention center. However, it is a little bit more of a hike to the restaurants in the Gaslamp.

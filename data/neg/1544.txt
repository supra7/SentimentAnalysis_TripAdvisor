What was suppose to be a lovely weekend to celebrate my 50th birthday became a nightmare the minute we arrived at the Hilton Front Desk at 3:30pm. We were told that our room was not ready and placed us in another room without asking us if it was okay. The person in the front desk just talked real fast and gave us the key to a room that was not what we had reserved weeks before. When we told them we did not want that room and that we would like to get what we reserved we were lied to by say the room is not cleaned and will that they will let us know when the room would be ready. 5 hours later no phone call at all and we had to approach the front desk and ended up staying in room facing construction work, and with all our plans ruined. This has been the worst experience in a hotel and I would never recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. It is overrated. This is what we asked for and the Hilton confirmed to have it ready for us "CORONADO VW 1 KING BED RM" We also waited with many other hotel guests for their rooms so there is no telling what happened to them.

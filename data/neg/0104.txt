for the price i paid...it was okay. spent 2 nights there before going off to family's home about 45 mins away for additional 2 days. didn't want to bother them because we were there for the weekend (wedding). just wanted place to sleep and store belongings while shopping and sightseeing seattle. room run down. very dark - dark brown/dark orange/maroonish color decor. but clean. had running hot water. no problems with bath/toilet...clean and functional. tv sucked though. could only catch 2 stations and they were pretty much snowflaked. got free internet wifi from next door hotel (monaco i think). definitely not elderly or handicap friendly with stairs to get into lobby and no ramp. but i paid for location without breaking my bank account. doubt ill stay there again...i might pay extra 50-75 a night next time around.

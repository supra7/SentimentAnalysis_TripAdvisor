Agony Bay Feb 14-21Where do we begin-no white sand beach or calm caribbean water as in the brochure. Water is too rough for water sports, small kids. Red flag (don't go in) or yellow flag (enter with caution) everyday. No one goes to the beach. Broken glass and garbage. Pool was dirty, jacuzzis dirty when they worked, public washrooms unsanitary fith-day two couln't face them anymore and used my room one all the time. We had 4 rooms all with issues from no bedding, no shower curtains, leaking toilet, shower heads that fall on you. No one helped with the luggage. They don't offer kleenex, clock radios, irons/boards, telephones etc. Food is a 2 out of 5. Small buffet but edible. Don't believe the several a la cartes. A lot of staff who don't speak any English. Bar tenders are your best friends. It's the only way to get through the week. Anyone who has never travelled may find it acceptable but if you have anything (even 3 stars) to compare it to you would rate it a 1 or if generous a 2 star. Sunquest will be receiving our official letter of complaint.

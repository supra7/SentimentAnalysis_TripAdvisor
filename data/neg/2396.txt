I live in the Chicago area and purchased a coupon through We Give to Get to use at the Dana's spa. My husband I excitedly booked two appointments for Saturday and noted the four-hour cancellation policy when we did. Unfortunately, I did not notice that the coupon could not be used on the weekend until I printed it out two hours before our appointment. I quickly called the Spa, thinking that either a.) they would accept the coupon in good faith since I had made a genuine mistake, or b.) allow me to reschedule. Not only did they refuse to accept the coupon, but they called me back after I cancelled the appointment to inform me that I was being charged $100 in late fees! I nearly cried - I have now spent $90 on a coupon that I never want to use because the hotel was so rude to me, but I have also wasted $100 in late fees. I do understand it was my fault that I overlooked the small print, but in my experience, the hotel industry is much more accommodating. If the Dana is not supportive of We Give to Get, then it seems the underlying reason to work with We Give to Get, e.g. exposure/advertising and the appearance of a commitment to charity endeavors, has been defeated. As of now, I have a sour taste in my mouth about this hotel and will never recommend it to family and friends who travel to Chicago. Nor will I use its spa or other amenities.

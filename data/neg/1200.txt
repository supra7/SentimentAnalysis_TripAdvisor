worst Ive ever seen Don't do it! Im stuck here for a week on buisness. horrible location, no food or drink anywhere nearby (unless you want to live on coffee shop sandwiches) No Wi-fi, Shabby unkempt rooms. A free shuttle to the flight museum dosent cut it as an ammenity. Lets see, Clueless inept staff, random debris and furniture cluttering all the hallways. This has got to be the worst place Ive ever been stranded. Enough to turn me away from the entire Red Lion chain for good. Dont do it,no matter what

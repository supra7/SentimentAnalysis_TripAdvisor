I hated staying in this hotel. First of all, there's a very strange building next door which I think either houses the homeless or the crazy's. There was one lady at the front desk who was nice. Otherwise the guys behind the desk are rude, punk college kids. I had several run ins with their attitudes. Also on one particular day they were cleaning the windows; the guy propped up his squeegee which ended up falling over and hitting me.The walls are really thin and I had a room by the elevator so every time someone came on and off the floor I heard it. I would never stay here again, I chose to stay in this location because it was the only affordable thing around the convention center. However on the price vs. quality comparison, it was still a rip off.

I recently stayed 4 nights at the Westin on business. It was a dismal experience. The room was dark, creepy and old. It was also pretty small and the bed was a murphy style that flipped down from the wall. One plus: the fabulous view. I had breakfast in the casual eatery each morning and found it to be overpriced...a egg mcmuffin style sandwich and a bottle of water ran $13. Room service was even pricier, the one meal I ordered was bland and tasteless and ended up costing $42. The worst part about my stay was while I was waiting for room service. I get a call telling me to open my door and when I do, I find another door has been closed, thereby locking my room and the room next to me off from the elevator vestibule and hallway. It was not just closed, but locked witha deadblot, and the top latch thrown, too. This caught me completely off guard and when I opened it the room service attendant could tell I was flustered. I asked who closed and locked that door and he was as dumbfounded as me. All he could come up with was that the person in the room next to me had closed it perhaps to make it quieter....why the Westin even has doors like that is beyond me. I spent the rest of the night uneasy.

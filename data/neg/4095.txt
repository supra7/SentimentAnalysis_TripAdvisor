My room was small and dirty, with most surfaces suffering some form of dirt or stickiness. The smallness I don't mind, but the stickiness I don't need. The decor was intended to signify high class, but the quality of finish (chipped and dirty paint and tile, 50-year old hardware, woodwork, and even a vintage 1950s HVAC system!) destroyed that vain attempt. The bathroom was too small to swing a kitten, which again is no problem unless you lay the thing out without any concern for the idea that people will need to use it. Sinks of miniscule depth located directly under shelves are fine if you want to splash like a dolphin or crack your head open on a daily basis. Did I mention the outlets? Don't plan on using more than 2 electrical devices in your room. Clearly more than 2 surface-mounted retrofitted outlets was going to bust the rennovation budget on this place, as was any kind of decent internet access. The modem was screwed into the bottom of one of the desk drawers (I found out because it was broken and a tech had to come and replace it), presumably because otherwise the clientele would steal it? So I ended up ruining two pairs of trousers on the screwheads that protruded underneath the desk, while trying to work there. That leaves a nice impression too. The crowning glory was a 1:30am fire alarm that sounded without cessation for 10-15 minutes, which although apparently a false alarm (sadly the building was not afforded the opportunity for a proper gut-job rehab) caused all (500+?) guests to evacuate the hotel into the lobby or the street, in complete confusion with no more than 5 hotel staff in evidence. I hate to think what would have happened if there had been a real fire. Conclusion? Don't stay here. It's not nice, it's not classy, and it's not efficient or even clean and modern in any way. Spring for the extra money for somewhere genuinly nice, or stay elsewhere and spend the money you save on cabs to get downtown.

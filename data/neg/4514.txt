The first evening I was there I spent well over an hour and a half on three separate calls to technical support for their wireless system. They were never able to connect me and I spent the entire visit (3 days and 2 nights) without access to e mail or the internet. This was a business trip and no access was a real problem. Then, when I got back, I discovered the many changes technical support had made to my laptop settings interferred with my ability to access wireless in other settings. It has taken 2 days to straighten that out. What a nightmare.

We were four and the rooms are so small...they only had king bed and a day bed for a family of four. the roll away bed couldn't fit in the room...the bed has bugs and staff is so rude from top to bottom...we visited three islands and Maui was our last destination spot and what a horrible way to end a ten day trip to Hawaii...We had gone through a travel agent and they had praised this hotel about having a Hawaiian living culture and property so cultured...this was worst than a Motel.....Never Again...I am so mad with the TOur company and the agent for putting us in this hotel..we had bought the breakfast package ahead of time and still upon arrival, they refused to cover the children and we ended up paying for it there....If I could grade this hotel in negatives I would....

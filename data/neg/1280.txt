The free airport shuttle was convenient and the driver offered to take us to local restaurants. The outside of the hotel is acceptable. Our room had a strong cleaning chemical smell. The bed was hard. We booked this hotel based on an advertisement at Pacific Central Train station in Vancouver, BC. The advertisement was for $55/night. When we arrived at the hotel they said it was $65/night and could not change it. I called the Quality Inn Customer Relations number and they said they would have the local hotel manager call me but he never did. We left the hotel after one night because of no resolution to the false advertising. Of course the $65 rate was for a room in the basement (no elevator) with choice of a view of dirt or a high fence in front of a storage yard. On the plus side: the room had a refrigerator and microwave. Breakfast was fair with sausage and watery eggs, cereal, muffins, yogurt, fruit, and juices. They did have a waffle machine which was nice.

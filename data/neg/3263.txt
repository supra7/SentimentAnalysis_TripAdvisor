The HIE at Safa Park in Dubai is in the Business Bay area, so hardly a resort sector of the town. That means guests are essentially there on business. There are five essentials to the business traveler: A comfortable room, a work area in the room, tea and coffee making facilities in the room, internet connection and a decent breakfast. Safa Park Holiday Inn Express only managed the first three. The internet was a disaster. First, they charge for it, which as all businessmen know (and almost certainly agree) is a rip-off as it costs an hotel nothing. But I have never staying in a HIE yet where it was charged for in the lobby too. But Safa Park does charge and very largely, it doesn't work. In the room connection has to be by cable and they demand a deposit for it - and then it still doesn't connect. The front desk, after much messing around finally came up with alternative routes to get to a connection, which had to be in the restaurant as it was impossible to balance a laptop on those low couches in the lobby....not impressed. If I have to pay for it at all, then I expect to be able to connect in my room. And breakfast...why only provide hard boiled eggs? The much-advertised free breakfast at HIE includes baked beans, turkey bacon (tasteless, don't know why they can't serve real bacon when most of the kitchen staff are not actually Muslim), and hard boiled eggs! Why can't they make scrambled like other HIE locations? I would rather pay and get the day off to a decent start. Otherwise, it is the usual model for HIE, generally one of my favoured locations because it is reasonably-priced and you know you will get a reasonable sleep and can make tea in your room (powdered milk, unfortunately, but you can usually scrounge some). But it was $250 a night! For that, I expect a decent breakfast AND free wi-fi.

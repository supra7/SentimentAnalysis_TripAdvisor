We live in Wisconsin and often take overnight weekend trips to the big city of Chicago with our dog. Be warned that the pet friendly rooms at the Palmer Hilton are old, run down, next to the elevator and a little smelly. Even though you pay the same rate as other guest, don't expect the same treatment. You also have to take the service elevators up/down with the dog. Thankfully Sasha is a toy poodle so we snuck her on the regular one without notice. The nearest green space is blocks away on Michigan Ave. Not ideal for that last outing of the night. Oh - don't even think about letting your dog do any business on or near Centennial Park. The guard actually yelled and ran after us. This was quite entertaining considering the guard weighed about 350lbs. House of Blues is much more pet friendly and there is more green space nearby.

If you're room is strip view (also pool) and on floors 16 17 18 19 20 you should instantly refuse to stay in them in you plan to sleep past 9am. The pool music is so loud and crisp that it's the same as having a clock radio go off in your room every morning starting at 9am. I'm an extremely deep sleeper but i can't get past the bass from the r n b hits playing LOUD 15 metres below me. I stayed in suite 1727. I decided to give up trying to sleep through this and live with the inconvenience of packing all my clothes and all the food i got for the kitchen and move but at 9:30 no other rooms were available and i was told there was nothing that could be done until 2 hours time. The receptionist said she would ask if they could turn the music down around the pool but that never materialised. The rooms are nice, beds are nice, bathroom shower and hot tub are all very nice but i'm not saying much that i wouldn't be saying about the wynn or venetian or bellagio for the same price range. The rest of the hotel is underwhelming, the dinning the room service the pool. I would only recommend staying in this hotel if you make absolutely sure you will be higher than floor 20 and don't care for the strip view or if you plan to be awake before 9am every day and like not having a casino in your hotel. Otherwise stay Wynn/Venetian/Bellagio.

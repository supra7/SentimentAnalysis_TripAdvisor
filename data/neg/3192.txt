The riders lodge is better off as a holiday chalet or bunglow in my opinion. The rooms had a stale smell and had no windows. The free wifi did not work well, the signals were weak. I asked for a room change vut was turned down. Management is aware of tne problem but choose not to do anything about it. Location far to city. Long walk to bustop. Taxis do not come in frequently. Breakfast was terrible. No shops within walking distance Dogs barking in the morning. No porter service Avoid this place if u can

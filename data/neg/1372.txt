The Hotel Colonial is an inexpensive hotel, for the price ranges between 55 and 75. Now, the front desk service is divided by those who are polite and efficient and those who are not. That is, The morning front desk person (a middle age man) was very polite and helpful, but when his shift is over--everyone else lacks the qualities the morning person, except one young man with eye glasses--who was very nice and even offered me a refund for leaving the hotel before my initial stay. Now, the worse thing that the hotel has is the room service, specifically a middle age lady that constantly knocks your door to disturb your sleep to offer you towels. If you wake up and leave the hotel for the day after 9:00 am she would not clean the room--she did this twice when I stood there, for I expressed grievance the next morning to front-desk. This lady made the whole stay at this hotel my worse experience ever--I mean, one of the day's during my stay--she even handed "clean" towels and told me that because the room seem to be clean, she didn't have to clean it, and complimenting me for being neat. beware of this lady

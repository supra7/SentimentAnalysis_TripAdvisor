In all honesty, don't waste your money on this hotel. Its over rated, over priced and definitely does not stand up to the Starwood name and I'll tell you why. The AC was broken in our room and when we called the front desk to see if it could be fixed, the receptionist was rude to us telling us we had to deal with it until the AC man could come, but he wasn't to be coming for another 5 days! Obviously they couldn't put us in another room. This is the first hotel where I have been to show my ID to get a new room key, they don't even do that in 5 star hotels, who on earth do they think they are? And it took the receptionist 5 minutes to find our reservation. Don't stay here! Seriously, I recommend going for a cheaper and better 2 Star hotel or another 3 Star hotel because this one is not worth your money.

This is the worst hotel I've stayed at in Boston, and as a frequent business traveler (despite this being a pleasure trip), the worst hotel I've ever stayed at that was rated 3.5 stars. Why? The rooms are not clean. Someone had vomited in my room, and the bed spread was left with the vomit on it after housekeeping had cleaned. They had also omitted cleaning the minifridge, cleaning marks off the wall and chair, and removing dried gum from the nightstand. As a Gold HHonors member, the hotel upgraded us to breakfast with hot items from the Diamond Lounge Continental Breakfast (but if you have to pay an upgrade fee, don't, because it wasn't well prepared or tasty). In any case, the upgrade wasn't necessary - only a clean room was, but they could not accomplish that. The floor also smelled of smoke and the hotel couldn't identify the source for about six hours. The front desk manager's response? Deal with it or leave. The hotel does nickel and dime - no free internet ($14.95/day), parking ($44/night), etc. There are much cleaner, more service-oriented, and more modern hotels in Back Bay, Downtown, and the North End for the price of this. See my pictures for the proof of what I've said in the review.

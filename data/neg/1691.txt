This was our first stay at the Hyatt, but our 6th trip to Maui. We love Maui. I must say that the staff is very friendly and helpful, with exception of the very first person we encountered who was courteous but for some reason put us on a smoking floor and in a smoking room. The bellman asked if we were smokers and took immediate action and contacted the front desk and took us to another room on another floor right away. I was disappointed with the rooms because they aren't cheap and it seemed that they were musty smelling and the bathroom floors were sticky. Another problem for me was the air-conditioning which were not working properly for my satisfaction. It was quite humid in Maui: the upper 80's to lower 90's and the room had the sun shining in on it in the morning. When I contacted the engineering dept. to come and look at it they said everything was fine, and offered to send an electrical fan. We spent 24 hours in this room then switched to another room next door and had the same problem with the air-conditioner then later that night the entire building's (Lahina Tower) air-conditioning system shut down due to a chiller problem. They got it up and running but it never got cooler than 75 degrees in the room. The bathroom didn't have a vent or venting system so when you took a shower all of the steam went into the room area which created some more heat... you get the picture. I did complain but they never offered to move us to another building because it looked like the hotel was sold out. The grounds are lovely with beautiful gardens, ponds, and waterfalls. It appears to be a kid friendly hotel many animals (penguins, flamingos, swans, parrots, koi fish ponds etc). They have a huge water slide and a whole area for children with a wading pool and small slide for younger children and sand area. They also have a kids camp as well. We do not have young children so I cannot comment on the camp. Maui has gotten extremely expensive!

While the KBH does seem to be the "Most Hawaiian hotel", the bad smell and marginal rooms made for a below average stay. We made our reservation over the phone and were clear we wanted to attend the Ohana Breakfast. Upon arrival, the clerk said that we were not entitled to it. After objecting, he relented, but it felt like we were "ripping them off". Not a good start. Then the room was small, basic and plain. That was the good part. The walls are thin and it smelled - bad. So, it was easy to spend the day outside. The location is okay - not a beach to snorkel at, but if you've been to Maui, you know that. The traditions at the hotel are nice. You feel good upon leaving with their farewell ceremony. All in all, we will stay somewhere else next time.

Upon check-in, met with an older white male clerk who looked at me as though I smelt bad when he saw we booked through hotwire. (I am an African-American female) He proceeded to say they were sold out (on a Tuesday night) and offer me a roll away in a partial suite or a smoking room. There are no amenities except USA today - not even a coffee maker (unless you pay for it) Room very small in back corner of hotel. We travel alot - sometimes with hotwire, most time not. When we do, however, we have still been treated courteously, and given a decent room. As a Chicago native, I am aware of the history, and the age of the hotel, but it was disappointing at best. Great location is biggest benefit.

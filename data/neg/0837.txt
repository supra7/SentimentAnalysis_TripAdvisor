For our summer vacation to Seattle, we had determined to book our 4 night stay at the Westin Seattle, because... - The HUGE towers provided a great view of the water. - They were the only hotel in the city that could provide us with connecting rooms. - and, the rooms looked clean and well updated onlinevery 4 star. From the moment we stepped up to the check-in desk, the Westin Seattle FAILED on all of the above aspects (which are marketed...on the telephone, on their website, in the info. provided to expedia, etc.) Immediately after booking (7 weeks before our stay) and on the morning before arriving at the Westin Seattle, we called the Westin Seattle to ensure we would receive connecting rooms. We were told that 95% of the rooms connected, and it wouldnt be a problem. We were assigned rooms...several rooms apart from each other... on the 12th floor of at least 50 floors (the front desk insisted they had no record of our request for connecting rooms) We entered our rooms to find: - missing bathrobes and one wineglass - VERY soiled carpet (see photo) - A very dirty and stinky bathroom that smelled of human stink COVERED with musky perfumevery old folks home - A view of the middle of all surrounding office buildings After spending the night, we delivered our (many) complaints to management (who treated us like we were in 1st grade)... and were, after several hours, able to cancel the remainder of our reservation. We went to the Max Hotel (down a block)...and felt cared about. Basically, the Westin Seattle is conniving and sneaky in the way they represent their hotel. Photos online of the rooms and bathrooms are NOT of the actual, average guest hotel room and/or they have slyly hidden parts of the room in photos (see photos). For a 4 star, it may rank well for business conventionsbut its not luxurious or clean, by any means. Honest.

Despite two advance calls, at check in was told rooms were seven floors apart; Happy Father's Day! Reception was indifferent despite Platinum status. It was 1 am and I had two children but got a shrug and "you could stay elsewhere if you want.". Given it was 130a now, we stayed the night. Rooms are small and old, to match the cold staff I guess. This is a big meeting hotel and maybe impersonal is the mission. If so, they are pros.

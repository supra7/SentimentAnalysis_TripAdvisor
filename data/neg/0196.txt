1st time to Seattle for a delayed anniversary trip so I wanted to stay at some nicer hotels but our room reminded us more of a Holiday Inn level hotel. It was a plain room with a few extra pillows. The bathroom had an ordinary corian sink in an ordinary bathroom. Our room was on a higher floor looking down on the freeway, which was very loud. There is a reason they give earplugs and a sleep CD. We asked to switch rooms and was told they were full and would probably stay that way through our stay which was only for 2 nights since we were staying in another hotel to be in a different area of town. After we put our luggage in our room, we decided to go get something to eat. We stopped at the Concierge and asked what was a good place to walk to and was rudely told to just walk around the area and we would find something. Not sure if he was the Concierge or a doorman just sitting at the desk but we expected some help. We decided that night to call our other hotel and see if we could come in a day earlier, which they happily said that we could. I had used club points for the Crowne rooms so maybe that is why the lousy experience but we opted to leave and go pay for a room in a luxury hotel, Hotel 1000.

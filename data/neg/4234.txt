I generally like the DoubleTree brand, but this particular hotel is not up to their standards. Pros: - Good layout, large rooms, and true suites. It appears to have been an Embassy Suites in the past. - Comfortable and functional furnishings - Modern lobby area - Fast elevators Cons: - The internet service was the worst Ive ever experienced in a hotel. It dropped and reconnected literally every 2 minutes for the hour in the evening and again the next morning that I attempted to use it. I called the 800 support number but no one ever answered. - The heating unit was very noisy. It clunked loudly like an A/C compressor every time it cycled. - Even though I paid for parking when I checked in, my key did not work when exiting or entering the parking garage. The front desk reprogrammed it and then it worked when I left. - The bedside clock was approximately 1 hour off and there was no way to adjust it. There were no radio stations set on the pre-set buttons. - The guest room door closure mechanisms are worn out, allowing the doors to slam loudly when people entered and exited their rooms. - The TV in my bedroom did not receive any channels. (The one in the living room worked fine.) - Soundproofing on the windows is inadequate, allowing highway noise to intrude. - In the morning, I found the doors from the lobby to the parking garage were blocked off with a sign saying go the 2nd level. Since Id already parked on the ground level the night before, this was inconvenient. I have no idea why they did this. - When checking out, I was prepared to share my concerns with the front desk staff, but they never asked me how my stay was. I think the property has the potential to be good, but I wont stay there again until I know theyve made the necessary improvements.

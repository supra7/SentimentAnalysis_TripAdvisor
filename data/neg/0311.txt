Pictures are deceiving. Rooms were small. My son paid extra for a room with a city view and we received a room with a view of the parking garage. Please don't pay extra - its just one way they will screw you out of more money. The room had no a/c, only heat. The room was EXTREMELY stuffy and hot. They did give us a fan which helped just a bit and was told to open the window. Yeah right - couldn't open the window. It was cooler in the hall than the room. I cannot tolerate a warm or hot area. It was difficult to sleep - bed was small and uncomfortable along with having no air circulation. Bathroom was really, really small. Very disappointed. No continental breakfast although there is a coffee shop attached to the hotel. When we checked out, my son expressed his dislike and concerns and the girl on duty said that she would have the manager call my son. My son asked if she had his number and she stated "yes" and we knew she didn't because he booked through Expedia and the person on duty did not ask for a phone number when we checked in, so we knew she was lying. My son asked her what number she had and of course she couldn't say because (A) she really didn't care, (B) she had no plans of telling the manager and (C) She was lying. Customer service was definitely lacking at this location. Although it was in a great area, it lacked EVERYTHING else. Would NOT reccomend this place at all.

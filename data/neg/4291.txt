There are 2 Hiltons in the central Boston area. Last year, we stayed at the Hilton in the Financial District. It was great and only walking distance to Quincy Market etc. No pool though. This year we thought that we would try Back Bay and again opted for a Hilton primarily to experience another area of Boston and to benefit from the indoor pool. Although the staff were very friendly, the hotel was rundown and jaded. Certainly not what we would have expected from Hilton. The cleaning staff also did not have that much attention to detail! As for the pool, it was okay but nothing special. No Hilton Executive Room either which was something that we missed. We did like the Back Bay area though and there were lot's of attractions in that area. We particularly enjoyed walking all the way to Harvard Square and back! We do like staying with the Hilton chain but would not use this one again. The Hilton in the Financial District is a much better option. If you want Back Bay, from our brief observations, The Lenox looked good.

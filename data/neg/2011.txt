a bunch of us were going gambling, so i went to priceline & bid on a 5 star hotel & chose vegas strip as the location... what i got was a hotel that was NOT on the strip, does NOT have a casino, and my priceline savings were negated due to the $18/day surprise fee. based on the resort fee alone (as a principle + the fact that it was not disclosed to me), i will never again stay at trump or use priceline. sean

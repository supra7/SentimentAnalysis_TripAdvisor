The hotel is located in very strategic location and the room was excellent. It has nice bathroom - separate shower & bath up (with jet). They have excellent sauna and Turkish bath. However, I was annoyed by their service, totally. First, they forgot to put towels, it's okay at the beginning - it could happen, I called room service and no one picked up the phone, then I called front office and asked to be assisted and he said he will ask his colleague to bring towels. I waited for almost 45 minutes and no one came to bring my towels while I had a meeting to attend. To cut the towel long story, finally I got them at around 10 pm. It was not a good impression on first day arrival. Secondly, I had to wear swimming hat in this hotel swimming pool and if you didn't have it, then you have to buy it from the hotel (this applied for men as well). Third, mineral water bottle next to the bed is not complimentary and this bottle was not included in their mini bar list. Personally the last one was perhaps my mistake for only viewing their mini bar bill list instead looking at the bottle carefully before drinking it. Last one, the front office staff were unfriendly, no smiles and very slow.

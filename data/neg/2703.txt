we read reviews on this hotel where people had turned up and their reservaton had been double booked or cancelled ,and believed this to be just one of those mistakes that rarely happens, however it happened to us .we initally booked a very cheap room with this hotel to turn up and find out they had cancelled are room without telling us. the staff were extremely rude and arrogant they did find us another room in a different hotel .,the museum hotel which was much better with friendly helpful staff. needlessly to say i would never entertain staying at the robert ramon, be warned dont take reviews as people having the odd random bad experience we made that mistake

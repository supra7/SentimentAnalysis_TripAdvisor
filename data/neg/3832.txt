Met up with some friends at the Sports Bar inside the Boston Copley Marriott Hotel last night. We used to love going to the Marriott when they featured live dance bands, but then some big wig decided they would make more money by having a sports bar which operates all day. True, they probably make more money, but they lost something which is a rare find in Boston: dance music for all ages. That being said, we decided to meet up at the Sports Bar. It was nearly desserted and deadly quiet. I opened the wine menu and saw that the only white wine they had that wasn't horribly oaky was $14.00 per glass. When the waiter brought my wine, he seemed positively embarrassed, probably by the price of the wine. My chicken wings were caked in congealed grease. We won't be going back any time soon.

Stayed at Trump Vegas during Christmas. Hotel doesn't have self parking, so you need to valet ($15 per day). No problem with that. But, you need to wait 45 minutes to get your car back. That is not okay. Not many bell men are available too; need to get my own luggage to my room. So much for a 5-star hotel. The morning we left, there were over 100 people waiting in the lobby to get their cars. So, be careful if you have a flight to catch. Better off park across street (Nordstrom) if you are going in and out. Cant find any onsite management to discuss the issue.

Although the bathroom was clean and the staff at the desk pleasant, our room was filthy. The inside of the bedspread was visibly spoiled and blood stained. It clearly had not been cleaned. The box springs which were visible were equally filthy and stained. I was afraid to look at the mattress. The pillows were barely usable. I left for the airport a couple of hours early just to get out of the place. The floors and elevator had not been cleaned. There is no airport shuttle.

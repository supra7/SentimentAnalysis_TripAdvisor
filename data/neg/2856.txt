I booked this hotel at booking.com, its the cheapest one so expect for the worst, bed bugs, cocroaches crawling, they said breakfast is included but nothing provided, no internet connection, hardest bed you could ever sleep on, no free items such as toothbrush toothpaste shaver bottled water, i dont usually bring my own towel whenever i stay in a hotel because i expect them to provide me but after several request they havent given me any towel, tv is not working, noisy neighborhood, you can hear conversation from the other room and even people on the street, aside from the sound of airplanes passing above almost every minute, location is hard to find, prostitutes in the area, unprofessional staff specially an ugly Indian receptionist... My verdict, never stay in this hotel even if its the last available one in Dubai!

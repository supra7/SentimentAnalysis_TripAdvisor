A screaming baby next door and its loudly arguing parents kept me awake. The room was smokey smelling and the bathroom not very clean. My view was of the heating system in the alley. I had to close the bathroom door to use the toilet. The parking was quite expensive and although the internet site claimed breakfast was included, when I got there the staff said that was wrong.

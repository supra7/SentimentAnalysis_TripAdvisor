We booked two rooms for 4 nights and had to check out early because of my wife's allergies to dogs and the loud trains going by right outside our window. If you stay here make SURE you get a waterside room or you wont get any sleep. Also, I've never seen hotel rooms so small! To give them a little credit, the bathroom was nice but also small.

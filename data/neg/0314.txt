I am a college student, used to living in dorm rooms. I have never heard such intimate details of what people staying next to me were up to as I have at the Executive Hotel Pacific. The couple next to us obviously waited to initiate intimacy until after the six o'clock CBS news, both of which I could hear clearly. The woman next door had such loud yelps and gasps of pleasure I felt like I was in the wrong by just being in my room. By two am I had had enough and when my roommate and I called to the front desk to ask to switch rooms they put us right next to the elevator, which we could also hear extremely clearly every time it was used for the rest of the night. I would have rather stayed in my dorm which had as much free space and also never left me so certain anyone in the next room was "faking it."

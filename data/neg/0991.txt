Nothing special about the rooms, actually very small. They over-charge you for everything, bottle of water $8, room service is a joke, small menu and prices are ridiculous! Went down to guest services for a key to the gym, and I guess since I was not wearing a $400 gym outfit, they did not believe me that I was staying there and had to escort me to my room for an ID to prove it, I was humiliated, and they didn't even apologize. Trust me a go for a Hilton!! Oh yes also they charge $45 a day for parking and $15 for internet.

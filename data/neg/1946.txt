I think this hotel still is working out some kinks!? At least I hope so. I returned to our room after a full day of attending a conference at another hotel to find that the door was propped open and a housekeeping sign on the door- but housekeeping was nowhere to be found and no indication that they had been there any time recently....meaning our door could have been propped open all day. I submitted a formal written complaint, but receive no apology from anyone. On the third day, I returned at 5:00 PM and found that my room hadn't been cleaned. When I called and asked for service ASAP, no one came for an hour. This hotel is clean and nice, but if you are a stickler for service, like me, I wouldn't stay here. The other problem- we stayed on the 57th floor and the noise from the train outside woke us up every night. So, if you choose a high floor, just note that you will not be isolated from the sounds below.

After a 2 night stay I have to state that, while the Inn definitely had an old-time feeling and ambiance, it had too much of that feeling for us. The biggest plus is that the Inn is only 2 blocks from the Seattle Center. The downside is that if you are looking for a typical motel/ hotel environment, this Inn is not for you. A very aged room with steam radiators and a noisy a/c is is sometimes OK, but when I had to go one block to a store to get ice (no ice on the property!), then that was too much. Some folks will love the quirks, but we didn't. The price is certainly agreeable, but we will check out other nearby hotels next time.

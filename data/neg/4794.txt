This hotel looks like a very nice hotel. Look closely and you'll find that the toilets in the rooms are as loud as jet engines. The bathroom wallpaper was hung by a 6 year old and overall the entire staff as been conditioned to be uncaring and indifferent. While there, we had our room charges screwed up and charged to another room. We had TERRIBLE service at their Sports Bar "Draft". I won't expand upon this because my disappointment deserves its own space!!! To print boarding passes in their "Sheraton Link" is tedious and time consuming. The best advice I can give for this hotel is stay only if it is a screaming deal. If this hotel is NOT at least $20/night cheaper than you next choice, TAKE YOUR NEXT CHOICE!!!!

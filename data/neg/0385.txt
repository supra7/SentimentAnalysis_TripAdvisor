My husband and I stayed at this hate for the weekend of 4th - 7th Feb 2005. I booked the hotel some time ago, before some of the negative comments so upon re-checking the website before I set off I was a little apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived late and were greeted by a rather unfriendly bellboy, not the end of the world but certainly a long way of a warm welcome. Our room was fine, wed been upgraded to a king and it was fairly comfortable. In the morning however I noticed that the bathroom hadnt really been cleaned all that well. I would stay the standard of cleanliness was debatable, not too bad though if youre not fussy. Having been out and about all day my husband and I returned ot the room around 4pm, and it was a cold inside as it was outside. I check with reception nd they said that they have to turn the heating off during the day to prevent the system from overheating! What! Heating came back on at 8pm. Another point to note was that the walls are very very thin. Our neighbours were watching Bridgett Jones; we managed to hear every word, given that Id seen the film before I wasnt so excited about hearing it again at 11pm. On a positive the location was great. The hotel cost $89 a night (booked directly  no breakfast) although I did notice Expedia had rooms going for $79 a night. We didnt spend an awful lot of time in the hotel, I do think you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.

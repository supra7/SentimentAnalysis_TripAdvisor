This hotel has "Mitte" in its title... It's an absolute lie! It's nowhere near the Mitte area. It takes a good half hour plus a 15 minute walk from the S-Bahn, so once you're out for the day, you have to stay out i..e. no popping pack to freshen up. The room was dowdy, with the bed oddly placed and the mini-bar had been removed, so there was a smelly old disused fridge under the tv. The church bells next door ring for 15 minutes every morning at 8am; not good after a night out in Berlin. 15 was asked for breakfast - we didn't bother, and just spent as much time in the city as possible. Love Berlin, won't be back to this place.

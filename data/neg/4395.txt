I stayed in the hotel with my friends for my birthday. We were five girls who put in the extra effort to make sure we didn't stand out but because we were young almost all the employees were rude and unwelcoming to us. We were waiting in the Oak Room Bar for 20 minutes while the servers and managers looked us over and checked and rechecked our legal id's. They took so long that we took it upon ourselves to take our business elsewhere.Reception wasn't very helpful either, they made us seem like a burden to them. In fact, the only polite people in the hotel were the doormen, valet, and the maintenance man who fixed our broken shower. Over all the hotel is beautiful and the rooms were well kept but the lack of hospitality of the staff is a real turn off especially if you are paying that much for a room. I will never return to that hotel.

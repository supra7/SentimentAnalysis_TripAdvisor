This place was a nightmare. A summary list of the problems: - They confirmed a taxi from the airport when my girlfriend arrived at midnight - it didnt turn up; - The hotel room was extremely small and completely overpriced - not worth anywhere near the money they charged - Worse still, we ordered a bed for an extra person in the room - it wasn't provided and then charged us an extra 50% at 1am in the morning when we returned from the restaurant - this extra "50%" was a number that they made up and no doubt went into the pocket of the night receptionist - Throughout this the staff were INCREDIBLY RUDE and we often felt physically threatened! - The cooling system in the room didn't work and we woke up throughout the night because of the heat - The staff didn't clean the room properly .... oh, and the breakfast was awful! All I can say is that if you have any other option in Istanbul (including hostels), suggest you take it!

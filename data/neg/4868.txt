HORRIBLE Manager. I visited this hotel for the Daytona 500 last year and the manager as well as the staff of the hotel were awful. This manager was a dark haired hispanic guy. He sent a security guard into the gym and they escorted me out saying that I was not a guest. When I pulled out my guest card and showed them, they took me into an interrogation room still accusing me of not being a guest. They verified my drivers licence and that I really was a guest and the guy didn't even apologise. When it was time to go to sleep I pulled the shower curtain to find black hair all over the bath tub. It's just gross for the price you pay not to mention the the breakfast is 20 dollars a person.... Head my warning. This place looks like a million bucks, but don't be fooled by appearances.... This place is a dump.

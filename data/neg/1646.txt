The grounds were great, but we suffered some really bad discrimination, plus they defrauded me with false advertising. Here is what happened. I stayed at the hotel for 10 nights last April. (At 700 per night) I was in Lahaina at night and came back around midnight thirty. I checked the close self park and it was full, so I tried to Valet the car, which they advertise. I pulled up, and the Valet told me he didn't feel like valeting hotel guests, only ones going to the nightclub in the hotel. He made us drive to the far end of the grounds and I was forced to walk 15 acres back to my room at 1:00AM. No big deal right? Well I am disabled and it was VERY challenging. I had to cross a bridge that had no handrails and my legs gave out. I fell off the bridge and into the duck pond. My knees are stilled messed up a year later. I attached a picture of the bridge because I still might sue. When I complained the next morning, the only thing thing the lobby was willing to do was to give me FREE VALET!. Can you believe it. BTW I am not cheap. I spent over easyly $1500 on food at the hotel, plus my normal room charge. The whole trip was nearly $10,000 and was ruined because this happened the first night I was there. So unless you don't mind being discriminated against, lied to, and having people violate the Disabliaty Act, go head and stay so you can see the penguins.

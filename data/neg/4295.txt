Hotel had no AC. It was in the 80's on Saturday. Front desk staff informed us to open our windows that the hotel had no AC. Also bed linens were stained and the toilet ran all night. Front desk staff very unhelpful. This hotel does not represent the Hilton chain very well. The Sheraton across the street is a much better hotel.

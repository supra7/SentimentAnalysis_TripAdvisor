This hotel has a lot going for it: pleasant and professional staff, nice decor, comfortable bedding, great location, stunning views from some rooms. Nonetheless, for my needs, I cannot stay here. The biggest problem for me was that internet access in the room is an extremely weak wi-fi. At this hotel, the internet access seems to work at first, then it slows down, then it dies, then works, then dies.... ARGH!!!!!! I spent a long time on the phone with their tech support, to no avail. The hotel staff were honest with me: "lot's of customers complain about our internet access". Any business class or high level tourist hotel MUST offer a reliable fast internet. Internet is integral part of life. I also experienced other problems at this hotel, such as VERY slow elevators. The elevator capacity appears to be inadequate for the size of the hotel. Also, staff are sometimes missing in action (such as a busy bar scene with no bartender, no staff at all for an extended period.). Finally, the only parking available is via valet, which can be ok, but their valet brought me the wrong car (how does one mistake a Honda Accord for a Ford Escape?). Ultimately, this hotel has great potential, but suffers from many highly irritating, easily fixable problems (other than slow elevators, which are indeed highly irritating but may prove hard to fix).

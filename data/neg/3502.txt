Stayed Fri,and Sat. after Thanksgiving. This was our third or fourth visit to the Magnolia. We have always been impressed by the fact that front desk remembered us from previous visits. The woman at the front desk this time was having trouble remembering what year it was. She asked us if it was our first visit and if we would like a higher or lower floor. We had already expressed our preferences when we made our reservations. Our room was small,on the 23rd floor. It was right by the elevators,which proved to be a major problem. It was so loud,I kept dreaming I was at a train station all night. So,the major problem happened at the breakfast buffet on Saturday morning. There was no food! All these people are standing around the steam tables holding their plates. The restaurant was filthy,not a clean table anywhere. I called the desk from my cell told the same front desk woman there was a major problem in the restaurant and I needed to speak to the manager. She said the manager was at the restaurant and would call me back. The staff kept saying food was coming,but it showed one thing at a time,eggs showed,then potatoes,etc. These small dishes were shared by the 50 or so people waiting. If the manger was there,why was she not apologizing for this horrible breakfast? I was contacted by the manager who told me they were undergoing renovations and had no kitchen. They had to make breakfast in a room. They should have just cancelled it. I had to be somewhere and it was really frustrating. The manager acted like I was an [--] or something for demanding something I had paid for,like THEY were the ones inconvinienced. She sent some drink tickets to the room for the FREE happy hour. I used to really like this hotel,I was very disappointed this visit and may not go back.

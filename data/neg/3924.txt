1. The location can't be beat. 2. The rooms are miniature, not even a space to put down your suitcase... and I was in the extra cost towers. 3. Must not have any international clientele, breakfast opens at 6:30 and NO COFFEE before that. 4. What makes the towers worth the extra cost? I can't imagine. 5. $12.50 a day for internet... ONE DEVICE ONLY, you have a smart phone pony-up another $12.50 6. Did I say the room is miniature yet? Others hotels have bathrooms as big. When asked the union concierge said I was upgraded, I can't imagine the other rooms. If I came back I would book the cheapest room available, I bet it would be the same thing as the 'special' tower room. Very disappointed.

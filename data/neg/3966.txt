Great location and a lovely facade. What a shame that the staff are so ignorant, to the point of rudeness with the concierge staff. Held door open for business men/women in front of us but then pointedly let it shut on us. We weren't in suits and skirts so I guess that made us not worthy! Totally unhelpful with advice on running routes near to the hotel and the availability of hotel services and amenities. Reception staff made a point of ignoring us standing at the desk to the point where we had to wave one of them down by reaching across the desk. The cleaners were the only staff who spoke to us during our 3 day stay here. Would not go back if you paid us!

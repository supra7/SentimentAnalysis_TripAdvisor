The HIlton Back Bay has elevator problems. Not just broken elevators and there were two of those during our stay that significantly lenghthened lobby wait times, but noisy elevators. Our room was located behind the elevator bank and across the hall from the elevator and at night and in the morning we could hear the elevators going up and down. This is a real impediment a to good night's sleep. There isn't much soundproofing between rooms either, as it sounded as if our neighbor was showering in our room. On the plus side, the rooms are pleasantly decorated and the hotel is conveniently located to the Prudential Center mall. Although there is no concierge, the Front Desk did make us a restaurant reservation and the bell staff was helpful.

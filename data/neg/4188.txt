We decided to stay here despite the negative reviews because the hotel sounded quirky and different and was in an excellent location. The hotel definitely needs some work. The floor we were on as well as our room smelled strongly of old cigarette smoke. We tried to air out our room by propping the window open with a phonebook (they don't stay open on thier own even though they are supposed to). I think the smell came from the ancient stained rug in our room and no amount of airing out would get rid of the smell. The rooms are furnished exactly as you see them on the website, but they do look a bit more shabby in person. The bedding was new and clean. The bathroom was really small and cramped. The floor tiles were cracked, but they are likely original to the hotel and worth preserving. The toilet was cracked and the sink was ancient. There is no counter space, just a skinny shelf above the toilet. The bath amenities were good quality, but they only left us one very small bar of soap (and an empty wrapper in the tub). The air conditioning was loud, but it worked. They have a cool interactive entertainment system connected to the TV which included internet access. The doors to the rooms are really interesting. They weigh a ton and look like cabin doors you would find on a cruise ship. This hotel must have been really fantastic in its day. You can read about everything it used to offer. Its very sad that the hotel hasn't been kept up.

We recently stayed at this hotel as part of a Travel Package thru Victoria Clipper - Service to Seattle. It seemed to be in need of renovation...very dirty carpet.....mold in the bathroom...paint job needed to be done. Granted it was the lowest priced option for this package.... we just expected a little better quality.

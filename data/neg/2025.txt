I've just returned from Trump Int'l Las Vegas, and it's been THE worst experience of my life!!! First off, they lied to me at every turn when I reserved the two rooms--told me ANYTHING to get me to spend my money. When I got there, EVERYTHING was a lie. They added a $15-per-day fee to each room (resort fee) without telling me upfront. The hotel is located in an industrial area right next to train tracks...and TRAINS blow their ghastly horns all night every night--like HOURLY--sometimes four or five blasts at a time. Trump manager reluctantly moved us to the 42nd floor, and it was just as bad up there. There is no soundproofing in the hotel. The maid service is dreadful, and the bathrooms had bugs in them. One potty seat was broken, and I had to tip a maid to bring TP--it's SUPPOSED to be there already! The bed was so hard that I ended up sleeping on the couch an hour at a time in between train blasts!!! The facility itself looks posh, but it ends there. I was told to arrive early and they'd upgrade us to a Strip view room. Folks, there is NO strip view from the Trump Int'l except for maybe Circus Circus and one other crappy hotel down at that end of the strip. Trump is a couple blocks away from the strip so it's virtually impossible to see the lights of the Strip that everyone wants. A view of Circus Circus will cost you $50 additional. That's it. More lies from them. They sent me pictures of the rooms we'd have (two of them) and when we got there we were put in other rooms--nowhere close to the pictures they sent. When I called it to their attention, they said, "Oh that's a mistake but we'll 'upgrade' you for an additional $100/day." Isn't that called 'false advertising?" I could go on for days bashing them, but I just walked in the door back at home and it's 2:AM...the first thing I did was to come and tell all of you--business, condo buyers--EVERYONE!!! Do NOT get roped into the TRUMP INTERNATIONAL LAS VEGAS SCAM!!! IT IS NO BARGAIN!!!

Upon arrival we tried to cool the room down with the in room air conditioning but was informed it was centrally operated and was on "heat" mode only. We had no only choice but to leave this hotel and attempt to find lodging elsewhere. I was informed we would NOT be charged for our stay (we were only there a few hours) - after arguing with the desk clerk, the manager overheard us and said "we will not charge you" It has been a week and it appears I will need to call and get the credit card charge reversed (we WERE charged!). I would not stay here again.

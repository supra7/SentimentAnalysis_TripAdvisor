Stayed at the Vintage during New Years weekend. After checking in, we were advised that we were unable to use the lounge or the restaurant as it was New Years Day??? One of the 2 elevators did not work for our entire stay and when I questioned Kipton Hotels why were not recieving credit for our stay on their loyalty program we were told it was because we were paying too low of a rate. What kind of a loyalty program is that?? They have now managed too turn it in to a disloyalty program and as a season ticket holder to the Seahawks, we will now not be spending 8 weekends per year at a Kimpton Hotel!!!

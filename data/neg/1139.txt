We stayed here for 1 night in August since we had an early flight the next morning. Check in was easy and the cookies were nice. Having the printer in the lobby to print your boarding pass was really convenient. The elevators for the tower are not close. We wanted to carry our own luggage and got tired of the bell hops asking if they could take it for us. They were not too thrilled when we wanted to borrow their cart. t was a very long walk to get to the room. The room itself was nice but not for $200.00 per night. The inner hall was quiet but there was a lot of traffic noise from the outside. The bed was comfortable but between the noise of the traffic ( not the jets) and the room fan, we did not sleep well. There was mildew in the bathroom-cleanliness was fair. The shuttle to the airport was very nice and had bottled water. We would not stay here again because of the noise and mildew.

I stayed here for 2 nights and the room and bathroom were clean but even earplugs couldn't drown the noise out of the doors to other rooms being slammed at all hours, plus the couple in the room next to me having a domestic dispute for hours and slamming things around! Air conditioners also very noisy, had to cool the room down first and then turn it off just to try and get some sleep. Breakfast is also pretty ordinary. Toast, pastries, cereal, waffles, sausages or boiled eggs. You get what you pay for I guess.

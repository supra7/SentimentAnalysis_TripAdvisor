I came to the Sheraton Dallas for an academic conference. I was full of anticipation for an excellent week, but then the Sheraton Dallas ruined my life. Instead of checking into a hotel room when I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a horde of anime-loving creeps roaming the hotel. I was verbally harassed by the comic book freaks and ignored by the hotel staff. I tried to check in at 11, but my rooms were not ready. I am reasonable so I was willing to wait a little bit for a clean room. It is now almost 6 p.m. and I still do not have a room. Sheraton Dallas is the worst hotel in the world. They have the worst staff, they book conferences they clearly cannot accommodate, and frankly nothing goes right here. If I could choose between this hotel and the firey pits of hell, I would choose the devil lair over this cesspool. I hate this place.

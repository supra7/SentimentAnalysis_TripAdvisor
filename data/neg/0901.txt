I reserved 2 rooms for my parents and relatives first time visit to Seattle. I was very excited to show them a good time. I noticed the Travel Lodge next to the University Village and thought it might be a great idea for them to stay there since they can go and shop across the street. So convenient, I thought! I read some of the reviews on this site but I made the mistake of not taking it more seriously. I had the same experience with some of the other reviewers. The room wasn't ready for check in until 4 in the afternoon. When we enter the room it stunk badly. The exterior had a fresh coat of paint but it didn't hide the decaying interior. The beds were dirty and the pillows stunk of oily dirty hair. The lights on the bed side table were out. They didn't refill the tissue paper in the bathroom. Worst of all we found that they didn't even clean the room. Just made the bed and that's it! Can't believe they are charging people for staying in this dump!

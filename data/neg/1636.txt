We arrived at our hotel and thought the grounds were beautiful, very very nice. However when we finally reached our room, it was not much different than a Holiday Inn, or Best Western, just a simple room with a couple of beds and a table and a couple of chairs, no flat screen just archaic crt, ?? what are we paying for. I booked a deluxe ocean view with a separate sitting area, was told the separate sitting area was the table and chairs in the room. The free breakfast buffet is very nice, but if you are looking for nice accomodations in your room, look elsewhere, or sleep in the lobby.

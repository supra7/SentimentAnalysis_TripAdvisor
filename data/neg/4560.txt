Yes, the lobby is beautiful. A grand old hotel. Location and Lobby are the best things about this hotel. Service was good, except one rude bellman. The peeling wallpaper in the room was a bit concerning, but in retrospect it should have been a warning sign. What absolutly ruined my stay was the COCKROACH in the ladies bathroom on the meeting rooms floor (3rd floor). It was a biggie - several women were snapping photos of the astonishly large creature. I was lucky enough to witness this right before our business meeting lunch. I skipped lunch, and cancelled my plans for a quick dinner at the hotel lobby bar. To top things off, the towel in my room the next morning was dirty. Not stained, but dirty like stuff sticking to it. Very disgusting. BTW, when I complained the desk clerk seemed more surprised by the dirty towel than the cockroach. Such a disappointing stay, I will not return.

We choose to stay at the Dana Hotel because of its fantastic location and my wife wanted to try their spa. First, the Spa was average to slightly above average, however pricing was higher than average. Very friendly staff, however they did not have the appropriate equipment (for example, massage for my wife was pre natal, however they did not have a pre natal table, no massage chair for pedi, etc.) If you are expecting a Canyon Ranch experience, keep looking. Second, the hotel room was OK. Nice furniture (comfortable couch and desk), and good amenities (nice bedding, reasonable wine and snacks). Housekeeping left a lot to be desired (dried toothpaste on vanity top, green mystery substance on mirror, and hair on floor and walls in bathroom). Also, you can hear every step (or other... "movements") your upstairs neighbor takes. A major point of annoyance was the fact that housekeeping came at 9:05 am on the day we were checking out. We were not even awake yet! After almost falling back to sleep, there was another knock at the door, this time to restock the mini bar. Check out time is at noon! We just wanted to sleep in a bit, but it seems that the hotel staff had no intention of granting us this guilty pleasure. With so many other outstanding hotels in Chicago at this price point, we probably would not make Dana our choice again.

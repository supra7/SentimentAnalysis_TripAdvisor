Booked this hotel based on price and proximity to the American Airlines Arena (about 5 miles). Booked a double non-smoking room through Lastminutetraveler. Was told when I showed up that all double non-smoking rooms were taken and would have to take a single or a smoking room. Took the smoking room due to no other options. Stayed 4 days and never had any staff clean, make beds, or bring fresh towels.. Terrible customer service, stay away!!!

Having stayed in other Doubletree Hotels and been really impressed, I was disappointed in this location. I stayed in the "5th Wing" which is an annex building set apart from the main hotel towers. The room was old, smelled old, and was even kind-of dirty. I thought the room service choices and quality were REALLY bad - especially for the crazy-high prices. Plus, and I do realize this may seem minor to some, but none of the pictured items on the menu were actually ON THE MENU. So, there I was looking at a lovely dish that I wanted to try, and it wasn't available. Why bother? Anyway, staff seemed friendly and helpful, the hotel was quiet, and generally the stay was ok. Still, I felt like I was at an older Best Western with the 80's decor/linens, but I was paying A LOT more for this room. I recommend staying at one of the Best Westerns that are located very close to this Doubletree Hotel and save yourself some money.

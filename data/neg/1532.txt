I have stayed in many Hilton Hotels around the world, and I must say this one was very disappointing. The location is nice, next to the convention center. The rooms are to a moderate extent clean. Garbage is not properly removed, for instance the empty shampoo bottles and the cardboard box the bath soap came in was not disposed of during my entire stay of 6 days. The ironing board I used was never put away, the bed linens were not changed during the entire stay and the Towels are as rough as sand paper. I ordered Room Service after a long day at meetings and it was disgusting. The seafood in the pasta was raw and the service itself was quite deficient. The Restaurant is not much better, We ordered a soup containing pomegranate only to find the ingredient was omitted. Careless. Saturday night, sitting in the Lobby with some Business acquaintances was like sitting in the middle of the local "red zone", quite embarrassing. Scores of young women scantly dressed and staggering down the hallway in a drunken stupor. This Hotel lacks standards.

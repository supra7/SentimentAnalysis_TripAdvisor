I saw Hotel Max listed as one of Travelzoo's Top 10 deals, so I went ahead and tried it. It was a mistake. The special said they would upgrade the room to a King if they were available, but of course they weren't. I have stayed at many downtown Seattle hotels and this has been the worst experience yet. My biggest complaint is the size of the rooms, bathrooms and elevator. These are New York size hotel rooms at New York prices, but this is Seattle. You can get a much better value in any of the nearby hotels, Sheraton, Westin, W, Andre, etc. The artwork certainly does not make up for feeling like you're in a closet. The bathroom shower is so small, I could barely pick up my soap when I dropped it, and I am not a big person. Of the two elevators (each can hold only 3-4 people with no luggage), one was out of service. So everyone was walking down 7,8,9+flights of stairs, only to realize that you still have to get on the elevator at the 2nd floor to get to the lobby. There was quite a line-up on this floor.

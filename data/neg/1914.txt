Don't stay in this hotel on a Friday or a Saturday night as the noise from the restaurant next door is unbearable and goes on until after 2am When you complain the hotel say there is nothing they can do about it although on investigation I discovered the restaurant is actually leased from the hotel! This is a 4* Hotel in name only. The rooms are small and badly designed. The sink in the basin in my room did not fit so I was unable to fill the basin with hot water.Once again when I complained nothing was dome about it. There are no lights over or near the bed so I was unable to read properly. I couldn't get the air conditioning system to work and the bed itself was unbelievably uncomfortable. The breakfast was poor and I was actually physically ill one morning from eating the fruit salad. If you are late down there is little choice and the quality of the bread on offer is dire beyond belief. Do not use the mini bar (rip off) or buy water from the hotel (9 for a 1.5l bottle). They even charge for the tea/coffee making ingredients in the room for you to make your own hot drinks. There is a supermarket right next door to the hotel where you can get everything you need. The junior staff are clearly embarrassed by the hotel and help out where they can but the management couldnt really care less and is only interested in extracting as much money as they can from the guests. This place is the pits - if you have booked then cancel if you havn't then avoid this place and stay somewhere else

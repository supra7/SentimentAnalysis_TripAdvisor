Booked a reservation through a Vegas package website and ended up at the El Cortez. My wife reacts to smoke so we called the Vegas website to make sure we got a no-smoking room and we had selected that non-smoking option on the reservation booking. It was also printed non-smoking room on our confirmation so we thought no problem. Upon arriving at El Cortez hotel for check-in we found the non-smoking request is only a 'request' and ALL their rooms were smoking!!! Appartently you can pay (much) more for the deluxe rooms/suites which are more smoke-free but everything else is smoking. The hotel service was terrible and we ended up cancelling the room and finding another hotel on our own which was far superior and cheaper. Everything was dirty and yellowish brown from all the smoke throughout the hotel and casino area. I would NEVER return to this hotel. They appeared sneaky in trapping you into booking and then hoping you have no choice upon arrival. That was my impression at front desk too, they had clearly been through this before. I don't mind hotels only offering smoking rooms (probably better business for them) but IMO if you request non-smoking room and they can't accomidate they should not book the reservation!! Appartently the hotel allows/advertises on the various websites to book reservations under 'non-smoking' even when they don't have the rooms and then tell you it is only a request not binding!!! Ridiculous and sneaky, it means they are hungry for business and I don't think such practice should be rewarded.

Divas get away turned into a nightmare!!! We were under the impression that our two (2) Queen Suites would be adjoining. Once we arrived, we were very unhappy to find out they were not and we were not pleased to be initially placed two doors away from one another. Then imagine our surprise when we entered the rooms, (not at all what we pictured for a Suite) expecting more square footage and WE got less! All four rooms (kitchen, sitting area, bedroom and bathroom) were extremely tiny. Not spacious at all!! Very, very disappointing. During the course of our five (5) day stay, my girlfriends and I were relocated to different rooms four (4) times due to cleanliness, broken sofa beds and HUGE bugs in the room!! This caused a great deal of stress to us considering we had to keep repacking and then unpacking. We NEVER felt settled. Pass on this hotel!

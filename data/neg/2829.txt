We were too tired upon arrival to closely inspect our room, but in the morning we found trash left in the refrigerator as well as empty fast food containers including pizza boxes in cupboards. Found more trash in the dresser drawers. The floor did not appear to be vacuumed at all. The overall appearance of the public areas of this property should be a warning sign to anyone. No maintenance, no housekeeping. I did not receive a copy of my bill on check out. I was emailed a PDF of it, and discovered that I had been charged for the safe which we did not use. I expect that the safe is also full of trash.

Hi, folks! Let me make it clear straight away that I never give bad reviews to any place, person or thing, but when I booked to stay at this place, I was expecting true Olde Worlde charm, courtesy and service, as that is how they advertise themselves. But what did I get? I arrived at the hotel after an 11 hour flight plus another 45 minutes from Seatac airport to get here, and they kept me waiting for what seemed like an eternity! Eventually, they found my internet reservation and marched me off to my room on the 3rd floor (no lift) and no help whatsoever. Anyway, the room was so small, you couldn't swing a mouse in it, let alone a cat! The A/C unit did not work and the whole room was just so claustrophobic, I just couln't get oout of there fast enough! In the morning, the fun and games started--I got into the bathroom for a shower, and guess what--no hot water! And the bath tub and taps--they must have bought them in some garage sale during the 1940s--they were so rusty and horrible--yuck! Anyway, downstairs for a bit of coffee and their "continental" breakfast--this turned out to be cheao supermarket bagels and commercial coffee made in an ancient percolater! My advice--DO NOT STAY THERE--at least until they kick out all their Staff and bring new guys in with some courtesy and revamp the whole building!

I read the reviews and decided to take my chances at this property. Upon pulling up, I thought, this doesn't look that bad as the outside painting and lighting was somewhat modern looking. I checked in around 11pm-midnight and the evening clerk was friendly and helpful. I walked down the hall and it doesn't smell the freshest. Head upstairs, there's a door held open by a washcloth as it was for the 3 evenings I was there. My room was just okay. I tried not to look too closely. So, here's what I think. I needed a place near Children's Hospital, this property was about half the price of others within this vicinity. I was at the hospital all day and came back tired and would crash from about midnight until 5-6am and then back to the hospital. For the amount I saved over other properties, and the amt. of time I was actually in the hotel, it worked. Or, if I was partying with old college buddies and we had too many adult beverages I'd be okay. But, I would not bring my wife here in its existing state, I would not bring my kids here in it's existing state. I hope the remodel makes the difference for them. It is a very convenient location. Across the street from University Village. In fact, I ran from the hospital to grab lunch for us and a benefit was I was able to park in the Travelodge parking lot to run in and get lunch across the street. There was no room in the University Village parking lot and parking was crazy due to a UW bball game. I filled out a review that they sent to me and I was impressed with the quick response from their team. So, i hope they get it cleaned up.

I stayed at this hotel for two nights earlier this month. I've stayed at a number of Renaissance hotels in the States and in Europe and been very happy. I read the reviews here and was surprised to find a mixed report, but felt it was worth the risk - after all, I was trying to use all my remaining Marriott points for a free stay, and it's a category 5 hotel...how bad could it be? Well, was I shocked. The room was straight out of the 70s (or earlier). Worn carpet, worn furniture, ancient bathroom. It was satisfactory, and I was in no mood to move to a different hotel, but I thought about it. Then, I tried to use the Internet. Sorry, all, that just sucks at this hotel. I had to do several hours of work online and transfer a few files around. It was slower than an old fashioned modem (remember those?). I spent an hour on the phone with their Internet dept, and they kept claiming people at the hotel were sharing files which was overloading the network - they did make it slightly better. It took all night for the files to transfer at this hotel. For comparison, I had to do the same work a few days earlier from a Westin in Canada and was done in under an hour. Totally unacceptable. I should have tried my luck with the wireless from a neighboring hotel instead... There's absolutely no way I could be convinced to return to this hotel.

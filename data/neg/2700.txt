Stayed at RobertRamon for three days in September 2010. The hotel was located near a few popular museums and within walking distance to a few restaurants...but the price and overall hotel experience is not worth this location. Amsterdam is a small city and you can walk to everything easily (or take public transportation). The hotel is not very sound proof - I could hear trams running, cars driving on the street, and people talking on the street all night long. I could also hear other people in other hotel rooms talking and walking around their room. On my first day at the hotel, I was waiting to talk with the receptionist while he was helping another person. Thee receptionist created a hotel card key for my room for this person. I only caught this because I was standing at the reception desk and the receptionist said here is a key for room 312 as the people were walking, I pointed out to the receptionist that room 312 was my room...the receptionist called back the people and made them a different key. Not sure what would have happened if I would not have been standing at the reception desk. I would not stay in the hotel again.

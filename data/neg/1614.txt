Check in was slow waiting 10 minutes. Lobby was an open concept with live penguins and parrots. The pool area was crowded with kids and large groups which is expected based on the property size. Room was nice with oceanfront view; room was very tight for four with outdated and worn furniture. Water pressure was an adventure losing pressure to zero then full on for no apparent reason. We attempted to stage our showers in the afternoon did not make a difference. Food service was fair, although nothing compared to mainland Hyatt properties. We stayed at the Marriott Wailea and Sheraton Kannapali Beach prior to and after this stay considered superior.

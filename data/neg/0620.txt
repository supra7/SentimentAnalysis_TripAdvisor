This "small luxury" property is located close to good restaurants including Long's Vietnamese and Serious Pie. The rooms are modern and eight foot mirrors in the king suite make for interesting conversation - the upgrade from superior queen is worth it. Despite the aesthetics, our upgrade and checkout staff were incredible rude which was unfortunate given our stay was for Valentines. For example, after getting a cold checkout my partner and I waiting outside for a valet to get our car key which was already parked up front. After five minutes of waiting in the cold, I returned to the desk and asked the clerk to call the valet - attitude, no apology for inconvenience and to add further insult to injury she hadn't called herself despite seeing us waiting. The valet was equally rude and handed me my keys with a "here" - no thank you, no do you need directions, no look forward to seeing you again. I'd take staff friendliness over fancy toiletries any day. Chose another.

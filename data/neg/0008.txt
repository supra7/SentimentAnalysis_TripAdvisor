Stayed in the hotel for two nights for business recently. Whilst the hotel is of a reasonable standard the front desk staff leave alot to be desired. I asked them for a power adapter and after 15 minutes of waiting they returned and said they would contact me. I returned to my room to then wait 30 minutes without being contacted. On returning to the front desk, they said they couldn't find one - but there was no apology for not contacting me to let me know this fact. They then said that engineering would be in in 15 minutes and they would then possibly be able to find one and let me know. After waiting a further 40 minutes from the scheduled time that engineering would turn up, there was still no answer. I returned to the front desk to be told off handedly that engineering didn't have one. Once again, no apology for the delay or lack of information. THe general seevice from the desk staff was uncaring and lacked professionalism. Conversely the porters were very helpfulTHere is no room service and it is impossible to get coffee before they present it in the lobby in the early hours of the morning. Sadly I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and found it the worst during my three week trip around the US.

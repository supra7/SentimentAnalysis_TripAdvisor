I am currently staying here, july 31 08, I made a BIG mistake and booked a 10 day stay. The first two nights i stayed in the older section in which the doors open to the outside. This is noise central, or cell block 5. The first night and second night both I was kept awake by fighting etc in the hall and security had to come. I was moved to the tower (as a free upgrade) my third night and the people next door were in and out all night. (Drunk and LOUD and more) who knows. You can hear every noise from 4four doors down, the doors slamming, loud drunk people coming in all hours of the night. In contacting the front desk when there is a problem they are NOT CONCERNED, They pass you on to security and security passes you back to the front desk. DO NOT STAY HERE. In vegas look around, there are so many places that are nice and quiet. THIS IS NOT IT. Stay here if you want a noisy environment, and if you like thinking you are in a old folks home for the homeless. it is digusting and stinks. good luck

We thought we were getting a really good deal on hotwire so we were really excited UNITL we checked in. We were forced to pay 16 dollars (actually over 17 after tax) a night just to park! You have to pay the parking because they basically lock you in the parking lot where you must use your key to get out. Then you had to PAY for internet per night! OMG this is a three star and they act like they are on such a budget they must charge for EVRYTHING! We asked for a bottle of shampoo and the housekeeper had to verfy when we were checking out before she would give us a tiny bottle of shampoo! We needed a cart to bring our luggage in and they threw a fit!!! They did not want us to take a cart even though our room was at least a mile from the lobby! This is a HUGE hotel and I feel because we booked on Hotwire they stuck us in the crappy and far point of the hotel. I would NOT stay here again UNLESS I wanted to throw my hard earned money away like I just had to do! The only good think about this place was the free cookie they give you when you check in....however with what I paid extra I could have bought a whole tin of cookies!

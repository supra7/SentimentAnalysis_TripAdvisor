The only great thing about the hotel is the location. It is close to Chinatown, the Theater District, Boston Common and Quincy Market. However, the staff was not very accommodating, parking cost us a fortune ($35 for an overnight spot in the public lot next to the hotel - the other choice was $43 for the hotel valet), and the hotel lobby and guest rooms definitely need to be updated. All in all, this hotel definitely does not deserve its four stars... I'd only recommend it if you can get a really great rate and/or you only care about the location.

This hotel has a reasonable price, very helpful staff, a convenient location, and good shuttle service to the airport. The bath room area was very clean. However, the hallways and room furnishings were old and dingy looking, and the mattress was exceptionally old and lumpy. Our room had the carpet baseboard strips falling off the wall and was very musty.

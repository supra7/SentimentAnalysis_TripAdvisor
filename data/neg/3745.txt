The hotel acts like it's newly renovated. As in the outside is a different color and the bathrooms are new. The inside is HORRIBLY outdated. The check in process took so long & it felt like a hassle to the staff. They doublebooked our room & we were moved to a different one. The wiring is hanging on the walls & our air conditioner has the tubing/pipe hanging out. It also didn't work at all. And when we turned it on our room actually got hotter. They replaced it with an identical unit but the tubing kept breaking. The tv is one from like 1980's. The door didn't seem that secure. You can just tell this is a place that doesn't care at all.

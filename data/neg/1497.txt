My husband and I were told about this resort by a travel agent. We were on our honeymoon and stayed here for a week. We used the safe in the room to put away valuables-cash, passports, jewelry.... Our last night there, as we were packing, we realized we were missing a ring from the safe. The ring that was stolen was my fake engagement ring. I didn't wear my real ring just to be safe-thankfully. We quickly realized that all the cash in my husbands wallet was gone as well. He had a few hundred in USD and pesos in it. We ALWAYS kept the safe locked. We kept the key hidden in the room. We immediately went down to the front desk to report the theft and were met with indifference. The person at the front desk called "security." They told us the only key to the safe was the one we had. Unlikely, but the thief could have looked through our room for the key anyway and used it. They had us write down what happened and said they would look into it, but that there was really no way of finding out who could have done it. All the employees on the grounds (housekeepers, pool cleaners...) have a key that gets them into any room on the resort. We will NEVER return to a resort that would employ a thief that has the gall to rummage through a room and steal (what they thought was) a wedding ring. Aside from the theft: When we arrived, the water in the pool in our room was brown when we got there. We were told it would be cleaned immediately. It took them 3 full days and 2 more calls to finally clean it, so our pool was unusable for almost half of our stay. Food was good-not gourmet-but good. Get a room on the third or forth floor if you want an ocean view. Otherwise, you'll see trees only. Our room had a great view-room 342. The rooms are spacious and the outdoor shower is nice. Overall, not worth the money they charge. If you go here, don't use the safe.

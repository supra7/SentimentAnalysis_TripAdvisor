I have stayed at the Palmer House four times in the last 12 months, and I just couldn't take it any more. I am a Gold Hilton HHonors member, so I'm not anti-Hilton, but this is hands-down their worst hotel in my opinion. It has the ambiance of a bus depot. The staff is indifferent at their best, rude at their worst. Simple requests are a burden to them. For example, while checking in at the HHonors desk, I asked to be put in an outside room, because wireless reception in the hotel is terrible, and if you want to use your cell phone or broadband card, you have to be facing the street. The clerk said I would love the room. When I opened the door, it was an inside room, exactly what I didn't want. I called and asked to be moved, and was told I'd have to speak to a manager. When I explained to him that I wanted an outside room to use my wireless card, he shouted, "We don't have wireless in the hotel!" I explained to him that with my broadband wireless card, I did, and wanted to use it. He then said, "I'll send someone up," and hung up on me. Nice. Also, they were renovating the hotel. They had closed the fitness center, which they didn't mention on check-in. So, when I got up early and went down to the fitness center, I was met with boarded up doors and windows, with no sign explaining what the alternative was. These are just two examples of MANY I could cite. My recommendation is that you avoid this hotel at all costs.

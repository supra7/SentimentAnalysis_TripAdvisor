The hotel's website says that the pool is currently under construction, which is why I was surprised to find the entire lobby and bar under construction as well when I walked in. There were planks covering every part of the floor and the lobby bar was completely taped off, behind plastic. The rooms are very small due to the particular shapes of the two towers and the views are limited unless you're on a very high floor; the good location and helpful staff isn't enough to save this Westin, especially as compared to the plethora of other (beautiful) hotels within walking distance. The gym was awful - a few pieces of random equipment in a 'closet' with no windows. The housekeeping staff trapsed through an employee-only door at the back of the gym three times during my 30 mt workout. About me - I'm a Platinum Starwood member so I always prefer Starwood properties and I'm typically pleased. This stay, however, was so bad that I moved to the Seattle Sheraton after two days.

My husband and I just stayed at the hotel in mid-July and had a horrible experience there. Not only was our Superior Queen room incredibly cramped, but the noises from the elevator and other guests' rooms made it nearly impossible to sleep through the night. Also, the hotel promises other amenities such as wireless internet access from the rooms, but it wasn't working while we were there. We felt like we paid too much for this place and it set a sour tone for the beginning of our vacation. After two nights, we cancelled the rest of our stay there and booked at a new hotel.

Stayed there last week for a business meeting. The staff from the start was horrible. I was told because they were so busy that I would have to wait for a room. I asked for the manager and while waiting for her two others in my party were given room keys. The manager said she was sorry and all of a sudden a room was available. Not sure what the problems is there. The room was small and old. The lobby, meeting, and ballrooms were incredible. The construction was minor. If I were wanting to relive the Roaring 20's or searching for Al Capone's loot this is the place. Otherwise there are a lot of great hotels in Chicago. This is not one of them.

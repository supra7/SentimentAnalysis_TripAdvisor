From what I have seen on the website I was very keen to try out this boutique hotel, but modern design and a fancy photo on each door does not make up for a tiny room with a "so called" bathroom containing only a toilet and a small sink. Oh, I do should mention though the shower in a closet - never seen that one before! But the worse was definately how little the room was sound proofed. Without choice I had to earwitness my room neighbors activities until 5am in the morning! Maybe because staff at the reception expect complains on a regular basis they did not bother to ask if I had a pleasant stay which I did not have for sure!

We stayed at Hotel Opera Roma for two nights prior to boarding a cruise. The location was very convenient. Staff was helpful and provided good directions and transportation info. Breakfast was very nice. Our TV never worked properly despite a valient try by the front desk personnel. My main complaint with this hotel was the size of our room. I paid approximately $250 US per night and got the smallest room I've ever had in a major European city. You could bearly get around the bed. There was no comfortable chair to sit on(mainly because one couldn't fit. The bathroom was so small that if you were sitting on the WC, you could easily hit your head on the sink. I believe the room # was 204.

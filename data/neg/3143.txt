I had a 20 hour transit at Singapore Airport (00.10am to 20.10pm). I tried to book and pay at Crowne Plaza Hotel Changi Airport but their website would not permit this as the date of check-out had to be later than the date of check-in. I was happy to pay the hotel's rates. Seems strange for a hotel located at an airport to have such an arrangement.

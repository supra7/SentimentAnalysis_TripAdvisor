My family were very unhappy with the room (Rm 409), the room was small even we paid for the family room. The floor was very dirty, the cleaning was not doing anything. The staffs of the hotel were not helpful and not friendly at all. They gave us the wrong informations about the train station as well as where to go. They don't seem to care about the guests too much. But the location of the hotel is good, nothing more!

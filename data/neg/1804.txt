I would not recomend this hotel. We had a problem with the laundry facilities in our studio apartment. Most of our clothes had what looked like rust spots all over. The management did give us about 1/3 compensation for these clothes by not charging us parking fees during our stay. We were still out quite a bit of money for the ruined clothing. We also found our unit to be well used and not very clean. There are so many other beautiful places to stay in Maui that I wouldn't waste my time or money staying at the Maui Eldorado again.

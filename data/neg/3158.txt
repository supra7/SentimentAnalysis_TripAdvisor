with a night to spare in singapore and have another 9am flight the next day, we thought crowne plaza is the obvious choice. for SGD200 a night and all the positive reviews, we expected similar standards as the hotels we would get in town. we got in and felt we have been shortchanged. let me be clear that it is not because we had a horrible room. but the hotel gives us a distinct sense that it benefitted from the location rather than design or quality. the amenities are as promised, here's where the hotel fell short for us: lobby and corridor - resembles a singapore community center. - very basic with no carpeting or climate control. meaning when its pouring out there, the floor gets slippery and dangerous. room - half carpeted. and the tiled bit is a bit sandy - no hotel slippers to compensate for the non-tiled floor - large purple orchids painted glass division to separate the bathroom and bed. blinds were provided to make room look decent. - minimal paid television channels available on mounted lcd tv - light positions and switches were awkward - promised newspaper but not delivered - windows with black out glass in the middle of the room and bathroom bathroom - small metal bin not lined. - hairdryer provided is 3 pin, the socket in the bathroom only has 2 pin - bathtub line the side of the bathroom, away from the shower area. its seems to be placed there to check the box rather than for use, much like the hairdryer. pool - we did not swim there, but took a good look at it from our open air corridor. plants were placed in the pool, result is a maze in water. its hard to tell if the pool was added as an afterthought to boost the amenities checklist. in sum, we felt we paid SGD200 for a marked up budget hotel in the airport. it is a good hotel nonetheless if you want to find a place at the airport without fuss. but for the price, you can find better in the city.

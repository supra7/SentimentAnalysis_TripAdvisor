I stayed here for a weekend work conference (Friday to Sunday). Firstly, the conference facilities were excellent, as was the in-conferencde catering (coffees, cakes biscuits, etc). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the rest of the hotel. My room was clean but there were a few old stains on the carpet. It was quite basic, but as expected from a Novotel. But the worst, and most surprising aspect, was the food, it was absolutely dreadful. We had a curry one evening and it was inedible - the naan was cold and hard, the rice cold and the curry like something from a tin. The dessert was carrot pudding (!!) and to be frank, it looked like vomit. Breakfast was fine (difficult to go wrong with cereal, salami, cheese and bread) but lunch and dinner in the restaurants was awful. The staff, however, particularly in the breakfast restaurant, were very helpful and always smiling. The hotel is also a bit on its own with nothing near, no bars etc. There is a lovely park opposite if you fancy a wander. The cheese toasties at the mini-golf cafe in the park were far better than the lunchtime offering at the hotel! It's quite a way from the centre of the city (I think we paid 16 for a taxi in the evening) but a pleasant 10/15 minunte ride on the tram.

Hotel accommodation poor value for your money. 3 out of 4 lights didn't work and the sockets were worse. Reception slow as only 1 person working on it trying to deal with a coach load of German tourists and others staying there. The quilts on the bed were far too small and kept falling off. No extra blankets readily available as I would have expected for a supposedly 3 star hotel. Maybe 1 star would be more realistic.

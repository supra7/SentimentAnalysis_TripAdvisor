I have stayed in several hotels in Boston, ranging from 2 to 4 stars, and I have to say, I'll stay in the Ho-Jo at Fenway before I stay at this terrible hotel! First, the heater was pumping 80* into the room with no relief, and the window that should have opened did not. The bed was a double, not a queen-size, which is what we had paid for and even been told at the front desk we were supposed to get. The worst by far was when we tried to finally sleep- there was a loud obnoxious party across the hall. By 12:30 at night I had called 4 times to the front desk to do something about it. *Four times!* Security did not do anything about it, and by the final time, I went downstairs in my PJ's to tell them it wasn't being taken care of. Their "Four Star" security was just standing around on their walkie talkies while the party continued with the doors wide opened. I finally stated we'd be willing to switch to another room. So, at 1 in the morning, we packed up our stuff and had to move to another room. And the 2nd room smelled like something had died in it. Luckily the heater wasn't broken in this one, but the odor was horrible. We decided to make the best of it, because clearly telling the apathetic staff at this hotel that anything is wrong is a waste of energy. The next morning I spoke to the manager and told him of the awful experience. I told him if we wanted a party across the hall from us keeping us up at all hours of the night with a small bed and a broken air system in the room we would have stayed at a 1 or 2 star motel/hotel. But, instead, we had opted to pay hundreds of dollars to stay in their "Four Star" hotel for only one night. There was no mention of taking anything off the bill or comping our stay. All he did was offer up a free upgrade and free breakfast the next time we stayed at The Fairmont Copley Plaza. Which, of course, will never happen again. Save your hundreds of dollars you'll spend on this joke of a four star.

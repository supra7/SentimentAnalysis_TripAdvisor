Nice set-up. Walk to the airport. Bid $60 on Priceline for stay in mid-July. Much less than $224 on Hilton website. Problem: No free wi-fi. It's $9.95 per 24 hours. I was disappointed that a fine hotel like Hilton charges, especially when hotels on all sides offer free wireless: Radisson, etc. In sum, however, the hotel was clean and the staff friendly and efficient.

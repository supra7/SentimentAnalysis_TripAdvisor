My car was parked on the Renaissance hotel underground parking in Saturday, December 11th. It cost you $20 to park your car for more than 4 hours. When I return back from the event that was hold in this hotel, I found that somebody broke in to my car and all my electronincs (GPS, iPhod, Radar detector and my cell phone) were stolen. The hotel security was a zero help - they don't have cameras on the undeground parking. The $20 you pay for the parking doesn't give you any protection. The hotel management made it clear that they are not responsible for anything that would happen to your car. Basically you are on your own.

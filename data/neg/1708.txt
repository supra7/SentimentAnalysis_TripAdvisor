I stayed at the Ka'anapali over Christmas this year, and had to change rooms twice during my six-day stay due to a major ant infestation in the Kauai wing of the hotel. While I enjoyed the third and final room of my stay, by that point it was too little, too late to rehab my opinion of the hotel. The grounds are delightful, but for $300 a night, they can afford an exterminator. Friends of mine stayed at the Westin next door, and that's where I plan to book for future visits.

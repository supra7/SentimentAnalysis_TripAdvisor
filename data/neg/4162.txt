I stayed at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston Sept. 20-23 on business. When we arrived at the hotel, My colleagues and I got a big "Welcome to Boston" greeting when the bell-hop wouldn't take our bags out of the taxi and into the hotel. He said it was the cabbie's responsibility and the cabbie said it was the bell-hop's responsibility and so we just grabbed our bags and took them in ourselves. Once checked in, we went to our rooms and found the the queen size bed is actually a SMALL full size bed. The bathrooms are really small and in the corner rooms the toilet is so close to the tub that you have to sit sideways. The rooms appeared to be relatively clean although my room always had a Taco Bell smell when I returned after maid service. By the way...I don't eat Taco Bell! Last but not least, I definitely want to gripe about the customer service at the hotel. It was really poor considering the costly rooms and grand decor of the hotel. When my colleague found a mouse in her room (YES A MOUSE!), they did not respond to her request to be moved or to have someone take a look at her room to see where the critter got in. There was no apology nor discount offered. Needless to say, this hotel will never be on my list for a return visit (business or pleasure). We heard from others that the Radisson across the street is much better. I'll stay there instead.

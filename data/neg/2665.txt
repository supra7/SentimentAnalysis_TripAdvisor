I booked my reservation in November 2011 for July visit..I booked with antonio the general manager so i wouldn't have any issues because I knew the hotel would be sold out for this particular weekend due to essence festival...anyway upon arrival I was told my reservation had been cancelled in December and I was sent an email..I was furious...I immediately called my cc company because i say the charge had been processed months ago on my statement...I sat on hold with cc company while I was on hold the girl behind the counter who was assistant manager of the property began to tell me how she was the one who initialed the acct once the charge declined and how i had no $ in my acct. Almost n hour on hold with cc company n being humiliated n front of other guest..the cc company found the date n the charge n kept telling dummy behind counter that the charge was valid...she had no other choice but to give me my room..got to room bathroom door had big holes n it n u can tell by looking at dirty baseboards that cleaning was not so big of a priority for them...only good thing is Fred breakfast chicken, heirs, sausages, real eggs and handsome security guard Jared at the door...lol

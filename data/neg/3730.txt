So I went for the weekend and I stayed here because I was only staying for one night and All the other hotels i called wanted us to stay for two nights. Well the hotel is in bad shape the rooms are very tiny you can barely walk in there! first of all the bathroom was not clean and also the beds! I would prefer paying at least 50 dollars more than staying in that place again! don't waste your money staying at this place it's horrible! The only thing I liked was the view from the balcony.

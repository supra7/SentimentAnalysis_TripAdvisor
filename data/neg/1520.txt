I stayed at this hotel just before Christmas with my husband, hoping for a nice 2 days in Rome before heading to see his family. The first night, we had a suite with a tub, and I was so looking forward to a relaxing bath. However, what we found was that a group of ants had taken over the tub and everything around it! So, at midnight, after 3 calls and 2 trips to the front desk, they finally changed our room. In this room, no tub, and very small (not even room for 2 suitcases) for the same price. This room had a problem with the toilet. The water never stopped running in it after flushing...we were afraid it would flood the room. Again, a call and trip to the front desk where we were told that no one was available to fix it until "later" (this was 6 am). We left for the day and when we returned, we were told it was fixed, but after 2 times, the problem returned. We were never so happy to leave a hotel! When we asked if we could please be compensated somehow for our problems with the room; we were told that we would still have to pay the full price for the stay...INCREDIBLE!! NOT a FOUR STAR, do not stay in this hotel. The service is poor, irresponsible and indifferent, even for Italians!

Staff was ok. Booked a king with a view but when I arrived they told me they only had doubles. Most Marriotts upgrade me to Concierge level because I'm silver but not here. Bathroom had bare pipes sticking out of the wall, wallpaper peeling off. They put me in a dark corner of the hotel where most of the lights were turned off (there is a huge ballroom in the middle of the hotel, which all the rooms on one side overlook.) They kept this entire area dark which made the hotel feel cold and empty. Just a few old folks at the bar. Rooms decorated in loud, oldskool colors. One nice thing, the gym is awesome.

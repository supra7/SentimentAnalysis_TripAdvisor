Stayed at this hotel 7/23 - 7/29. Housekeeping is very disorganized with what appears to be no quality control to make sure each room is cleaned. At check-in requested to have the linens and towels replaced everyday since it is supposedly the policy of the hotel to only do this when requested. Had to call the housekeeping manager everyday except 1 day to remind them I wanted the room cleaned and towels/linens changed. The day I didn't have to remind them to clean it I found someone else's underwear on top of my closed suitcase. Reported the 'extra' underwear to the hotel manager. The manager checked the room key records which showed that only the maid and I had accessed the room. The manager then 'interviewed' the maid who said she knew nothing about the underwear or how they got there. Since my room was not cleaned most days even though the manager said they were sending a maid up and finding the 'mysterious' underwear in my room it seems that maybe this maid on the 7th floor had a little extra 'business' going on the side. Another party in our group stayed on the 14th floor and never had to request maid service or changing linens - it was done everyday as soon as they left the room. I called a week ahead of time to request that both parties be assigned rooms on the same floor but at check-in was told that was not possible. Lucky for them that they didn't end up on the 7th floor too! We both had the same room type at the same price so I don't know why we weren't allocated together but it was a minor inconvience. The manager did make an adjustment on 2 nights price of my room since I complained but I would hesitate to stay in this hotel again. It was annoying to have to constantly call housekeeping to get service and very disturbing to find someone else's Victoria's Secret underwear on my suitcase. The location of the hotel is good and the valet parking attendants and doormen were efficient. Too bad housekeeping is not.

I've never stayed at a hotel where the room was cold! We had to blast the heating device which still didn't heat the bathroom. The in-window heater/AC unit (think Motel 6) was so loud we couldn't get a good night sleep even on a king size bed. Staff kindly moved us to another room the following night with a newer heater/AC, but it was still noisy. To top it off the bathtub had mould on the walls, but at least we had a bathtub, the first room didn't. Asking for something from the front desk was a comedy of errors and staff were rarely there to open the front door. This is one of the reasons not to book non-refundable rooms as we were there for three sleepless nights.

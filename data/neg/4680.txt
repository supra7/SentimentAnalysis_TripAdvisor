From the opulent reception area we were thinking we were all set for a relaxing stay on our weekend trip to downtown Chicago... How wrong we were! While my wife was getting ready in the bathroom I relaxed in the room and looked in the nightstand for something to read. Where a used condom awaited me. You can imagine how disgusting that was to find there. A quick call to reception and we were moved - after a 15 minute wait - to another room. Where the swivel shaving mirror promptly fell off the wall. This was all Friday night before going out for the evening. Saturday morning saw us awake to construction work on our floor at 8am. We got a $50 room service voucher as way of an apology. I would not stay at this hotel again.

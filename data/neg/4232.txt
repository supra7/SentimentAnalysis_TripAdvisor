Overall experience was bad. Front desk is always busy and full of people. I requested complimentary comb and brush, called from my room and waited half an hour and there is no delivery. Ended i have to go down to front desk to collect. Confronted to front desk and the answer is "I m sorry i forgot". No Free Wifi and breakfast is expensive. only 1 staff manning the breakfast restaurant area and breakfast order time and served took 15 minutes.

Room was tiny, a few staff were excellent & very helpful. Some were not, speaking in perhaps Russion or some other language between themselves which I found very rude considering we were in an English speaking country. Some staff unable to provide any assistance at all. Housekeeping was not good, sheets were changed once in 5 days & had to request towels and milk. Breakfast is a rip of at 15, scrambled eggs are uneatable. There is no room service and food is not a available most days instead offering you a take away menu from a pizza shop. One poor girl working in the dinning room was yelled at in a foreign language by a co-worker while we were having breakfast, very uncomfortable atmosphere. If there is any type of function you will be told to park in the street as they need the parking spaces at the hotel for function guests.

I love the location of this hotel and stayed there in July and had a great time. The hotel was perfect. So, I recommended it to our friends and ourselves and returned in October. We waited two hours for our room which took us to about 4:00 pm. Upon entering the room, the carpet hit me immediately as being very spotted (icky.) We went ahead and settled in but couldn't regulate the heat/air conditioning unit, and the tv would not work. A maintenance man was sent and told us too many people were using the television sets. That's why it wouldn't work. What? He also gave us a tip to put the heat on low and dial up to 80 degrees. We put up with that, but it wasn't very efficient. Then we begin to shower, but the shower doors were horrible- all rickety and extremely hard to move. Our one lady friend to whom we had recommended this hotel was stuck inside her shower and couldn't get out. Her husband was finally able to move the door enough for her to squeeze out. He reported the problem and maintenance took the door off and put up a shower curtain. The following morning, our television still wouldn't work, so I took the remote down to the desk and asked them to give us one that would work. I also asked about the very spotted and dirty carpet. She said she would move us but that another room may have the same dirty carpet. She said she couldn't inspect each and every room for dirty carpet. She didn't impress me AT ALL. There was one concierge who was able to give us some information, but the other two just stared at me when I asked a question. They simply didn't know anything. Even though this Hilton Hotel is located well for us, we will find another place to stay next time we are in Boston. It was embarrassing to have recommended the Hilton to our friends. There was one high point during our stay, and that was the wonderful man who staffs the free breakfast for Diamond members. I give him five stars, but I give the rest of the hotel and its staff a one star rating.

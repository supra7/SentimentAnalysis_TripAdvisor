I thought Trump and that hottie Bill Rancic knew what they were doing. NOPE! This hotel really reminds me of a 25 year old bimbo, very pretty on the outside, but things not quite working right on the inside (sorry, no offense bimbos, it was the best I could think of). Yes the lobby and rooms are clean and pretty. But the floor to ceiling windows are made of cheap, thin glass. I was on on the 56th floor and could literally hear every car that went by. I asked for a quiet room having read reviews from people complaining about the noise, and this was the best they could do. You hear planes beginning at 6 am and trains at 7:30 am. So much for a relaxing weekend away! Odd that I have NEVER heard a plane in a Vegas hotel room and I've been here hundreds of times. The bartender downstairs also refused to sell me their turkey burger which is supposed to be good. He said I'd have to get room service to get it. Uhhhh...aren't you people all using the same kitchen???? Also note that the burger isn't listed on the room service menu. All in all, save your money. Even if you get a deal.

Stayed there for a few weeks. The staff simply does not care. If it happened and you forget a belonging in the room after you check-out simply forget it! Nobody from the staff takes any responsibility for anything! Also the laundry service they are using is crap. I had several of my clothes damaged even teared and of course the hotel did not do any damn thing. Obviously will never visit that hotel again!

The location is ok, nothing to the north in the city of Kiehi, south is not much better. So much for the location. They have no beach per se, except for a sandy west facing piece of sand about 50ft across, lined by lava, be warned. Now for the hotel, the grounds are amazing, or at least they were about 30 years ago. Checking isn't much of an experience. They've spent more money on the sign on the highway than they did updating the resort. We stayed oceanfront and let me just say, we were in Maui for 5 days and Kona for 5, both were ocean front and we didn't experience the cockroaches we did at the AML. BTW we stayed in private condos at the other places. The room was worse than a central L.A. pay per hour motel, bed hard, bad everything. Don't be sucked into the "free" breakfast, there is none. It's coffee and hot water. Bottom line is, don't do what we did, we came out a day early and found what we thought was a bargain, pay a bit more and stay away from this place, it's friggin bad.

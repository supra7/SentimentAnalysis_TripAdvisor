I was booked with my family by American Airlines due to flight delays. The room that was reserved was not available and there was no flexibility by the staff to help us. I wrote to the GM Sanjay Varma but my request for refund were ignored. Great example of bad customer service that can hurt a brand. Avoid this hotel if possible.

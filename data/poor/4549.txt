I had selected Stoneleigh to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We checked in and no one at check in informed us that we had a special package that should have included wine and breakfast. But more importantly, no one told us we would be put in a suite (handicapped room with no tub!) directly over a wedding celebration. The nerve racking noise started at 5:00PM and didn't end until after 11:00PM. The party was outside; below our 3rd floor window; and under our floor. The drunken celebrants swore and screamed into the night while the thumping music pounded our nerves. I called the front desk to complain and the manager asked what I wanted them to do! The next morning there were over $100 of charges for services we did not receive. It's been 2 days now since our horrific experience and no one from the hotel has called to apologize. The hotel ruined our anniversay and left my wife in tears. So this is a warning....DO NOT STAY AT THE STONELEIGH! They do not have a clue how to care for their guests. They are all about image but their management have no skills in serving and caring for their guests. Don't say I didn't warn you.

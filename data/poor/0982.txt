I could not say if H3R is a nice hotel or not because after booking our vacation 3 months in advanced and paid for it, when we arrived they told us they did not have any rooms available and we were going to be transferred to another hotel (thank god they did..we went to Azul Sensatori and had a wonderful vacation with our kids). We booked our vacation back in December, confirmed the reservation one day before arriving to the Hotel only to find out they never intended to give us our room. The reservations department claims they did not know that the Hotel had oversold the rooms and the lobby manager claims they did know (do they speak a different language or they're just outright lying). In any case, if you are going to have a situation like this there are many ways to better handle it: 1) let your guests know in advance so they can make appropriate arrangements, 2) at least have the decency of sending the Hotel manager to deal with the situation and not the lobby manager (who by the way was truly embarrassed) and 3) provide a complimentary weekend so at least your customer comes back and gives you another opportunity. But then again what can you expect from a Hotel that does not honor reservations. Easy to say, we will never come back or recommend this hotel since it is completely unreliable.

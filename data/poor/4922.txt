My husband and I went there to celebrate my birthday. Honestly, since the hotel changed into a NH it's the worst hotel I've ever been at. 1. We arrived at 3 p.m (15.00 CET) and we've been told that our room wouldn't be ready until 6 p.m. No comments. 2.The room was the smallest I've ever seen in my life although we've booked a superior one. There was only space for the bed and one chair. The bathroom was so small that it was difficult to have a shower. 3. The breakfast was poor: some ham, cheese, only orange juice... No choise. Overall experience was bad. We could have stayed until 5 p.m. on Sunday (because we've booked late check-out, not because we've been offered...) but left (without breakfast...) early in the morning. Will not come again. Makes no sense to pay for this hotel.

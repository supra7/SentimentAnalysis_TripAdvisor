Right. This is clearly a cost effective hotel. If you're on a budget - it's reasonable. However these are some key points that need your consideration: - The location is terrible. A local on a tram said as we were disembarking, "Oh no, you don't want to stay in this part of town..." - Upon leaving (in a bus headed for Berlin that wasn't going to turn around and go back), I realised I had rather stupidly left my phone on the bedside table. No problem, we'll use another phone to ring them and ask them to forward the phone to a hotel we'll be staying at in just over a week. They told us they would check the room and call us back to make arrangements. They didn't call back, so we rang them again after 2 hours only to be told that the phone wasn't found. They said, "you should check your pockets in the pants you were wearing yesterday." Hmmm, why didn't I think of that? (I did - the phone was left on the bedside table!!!) So... they either have a security issue where unauthorised persons have access to rooms once you check-out or they have a security issue where authorised persons are very industrious. Either way, stay at this hotel at your own risk. Surely there is somewhere closer to town that offers better security?

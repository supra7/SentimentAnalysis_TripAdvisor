We checked into the JW Marriott Just before Christmas and Stayed for 4 Nights. The Staff is Great, A great staff doesn't make a great hotel. The room was so damp that we couldn't see out the windows, there was moisture inside, and near the windows, that aren't made to open it was cold and DRAFTY. When we wiped them off we could see that most of the windows on our side of the hotel were just like ours. Our bed was old, and lumpy, and try wearing white socks in the room, dirty in one pass of the very small room. I am an Elite member of SPG, No open Club.Granted it was Christmas weekend, so I will give them that, but no offer to offset the closure.

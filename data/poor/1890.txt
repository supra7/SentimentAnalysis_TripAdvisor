I had reservations to stay here this coming September -- I just cancelled them due to unresponsiveness of the hotel -- I call, the phone rings once, someone picks up and hangs up. I email and no response. All I wanted to know is which T-stop is closest to the hotel. The lack of response and reports of cockroaches and bedbugs is enough to keep me away.

This hotel chain is trouble; they are obviously running a scam with bait-and-switch tactics, overbooking and then shuffling people around.Stayed here with In-Laws. And yes, those reviews where they talk about overbooking and then sending you to a sister hotel: this is exactly how we ended up here; booked over yahoo, and the other hotel (The Astor) said they had no record, even though we had print-outs with "confirmation number" on it; they wasted hours, and then sent us here. Very noisy, cramped, but cheap.

9 of us traveled in a motor home all night to stay over the St. Patricks day weekend, Reserved 3 rooms for 4 nights WITH A CREDIT CARD,,,assured on the phone the rooms would be waiting so we could crash, clean up and have a free day before our annual convention, "Greg" at the front desk says ..."you were not here by Midnight and we gave your rooms away".....and then added.."Oh yes, we billed your card for the rooms last night"....would not help us find more rooms....kept repeating in a slow, condensending voice.."you don't understand - we have no rooms".....never have I had to hold back 3 Woman from strangling a Clerk. Marriott put us up......Embassy Suites called 3 hours later...Greg was wrong, we have your rooms. Marriott was clean, nice, packed. Embassy, old, tired, dirty.

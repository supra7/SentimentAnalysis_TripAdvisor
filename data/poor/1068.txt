We were there from Friday 7/3 to 7/5/09 in room 211. Starting at around 10pm on our first night (7/3), the couple across the hall from us started arguing and slamming their door. We could actually hear them word for word because they were loud and stood right in the hall. Finally around midnight, we called the front desk to complain. The front desk person said shes sending someone. About 5 minutes later, there was a knock on our door, the security guard wanted to know if everything was ok because theres a complaint. We told him that we were the ones that complained! Five minutes later, he knocked on our door again wanted us to point out the people that we were complaining about. This wouldve been ok if it wasnt for the fact that the lady that was making all the noises was standing right there in the hall way. Her spouse took off as soon as the security guard came around. Of course it shouldnt have taken a genius to figure out who these people were since they were standing right there in the hall way and a guy jumped into his car and took off. The security guard went back to the front desk without really doing anything except disturbing us even more. About an hour later, the guy returned and the arguing continued until 3 in the morning. This time, we just put up with it because it was better than the alternative. At the same time, we could hear every single foot step, water running, toilet flushing, and movements from the room right above our room (#211). At least we didnt have to hear people yelling and cursing at each other on our second night. Regardless, we didnt have much rest due the noises from the second floor. On top of that, there were other problems: the ice maker didnt work in our refrigerator; front desk receptionists were very unfriendly; and the plumbing back up so there were always debris in our tub. We couldnt place a formal complaint since the manager was off that whole weekend (or at least thats what we were told). Were always staying at the Marriott chain hotels, and usually are happy; but this location is the worst. We will never stay at this place again.

Condescending front desk staff, noisy rude cleaning staff at 5am, restaurant too lazy to bus the tables and was given the wrong order, and overpriced no-frills executive level. No reason to waste your money here when there are so many good options in Chicago. Stayed here twice before and had good experiences but this place has gone down-hill in a hurry. The staff is sorely in need of re-training. Tried to give the hotel a chance to redeem themselves but only got a half-fearted apology for the morning noise. This hotel no longer lives up to its grand reputation.

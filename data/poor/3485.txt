I thought this would be a great get away for my girlfriends and I - we expected a vacation in itself while staying at this hotel. We had a TERRIBLE experience. Besides the good location, there is nothing to say good about this hotel. There are NO elevators which we were not told about. The music in the lobby was pumping out club beats and made it very hard to hear the man at the reception, who hit on us immediately upon check in and then again when we called down about our awful room. The room we were given was nothing close to what is pictured on the internet. The rugs were badly stained, and the beds were uncomfortable and had no blankets. We didn't stay more than 15 minutes before changing our minds about staying at this hotel. We were supposed to only be charged for the first night of our two night stay (as it states in their cancellation policy), however I was charged for both nights which put my bank account into overdraft. I tried to call and reach the manager about this issue and only received attitude and the run around from the staff at the front desk. When I finally got through to the manager after a week (his name is Keith) he barely showed concern about the disposition of his staff or the state of his hotel. I am still waiting for my refund. Do NOT stay at this hotel. We found a better rate at the Double Tree.

I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos in downtown Phoenix for 4 nights while at a conference. I couldn't get into the Hyatt or Wyndham (which were the same conference price). They make you sign a statement that you will be charged a $50 fee if you depart early-that should have been my first clue that this hotel was going to be awful. This is a "historic hotel" (read old and run-down). The rooms are small. The bed is lumpy and hard. The pillows are like rocks. (They don't provide down pillows, only foam pillows that have been washed a lot and are lumpy). The bathroom has the original fixtures and cracked tile. The shower is the size of a phone booth with a shower curtain (don't drop your soap, or you will need to step outside of the shower to retrieve it, because you can't bend down in the shower - and I'm 5'3" and of average weight). The towels are thin and old. There are louvers over the door mean that you hear every noise in the hallway (the walls are so thin that I could hear the phone conversations from across the hallway). Being an old hotel, there are a lot of creaks and noises all the time. There are no individual A/C or heating controls in the room, so you are stuck with whatever temperature they have for the entire hotel. They do have ceiling fans in the room, so that helps in the summer. There are no services in the hotel-room service, breakfast, etc., though they have a bar for nighttime. On the good side, the hotel is 2 blocks from the convention center and they provide free wireless internet, though it goes out frequently. Supposedly, this hotel is haunted (several deaths occurred decades ago), but I didn't experience any "ghosts". Bottom line, for the price I paid, this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at.

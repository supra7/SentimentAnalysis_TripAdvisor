I was spending a night in the city and wanted to "splurge" so I tried for a 4-star hotel through Priceline. This is what I got. No way, no how is this place 4 stars. It's one of those places that are more concerned with being "cool" or "trendy" than with the guests' comfort. The room was tiny and not very clean, and I was told that no bigger rooms were available. The A/C barely worked; you could only feel it if you were sitting right next to it. People came up to look at it twice and still couldn't fix it. The room was dark -- good thing I didn't want to read -- and the hallways were downright creepy, they were so poorly lit. The bathroom had only a shower stall, something I find unacceptable in a "four-star" hotel. Next time I want a 4-star hotel, I'll be sure to avoid "midtown east" when bidding. This place was ridiculous.

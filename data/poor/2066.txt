I chose this hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and all I can say is that I will be much more circumspect about believing those reviews in future. In this case, in particular, I have to believe that employees of the Kimpton chain have been posting these reviews about the great service at this hotel. I stayed here for four nights and it was one of the worst serviced hotels of my experience. The room was not well maintained and not clean enough. On the first day I was there, even though I put a please clean my room notice on the door, it was not serviced at all. On that same first day, I called for breakfast room service and was told they had no cereal. On another day, it took me 45 minutes and three phone calls to get a juice and a pot of coffee for breakfast. There was a lovely young man at reception who appeared to be constantly on duty. In other words, the hotel was woefully understaffed. I would never go there again. Beware of these reviews!

Do not stay at Harrahs Las Vegas worst experience ever!! We were robbed while we slept someone came in our room stole our wallets. Hotel staff did nothing to help once they were notified Gustavo and a lady that work at hotel told us they would do an investigation and let us know. We asked them to call police no help at all. We had to file a police report on our own with NO HELP from hotel. They seemed use to the situation which we were not we've stayed at MGM, Excalibur, Treasure Island and have never had problems before however we were comped rooms at Harrahs so decided to stay with them NEVER AGAIN!!!

We flew to Istanbul to celebrate the New Year, Hotel Hatay was booked in advance. However, the hotel free rooms did not have and we lived in a nearby hotel Antioch. The Turks know how to deceive and convince us that Antioch is also their property, only the name of another. Number of Antioch was terrible and small. On the last night we all slept in the same alleged hotel room Hatay, where they received the number, which paid for. Breakfast at the hotel of average quality, but will not stay hungry. Tourists beware and ask them to return for their money!      ,  Hatay   .              Antioch.      ,  Antioch    ,   .   Antioch    .            Hatay,   ,   .     ,    . ,        !

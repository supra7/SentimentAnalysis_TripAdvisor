I'm a long-time Marriott customer but this hotel was the biggest disappointment I've experienced with Marriott. There were so many issues I don't know where to start from having no power or water, getting sick after eating in the restaurant, to having to call security because of unruly guests on my floor screaming at each other all night long. I know it's not representative of all Marriott hotels but I would skip this one if you need lodging in downtown LA!

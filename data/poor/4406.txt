Long check in line, room RESERVED not available. I paid extra for a high floor with a view got offered a smoking room than got a room with a view of airconditioners on the ground floor with loud noise from room above. Poor service, key quit working 3 times had to stand in hall to wait for sercurity. Pool closed. Elevator not stoping on your floor. One elevator broke repair guys there for hours. Not a very nice casino.

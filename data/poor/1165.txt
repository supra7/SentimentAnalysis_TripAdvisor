My friends and I stayed here from June 29- July 4, 2010. We were placed in Room 408. 1) The room was not vacuumed. This is was very digusting as there was pieces of hair and other particles on the carpet. I have to mention that I do not think that house keeping vacuums as the next day, we noticed that they did not vacuum the floors. I had to call front desk and ask them to specifically vaccuum our room. 2) All of us got bed bugs! How did we know? Well we woke up on July 1st night and we had all these spots on our legs (We had one King Size bed and the 3 of us slept on it). THe spots were by our feet/legs and all 3 of us got it. Plus my friend had gotten bed bugs a few yrs ago when she had traveled to Thailand. She has experienced bed bugs and the gross ness associated with it. The guy @ front desk changed our room for us - howver, the "fear" of bed bugs still lingered in our minds. We are back home now (it's July 13),, the bed bug marks are still on my leg but slowly fading away. I had to wash all my clothes and throw away my luggaages as I would be scared if the bed bugs traveled with me back home. AVOID THIS HOTEL IF U DONT WANT BED BUGS!!!

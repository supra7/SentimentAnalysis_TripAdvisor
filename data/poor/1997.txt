Based on reviews here and their inclusion on the Conde Nast Traveller Gold List I was shocked by the Eliot Hotel. The staff is incompetent, fond of giving incorrect answers to questions and seem to be totally unsupervised. My wife and I checked into our room to discover a shower that fell apart when you turned the knob and outfitted with a shower head that would be unacceptable for a Motel 6. A door that seemed to house part of the heating system refused to stay closed although neither of us ever opened it which may or may not have also had something to do with the room's refusal to remain warm enough for a winter night. We were attending a wedding next door and upon returning at 10 past 12 were told that a limited room service menu was available. We ordered a turkey sandwich and after being told that it would take 45 minutes to an hour for the crack staff to put even that simple meal together settled in to wait for our meal. 15 minutes later we received a call telling us that there was no turkey sandwich left - these things happen but how in the world does it take a hotel that pretends to be high class and well appointed by professional staff that long to discover there isn't any turkey in the house. Especially when it's one of only three things you're allowed to order past the arbitrary midnight cutoff. The housekeeping staff pounds on the door at 6:15 Sunday night for turndown, we were on our way out shortly thereafter and asked them to return later. When we got home from the event we found an untouched room, par for the course for this mess of a hotel. Stay elsewhere in Boston, the Eliot is not worth your time nor your money.

We just checked in about 4 hours ago and have already been treated like second-class guests numerous times. From when we first pulled in to the valet and I was left to load my own bags onto a cart to bring them to the room (staff was too busy with the Bentley parked in front of us) to when my wife called the front desk to see if a slightly larger room was available and she was given the runaround by the desk clerk, we have already made up our mind to never stay here again. We are in town to see family that we never get to visit, as we are currently living out of state, and just wanted to upgrade our room to have a bit extra space for people to sit and visit, and when my wife called the front desk, they told her they had no rooms available except for a suite, which was out of our price range. As she was talking, I then logged on and checked to see if there really were no rooms available, and there were multiple reservations available for the nights we're here for the EXACT room my wife was requesting. After hearing this, the desk clerk had to hang up to call back, as he was likely caught in his lie. He called back a minute later to tell my wife that because of the mix up, they would be upgrading anyone who booked OUR size room for free, but still wouldn't offer us the upgrade that WE WERE WILLING TO PAY FOR! Judging by the clientele we see all over the property, perhaps if we rolled up in a more luxurious car and had on a bit more jewelry, we would be treated with the decency we deserve as paying guests and Starwood Gold Members.

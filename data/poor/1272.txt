I've stayed in my share of one-star motels, but this was the worst. It was conveniently located right off I-55, but it was also in a very run-down area (complete with abandoned buildings) and felt kind of isolated and unsafe. I booked online through Hotwire, but if I had seen the place beforehand I never would have stayed here. The room was somewhat dingy, the bed uncomfortable, and there was a lot of noise from outside (could have been the elevators - I didn't see a single other guest on my floor). This didn't bother me too much, but the mold in the shower did. The toilet stopped working on my first morning there, though the guy at the front desk was apologetic and had it taken care of immediately. This is the only time I've ever considered moving to a different hotel even though I likely wouldn't be able to get my money back. Definitely a place to avoid.

Possibly the worst place I have ever experienced. Shower was overgrown with mildew. Staff was impossible to get in contact with after multiple attempts, and will charge a 50gbp service charge for calling. Email address provided does not work. Cleaning services not performed. The saving grace would have been location, however is situated right beside a bar, where patrons had smashed glass bottles over the entrance. All while charging over 120gbp/night on a 7 week stay!

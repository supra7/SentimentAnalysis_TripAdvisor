I purchased a package for about $300 that offered me free stays in the US plus a couple weekends at selected resorts. I figured for $300 I could stand a pitch or two for a free stay. I knew it was a timeshare and that there would be hidden costs. When I made my reservations for Las Vegas were were combining it with a wedding for my soon to be step-son. It was a weekend trip. I booked the stay through the phone and the internet. I was not told the address and location of the resort. I tried to get a confirmation mailed or emailed to me but no response. I received a confirmation call about 1 week before the trip with what sounded like the Sahara but when we got there - we were not booked in. We had no idea where there hotel/resort was. The phone number they gave me did not connect to anybody - we could not call the east coast - they were gone for the weekend. We had not choice but to book a room were we were standing - that set us back a bit more. We finally got in touch with SummersBay Vegas. It seems that their resort was more than an hours drive from the strip. We did go there and complained to the management about their lack of communication. They tried to tell me that the person who called just lost their brother to cancer - no dice - I just lost my spouse to cancer - they figured that would not work on me - so the talked faster and by the end of the short meeting I got one night paid for for our hotel and we were free to go - no sales pitch. We never used the remainder of the package I purchased. I just could not think what it would have been like to be as far as DisneyWorld with kids in tow and be left with no room at the inn. No thanks - you got my $300 - I got 1 night free - we are even.

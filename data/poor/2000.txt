I've never written a review before to complain but I would never want someone else to go through what I did this past weekend. Not only was the Hilton Back Bay a terrible hotel for all the typical reasons (screwed up my reservation, no towels, dirty room, thin walls) but my car was broken into in the garage that they charge you to stay at. Not only was it broken into in their "secure garage" but someone tried to steal it and when unsuccessful, stole everything inside of it. When I saw that this happened the hotel was absolutely NO help, would not refund my parking fee, and even asked us to leave because they didn't want the police to come to the hotel!!!! So basically after an already terrible stay they charged me to stay in their parking garage where my car was severely damaged and my personal belongings were stolen and then they asked us to leave. DO NOT EVER STAY HERE!!!!!

Customer service from this Westin's managers is below expectations, but may meet that of a Super 8 motel. There are too many problems discuss and will update (with pictures) when I can gather my fustrations, but at this time I would advise travelers to stay away from this hotel, regardless of any "deal" that is offered, unless it's completely free.

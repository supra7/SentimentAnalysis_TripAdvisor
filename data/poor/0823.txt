Last year my stay here was pleasant, but not this year. Breakfast: the restaurant area on the ground floor is really too small for all the guests. We had to line up and wait a long for a table to sit. No much variety. No omelette station: you have to order (many time...) to the waiter. Internet connection - wifi - is very expensive. Pool:the hotel has a new policy (what a surprise!): women and men can not use the pool at the same time. 7.30 to 13.30 only women, 13.13 to 19.00 only men. I like to relax by the pool with my husband and I will not come back here again.

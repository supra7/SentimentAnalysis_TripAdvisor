Despite the delightful and helpful Joey on reception and the apparently good location, we cannot recommend this accommodation. There is nothing Boutique about the Citadines, more like park bench. We cannot understand how this establishment has achieved the rating it has. After a reservation stuff up (not ours) we had to split our 2 night stay between two different rooms. The 1st , a studio apartment which could best be described as shabby with tatty furniture, dysfunctional doors and lights, difficult toilet, broken thermostat on the AC and generally in need of serious TLC. A lack of kitchen ware (only 1 bowl) made the kitchenette facility close to useless. Our second room was close to microscopic with very little room around the bed, you pretty much had to climb on from the end. Though not quite as tatty as the 1st, still far from good or acceptable. Both beds were truly an example of mans inhumanity to man, the mattresses, I use the term loosely, were the hardest Ive ever experienced. I had to keep on checking they were real and not blocks of wood, they looked real but real sleep was simply impossible on these excuses for comfort. Ive done a reasonable amount of travel/backpacking around Asia for over 25 years and never experienced beds like these. Shame Citadines, shame! There also appeared to be some serious night club action happening relatively close by which the Citadine is ill equipped to acoustically handle. Maybe this explains the beds, youre not going to sleep anyway so why bother trying. Our 2 day HK homeward stop over was meant to be a little touch of luxury after nearly 6 weeks of backpacking in Europe but the Citadines totally spoiled this for us, the only real dud for the entire 6 weeks of travel so I suppose I cant complain too much, but yes I will. Citadines is an expensive rip-off for a seen better days dive, dont go near it.

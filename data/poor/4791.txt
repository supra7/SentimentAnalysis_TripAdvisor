Stayed here for a business trip. At check-in, the person at front desk was very rude and unhelpful, and talked to me with an attitude. My business package included free parking, but she incorrectly charged me and 2 of my co-workers $15 per night for parking. The machine that controls the access gate to the hotel guest parking structure did not seem to work after check-out for me and another co-worker, and we needed to contact the front desk for assistance. I have opted out of the $15/day internet and and $20 breakfast buffet as I consider the price to be too expensive. I also consider the $15/night parking.

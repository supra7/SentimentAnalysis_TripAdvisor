I would give it zero stars if I could. When we arrived after our cruise to check in we were told they had move stay overs than expected and that they had no room for us. They had not attempted to contact us before our arrival. They moved us to a hotel that was several miles away in the university district and told us to walk next door to a shopping center to catch a shuttle to that hotel. They didn't even provide transportation. It took us over 40 minutes just to deal with the situation at the Roosevelt plus the shuttle ride, plus the check in process at the new hotel. It took us over 90 minutes just to check into a hotel room, that wasn't the one we wanted! We booked the hotel specifically because of it's location in downtown, which we were no no where near. Once we got to the other hotel, there were continued issues and the entire day was filled with stress and frustration. I would never stay at this hotel or any other Coast hotel ever again. And we were not alone. I watched them turn away at least 5 other groups while we were standing there waiting. Beware!

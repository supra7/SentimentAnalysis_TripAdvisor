The worst hotel in america! My wife and I have done a lot of traveling around the world and when we stayed at the Chateau for a wedding weekend it was comparable to the worst hostel situation you can imagine. An unfriendly and uncooperative desk staff lent itself to several confrontations after first being put into a smokers room, with a leaking ceiling with five foot water puddle on the floor, and sinks that didn't drain. The second room had stained sheets and a window that would not close. Finaly in our third room we found peace for the night. On the second night some friends came to town and discovered a mouse in the bathroom. When we reported it to the front desk, they acted as if it was not a big deal and didn't offer to move our room. I called to discuss some sort of dicount on the stay and was given nothing for our incovenience. In addition, the cost was perplexing, at $169/night this place deserves no ones business.

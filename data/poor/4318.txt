My wife and I, nonsmokers, checked-in to Harrahs on Oct 16 and the entire time we were assulted by the odors of various tobacco smoke. Anytime we wanted to go into or out of our room we had to go into the smoke-filled casino lobby. We stayed at the Venetian later in our trip and even though people smoke there, you don't bathe in it. We walked through 10 different casinos and of those 10, Harrah's was definately the worst. And beware of getting a room in the Mardi Gras tower above the Carnaval Court. The music goes on until 2am and I had to be up at 6am for a conference. We were changed to the Carnaval Tower (ironically, not near the Carnaval Court) and had a partial strip view (if one considers Casino Royale a premiere strip location). If smoking and a seedy crowd is your thing, by all means, head to Harrah's!

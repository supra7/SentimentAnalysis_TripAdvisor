After spending time in downtown San Diego, we checked into this place to discover no air conditioning, but it had free food! The fan in the room had filthy dust, the bedspread and headboard had a film of dust, and there was toilet paper on the floor as we walked in. The door to the patio had chocolate finger prints on the handle. But the best thing was the free food in the floor - M & Ms, Crackers and Sunflower Seeds. YUM! This place ruined what had been a perfect vacation to a disgusting one!

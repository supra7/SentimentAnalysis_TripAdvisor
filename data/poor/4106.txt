Ironic -- as I went online to post this, I read the 8.26 review by a Seattle guest. My sister and I had much the same experience last week. After extensive online research of Chicago hotels, we chose the Fitzpatrick based on the very positive TripAdvisor comments. I have no idea how this place receives a 4-star rating. The carpeting was dirty and stained, as were the bedspreads and bedskirts. The closet door and nightstand were missing handles. The toilet did not flush properly ... the pool was small and dirty. As I checked under the bed to be sure we weren't leaving anything, I noticed the metal bed frame was broken. And the list goes on and on ... I have stayed at many hotels and would expect some of this at a less expensive place, but certainly not from such a highly rated place. We had our children with us and we so wanted to look forward to a nice room in the evenings, but as we stood in the rain at Navy Pier we didn't look forward to returning to the Fitzpatrick. As we passed other hotels we would say 'we could have been there'. Sad that it had such a negative affect on our vacation. Buyer beware!

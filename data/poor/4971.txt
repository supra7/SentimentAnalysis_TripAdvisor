Please save yourself from a terrible experience. This hotel says it's 4 stars, no way. Peeling wall paper, stained rugs throughout, walls crumbling, moldy showers and sinks are the amenities here. Upon arrive we were unhappy and asked to see other rooms. We looked at 4 and found the same, or worse in the others. They set the air conditioning to only go as low as 20C! This place is a property of Leonardi Hotels, be careful to avoid.

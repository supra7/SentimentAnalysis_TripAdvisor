- have stayed many places in Las Vegas but will never stay at Harrah's again. You have to ask them to bypass the A/C system in order to keep the room somewhat cool. The staff really could care less if your there or not and they are great at giving you incorrect information. Food BECAREFUL where and what you eat. I was in bed for 24hours due to food poisoning from Toby Keith's Bar/Rest. Overall Bad place to stay service was the worst and rooms are tiny and Hot.

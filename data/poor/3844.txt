Whatever your reservation rate shows up as, add $10 per night for the "mandatory amenities charge for playstation and DVD player." yes, mandatory. Then be sure to bring some shower cleaner for the shower walls which haven't been washed since Obama has been in office. Pack your carpet shampooer for the floors. And don't forget a mattress pad to make the disco era mattress sleepable. Other than that you should enjoy your stay. Never again.

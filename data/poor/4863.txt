Beware.... bed bugs This hotel is located on top of a bus station, with buses running from 6AM to 9PM. Nowhere in the lodging information does it mention this. While the hotel was decorated nicely my traveling companion and I got a serious case of BED BUGS. These 2 issues ruined our vacation,needless to say.

I stayed at this hotel 26th to 39th May 2010 in room 201. Each morning I awoke with a bite on my body; I knew the bites weren't fleas or gnat or mosquito bites and was puzzled until I got home. They were bed bug bites. I immediately emailed the hotel to let them know and when asked for a review, also explained what had happened. Three weeks on, all I have had are holding emails from Travelodge. It's distressing to think that they are probably letting other people sleep in an infested room. It's also very poor service that they have not responded to my complaint, except to tell me how busy they are and lastly, how they'll be 'looking into it'. While it's possible for any hotel to get bed bugs that are carried in by one dirty customer, it must surely be a priority for any establishment, even high turnover flop-houses to fumigate and deal with problems of this nature immediately? Needless to say, I shall be pursuing this with Travelodge and taking my business elsewhere.

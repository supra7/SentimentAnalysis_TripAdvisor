Our bedroom was not as advertised, but it would have been fine if it wasn't for the bathroom. The bathroom was falling apart. The shower head was coming out of the wall, the towel bar was falling off the wall, the toilet paper bar was broken. And the worst part was that the bathtub was covered in mold.

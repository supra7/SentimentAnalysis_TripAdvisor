We are a well traveled couple looking for a great resort on Maui and can't say the Westin met the expectation. Too many kids, too crowded around the pool area...could have had more beach chairs on the beach....zero on great resturants or nice bar....room was small/bathroom not very well done at all...kind of low-end if you will. Valet parking was a zoo...however, staff was very friendly and helpful...weird that whenever you asked for any kind of assistance from the concierge you received a pitch for the time shares...ugh!

Bad Service, Noisy I initially booked three nights (my wife and I) and decided to leave after the fist one for a nice gay operated BB a few blocks away for cheaper! Front desk is totally rude. Rooms are dirty. Toillet and shower was backing up and staff couldn't have cared less! And... Worse of all really really noisy!

There was mold growing on the ceiling of our room! The carpet had been wet and also was molded. The elevator got stuck on every floor and opened between floors once. On the day we checked out, the elevator was not working at all. The front desk staff was rude and quite unhelpful. You pay $5 a day for Internet useage, but it's only good for 12 hours. (I had to explain that a day is 24 hours, not 12). The location was convenient to the subway system, but the hassles were not worth the lower price. Stay somewhere else unless you want to come home with mold allergies and frustrating memories.

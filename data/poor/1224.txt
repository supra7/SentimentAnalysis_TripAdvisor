When we arrived, the hotel had already given away our suite we had reserved, in advance, to accommodate 6 people. They would not make any exceptions and crammed us into a standard room with 2 roll away beds that barely left enough room to walk around. They also refused to give us a refund for the difference in room rates from the suite we originally booked and the standard room we were actually given. All they said they would do is "comp" our parking fees for our 2 cars. But watch out, a week later my friend found a charge for the parking fees on her bank statement. Sneaky! They also have the air conditioning preset, because they are cheap, which you are unable to lower manually. Like getting ready to go out in a 78 degree room that eventually went up to 80 degrees? Not. Fun. The managers at this hotel are clearly inept and have no sense of the word "customer service"....good luck with this one!!

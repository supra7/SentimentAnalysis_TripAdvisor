This was the worst hotel experience of my life. The customer service at this overpriced, dirty, outdated hotel was spectacularly bad. When I went to check in, it took the three juvenile, unprofessional and class-less people behind the desk nearly ten minutes to acknowledge me, even though I was in line at the desk and there was only one other customer in the lobby. One of the reasons it took so long is because one of those three individuals had, apparently, broken wind at the reception desk, stinking up the lobby. The male worker was so busy making a big deal about it and drawing attention to it that they were all distracted. There was no opportunity for a good night's rest for two reasons. First, my phone kept inexplicably ringing in the middle of the night due to some malfunction. Second, in the early morning hours, hotel employees were loudly coming and going down the hall, slamming doors up and down the floor. The day I checked out, the elevator was broken. A hotel employee cut in front of me to get into the only working elevator with a cart so large that only he and the cart could fit in the elevator. When I explained that I had been waiting for a very long time (and needed to check out), he angrily told me he needed the elevator because the other one was broken. On the day I checked in, my bags had to be stored for a few hours. I had to call reception three times (over the course of half an hour) to get my bags even though I was the only person who checked in during the time I was in the lobby. The last day I was at the hotel, the hallways were littered with trash. There were huge trashbags on the floors for hours that final morning. And the rooms, while decently cleaned, were old, scuffed and dated. This hotel is TERRIBLE. Truly, I have never had a worse customer service experience. Do not stay here. A youth hostel would be better. It is TERRIBLE.

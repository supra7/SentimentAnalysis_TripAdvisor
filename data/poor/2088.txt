I checked in with my daughter on March 16. She wanted to stay in a five star hotel so we chose the Hilton. The first morning I reached for my eyeglasses which had fallen to the floor by the bed. When I reached down my hand landed on a nasty, dessicated orange section which apparently house keeping missed. I took the piece of food trash in a tissue and showed it to the concierge, who asked me if I wanted a manager to contact me. Yes. 8 hours later I got a call from an uninterested manager who asked me if I wanted him to find out if one of the services in the hotel would give me a credit. He never followed up. By the third night in the hotel, our sheets were soiled and dirty. We left the sheets down so housekeeping could see that they needed changing. They were not changed, so my daughter and I had to spread towels on the bed to sleep. The toiletries were not replaced as required. Very disappointing

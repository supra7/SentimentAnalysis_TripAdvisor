Scary,Nasty and Never Again All I can say is don't waste your time staying here. The Management is poor quality especially when they are yelling at the staff in front of hotel guests. The elevator is always breaking down and they expect you to climb up and down the stairs to your room and that is an experience in itsfelf. The stairs are cluttered with Bags and Bags of trash, dirty linen and trays. Even the halls were cluttered with bags of dirty  clean linen and it makes me wonder if my bed was changed with what? The staff is in such fear of making a decision and every request was given the answer of LET ME ASK MY MANAGER and you have to wait and wait.The rooms are different. Some remodled and some that look like Motel 6.My only good thing to say was Housekeeping staff was pleasant and the housekeeping Manager he was great and he took care of our needs without question and as busy as he was I am suprised. The maid was great and we never had to ask for a thing so it makes me wonder why everyone else was so scary.My plans to stay elsewhere is a no brainer.

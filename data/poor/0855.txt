We arrived in Istanbul at around midnight, the day we arrived I called the hotel to make sure that they did not cancel our reservation (for which I had pay one night in advance) because we were arriving late. They said it was ok, however when we arrived, we found out that in fact they had cancelled our reservation because the hotel had been "overbooked" and we were arriving late. So they put us in a single room but still charged us for a double room. Besides that the staff in the hotel were rude and unhelpful, every complaint or request was a chore and they made you feel like everything was our fault, the fact that they cancelled our reservation, the fact that we got charged for a double when in fact we stayed in a single that first night, the fact that the jacuzzi was not working, everything was a drama. As I said in the title, the location is great but I am sure there are lots of other hotels around the area so don't stay at the Pera Tulip Hotel Leslie

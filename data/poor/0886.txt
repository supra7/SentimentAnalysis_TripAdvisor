I booked through hotels.com and verified my reservation was refundable before making the reservation (I even called customer service to check). After booking I needed to change the date on the reservation. When I rebooked it online I didn't realize I had accidentally clicked on a room that was exactly the same as previously reserved except it was apparently non-refundable. Unfortunately I had to cancel the trip due to family illness. I cancelled through hotels.com using the cancellation link in the confirmation email. I was well inside the cancellation window (had I actually booked the correct room) but never received a refund. I called hotels.com customer service  they informed me I had a non-refundable room but they agreed to call the hotel. The hotel did offer a refund for me of two of the three nights but the hotel refused to credit the full payment even though it was cancelled more than three weeks before the stay. While Im grateful for the two night credit, for a supposedly 5 star hotel I'm dismayed at their lack of understanding. 5 star hotels such as this need to think carefully about the impression they leave on customers when they exhibit such a lack of service. It turns out this was an extremely expensive accidental click. Even though this was clearly my error, I could never recommend staying at this hotel simply because they have demonstrated a lack of five star customer service. Im also disappointed that Hotels.com lacks a warning that has to be confirmed before a non-refundable reservation can be made - this would avoid such easy mistakes happening. So if you are planning a stay here  buyer beware..

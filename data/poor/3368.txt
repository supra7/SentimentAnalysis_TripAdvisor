The front desk personnel first had no personnality. On the way to the room i noticed how dirty the elevator was and the hallways. Carpets were worn. Stayed in room 702 on the oceanfront so I paid top dollar. There were four of us, my wife two kids and I. First I noticed how small the room was. The two double beds were stuffied in the small area. There was a tiny table with two chairs in the kitchenette area. The room had a mildew smell. First thing i notice when puting the suitcases on the bed was the filty black AC vent that used to be white. My wife has asma so dust and dirt don't go over well. I went out in the hallway where there were 3 house keeping people. Took some time for me to explain to them that i wanted them to clean that vent. Most of the worker in the Hotel come here for the summer to work from Eastern Europe. Later that day after coming back from the Beach we noticed how much mold was in the bathroom tub area outside and in. Complained to front desk, they sent someone to clean it. AC was nosiey. they never fixed that. This place runined our vacation. i will never ever stay here or anyother holiday inn again. You may say don't compare all H.I.with this one, but I complained on the survey that was sent to me a week later and also on the Holiday Inn website and no response. Even the front desk at this Hotel never said they were sorry. I can't tell how much anyone with a family should not ever waste their money staying at this dump!!

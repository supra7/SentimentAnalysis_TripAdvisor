We booked via Expedia for a quick overnight stay in Dallas. The prior reviews on TripAdvisor, and lack of availability of some other favorite hotels, directed us here. My wife checked in before I arrived on a separate late night flight. The hotel itself is very average and has a helpful staff. However, when we pulled back the covers of the king bed (room 311), we found a few bugs crawling on the sheet. A more extensive check of the mattress pad and bottom sheet reminded me why I would not recommend doing this at most hotels -- we found bedbug droppings and more unpleasantness. The staff tried to move us to one of the few available rooms and we found a lesser problem, but still similar. So, at 1pm, we went looking for a hotel room. We worked with Expedia for a credit and this is still unresolved. Expedia requires that the hotel agree to the refund. Some service! So, to everyone else who stayed at the Comfort Inn Dallas Market Square around July 26th, 2007, if you're wondering about those red bite marks on your body, we know the answer. And to the owners of this hotel, get ready for your City of Dallas public health inspection because we filed a complaint.

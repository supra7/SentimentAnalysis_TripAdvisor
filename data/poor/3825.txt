Stay elsewhere, You're worth it! Worst experience ever! and we're from Hawaii. My husband is 6'3 and they only had doubles or twin size beds. Do not expect much as far as service. We asked for an extra pillow 6 times-it didn't show up till the next day. The front desk have no concept of customer service or capable of multi tasking. There is always a line to just turn your key in. Parking garage is a nightmare too. Tight spaces and inconvenient to access. We decided we were worth more and left after a grueling 4 nites. Found a place with an oceanview.

Hotel is fine--except that the rooms don't come with iron and ironing board, and when I asked for one at the front desk, the clerk said they were all in use and I'd have to wait until someone returned one. Huh? Maybe....you should buy more irons if you run out of them! So I asked to file a complaint. Well, they're out of complaint forms too (why am I not surprised). So I asked where I could buy an iron; she didn't know but figured it was too late (6:15pm) to find a store that would have them anyways. So now I have to wake up early, go walk around to find an iron, come back, iron my clothes before my meetings for the day. The lack of a basic amenity and apathetic staff pretty much spoiled my impression of this hotel.

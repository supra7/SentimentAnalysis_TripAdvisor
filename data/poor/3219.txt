For such a well run hotel it is unfortunate that I could not adequately convince the management that a room with a foul aroma was unacceptable! The first room I was offered had a mysterious foul aroma. The bell person agreed and they sent up some destinking team. The treatment was ineffective and I was moved to a room with a new foul aroma. I recognized this aroma, stale beer and cigarettes. I was told one mover per customer, all are rooms smell like this, (not true and I hope not) and I was stuck with this room. The destinking team did try again to fix the smell. forget destinking it doesn't help! On the second day I was once again moved to a third room. No smell finally and I didn't really think all their rooms smelled like that. The first move cost me my first appointment in Las Vegas. It wasn't like the Four Seasons where they just move you and you don't even have to be there. The second move another appointment. trashed. The hotel had so adversely affected my stay that I left early. I should have left as soon as they could not find me a satisfactory room. It wasn't my first stay at the Wynn/Encore but it was my last. On my next visit to Las Vegas I tried the Mandarin Oriental NOW THAT WAS A 5 STAR hotel. Even better than the Four Seasons (my usual favorite).

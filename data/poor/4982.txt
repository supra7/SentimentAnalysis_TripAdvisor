I stayed in Barcelona for two nights and thought I would give this place a try. Being a student, I was on a budget and thought this place would be ok. When I first arrived the staff was very friendly, the man working the desk provided me with a map and gave me my room key. The place seemed fairly clean and the lobby was ok, but when I got to my room I was not impressed. Although it was small (as I expected it to be), it smelled like raw sewage and it clearly had not been attended to as there were still clumps of hair in the shower (which also leaked water all over the floor). The bed was hard, and the hostel is located near a very noisy street. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs! I became sick after a day. On the plus side, the breakfast slection was half decent, lots of muffins, croissants, meats, cheese, juices, toast, yogurt etc. - just be sure to show up early or you will be disappointed. The staff is great and very helpful, except for one elderly man who made me feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable. At first, I thought he was very nice and just joking around, but then became very touchy-feely and even asked if he could kiss me and touch my arm. (Sexual harassment, anyone?) I was meant to leave to the airport at 3, but I became so fed up with the hostel and the location that I decided to leave at noon as I would much rather wait in the airport than stay there a minute longer. If you are looking for a cheap place to crash and don't care about cleanliness or noise, this will be an option for you. Otherwise avoid at all costs. I will NEVER stay here again.

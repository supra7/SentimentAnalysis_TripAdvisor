We had 4 teenagers with us. One of them left a hundred dollar bill in the bathroom when we went to breakfast. When we came back, the housekeeper was in the room. The child went to get her money and it was not there. We asked the housekeeper not to leave the room, but she went running out of the room, down the hallway.. When we reported the incident to the managers, Scott and Andrew, all they could say was that the housekeeper has worked with us for 17 years. Management did not appropriately handle this situation. When you stay at a hotel, one wants to know that management will take a report of theft seriously and thoroughly investigate. We tried to follow up on the results of their investigation, with 3 separate phone calls. Although we left messages, NO ONE returned our calls. I will not stay in a hotel that does not take my safety seriously. As convenient as this hotel is--in this case, location is NOT everything!

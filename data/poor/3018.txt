Lots of disappointments. We arrived at 5:00 PM on Saturday. There was no valet. Parking was two blocks away. No bellman to help with the bags. Small rooms were expected, but light emitting vents over the door was not. The place was noisy, as there were no double paned windows and the vents in the bathroom were like a megaphone to others rooms! Shower was clogged, it took 20 minutes for the drain to go down. Worst of all was the lack of advertised wireless internet. The connection kept dropping after one or two minutes making any kind of web work impossible! Staff gave an explanation which was not believable by anyone with even the basics of networking, let alone an IP professional. If they don't know, then say so...don't give me a story. Did I mention that there was no food service on Sunday morning? The clerk cheerfully directed guests to a diner four blocks away, which was closed! Bottom line: We will not stay here again.

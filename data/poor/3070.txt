The room is fine, if a little tacky- but there is absolutely no parking anywhere!!! The liar who took my reservation assured me there was plenty of street parking and that, in a pinch I could park across the street at the school. Neither statement was true. We drove around in circles for an hour every time we needed to park- and the staff was totally unsympathetic. On top of that, they did not warn us that we'd have to move our car for alternate side parking on Mon morning. Pretty much ruined our trip. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!

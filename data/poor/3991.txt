Location was excellant. Service was so-so. Front desk staff not friendly. Rooms very small and we felt confined. TV channel selections terrible, halls dark, no free amenities at all, no paper, coffee in lobby picked up by 9am.. Won't go there again, will try another downtown location next time. For the price, very overrated hotel.

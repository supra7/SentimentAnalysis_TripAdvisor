Yes, the hotel is located near the ballpark and blocks away from the Inner Harbor, but that's ALL! I have nothing positive to say about this horrible hotel! You won't get a king bed even if you BEG for one. The night supervisor informed me that no one staying in a king room was checking out for days....come on!!! I'm not stupid. I was there for six nights and was miserable. The two beds in my room were more like TWIN beds. They were SO SMALL!!!! No internet (unless you want to pay $11.99 PER DAY), no refrigerators in the room (unless you want to pay $25), no microwaves (to heat up leftovers from the fabulous restaurants in the area), and SELF-PARKING is $26 a DAY!!! Go across the street to the Holiday Inn or the Marriott. I assure you the staff will treat you a lot better and the hotel may offer more than just OXYGEN. I will not check any of the amenities below because they are not amenities to me unless they are included in the price I pay for the room. All of the ones listed below are EXTRAS because they come with a price.

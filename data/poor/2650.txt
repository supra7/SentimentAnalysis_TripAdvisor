I am not one to post reviews at all, but this place moved me to tell the world not to waste their money. If you book here, take airfreshner, your own bedding and towels, and a high tolerance for being treated rudely! We had an interior room for jazzfest, and it was awful! There were no windows, so good luck knowing if it's the middle of the night, 11 in the morning, sunny, or pouring rain out. The room's air conditioning units were pumping out a foul smelling 'moldy' odor, that the staff seemed to not care about. We spent $30 extra dollars at Walgreens to purchase our own de-odorizers, which only masked the stench. When given the key to an alternate room, we found it stunk worse that the original!!! The room was filthy, we found a presntation board, from a previous guest, under our bed that was dated 2002, if that tells you anything about the cleaning staff's dedication. It seemed that everyday as we were leaving the hotel, the cleaning staff was always sitting in other rooms watching tv and lounging around. In addition to outragous room rates, we were charged $25 a day plus tax for parking!! Plenty of other Quarter hotels don't charge if you are a guest! And the kicker is, the front desk staff got caught talking smack about us as we were leaving the hotel. And although we called hotel managment on it, we still saw the same staffers in the lobby each evening of our stay. So, I felt uncomfortable the entirity of my stay, everytime I came or went through the lobby area. And beware, this hotel is owned and operated by a company that owns two others in the area, so beware of them also! The only positives about this place were that it had a beautiful courtyard and an extremely friendly and helpful parking staff!!!! (you can find that almost anywhere in the Quarted by the way!)

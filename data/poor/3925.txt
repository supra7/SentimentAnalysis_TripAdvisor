went to the Maui Sheraton in August 2002 for the second part of our Hawaiian vacation. It really ruined the vacation. The lobby was not all that impressive. When we got to our room is smell like urine and there was no lanai as promissed. We did not even let the bell hop leave and called the front desk. I was told that there were no more rooms in my category and that we would have to stay there. I told them that this was unacceptable to either find another room or upgrade me. After 20 minutes the front desk called back and said that the found another room. We went to our room and it felt damp but my wife and I said we would try it. The veiw was of the tennis courts, garbage bins and golf course. I must say though that the beach was magnificent. Although you had to pay 15 dollars a day per person for a lounge chair. That was outragoeous, so we went to the local ABC store and purchased a beach mat. The worst was yet to come, our room was infested by roaches. My wife and I were horrified. We had the creeps staying in that room. We decided not to switch rooms because we did not want to spend a few hours of our precious time packing and unpacking. When I went to see management about it they took a very cavalier attitude about it and suggested that they were some other bugs and not roaches. The nerve. The only thing they offered me was a refund on my $12.50 resort fee for the days that I spent there. I did not feel that this was right. I spent Thousands Going to this supposed First Class hotel and accept for the natural surroundings it could have been any roadside motor lodge. When I came home I wrote a letter to the General Manager and after 2 months got a reply. They gave me 10,000 Starwood points which would not even cover a night in this hotel or other first class starwood properties. My Vacation was ruined. I would not recomend this hotel at all. But stay at one close by and use the beach as everyone else does.

One word - "dump" Bad enough the hotel is a dump, but add a less than friendly staff for total discomfort. The place might not be quite as bad if they at least pretended to take an interest in guests comfort. Seems $ is what matters most. I didn't like my room partially because of the southern exposure. (No a.c. which is common in SF, but it was unseasonably hot and faced directly south. The room baked to well over 90+ degrees each day.) I asked if they had a fan - no. Could I have a different room - no. Well then I found somewhere else to stay for the remainder of my trip, and they charged me a $50 early check-out fee. The room was fairly spacious but the furniture was shabby at best. The curtains were tattered. The bathroom had a thick layer of old dirt and scum that would require a remodel to get rid of, not just a good scrubbing. There was hair on the bathtub and sink from another guest. The tub drain was sluggish and I had to shower in standing water. The toilet flushed inadequately. Sometimes there was scalding hot water, sometimes no hot water. There is no fan in the cave-like bathroom - no air circulation. The hallways had a funky musty stale smell, beat up old carpeting and dingy walls. I read other reviews which seemed to focus on t he neighborhood. The homeless situation is yet another reality of San Francisco. I find them harmless. They are not violent or mean. They just happen to be on the street. It's heartbreaking. Besides, the review is supposed to be of the hotel, not the city of SF. I wouldn't stay at the Air Travel Hotel again if it was offered free. I'll just chalk it up to making a big mistake, and move on. Never again!

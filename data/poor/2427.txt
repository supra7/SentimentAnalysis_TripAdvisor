Compared to the five other Ritz-Carltons I've stayed at this was by far the worst. (Naples is the best!) Perhaps it is the size, with nearly 600 rooms it is the largest property, and most likely this is why the service is pitiful. This hotel is the equivalent of a Holiday Inn. I waited over an hour at the small local airport just 10 miles away because no one told me to take the Kapalua shuttle; I was waiting for the Ritz-Carlton shuttle. None exists! At arrival, I loaded my own luggage on to the cart, and when the bellmen finally decided to help he showed me to my room and literally never uttered a word. The carpet had a huge stain, the bedspreads were tattered and one of the lamps never worked. I was never given a key to the mini-bar and when requested one it showed up two days later. The bartenders were surly. At the beachside bar which is at a great distance from the hotel there were only four stools at the entire bar and when my food arrived and it was raining I had to stand and eat, when I complained the bartender actually asked another guest to stand while I used his barstool (TRUE STORY!). It was embarassing and very uncharacteristic of the whole "ladies and gentleman" philiosophy. In the terrace room for the overpriced breakfast ($38.00 for one a la carte) I cut my lip on the broken juice glass and never even received an apology or perhaps a credit to return to the restaurant. When all of this was reported to the front desk, the clerk advised he did not care as he was leaving in the morning to work at the Lake Las Vegas property. And don't bother addressing your concerns to the GM. He is newly in from the Fairmont Whistler B.C. and could care less. Perhaps he is just overwhelmed. Combined with the poor location, constant wind and clouds and the cool June temps, I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me. Go to the Four Seasons and relish in true service and hospitality.

I watched the maid wash our glasses and mugs in the sink then dry them with the same cloth she used to wipe down the sinks and counters. She may have used the same cloth to wipe down the toilets but did not see that. I tried to tell the cleaning staff the potential of getting people sink from doing this but none spoke English. New glasses were brought to our room at my request. The staff person carried the four glasses and two mugs with his finger inside them. The cleaning staff and supervisors have no idea how germs are spread. We did not eat at any of the Arizona Grand Resort restaurants of coffee shops in fear that the sanitary conditions were the same there.

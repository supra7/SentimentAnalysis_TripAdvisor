There is something seriously wrong with the management and customer service philosophy used at this hotel. Wynn was way, way better before. I have been treated better at Motel 6s. What I observed in my time there: 1). Woman getting hit by object full water bottle thrown from second story balcony at pool area. 2). Me getting hit by another full water bottle thrown from second story balcony at pool area. 3). Man complaining to poolside security about an assault/battery of some sort at pool area. (I don't know the details of this one, but I saw the guy complain) 4). Stolen wallet from the pool area - not recovered as far as I could tell. Security did retrieve a stolen iPhone from the bushes. 5). Woman performing "an act that you wouldn't want your children to see" on a man on the balcony of cabana #113 in full public view of the families and children passing by on Las Vegas Boulevard. 6). At the entrance of the pool area, a woman asked a man to show her his privates. He asked her to show her breasts first, which she did for a few seconds in full view of the public. He lowered his swim trunks at that point. 7). I got banned from the property for complaining about getting assaulted by people at a high roller party in the pool area fronting Las Vegas Boulevard. I called the las Vegas police because the hotel refused to do so to keep their record clean. These imbeciles didn't even apologize for anything. Things have gotten so bad that I am in the process of filing a civil suit. Telling them that we had recently sent hundreds of salespeople there, but couldn't consider doing that again if this is what we would expect to happen to our employees and their families didn't seem to make a dent. I recommend you avoid this place until they gut out the bad management and customer service practices and replace it with folks appropriate for a 5-star property.

I recently went to NY and when looking for hotels could not find anything under $450 per night, so when I stumbled upon the Marrekech Hotel located on the Upper West Side on expedia.com, I was absolutely thrilled! It turned out to be THE worst hotel experience of my life. One of the matresses in my room (556) was infested with disgusting bed bugs which bit and sucked my blood all night. The next day I noticed several mosquito-like bites on my upper arm, but my day two, I had large clusters of swollen bite marks on my throat, neck, other arm, hands, back and bottom. I am still itching as I write. When I spoke with the hotel management who actually knew about the problem, they agreed to reimburse me for two nights of my stay, which was the least of what they could do. PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL! I fear that you will regret it. If the management is aware of the problem, but choosing not to entirely eradicate it, then you have to worry what other corners it is cutting.

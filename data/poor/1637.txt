I was going there for a convention and Hotel Anatole was sold out. The closest available hotel was Extended Stay. Booked it because ratings show 3.5 stars. Well, this is false. This hotel does not deserve more than 1 star. It has roaches, and I killed two or three of them. The carpet was extremely dirty with burnt mark and foul smell. The bed was not comfortable. It is definitely not a deluxe hotel. This is not a home away from home.

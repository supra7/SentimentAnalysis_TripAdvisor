I stayed in his hotel the second weekend in February. When I arrived it took 20 minutes to check in since they only had one person working the front desk. This is a time when Harvard University was holding a convention in the hotel so it was wall-to-wall students. The room was quite aged and it still had a tube type TV! The room was small without an easy chair to sit in so the only place to sit was on the bed. We were awakened on Sunday morning at eight o'clock by jackhammering and drilling. When we complained on check out, front desk person said there's no construction going on in the hotel even though I told her I would bring her up to the room so she could hear it the nonstop hammering and drilling which appear to be coming from the adjacent room. Small rooms, unsympathetic staff, having to walk down 11 flights of stairs because the elevators were so crowded, $40 per night parking and being awakened at eight o'clock by construction sounds make this a definite thumbs down

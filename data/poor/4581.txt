When people say the rooms are small THEY ARE NOT KIDDING!!! I used Priceline and got an amazing deal ($50). When my son and I opened the door to our room we both just stood there in shock. It was smaller than a cruise ship room. Seriously. Maybe 9 X 11. We couldn't use the fan in the room either. When it turned on it made a loud screeching sound that was intolerable. I didn't complain to anyone because I know I got a 'good deal' through Priceline. Lesson learned. NEVER STAY AT THE HOTEL FELIX!!

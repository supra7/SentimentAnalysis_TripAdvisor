made a reservation here and had to cancel. I cancelled within the guidelines but am 3 weeks into and 3 phone calls to try and get my refund back to my credit card. I am beginning to wonder if this is some kind of game to see if they can keep from issuing refunds. They had no problem taking the deposit right away but getting it back seems to be a daunting task. will never book this chain again

Stayed with friends for Mardi Gras weekend '09 at the Chateau Hotel. The hotel was conveniently located in the French Quarter. That's where the positives end. One of our rooms had no windows and no air circulation. Only heat was available, kind of like a college dorm room in the winter months. If you prefer the consistency and quality of a chain like the Marriott or the Hilton, the Chateau is not for you. The rooms seem like they were last updated in 1989. There are no elevators, likely due to the age of the property. The bathroom had a screwdriver and a bunch of screws on the floor. The smell upon entering the room was moldy. The sheets felt old and worn, like something you'd experience when visiting your grandparents. Stay at a chain and avoid this dump!

Remember, hotel star ratings are based on the amenities offered at the location, not on the quality of the rooms. In my opinion, the quality of the rooms was substandard for a downtown 4-star hotel in a major U.S. city. This hotel makes me question if I will ever stay at a Hilton property again. Review Good: Fairly clean; beautiful lobby Neutral: Downtown location, but on the boarder of a shady area Bad: Miniature room with ONE full-size bed (for two adults); no coffee maker in room I could not in good conscience recommend this hotel to anyone due to the size of the room and the tiny bed. (I didnt even know that a respectable hotel chain had a full size bed as an option. I have only seen queens and kings in respectable hotels.) I guess if enjoy being in tight quarters and you can sleep comfortably in a petite bed, this hotel would be fine. PaulSuburbs of Chicago

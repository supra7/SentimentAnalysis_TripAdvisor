I took a last minute trip to Hong Kong and did not book anywhere so I was pretty desperate as every hotel that I crossed was fully booked. I paid 500 HKD for the room sight unseen which proved to be a mistake. The room was grotesque-tiny, not very clean, a nasty, stained bathroom with a floppy wooden door, antique plumbing and no soap, toilet paper etc. and smelled nasty. I think that the thing that surprised me the most was that there were two large suitcases taking up a good portion of the room (storage I'm guessing). I had to have a few drinks in order to be able to return to it. The location was good but I would never stay there again.

Possibly because the hotel is between brands - but mostly because they had not advised us that they were in fact between brands so. We had booked 3 nights a the Wyndham Gardens Hotel - fully expecting a full service hotel, with complimentary breakfast and what we got to was chaotic. The hotel was/is being refurbished, the rooms are T I N Y with one of the beds being so close to the airconditioner it might as well have been attached to the airconditioner. I was absolutely apauled. All credit to to the font of house staff, when I absolutely insisted that they find us alternative accommodation - they did after almost an hour and a half on the phone to other hotels in New York. It may well be fantastic when the refub is complete - for now, make another choice.

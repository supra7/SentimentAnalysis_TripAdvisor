Lousy I expected a quality hotel with excellent service. I am sorry to say that the stay was not worth the money, the service was in one word: lousy. It did not even meet the service of a 1 star hotel. So the Joie de Vivre story of experience this and that is all bla bla to me if you cannot even achieve the basic standards of service.

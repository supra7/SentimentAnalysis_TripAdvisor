This place is WAY overrated. I booked a room for the weekend after reading reviews form here and was terribly disappointed. The rooms are big but that's the only thing this place has. Maid service is nonexistent - before,during,or after your stay. The maid spoke no English and I had to bring trash and towels to her before she knew what I needed done. When I go on vacation I don't want to make the bed,empty trash,do dishes - nothing. I want to relax. Our room looked like a crime scene on the carpet - disgustingly dirty. The couch stunk so bad and was so filthy we put one of the bedsheets on it before we sat on it. We wore socks in the shower because that too was gross. Our room was around back - not much lighting and lots of bushes and trees = criminal opportunity. The rooms are far from suites - more like converted apartments. There are no interior corridors - your bedroom windows are right on the balconies/stairways. All night we saw shadows going past our window which made my fiance very uncomfortable. If you have ANY standards this is not the place for you. We checked out early the next day ( after the maid fiasco ) and went down the road to Residence Inn & Suites, which had the same type of accommodation's but MUCH cleaner,safer, and actually cheaper. Don't make the mistake I did.

The location is excellent. It is modern. I had a room by the elevator, so the noise was excessive. But at 1:15 AM two people opened my room and started laughing. I called to the reception and they said the system had made a mistake and I was supposed to forget about it and go back to bed since it had been corrected. There is no other lock on the door so if someone has a key to my room I can't lock it besides this.

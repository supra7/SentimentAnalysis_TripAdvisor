This is the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. When the elevator arrived at my third floor room, I was greeted by holes (looked like kicks and punches) in the wall, bare wires sticking out of the wall where someone had evidently stolen the light fixture, and general stench. I entered my room to find a filthy bedspread, a velour chair and ottoman that used to be red, but were so caked with dirt that they were brown and sticky, and a grimy, moldy bathroom. When I looked at the carpet, it looked back at me. The swing arm lights next to the bed hung off of the wall at a 30 degree angle. I was scared to touch anything, and with good cause...When I got in the shower in the morning, my hand came away from the temperature control valve BLACK with dirt! The yellow towels looked as if someone had intentionally tried to turn them gray, and the closet space was lit by a bare bulb with a pull chain. I was terrified to plug in my laptop; the electrical outlets were either missing or blackened and charred. I was (after a two hour hassle) finally able to get one channel on the television (NBC), and the staff acted put out that I requested a functional television. I used every lock available on the door, then stacked my luggage in front of it. Had there been any other property available in the city during my stay, I would have moved. The only thing missing from this hotel was a chalk outline from a dead body. Really, it was that scary and disgusting.

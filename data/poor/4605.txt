How can a room as small as a match box be called a suite.........NEVER STAY HERE ....it may have a good location for the convention center....but ther are lots of other v hotels and no need to stay here. I have stayed in other Embasssy Suites Canada andUSA and this is the WORST ...just give it a miss...........not at any price. NO NO NO NO

We stayed here for 2 nights in June 2011. Upon arrival, parking almost impossible because so so tight. Room was OK size but kitchen dishes and utensils were dirty...clearly not professionally cleaned between hotel guests. Safe was broken and staff confirmed that it had been left that way after a couple locked there Passports in and had to leave quickly. They also said there was no way to have it fixed during our stay. Also, shower ran out hot water quickly.

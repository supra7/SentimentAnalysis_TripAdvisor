As first time visitors to Las Vegas, to say myself and my girlfriend were excited about our trip would be an understatement. The fact that every ounce of that excitement was gone as soon as we stepped into The Stratosphere sums up how bad this hotel is. First of all, the location is atrocious. It's based in an extremely seedy area and there is a constant sense of danger. We counted 3 crime locations (based on the police tape) within 100 yards of the hotel entrance! It is also a 3 mile walk to the heart of the strip (The Bellagio, Caesars Palace etc.). Secondly, the smell is vile. As soon as we entred the casino/hotel lobby we both looked at each other as if to say "do you get that smell too?". When the elevator doors opened on our room floor, we both gagged at the smell that hit us. It's quite difficult to describe, but the best I can do is to say it smelt old and dingey. Thirdly, the room was useless. I drew back the curtains as soon as we entered the room, only to be faced by a 15 foot wall. There was absoutely no natural light whatsoever in the room. The smell also lurked in the room! We literally checked out 2 hours after checking in without even asking for a refund; we just wanted the hell out of there! We booked into the Paris hotel which was perfect!

Harrah's Las Vegas use to be a very nice place to visit. That was then. I would tear it down and build a Hotel/Casino/Resort that can hold its own amongst the other more modern more exciting Hotels on the strip. Room was okay, stained carpet. Old CRT television with bad picture and sound. bathroom dirty and dried tothpaste from previous guest in sink. We set the A/c to 60 but the room stayed at 78. Food expensive for what you get. Old slots with a few modern ones placed here and there. Small check-in area and always crowded and the Concierge was awful-rude. I waited in the designated area and people just walked up to the desk asking questions bypassing the designated area and the Concierge did nothing, I walked away after 10 minutes. met only one nice lady cashier at the buffett and the valet was fast and courteous. too many choices now, for alittle more money you can have a better place to donate your hard earned money. Business center charges 10.00 for first 15 min to use their old computer. there is no wifi anywhere. you have to use the swipe your credit card computers near the monirail station.

We've given up making contact! We haven't managed to book a stay at the Casablanca. I can only describe their reception as totally inefficient  non communicative!I have been trying to book two rooms for seven nights accommodation in August but they have so far ( three weeks later!) failed to respond at all to my two e mail requests.Having read the glowing reviews of service, I feel very disapointed and have decided that they don't deserve our business.I have never experienced this degree of poor service from a hotel before in all my years of travel.

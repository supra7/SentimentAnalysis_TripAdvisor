Our room was burlarized on 12-24-2011 while we were out off the room sight seeing. It appeared as if someone used a key card to enter the room. They took two Apple MacBook Pros, iPad three, clothes, and many many Apple assessories for the computers and iPad. I filed a police report because the Harrah's Security and Risk Management didn't appear to care about our situation. The Harrah's Hotel claims representative from CCMSI is refusing to reimburse us for our losses. Please, please make sure you have your own Home owner's Insurance because you will have a problem getting Harrah's to take responsibility for someone (their employees) using a key card and walking into guest room's and helping themselves to your property and walkiing out the room and NO one see anything. There NO CAMERAS in the hallways and Elevators they are ONLY on the Casinos Floor. I WILL NEVER STAY AT ANOTHER HARRAH"S PROPERTY.

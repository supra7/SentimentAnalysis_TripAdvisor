dear sir after challenging a lot finally I arrived to the hotel and I found that they are very impolite and they act like a thief!! because of hotel problem with my credit card I should pay all of money at the beginning and despite of my booking reservation they asked me 880$!!! when I told them I should pay 824$ and they found that I knew the price I gave them totally amount!!!!826$! the sauna, Turkish bath and even if Jacuzzi is not free and we should pay money to use them !!! They didn't clean my room and in my bathroom the trashcan was not empty at the arriving!!!!!!! I think it is the worse hotel you can stay

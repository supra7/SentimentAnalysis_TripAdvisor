We stayed at the W because the Mercer was fully booked and you get what you pay for. For 450 dollars per night one could reasonable expect a fantastic room and great service. The hotel room was tiny, shabby and damp. The staff were dismissive and basically ignored our requests (3 times) for someone to take a look at the issues we had with the room. The bathroom was tiny, there was mould growing in the carpet, there was a cigarette burn in one of the blinds... I could go on. If you want a room of this standard (but 3 times the size) pay a quarter of the price and stay in 2 star accomodation close by (I have in the past!!) All in all the W Lexington put a huge dampner on what should have been a fabulous weekend in New York.

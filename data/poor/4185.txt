My wife booked this - thinking it was similar to the Hotel Ibis. We arrived at the hotel. The little star(s) it had were falling off the building. Area - run down. Not a single foreigner in sight. Felt intimidated as the shops were dire, council flats in close proximity and no decent places to eat at. Reception - welcoming and nice. Room - awful! Stank of smoke. We ordered a double - but were given a twin room - not ideal for me and my wife! The bedding was stained. We were told a safe was available and working - but on arrival told it was not available! Where else could we store our safe belongings!!! There were little insects in the bathroom. We got no sleep at night as the other ppl staying in the hotel just kept making too much noise! You could hear other ppl watching TV, hear footsteps, hear bathroom/toilets being used - a real nightmare! The restaurant attached to the hotel looked ok. But food was aweful!!! The beer was the only thing worth having. 1 tube stop was hidden away in the little side streets, abot 5 mins walk. We walked there - but then safely walked back as the area is so run down! The other tube stop was 15 mins walk away! The hotel itself is miles away from the sights and delights of Madrid. We asked to be upgraded the following day to another room - but were refused. As a result we walked out and are awaiting our Travel Agent to retain refund. Avoid avoid avoid

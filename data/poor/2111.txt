2 Years in a row we attended the Blackhawks Convention. As far as information or promises made., get it in writing. You See the Chicago Hilton makes no mistakes at least will not admit any mistakes. Instead "sorry for the inconvenience ". First year the passes were included with the price of the room . Hilton never mentioned this , I am good at finding out all info. Not this time I bought an additional 5 passes $300.00. When I expressed my surprise Hilton , "sorry for the inconvenience ". This year more problems, mix up with old bank account , they made a refund to a 9 month old closed account .Double charged new account. "sorry for the inconvenience ". at check in the guest service agent assured us that one credit card was being used for each night providing a computer for viewing . When we saw the mistake 3 weeks after our stay we called Kelly ,customer relations , then a few more then Jennifer , and Mr. Mc Ardle , "sorry for the inconvenience ". . Mr. Mcardle assured me he knew I was worrieed and would figure it out right away . I waited 4 days and left him a message . Jennifer , Mr. Mc Ardles, assistant called and offered to split the loss, or help me find the lost credit and "sorry for the inconvenience ". Unable to share the account number , only hint .... it was a Visa ,. While on the phone with Jennifer , Mr. McArdles, assistant I found her a Visa phone number . After several other calls and being sent through 5 lines , we are told in was actually a debit card for a closed checking account, Jennifer supplied them with my old debit card number and that it was a Chase Bank account through Visa debit. A bit demeaning at Jennifer's reluctance to share my info with me Jennifer , Too much chaos from a fine hotel. Still waiting but Jennifer did state "sorry for the inconvenience ".

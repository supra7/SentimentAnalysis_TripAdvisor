Staff is unfriendly, breakfast very poor. Don't ask for the alarm clock in the morning because it is manual and they forget to call you all the time.. I had an embarrassing experience after having lived in the hotel for one month. My agency made a mistake and booked one day less than I should stay. I told them that I had to stay one more night, but they came up with my suitcase in one hand and all my clothes picked from the closet in the other one. As I obviously could not go out in Rome with 5 shirts and a suit pending from my hand, I told them that I needed to put my clothes inside the suitcase. They didn't even bothered, and I had to fold my shirts and put them in the suitcase just in the reception bar. It was a very embarrassing experience having to that in front of all the guests. After having been living in that hotel for a month, I was expecting a better service. THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER

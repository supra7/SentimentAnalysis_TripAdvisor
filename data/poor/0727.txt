We went to the Hyatt Maui for our wedding/honeymoon and I was in tears within the first day! The room was small and gross, the bathroom was dirty with mold on the ceiling and on the wall. We stayed in room 612, my husband complained to the actual manager on duty and they supposably cleaned the bathroom top to bottom- they comped up our wedding dinner which was nice but the bathroom was still dirty as you can see the pictures. There was never any self parking available at night time so we had to park somewhere else and walk all the way to the door. We also went to the Luau, which was absolutely a waste of a hundred dollars a person, the waitress we had was rude and called me a bi*ch after she told us we couldn't sit where we picked cause it was reserved- as if we knew!! The grounds of the hotel were absolutely amazing and the breakfast was to die for but the amount of children was crazy! My husband and I weren't able to enjoy a nice relaxing quiet time in the hot tub because it was wall to wall kids and i mean younger than 10 with no adult supervision! The pool attendants didn't seem to enforce this at all. All in all, I would NOT go back to this hotel again!! and the worst part... it was our honeymoon and I was completely disappointed about the lack of customer service and the lack of everything else there!

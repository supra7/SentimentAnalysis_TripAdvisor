where do i start well me and my girlfriend wanted to get away for new years eve so we made the drive from dallas to new orleans and i had reserved a king suite at the roosevelt and requested a early check in we arrived around 1:30 and we were told our room will be ready in about a hour well 4:00pm comes around still no room after many attempts at the front desk with rude employees finally had a nice young lady that upgraded us to a luxury suite for the night but we had to check out the next morning and go back to the room that we reserved which we agreed to. well there we go again 2 and a half hours later still our room was not ready so almost 3 hours later we finally got it it wasnt the room we requested with a tub and a view so we decided to take it anyway the only compensation we got was 2 drinks and free brunch and to top that off the valet is $44 a night so you would think they would be more proffesional but no i went back to my car 5 min after we parked to get my phone and it was on the side of the road still with the engine running and window down with nobody watching it and note this is a brand new BMW and then there was a small crack on the front bumper once i got it back but i wasnt even gonna waste my time on trying to get anything out of them so in other words it could have been a way better stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't stay at this hotel if you are a non smoker or you book through a travel agent. In fact don't go there at all! We arrived fairly late on Tuesday night and were given our room keys but when arriving in our rooms we found that they were both on the smoking floor and stunk to high heaven of cigarettes. We went back to reception and asked to have our rooms changed only to be told that there were no non smoking rooms available at the price we paid and that if we wanted a non smoking room we would have to pay extra. We were also told that as we had booked through an agent there was no guarantee of room type (i.e. smoking or non smoking) and that this could only be guaranteed if we had book with the hotel directly. Having explained how bad the room was and that as non smokers we could not be expected to sleep in a smoking room we asked to be moved again and it was like banging our heads against a brick wall. All we got from the night duty manager was that it was their policy not to move customers to other rooms free of charge (we were talking $10 difference by the way) and that she understood our problem which clearly she did not. She would not budge and just kept going on about hotel policy and the fact that she would get in trouble if she gave us upgraded non smoking room free of charge. After 20 minutes of complete frustration we reluctantly agreed to pay the extra $10. And what did we get for that $10, well the room was on a higher floor but not as big or nicely laid out as the previous room, my brother ended up with twin beds rather than a double and our room had a bathroom with facilities for a disabled person. Note also a lot of their rooms are on the main road and can be very noisy (we stayed there for 2 nights 2 weeks before when we did get non smoking rooms) but noisy ones. Customer service 0

July 4th Weekend was great! The super 8 was not. The carpet was so dirty it stained our socks! The tv remote did not work nor did the repeated attempts to replace it! It was miles from Graceland and not within walking distance of Beale st. The staff was very unresponsive and don't think of swimming in the murky pool. One of the bedside lamps was not working. The toilet lid was unattached. and it is located in an industrial part of town. Please see Memphis but do so from any other lodging beside this one. I have a high pain threshold for complaint but I am taking the time to write this review to warn others. SUPER 8, you better do your quality control! you have lost me as a customer!!!!!!!!

Dilapidated, out of date, dreary, ground-floor, facing a multistory carpark (which illuminated my room all night) and reeking of smoke - that was what I found when I finally arrived at my "non-smoking" room, that is, after pushing my luggage myself through corridor after corridor, and the ballroom! Even the corridor reeked of smoke. At "reception" I was studiously ignored for nearly half an hour whilst another inmate tried to get some satisfaction for his flooded room. Finally I was checked in to my "non-smoking" room and given a map of how to get there. As I was on my way to a boat trip I had too much luggage to carry myself, so I asked about assistance and was told to get one of the trolleys round the corner. It was one of those big things with gold bars over the top. Another woman was just returning the trolley and gave me advice on how to get to the room, via a "short-cut" which took about 10 minutes off the walk and I was very grateful to her. I was nearly dead on my feet after flying from France via London, having had to depart France nearly 24 hrs previously. It took me about 20 minutes at least to walk to the room. For this I paid 120 euros on Expedia (the French version) . It seems to be impossible to book on the American site from France, although I could see it was a bit cheaper. All in all from my arrival at the hotel it was over an hour before I got into the room. I'm afraid I was just way too tired to complain at that stage.

Called this morning to book a dive package and was told be there at 12:30 or so as we were the only divers and booked a scooter dive. We arrived 10 minutes late and the instructor was furious and told us we couldn't join the group they now had . Also cancelled our scooter dive without notifying us. We carried all our gear through the extensive grounds to the beach to be treated like garbage. Thanks Steve for ruining our day of diving in Maui -

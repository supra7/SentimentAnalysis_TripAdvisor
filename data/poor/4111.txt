i would NEVER stay in this hotel again. you cant even get ice without calling room service! elevators are the smallest i have ever seen. my 3 children, my wife and i and our 2 bags could not fit on the elevator. when we were ready to check out the elevator came by 8 times before we could get down to the lobby. speaking of the lobby. it is also the smallest i have ever been in. hotel smelled old and mildewy. staff is unfriendly. wasted my money and had a terrible experience. would NEVER recommend this hotel

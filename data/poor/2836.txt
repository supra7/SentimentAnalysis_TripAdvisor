I stayed at the W in November 2010. firstly they put me in a room where the heater kept making a hissing noise, took a while to get my room changed but did eventually. Fell asleep jet lagged one afternoon and woke up to an employee in my room. SHot up in bed and he looked surprised and stammered "sorry, i was just checking the tea" then he goes to the mini bar apologising throughout while I felt very bewildered just watching from the bed. he leaves and apologises again, and I go back to sleep thinking it weird. I wake up that night and go to get my wallet to buy dinner but my wallet wasnt there. I had it when i was dropped off at the hotel (tipped the driver) so i didnt lose it. All of my other stuff was on the table - blackberry, laptop etc. The wallet had about $200 in it and 10. Told management and they initiated an investigation. This was fri night but they werent able to speak to the employee until tuesday as he wasnt on shift and wouldnt answer his phone. management get back to me on wednesday and say that the employee was very upfront and admitted to being in the room (against policy to be in the room while a guest is asleep - imagine if i were a female - i would feel a lot more vulnerable) but that he didnt see me in the bed - which is impossible. When you first enter you see a wall and you turn left and the first thing you see is the bed. They said that he had been working there for 10 years and they trusted him. I replied if he had been working there for 10 years you would think he would have the experience to tell the difference between someone in bed or not.

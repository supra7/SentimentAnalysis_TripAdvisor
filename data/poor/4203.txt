In today's era of service focus and healthy lifestyles affirmation, it is unbelievable that this aspiring "upscale" trendy oriented Hilton has such an outdated gym/fitness policy. Closes at 10pm no exceptions. That may have been the norm a decade ago, but now days most hotels of this size and caliber are understanding trends in lifestyles and consumer needs and offering 24hr key pass access. But obviously this hotel is either clueless or just does not care. As a HHonors gold member, this has been one of my worst experiences and would never stay here again. There are much better options to choose from!

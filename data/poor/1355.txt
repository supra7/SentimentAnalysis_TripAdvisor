We arrived to a reception area full of guests sitting with their luggage and a long queue. The people at the front of the queue were told they would be staying at another hotel miles away in Muswell Hill as the hotel was full despite them having pre booked. When we got served we were told the same thing, the guy on the desk was grinning when he was telling people without a care in the world and being incredibly rude with no apology whatsoever. When we questioned him about it he became even more rude refusing to even show us on a map where this over hotel would be. It turned out everyone in reception area with their luggage was waiting for minibuses to ferry them to different hotels. The hotel we were sent to was miles away from where we needed to be costing us extra expense in travel though the staff there were at least helpful and friendly. The next day over breakfast I was told by a member of staff at the hotel that Central Park Hotel purposely overbook by around 50 people a day and had been for nearly 3 years now. Guests think they are staying in Finsbury Park but are sent over to hotels when they arrive, he was shocked it was happening and told me that 8 other guests had also stayed there that night who had booked in at the Central Park Hotel and this was a regular occurrence. I think it is disgusting this is happening and would urge people to avoid booking at the Central Park Hotel as you will be sent to another hotel miles away, spoken to rudely and left very disappointed!!

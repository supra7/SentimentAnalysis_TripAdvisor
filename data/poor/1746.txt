Should have listened to the reviews, but we didnt. Weve been coming to OC all our lives,and we know about the old hotels. We expected old but not filthy. The pillow cases had not been washed, mold in the shower, mold on the ceiling where someone splashed what looked like mac and cheese, it looked like the room door had been kicked in at one time by the large dent at the knob, the 'sleeper sofa' was so dirty and stained that i was afraid to sit on it let alone open up to allow my son to sleep on it. The one bright point was that when we left without spending the night, the gentleman at the desk was polite. we are going to dispute the charges with our credit card company.

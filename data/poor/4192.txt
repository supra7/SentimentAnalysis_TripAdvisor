My experience at this Sheraton was exactly the same as my experience at the Sheraton in Newport Beach, after a long drive (3 hours plus), I pull into Valet and get informed that there will be a $25 charge to Valet, I'm like what? I am over paying for the room as it is!. Then there is only one person at the front desk to check in a line of 5 people as I walked in. Front desk guy very professional and checks me in, very helpful and polite. I get to my room, its clean nothing exceptional, wanted to lesson to some tune while I unpacked, forgot my ipod in the car so I turned on the t.v, Get this $4 to hear music on the set for 2 hours, go to get in the shower, all good, till I go to dry off, the towels felt like sandpaper. it actually hurt to dry off. so, went to up my laptop to check emails, guess what another fee, $12.95 for 12 hours. my point to all this is this Hotel Chain nickel and dimes you to death after you pay more for a room that many, may other hotels just as nice or nicer provides at a much fairer price. Very Disappointing

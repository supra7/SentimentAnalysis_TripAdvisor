My husband and I came to Maui for our 2nd honeymoon. I booked this resort because after reading all the nice reviews and seeing pictures online made me feel like this was the best resort to book! However first day we check in..parking was a problem! We drove around for 10 minutes trying to find a parking! Don't get me wrong..workers @ Westin are very friendly and very helpful. But the rooms are small!! We booked an ocean view room and when I went to look at our view.. It was nothing but palm trees!! I wad pretty bummed!! The sheets are not fully clean.. There are little bugs crawling around. My husband was getting btten by those little critters! Our toilet was broken! The fridge kept leaking..the pillows weren't comfy. Every morning I would wake up with neck pains. All I know is we are definitely not staying here ever again!!

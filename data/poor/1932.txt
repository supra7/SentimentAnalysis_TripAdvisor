Stayed at the hotel on Sept 30th for a night on the town with my boyfriend for his birthday. We checked in around 2pm - check in is at 3pm - but thought maybe our room was ready. Had to wait in a huge line for 20 minutes just to ask if a room was ready. There wasn't one. But we were told we could pay for our room then and come back after 3pm to get our room keys - which we were told would be easier for us. Came back around 4pm and had to wait in another long line. More than 20 minutes this time. They had 2 people working the front desk on a Saturday, which we also found was a day the hotel was fully booked. You'd think they'd prepare for a 100% occupancy day with more staff - especially for the price you pay. Our room was like a closet. We could barely move around. Very old style. Only think modern in the room was the duvet comforter. All night we could hear other room doors slam. That's just they way the doors close apparently. Called Guest Services and no one ever answered. Housekeeping came in around 8am when we were still sleeping. Check out was another nightmare. Took forever. Had to wait for 25 minutes for valet to get our car as well. Never will return, not even if we were offere a comp stay. Very overrated hotel. Plenty of other lux hotels in the area more worth it. You do not get what you pay for at this hotel. Its almost a joke.

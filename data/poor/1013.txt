Everything about this experience was negative. The staff were incompetent. Despite paying for specific bedding requirements, the staff presented a quaint bunk bed and trundle bed configuration which was exactly the point of my paying an additional cost, which was not refunded. There was no tv reception. This "hotel" was the worst, most delapidated, ramshackled, eye-sore I have ever had the misfortune of staying in. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.

I will never stay at this place again. The photo's in their listing are very misleading, the room I was in doesn't even come near resembling the one in the picture. The Room in MAJOR need of updating. The matress was old and sagging EVERYWHERE, the carpet was dirty, the paint on the walls peeling. The bath tub was mildewy, and rust stained, the light fixture was wired in with the wire running up the wall across the cieling, and over to the fixture. The light fixture was held together with Masking tape. The mirror in the bathroom was broken on the edges in several places, leaving sharp edges easy to cut yourself on. The tv was plugged in using a long, thin extension cord over to the other wall. They lock the gates at 11pm so you can't get your car out of the garage, and you have to buzz to get onto the property to get to your room. Over all this is one of the WORST hotels I've ever stayed in.

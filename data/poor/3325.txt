At our day of our arrival, the hotel turned out to be overbooked. We had a reservation, but we had to move an other Thompson hotel. At first the girl told us that it was our mistake, later they assured us that it was the mistake of the booking company, but in the end, after a lot of calls and arguments, it turned out that it was just the mistake of the hotel. That room was more expensive and we had to take a taxi to the wallstreet area. Besides that i don't like that part of New York, this hotel didn't have a swimming pool. We choose the LES Thompson hotel because it had a swimming pool. My father doesn't walk that well, so if we went shopping, he could spend some time at the pool. After the first night at the other Thompson hotel, we could check in after 3/4 AM. Happy about finally be at the hotel we would spend 4 nights, we were looking forward to take a referessing jump in the pool. Only this wasnt possible because there was a private party at the pool. 2 days later the pool was again not available of another private party!!! And the internet was down too! By checking in I had to pay a average roomprice of about $260. For 3 nights they charged my credit card for $1340. They assured us that the deposit of $150 a night ($450) would be payed back to me after checking out. After checking out they told us the samen and i would have the money back on my credit card back right away. A month and several expensive phonecalls, a lot of promisses to fix it and call me back, I still didn't get the money back. They even didn't call me back a single time or replied to my emails. Oh and don't order drinks at the pool. We ordered a cup of coffee, a mineral water and a orange juice and had to pay 45$. We had to pay 2 times the service tax and the gratuity, because brought it two time (first the juice and the water, and later the coffee). The most funny part was that the waiter asked for an extra tip!

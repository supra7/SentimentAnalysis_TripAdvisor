We were scheduled to stay in the Soniat House in mid July for 2 nights and called to cancel the week before and was unable to do so. More than 48 hours was given and still we were charged for one night's stay. The hotel looks quaint and I would have loved to stay there yet with this type of customer service I will bring my business somewhere else when visiting New Orleans. Disatified in Tampa!

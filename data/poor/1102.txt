Checked in around midnight for one night stay in August 2011. Room was freezing cold with air conditioning that would not stop. Staff member came and supposedly "fixed" it. Woke up at 3:30am with room at 87 degrees and hot air pouring out. Another staff member came and said first staff member did not fix it right - duh! Room took well over an hour to cool off because even once AC came on fan would only run on low. All this on top of hotel under construction and staff very pokey. Would never return period.

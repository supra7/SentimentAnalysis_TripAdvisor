What can I say, the W Hotel has seriously gone downhill. THe W Hotel Lexington is really such a disappointment. W Hotels I've stayed in in the past have always been modern and interesting. But not the Lexington W, it looked and felt like a total "has been". The bar and lobby area were still pretty busy but the rooms were awful. At around $400 a night my room was extremely cramped, but worse it felt dirty, run down, stained and falling apart. It was seriously in need of a refurbishment. It just wasn't a room you wanted to come back to. Seriously, if you can avoid it don't bother with this W hotel. I moved out after a couple of days and found something much better for the same price.

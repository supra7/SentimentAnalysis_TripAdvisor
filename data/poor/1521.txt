Our family of five had a reservation for a 4 night stay. Arrived at 1pm, check in is at 4pm so the room was not ready but the woman said it might be in 45 minutes so we opted to wait. Had lunch by the pool, the food was good. Went back to the desk to check on the status of our room...another woman called housekeeping and told us the suite was still not ready so we decided to head to WDW. Even told the woman at the desk that we would not be back until 10-11pm and she said "no problem". When we got back at 11pm, THEY HAD GIVEN OUR ROOM AWAY AND WERE COMPLETELY BOOKED!! We had been up since 5am to catch our plane and had three children in the car ready to go to sleep. WorldQuest had found us a place to stay at a hotel 10 minutes away...a two bedroom suite rather than the three bedroom suite we had booked with them. So, we had no choice but to go to the other hotel and eventually settled in at 1am!! What a start to our vacation and needless to say, we never went back to the WorldQuest Resort. Why would we want to stay at a resort that does not honor their reservations...and we had even checked in (with two different people)! They did pay for our first night at the alternate resort but that did not make up for their front desk and management's incompetence. I cannot say enough bad words about this resort.

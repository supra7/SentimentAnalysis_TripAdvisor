Long time Las Vegas traveler and very disappointed with Harrahs. Booked 3 remodeled Premium rooms for a 5 night family reunion. All three rooms were dirty, bathrooms had mold, and the view was horrible. Hallway carpets were torn and walls desperately in need of paint and repair. Arrived by 4pm but did not get any of the room types requested when booked through Travelocity. Overheard some Casino employees stating Travelocity bookings get what they get. Requested 2 smoking rooms, one with King and one with 2 Queens, and a non-smoking with King. Got 3 non-smoking rooms with 2 Queen beds instead. Was told at check-in shouldn't be a problem to get the rooms requested the next day. Next morning wasted 2 hours trying to change Premium rooms. Even after complaining about the filthy rooms, they were unable to provide the room types booked, and there was no offer of compensation for the filth. Decided to pay $600 to upgrade to 3 Jr. Suites. Still couldn't get any smoking rooms. The hotel confirmed all 3 suites would be ready by 4pm, but when we went to change rooms, only 2 suites were available. Talked to the Manager, but was only able to get an 11th floor Premium non-smoking room for a smoker. It was better than looking at rooftop air handlers, but had to listen to jackhammers during the day at the pool and loud music until 2am from the outdoor bar at night. The 2 Jr. Suites were nice and clean. If you like cold showers these rooms are for you. Bath water was hot, but when you turn on the shower the water turns cold. The suites were on different floors but the water issue was the same in both suites. Gamble at Harrahs, don't stay there.

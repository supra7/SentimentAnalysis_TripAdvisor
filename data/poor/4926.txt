First af all the ac seems to work only in the livingroom. If you are in a wheelchair the bed is to high to transfer, the chair doesn't fit in the restroom and has no hand rails, can't reach the sick to wash hands and brush teeth, and the tub not good for people in a wheelchair. It has wheelchair accesible parking in front of room but no ramp. Ice machine not working. People there need to check hotels in the area maybe the circus Circus restroom.

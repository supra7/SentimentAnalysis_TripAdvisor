I was in Seattle for 7 nights and I asked the Alexis Hotel to assign me a Quiet room. They assigned me Room 521, which is a little bit away from the Elevator. What they don't tell you is that the Quiet rooms face an Alley way, where a dumpster truck comes 3 times a week at 11 PM and creates a racket for about half an hour! Not very good when you are trying to get over your jet lag and resting before important business meetings the next morning. Also, the same alley way has a club of some sort and you can hear the noise from there as well. Perhaps they need to put better sound proofing on their windows. There is a building facing the hotel on the opposite side so if you choose lower floors you might find the view obstructed. Decor was dated. Also a warning for women travellers .. The hotel is on 1st Avenue which is not a good road to be walking in alone at night Overall a pretty bad experience for $276 a night.

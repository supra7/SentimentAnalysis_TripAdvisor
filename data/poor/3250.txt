They say '1 hour in a casino = 6 months of passive smoke'. Nothing could be more true about Encore. Forget the glamor for a moment and Encore has glamor. Is it worth it risking your health (if you are a non-smoker), your time, your hard-earned money, and your sanity to stay and gamble at the most 'glamorous' casino on the strip? No matter what anyone says, it wasn't worth it. Avoid Encore - it's just like every other casino on the strip and a zebra will never change it's stripes.

no way ! 325 usd room only rate for so small rooms and dirty towels ! no way ! we stayed at san martins lane at london and enjoyed a lot , that's way we choose to stay another ian shragger hotel in sf . sorry but even Asia de Cuba was a failure . dont stay there if you are a couple and if you have more than 2 luggages . the only nice thing was the famous redwood room bar which was packed every night and has a great ambiance. location is great but again there are many other alternatives in the same area.

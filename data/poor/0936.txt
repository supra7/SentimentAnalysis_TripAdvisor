This place is not a resort even through they charge a $25 resort fee, there is nothing to do here, they have "Resort Actives" listed on the website but if you click on it, you will notice that it tells you what you can do in Key West, as for the ones they say they have onsite, they are really ran by another company and you get a discount on everything but nothing is free, as a matter of fact, the pool towels are in your room and if your room is short a towel, it is a $25 charge per towel. Speaking of the pools, they close at sunset, along with the cafe and tiki bar. The rooms are only good for sleeping, no chairs, I'm sorry there is one. There is no beach, just some sand outside and I have yet to see water because of the over grown trees and garden...yes yet, because I am at the Parrot Key as I type...wish I could get out of tomorrow's stay...the place is cute, but trust me you will be more happy as a cheaper chain or a B&B.

What a bad place to stay , go spend it somewhere else!!!! I booked two nights and two rooms for my 2 sisters and our 78 year old mother for two nights. We also had three children with us. This Inn was recommended four years ago by Sunset Magazine,an article that my mom had kept filed. We were all so disappointed by the experience at the Marina Inn.It just looks neglected, front entrance light broken and the service was pathetic.The breakfast was hard boiled eggs and packaged muffins.We all walked up three blocks to Union St. to a wonderful French bakery .The small tomb feeling rooms were so small , echoing sounds were heard all night by the elevator noise and people talking from other rooms. The rooms are very dated and depressing . We did not want to come back to this Inn, when our day was done. Next time we will spend more money for a better hotel, which we usually do when we visit the city. Live and Learn.

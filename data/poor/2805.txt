the room was awful~ it was tiny, dusty, cold. the amenities and location of the hotel may be its redeeming quality. and there's no way for you to turn off the a/c or air vent so throughout the night, the thing would be humming its merry way. if you don't mind walking around NYC, i'd say pick a better hotel unless you can shell out a hundred more to upgrade to a larger room.

We were very dissappionted with this hotel. The first room they gave us was flooded when we walked in so they had to give us another one. There were three beds in the room plus a camp bed stood against the wall. and the curtains were hanging off and badly stained. The wooden floor was badly marked with large gaps out of it and the bathroom was so dirty we couldnt have a shower. I would strongly urge avoidance of this hotel.

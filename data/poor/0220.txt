If you are thinking of booking a room at this hotel, JUST DON'T DO IT!!! I traveled to Seattle with 3 work colleagues for a seminar. We booked our room through Priceline, asking for a 3-star hotel in downtown Seattle, and got reservations at the Renaissance (supposedly a 4-star hotel). What a disaster! Half of us got rooms on the I-5 freeway side of the building. The noise there was so bad (large container trucks rumbling by all night) that we had to switch rooms. Even earplugs didn't help block out the noise. The rooms were also pretty shabby, with scratched up, damaged furniture. When we complained to the management and asked to switch rooms, they told us that the Priceline rooms were discounted rooms, so we shouldn't expect the same quality as "full paying guests"!!! We ended up having to pay an extra $25 per night just to get adequate rooms. The other half of my group got rooms on the other side of the hotel. There was construction going on from early in the morning until quite late at night. These rooms were also terribly noisy, but earplugs at least cut out much of that noise. The staff acted like complaints from guests about not being able to sleep because of the noise was old news that they didn't want to hear about. They acted indignant that we would dare to complain and were extremely rude and dismissive. Also, the ice machines were broken on most floors (we had to search 3 floors to find a working one) and there was no attempt to fix them. There was no minibar or even a mini refrigerator in the rooms. There was a spot where the refigerator used to be be, but they had removed them all. The Renaissance bills itself as a 4-star hotel. If that rating is based solely on the hotel lobby, I'd give it 3 stars. Based on the shabby rooms, the noise, the lack of service, and the rude staff, I would be stretched to give it 1 star! We will never stay at a Renaissance Hotel again!!!

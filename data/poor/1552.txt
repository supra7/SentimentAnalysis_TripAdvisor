OMG, where do you start..extensive mold in the showers, rude and inept staff, horrible food, sheets with burn holes in them, leftover food under the beds, water leaks, filthy carpet, inadequate maid service. Lobby looks fabulous, but that must be about the only portion of the hotel they keep up for appearances.

My wife and I stayed in room 10203. The room was tiny, the view was horrible but even worse, the room was incredibly noisy. There was obviously some kind of plumbing problem and we got woken up at 5:45 a.m. 2 days in a row when the person in an adjacent room took a shower. It resulted in an extremely loud shrieking noise. I have experienced anything quite like that. To make matters worse, there is a steep charge for the fitness center. I will never stay at this hotel again, at any price.

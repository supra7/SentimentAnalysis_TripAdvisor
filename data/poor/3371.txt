I have stayed at this hotel in previous years with no problems. It has never been the most cleanest or new Holiday Inn I have stayed in, but has always been exceptable considering the price. Unfortunately this year the conditions are much worse. So bad that I wanted to leave. We almost did not have a room that had been reserved for a year prior, and when we got to the room it had obviously not even cleaned. Hair in the bathroom and a filthy bathroom floor, a visibly dirty kitchen area. Carpeting that had not been vacuumed and a horrible gnat problem. In my opinion this hotel needs to be cleaned and updated or use some TNT and start new. I do not recommend staying here unless you come armed with disinfectants and a high tolerance to substandard conditions.

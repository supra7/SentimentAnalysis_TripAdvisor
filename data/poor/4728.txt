I wonder if the reviewers stayed at the same place we did this past weekend. We booked at last minute so this was all that was available that did not cost over $200.00. so we weren't expecting a luxury hotel. But for $107 per night, we expected to have a clean room with a hot shower. The room was not exactly filthy but not exactly clean. The shower took a long time to heat up and had very little pressure. The sink was out in the sleeping area, which was also very small. There were red stains on the carpet which I hope was paint not blood. There was a burn hole in the bedspread. We had planned to stay 2 nights but decided during dinner that we weren't staying the second night. Fortunately we only live an hour away. This would be OK if the price was $50-$60 but not $107, its basically just a place to sleep.

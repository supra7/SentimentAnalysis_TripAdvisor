My experience at this hotel was extremely disappointing. We were greeted upon our arrival by protestors outside the hotel with a giant inflatable rat. The restaurant under "renovation" had actually been closed by the health department because of a rat problem. There was a health department closure notice posted inside the hotel. By the third day of our stay (our departure day) I had started to break out with red itchy welts all over my legs. When it finally dawned on me that they were bed bug bites I attempted to contact the manager on three different occaisions. He was gone for the day, at lunch, and in a meeting. I can only assume that the management of this hotel is totally indifferent to the concerns of their guests. I just wanted some assurance that the hotel would take care of the problem so no one else would have to experience the misery of these bites. The hotel is in a great location but I would not recommend it to anyone!!!

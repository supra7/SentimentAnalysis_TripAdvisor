DO NOT STAY AT HARRAHS!!! We were robbed in our room at night while we were asleep!! I had my purse stolen, along with my glasses, digital camera, cell phone, credit cards. My husband had his ATM card and cash stolen. ALL WHILE WE SLEPT. The next morning we complained to hotel management and security, none of whom seemed to even care. They fed us a meal but that was about it. We were told there was only 1 security guard on duty at the time. When we got home, we complained to the CEO of Harrahs. He said he'd "investigate" meaning he'd have their third party claims adjuster call us. They have completely denied any claim. We are still losing sleep over this and have suffered mentally as a result. We will NEVER stay there again.

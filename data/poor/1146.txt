Travelled for work reasons and just needed somewhere to sleep for the night after a late train into St. Pancreas. Location is the only thing positive about this hotel, I of course knew what to expect at a travelodge as spent many nights at various travelodges throughout the country but this was in my opinion the worst I have ever been in! Check in was basic, the lady didn't really care about giving good customer service. We were on the ground floor and the corridor had a stale smell of smoke as did our room. Across from our room was a huge hole in the wall and not even an attempt to cover the hole temporarily. Like I said our room smelt of stale smoke but we were so tired just wanted to go to sleep. The mirror was cracked, and the room just felt tired! Our air con machine decided to constantly make a noise but luckily we were there exhausted it didn't stop us from sleeping, but could imagine it would really irritate other people! Also the traffic outside of the hotel is really noisy and near a fire station so constantly hearing emergency services driving by. Check out the same lady didn't really care or ask us if we had a nice stay so was very glad to leave this hotel...would never stay here again!

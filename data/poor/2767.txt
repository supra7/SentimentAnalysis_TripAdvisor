Service was unprofessional, my account was debited 700 dollar too much, and no explanation for that. Me and my friend "upgraded" first, but we ask to get our "deluxe" room after we saw that "upgraded" room. Bad "deluxe" room was better than that "junior suite" and its crappy sofa bed. My door key end of working cause our room was not paid (??), and still they have overcharged me 700 dollar (as well as my friends). Finally they said that I cant get my room key because of "security reasons", what the f**k! Bathroom was broken, air conditioner was too loud and room was not cleaned up, there was towels, duvet etc. for two, and after several request we got one duvet more (and after tens of towels, blankets, bedsheets etc). So, there is plenty of good hotels in NYC, this is not one of those.

Stayed here for the first time a couple of weeks ago for one night. I can only describe it as a Hotel from hell. On arrival the male receptionist was on his mobile chatting to presumably friends. He took no interest in my custom. The lift to the rooms was so dark it is a health and safety hazard. My room was hot. Air con unit was out of order. Impossible to open the window. Very stuffy and unpleasant. Only one pillow supplied in the room. When I asked the male receptionist for an extra pillow he said they had none spare! No telephone in the room. If you want to make a call you have to use your mobile. The tv has limited channels. Why there is no skynews and other freeview channels etc is beyond my understanding. Bathroom was dirty. Toilet flush handle was loose. Door handle on the bathroom door was loose. Light fittings next to the bed were all loose. The shower curtain was stained and smelly. Drainage was slow in the shower due to a blockage. Despite a do not disturb sign on the door the cleaner knocked on the door at 8am and 0915. I have emailed customer services about the above but have I received a reply? Short answer is no. Avoid this hotel from hell at all costs and stay elsewhere.

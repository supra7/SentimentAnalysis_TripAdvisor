This hotel claims to be 5 star and its the worst experience we have ever had at a resort of this rating. It started with the hotel not getting us into our room until 6:30PM when we arrived at the hotel at 2PM. They told us to sit in the lobby and our room would be ready in 30 minutes. We were told every 30 minutes from then to wait. We have 4 kids and they were bored to death. When we finally got our room we opened our laptop bag to find out it the screen was cracked and we had just used it in the car on the way to the hotel. So we waited on security to file its report and was told the insurance would take care of it. NOT! Since we have came home we received a letter that said they were not responsible for it. This was a brand new apple laptop and we know the bellman did it. They just acted like they would take care of it to get us off the island. Totally professional!! The grounds of the resort were full of trash. They did not clean the pool grounds the entire time we were there. We were at the pool everyday. The room had ants in it and they were very small. I will never stay at this resort again and its a shame. Last of all the food is way over priced and is comparable to some cheap fast food place. My advice is to stay somewhere else and don't fall for the 5 star rating when its not.

Rooms are dirty, old, never cleaned and totally different from the pictures you can see on their website. Bathroom is disgusting, rooms are very small, dirty and they never change sheets. There is no telephone, phon, bedside table, I travel a lot, but I would never imagine that such a kind of "hotel" could exist!!!! S T A Y A W A Y

Thankfully we only stayed one night at the Hotel Seattle. Our room was an absolute disgrace.....very tatty witha layer of dust on most furniture. The bathroom had to be seen to be believed. The bath was old with ingrained dirt, the sink wobbled and leaked at the base. The floor tiles had a few decades ago seen better days. The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in. Whilst the location is handy for many of the tourist sights, it is not the best area to wander around at night and we felt quite uneasy doing so. I wish I had consulted Trip Advisor before staying there. Stay away!

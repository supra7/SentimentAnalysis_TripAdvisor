The rooms in the hotel were nice and clean and the pool area was relaxing but that is where anything good about this hotel stops.... The rudest staff we have ever encountered in all of our travels, we were woken up at 6:30am by a loud speaker blaring in our room that "There is an emergency in the hotel, get out immediately, do not take the elevators, use the stairs only". Everyone on our floor had to go down 23 flights of stairs, some people elderly and some panicked, only to find out that it was a false alarm. When we all walked over together and addressed security, they literally laughed in our faces. I could go on and on about little things that we dealt with, with the staff. Also the localtion of the Stratosphere is at the south end of the strip, in a seedy area and a good mile and half from the center of the activity. We loved are time in Vegas but would NEVER stay at the Stratosphere again.

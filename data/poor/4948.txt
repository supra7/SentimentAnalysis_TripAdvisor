Me and myhusband exchanged out Fairfield Share Plus points to stay a week at this hotel and at first we were happy to be able to get VEGAS but after we arrived we see why there was availablity. This hotel was the dumps and it was full of senior citizens who acted like they were so happy to be there. This is no lie when the offerd continental breakfast one morning the line was out of the building. We thought they must have been serving something good but when we got inside all they had was one bagel in a sandwich bag and cream cheese. People were actually stuffing the bagels inside their pockets to get more than one. It was the worst place I have ever stayed. We complied and was given our week back and we in turn went and paid to stay at another resort. If I am going on vacation I at least expect the accomadations to be on the same level as I have at home or better not worse. There was rust in the toilet and bath tub and the carpet was worn and smelled like mildew. There was window a/c's like we were still in the 70's. The entire place was just in need of serious renovation.

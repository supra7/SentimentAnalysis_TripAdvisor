My mother and I booked a room with 2 double beds at the beginning of May for our stay at the beginning of July. We were a bit dubious after seeing the rate of $40 per night, but we had positive experiences staying there when it was still the Radisson so we decided to give it a shot. When we arrived, the front desk clerk informed us that they didn't have a room with 2 double beds available and they could only offer us a room with a queen or a king. Irritated, we pulled out the confirmation we had printed when we booked it that said we had a confirmed reservation. The sassy clerk (who didn't even have a name tag on so we could report her to the manager) told us that she couldn't do anything except stand there and keep telling us that she couldn't give us the room we wanted. She didn't even seem remotely interested in trying to find an alternate solution for us and told us to call the manager, who conveniently wasn't there. Needless to say we will never be staying here again, regardless of how convenient it is. This hotel has gone downhill since it became Regency Inn and Suites.

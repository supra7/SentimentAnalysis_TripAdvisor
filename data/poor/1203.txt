We read the reviews, but didn't head the warnings. We were traveling with a large group (29) and needed rooms that accommodated families of five. We booked in April for August. A month after we all received our confirmations, the hotel sent e-mails t three families in our party stating their credit cards would not process. One family did not respond within 24hrs (responded within 48hrs.) and lost their room . Since they were a family of five and those rooms were gone they had to book two rooms in order to stay with the rest of our group. Two weeks before we were going two families got the same credit card notice, but took care of it promply. Upon arrival they had a room for everyone BUT my family. They said they had moved us to a different hotel. When we explained our frustrations, they literaaly laughed. They wanted us to walk to the new hotel to boot. I refused, so they put us in a taxi after much arguing. So 4 out of 29 people traveling together to Europe from America were separated from the group. Although we got a suite in the new hotel, neither hotel was anything to speak. We paid the same rate as we had booked, but our new hotel did not accept credit cards so we had to pay cash. Never again! Please head the warnings

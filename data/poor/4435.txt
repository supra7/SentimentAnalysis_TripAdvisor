My husband and I travel to Vegas 4 times a year. We stayed at the Strat in Sept. of 2005 and we considered it average. We stayed again this past weekend and it was terrible. We were in town for the concerts at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. The neighborhood is VERY dangerous at night. We stayed in a suite 6/21-6/24 and it was very worn. We had to call the front desk in the evening because we had a "special smell" coming from a room on our floor. Not a classy hotel at all. When we left I asked my husband if he would stay there for free and he said they would have to give him money to stay there, You don't even get what you pay for! We love The Orleans, Monte Carlo, TI, Bellagio, and Mandalay Bay.

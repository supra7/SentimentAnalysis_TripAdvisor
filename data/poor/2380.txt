My wife and I stayed at the hotel May 16 thru the 21 of 2006 I had read all the bad reviews before we went and we talked with are travel agent about the problems with the hotel. She called Classic Vactions whom they use to book the trip with and asked about the hotel and the things we read about. They assure us that this is a vey nice hotel and not to read to much into the bad reviews. Well guess what, the reviews we read were right and they were wrong. The hotel room we got smelled bad, the wall paper was coming off, and the partial ocean view was of a golf course with a utility shed. I called are travel agent and left a message, because of the 6 hour time difference, about how all the bad reviews we read were right. Thankfully, the next day, she was able to have us move from room 208, which if you are facing the ocean is on the left side of the hotel, to room 416. We had a better veiw and the room was in a little better shape. The decor of the rooms is very out-dated, but most of all the rooms need to be remodeled badly. As for the hotel staff the valet guys were very nice and helpful, but after we got are room changed the staff at the front desk didn't seem as friendly as they were when we had arrived. So my advise, I would pick somewhere else to stay, because not only of the run down hotel rooms, also because you are pretty far south and there isn't much around as far as places to eat. Oh by the way gas is or at least it was 3.66 a gallon. But if you don't mind the run down rooms, or the very high price restaurant and driving 20 to 40 minutes to see or do anything, and have the bucks to blow this is the place for you.

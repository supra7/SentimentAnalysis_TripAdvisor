Talk about beind deceived!!! We booked our trip based on the lovely photos of this hotel posted ont he web! I would certainally like to see the room where they took these pics, cause it couldn't been at this hotel. The rooms were your typical cheap hotel rooms....2 very hard beds, a cheap swamp cooler & a very funky smell For the price, I could have dealt with this, but taking a 2 minute shower because the tub wouldn't drain totally ruined it for me. Had we not already booked & paid for the rooms, I would have ran as fast as my feet could have taken me!!!!! I only wish I would have taken a camera with me so I could have posted pictures for all to see...... Only stay here if you love the Ghetto!!

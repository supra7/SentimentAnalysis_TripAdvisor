How could someone enjoy this place? It looks nice from the outside.. Inside, no. the room is clean..but lacking. One pan, 3 plates, & one bowl in the "kitchen". The stairways are gross. Overflowing trashcans in the halls. Smells odd. Internet speed is a joke. No storage space to think of. Keeping a lookout for bugs.. The towels are crappy, bed uncomfortable. I thought I paid to stay at a hotel, not a homeless shelter. Never again!

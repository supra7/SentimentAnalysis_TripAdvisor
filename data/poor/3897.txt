We are mid way through a one week stay and are really disappointed. We have stayed at Sheratons in many different locations and the normal feeling is low key luxury with an accent on customer service. Sadly the Maui property scores low on either. We attempted to have breakfast in house the first day, too many customers, too few seats, too few staff all of whom seemed stressed. We went to the bar by the beac, I was served beer in a plastic cup with a hole in it that spilled into my lap, the server reluctantly replaced it with the comment 'you will dry off quick' hilarious eh? We had some fruit but realized that there was No cutlery, no plates not even a spoon in our room so we called and asked for something to eat off, the response? It will take an hour we are very busy and there will be a $4 charge for delivery! Pretty ordinary when you are paying hundreds of dollars per night and you are a SPG member. This is a beautiful location but we can not believe how under resourced and lacking in basic amenities the rooms are. Look elsewhere if you are coming to Maui. Ron & Lyn

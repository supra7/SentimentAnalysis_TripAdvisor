Within 15 minutes of checking into our room we kept hearing a loud banging noise. I went back to the front desk and informed the lady that this would be unacceptable. She then referred me to her manager (Michael) who told me they could move us to another room for $90 per night, otherwise we would just have to live with the noise. We had already payed a premium for an ocean view room and I felt this was an excessive increase just to get a quiet nights sleep. Michael promised to investigate the noise and get back to me. That was the last we heard from him. Not to mention, the bed was the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in. We booked our trip through the Auto club of southern california. I will never do that again, nor will we be staying at the Maui Prince next November when we return to the Island. Several people whom we met in Oahu had nothing good to say about the Maui Prince, so it seems that their reputation already has been tarnished. Shame on you Maui Prince and the Auto Club for not knowing better.

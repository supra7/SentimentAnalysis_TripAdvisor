Was at the Frenchman Hotel July 5-6, 2008. My experience was horrible. We had two rooms and neither one of them had air conditioning when we arrived. This time of year is HOT in New Orleans. One of the units was fixed but the other never was. In the room without air, the ceiling fan failed to work as well. This room did not have a mirror on the bathroom wall. The manager was nice enough but the desk clerk was rude and not very considerate consider the mess that we walked into. On the brighter side, the furniture is beautiful and the rooms, although very tiny and cramped, were decorated nicely. The bathrooms were tiny and cramped. For all of this, I feel like the Frenchman was overrated and overpriced. It will not be on my agenda for my next stay in New Orleans..

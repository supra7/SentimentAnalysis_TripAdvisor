We have been on a roadtrip in California, Nevada and Arizona. This hotel is our worst ecperience. We booked this hotel, like all of our hotels, through a travel agent earlier this year and we were supposed to stay here for two nights. We leaved after 2 hours! The room was small, looked old and smelled horrible. It was obvious that the room had not been cleaned, because we found dead cockroaches on the floor next to our bed. The bathroom was also very small and definetely needs an update! If you want to take a shower, you have to shower in either ice cold water og extremely hot water. We booked another hotel in Phoenix, Radisson Hotel Phoenix City Center, and we were very pleased with that.

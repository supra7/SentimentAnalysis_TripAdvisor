Very small room - so small there was no where to put a suitcase. The airconditioner sounded like a train so I couldnt get any sleep because it was too hot without it. The windows did not open, even an inch. The carpet was torn and very dirty. The water was brown, yes brown. We were told it "was the city water". Hmmm, I go to NYC every couple of months and have never had brown water in a hotel in 5 year. I chose this hotel based on the W reputation. This was my first experience in a W. Based on this, I will pass. The room was not any cheaper than the other nicer hotels in the area. No one from my company will be staying here ever again.

At some overpriced hotels, at least the employees pretend like they care about their jobs. Not here. We paid for an oceanview king room. We got a view of a lawn or maybe is was a tennis court under construction instead. This place still hires and keeps the kind of employees who look you up and down before they decide if they will allow you to eat at their restaurants. We must not have passed muster with the stuffy, bitter woman who guarded the entry to the restaurant, because first she told us that reservations were required, then told us that we could not make reservations for another 1 1/2 hours. This was at 7:00 PM even though the restaurant was not even half full. When I said we could eat at the bar, as we had the night before, she said no, we wouldn't like that food either. Then she said we should eat at the Japanese restaurant downstairs instead. We did, and it was an excellent meal, but I almost choked when the bill came- $91.00 for just two people. I should've done an end run around the stuffy woman and eaten in the bar anyway. Checking out the next morning took over an hour, and I spoke to three desk clerks, before they went into another room to have a conference over my bill. I was so disappointed with what was from the outside a very pretty hotel, with beautiful landscaping. but that couldn't make up for employees who hate their jobs and all of their customers. If I go back to Maui, it'll be to some other hotel.

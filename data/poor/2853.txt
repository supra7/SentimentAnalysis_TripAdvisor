I stayed overnight for a business trip. It was my first experience at a W hotel. The room was nice and I was pleased to find a note from the "manager" saying to call him if I needed anything. The following morning I checked out of the hotel but had one of the bell men hold my bag while I was in a business meeting. I tipped him $3 for the one bag. When I came back from my meeting to pick up the bag there was another customer in front of me that was picking up several items of luggage. Once finished, she gave the bell man (a different one this time) some change. She was a bit cheap for all the help he provided her but his reaction was appalling. As soon as she walked away, he slammed the change on the counter and started storming around cussing under his breath. I had to wait for him to calm down so that I could get my own bag at which time I gave him no tip. As I walked away, he slammed his hand down on the counter. I ended up giving his tip to the guy that called the taxi for me. To make matters worse, I decided to call the "manager" about the situation. The "manager" turned out to be a recording where you could leave messages. I left a message and got a very un-heartfelt email apology reply later on from what seemed like an email reply center. I won't be staying there again. There are way too many hotels I've stayed at in NYC with better service.

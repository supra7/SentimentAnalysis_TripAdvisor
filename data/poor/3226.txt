My significant other and I are very busy physicians and we plan our vacations long in advance to make sure everything is just right when we finally manage to get time off together. I had booked my stay at the encore king suite with panoramic views several weeks in advance and requested an early check in. They said it shouldn't be a problem. When we got there, we wond up waiting over 4 hours for our room. It wasn't even ready at 3, which is there check in time. We spoke to the manager and he was actually rude. I've never been treated like that before or had such a hard time checking into a hotel before. I travelled 12hrs to spend 18hrs in vegas. I spent 4 of those hours in the Encore lobby waiting dor my room. Even worse, they charged my card for $450/ni, along with an incidental fee of $150, immediately upon my arival...before i could even get a room key.

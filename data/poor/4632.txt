I had spent 3 nights in this hotel with my daughter (2) and husband, and boy was that just about the worst mistake ever. I have stayed in a motel 6 before that was cleaner than this place. Don't let the price fool you. Def. Not worth the money, not to mention don't forget about the valet parking you will end up having to pay for which will run you another 22 dollars a night, you might as well just go down to the holiday inn for the amount of money. Our first night there, the carpets were sooo disguisting it turned our feet black just walking on them, so we wore our shoes the whole time in the room, the coverlets for the beds were stained and gross, who knows what they were stained from, the shower water backed up and filled up the tub in our room so I had to shower in knee deep dirty water, and the heat in our room was not working properly and we froze our buns off most of our stay. Needless to say, we constantly dreaded going back to our hotel every evening. Maybe if I was just in new orleans to party and get drunk this hotel would have been key because I would have been too intoxicated to really care. If you have a family vacay or small children, DO NOT STAY HERE! I GUARANTEE YOU WILL REGRET EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR STAY.

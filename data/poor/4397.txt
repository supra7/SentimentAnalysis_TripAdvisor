The service was incredibly awful. The check-in line was comparable to airport screening, only slower. Apparently the very strict check-out rules do not apply to the Hotel itself at check-in, Because although we arrived at the posted 2:00 check-in time, our room was not ready until 5:00! We waited in the lobby for three hours! When I complained that my stay was now less than fourteen hours, and that I would like an extension of the checkout time as a courtesy, I was told this was not possible unless I paid a $32.00 fee. Very disatisfying.

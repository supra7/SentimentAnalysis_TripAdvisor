Stayed here for business and the place was filthy. Housekeeping here is a joke. There is dust on everything including all the molding, even the bathroom tissue box. There are long hairs on the floor in both the bathroom and bedroom that are way to long to be from me. I highly doubt there was any attempt to vacuum the floor. The age shows with damaged wood and/or peeling paint. The room would look at a lot better after a day or two of touch ups. Would not stay here again. Walls are very thin. Noise from other rooms as well as from the street is quite loud. Location is great but that is about the only positive.

Stayed for two nights. Was encouraged to upgrade to pool view room with balcony . Wasn't told it overlooked the big top band that played until 3 a.m. Stood in line at buffet for 45 minutes because there was one cashier. Housekeeping came at 4:30 p.m. when we were changing to go out for the evening. Said they would be back at 5 p.m. When we got back to the room at 1 a.m. the room was still dirty. No towels to shower with. When we checked out, spoke to the manager on duty. Asked to have the upgrade charges deducted, was told that since we complained "after the fact" he wouldn't do anything. We go to Vegas at least twice a year. Will never stay at Harrah's again.

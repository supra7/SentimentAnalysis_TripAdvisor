The service at the Felix was garbage. The eight rooms that were with our party were a little loud but after we had warnings we lowered the noise volume. They charged us with a cleaning fee ($50) and a fee to clean up vomit ($100), when no one had puked in our room the entire weekend. They wouldn't give us room service, we had to ask for toilet paper and extra towels because they cut off our house keeping. The front desk staff should be working at Burger King rather than an alleged 4 star hotel. They were unprofessional, unfriendly and down right rude to our entire party. We paid good money to stay there and they treated us like we were low life scum. When I wanted to dispute the extra charges they told me to talk to their supervisor which conveniently wasn't there. I have stayed at numerous hotels in Chicago over the years and Felix is by far the worst. Do not give this establishment any business because they do not understand basic hospitality practices.

As I checked in a fight broke out in the front lobby with the bellmen and a drunk man. The room smelled like a wet dog. The carpet, wallpaper, and comforter looked about 30 years old. It was overall a very bad experience. I think the only person that would give this a good rating is someone with very low expectations.

My husband and I have just returned from a six night stay at this hotel. I read reviews before I went, as I booked with hotwire and noticed coments about the wait time for the two lifts. On my stay there was only one lift for five of the days we were there. We only had a note put under our room door once about the problem. Lines for the lift were long and often very crowded when the doors to the lift did open at your floor. We even walked down 25 flights of stairs a few times to avoid the wait. Charlene on the reception desk was very unwelcoming throughout our stay and even gave the wrong computer code to us on the phone. There are comments on here about the plastic cups in the room not being replaced each day, the door to our room had to be forced open by my husband and the bathroom door did not close easily at all. The airconditioning was very old and noisy. These are not new comments, others have remarked about this too. I wonder why people are giving it such good ratings, have they really stayed here? This is not my first trip to NY, we are frequent travellers and I don't like to run places down but the comments I put are true and I am not the first. On a good note, the breakfast had a good selection and was a great start to each day. Here the staff were busy and polite.

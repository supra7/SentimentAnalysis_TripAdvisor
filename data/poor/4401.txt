If any persons on the wolrd would think to save money just because you have to sleep few hours while you're in las vegas, than search for something else, everything you save from hotel room you'll spend on taxi ride to reach las vegas attractive spots. Since you check-in you'll feel not to be welcome, it doesn't matter how long is the line waiting for check-in, it will take around 30 to 60 minutes before is your turn, front desk employee very unprofessional and looks very unhappy to work in this hotel. I book tower room and without explanation she give me room in different block with different quality of furnitures and services, everything here looks very old and consumed after time to time, the casino it seams to be inside of sigars room, if you're non smokers you don't want even spend a minute around the tables, and also when you need to go your room you must pass through all casino and smoke air every where, orrible!!!!. The view restaurant has the baddest service quality of las vegas' restaurants with the most expensive price range for lowest quality of food. Las vegas is beautifull and you can realy enjoy your stay but don't stay at stratosphere if you don't want to go away with bad memory, las vegas does meet all your needs to enjoy your stay so stay anywhere else instead of this hotel. I like to go to las vegas almost every year, and this experience I will never forget as well I will forget the name of this hotel. I suggest to spend little more money and book your hotel 5 stars through hotwire.com, you'll be very well surprise and happy.

We stayed at the Intercontinental for Halloween, and it was probably the scariest thing we saw all weekend. The bell boys were too interested in their personal conversations to help us with our bags, and the front desk also seemed disinterested during check-in. Our hotel room was in terrible shape. No fitted sheets, the shower was barely a dribble of water, there were no washcloths, and the sink handle fell off on our second day. We ordered room service for two, and they proceeded to send us two pieces of toast and two bites of our remaining entrees. The fruit tasted fishy (I don't know how this is even possible). When we called to complain about all of these concerns, the manager simply said she's comp our breakfast. Why she did not offer to fix the shower or the sheets is beyond comprehension. The Intercontinental hotel is no where close to a four star hotel. There are many nicer hotels in the French Quarter. Luckily, we had an amazing time on our trip and were able to laugh off our poor treatment at the Intercontinental, but we will certainly never go back to this hotel.

Two nights with DH here was the last straw - I will not stay at this hotel again. Perfect location for business, but not worth the nonsense. The W New York has confused snobbery with with exclusivity. It seemed like every staff member went out of their way to make us feel like they were doing us a favor to let us stay there. Small room, unusable space, and street noise just aren't worth it.

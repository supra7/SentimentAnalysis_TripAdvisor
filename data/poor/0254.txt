I had to stay at the Sheraton where my company was having a convention. I showed up to the hotel to find out they deleted my reservation. They never apologized for the inconvenience and finally offered me a pull out sofa to sleep on for the night (I declined). The next day I was told by my company event planner that they had a room for me. I went to the front desk to get my room keys and they asked me to get the name of the person who spoke to them, etc., etc. It took me 4 check-in attempts for them to finally give me a room. I would have been more than happy to go back to The Alexis (a much nicer hotel) but on Day 2 they issued me a room. During the course of the week, we had sessions smoked out by roofers who were too close to the vent and for 2 days their internet connection was down. On my last day at the hotel, I left my jacket in one of the conference rooms and the staff made me call "0" on the phone and leave a message on their lost and found line rather than talk to someone in person. I had to ask 7 people where the physical lost and found was located as my car keys were in my jacket. No one seemed to know... The hotel has potential. The room was pretty comfortable and the location is good. However, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I cared about.

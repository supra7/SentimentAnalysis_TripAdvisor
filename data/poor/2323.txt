I have worked at one of the top rated resorts in the country for years and have never had such a bad experience as I did at the Grand Wailea! From the extreme lack of customer service, the poor quality of food and beverages, to the worst spa treatment I have ever had in my life I was so very disappointed and disturbed by this resort. Luckily enough the Four Seasons Resort is right next door and they far exceeded any expectations I have and it was the best experience I have ever had at a resort!!! The only positive points I can say about the Grand Wailea is that they have amazing grounds, pools, and the five sacred pools at the spa are incredible.

We stayed here 1 night in mid May of 2007. They told us we would have 2 queen beds on the first floor (ADA traveler)....we were told we'd have 2 rooms next to each other with our family members. After flying for the last 10 hours and getting here was not pleasant. Our ADA room was on the second floor and our family members weren't close by. The (OLD) room we got had 2 full size beds for 3 grown people! Then they said they had no roll away ,and we were tired. Finally they got one somehow from a nearby hotel at like 1:30 in the morning. We checked out about 1100 the next morning. About 4:00 that afternoon we realized we had left behind a shaving kit in our bathroom hanging on the door. I called right away, and the guy that answered the phone put me on hold. He came back on the line and assured me he had it. I asked him if he would mail it to our house as we needed some important items in there. He confirmed he had our address and it would be sent. Upon return home and several phone calls later, they now say they never did find it, and so sorry charlie.....between the condition of this hotel and their customer service, I'd look elsewhere to stay in Seattle.

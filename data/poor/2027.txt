Spent New Year's weekend in this Hyatt pretender. Read on, agh! No rooms renovated, ignore the blurb on the web site. Toilet paper not replenished, ditto kleenex. Tacky dispensers for shower soap, conditioner and shampoo hanging on tub wall and next to sink. Trying to find this one is a real pain with the one way streets and lack of sign- age. I've been coming to Boston for over 30 years! Restaurant staff very nice despite "Beavis and Butthead" pair abusing each other and the waiter. Front desk crew like programmed robots. Bellhop service surly and slow. No doorman and had to walk over the the Ritz Boston Common two blocks away!to find a cab! On and on and on! Who's in charge here. In short, four star rates, no star service. Room made up at 5pm on "New Year's Day" with a lot of rooms empty. If Paul Revere had stayed here he'd have left for Lexington and Concord at lot sooner. Even the elevators have a mind of their own! Don't even ask about the state of the bathtub! That's enough! Bottom line? Don't even think about it!

Recently I traveled to LV for a relaxing break. I pre-booked the Stratosphere Hotel and discovered several disappointments with the service, rooms and overall experience. Firstly the service - I booked a deluxe room with a king bed and was given 2 queen beds. I asked for refrigerator and discovered that would be an additional charge. The room smelled of smoke butt asked for a non-smoking room, another disappointment. I was given a room on the 24 th floor and the noise level was not acceptable.(doors slamming, loud voices(ladies of night) and even barking! Overall experience - Sitting at the bar I was approached by several ladies of the night. I went to the security kiosk and stated my claim. The security station was not interested. He stated that its a normal situation. I would not recommend this hotel for any family or business person. Next time I would book a classy hotel outside of the Strip!

Do not stay at this hotel, the most disgusting service i have ever received in my life, The rooms are small the showers in the bath, the food is very average. Rather stay at Planet hollywood a fraction cheaper however the value is tremendous. The pool at Harrahs is a joke guys beware of this hotel, i would say the worst hotel in Vegas. I would rather stay in Arizona in a tent at the bottom of the canyon than Harrahs. A def no-go STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

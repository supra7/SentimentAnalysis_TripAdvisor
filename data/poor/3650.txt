The airline had lost my luggage! Perhaps the single most important thing that mattered to me THE MOST...and Holiday Inn Midway Chicago couldn't even bother to leave a message on the in-room answering machine! My luggage was lost by the airlines and after informing the desk clerk that the airline was to deliver it at this address, I was assured that they would let me know. I checked in on Thursday evening and checked out on Sunday afternoon. The missing luggage arrived at 3pm on Friday. It wasnt until Sunday, an hour before I checked out did I find out that my missing luggage had indeed been delivered two days earlier!! When asked why I was not informed about its arrival their answer was sorry, but it was your responsibility to ask It is also Holiday Inns policy to not contact the guests room until after 9am. It arrived at 3pm, so what happened during the day that caused them not to contact me?? A simple phone call to the room and an brief message on their in-room answering machine would have sufficed. We were in town for a wedding. Some of our clothes for the even were in that suitcase along with everyday clothes and toiletries. We dont live in Chicago and dont know where the shopping centers are located. When we finally found a Wal-Mart we had to shell out a few hundred dollars for basics and some of our missing wedding attire, which happened to be there had we been informed soon enough. Our relatives were also staying at the Holiday Inn. My aunt needs her diabetic meds and food refrigerated. As per Holiday Inns boast of included amenities, a microwave and refrigerator are standard in all rooms. Her room DID NOT have these and had to be requested. I will never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone.

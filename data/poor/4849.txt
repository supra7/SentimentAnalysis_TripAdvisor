I booked this hotel through Priceline, and it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Full size bed for 2, a bathroom so small I had barely enough space to close the door, a bed so uncomfortable, I woke up in the middle of the night with a backache, and walls so thin I could hear the people next door going to the bathroom... I usually book my hotels through Priceline and I had never been disappointed until I stayed at Hotel Deca. I requested a king size bed (instead of 2 queens) and instead, they gave me one full! I don't know any other hotels with full size beds...and they call themselves a 31/2 star hotel? I stayed at a 3 star hotel by the airport which was MUCH better than this one. Needless to say...I don't recommend this hotel. You can find much better deals elsewhere in Seattle. If you have a car, I would recommend staying by the airport. Bigger rooms, better quality beds, for much cheaper.

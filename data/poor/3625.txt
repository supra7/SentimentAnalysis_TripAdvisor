what a disappointment We tried to book the St. Andrews, but they were full and referred us to their other property. We booked without researching...what a mistake! Although, when I look at their website now, I can't believe that we were in the same hotel! The rate was reasonable, and the person who booked our room told us they did have parking available. When we checked in, we were told no, they did not have parking. Public overnight parking costed us $40 per night to park two motorcycles, and we had to hike to get there. We could have stayed in a much nicer hotel for that money.Microscopic room/bathroom was smaller than a cabin on a cruise ship. Bathroom was mildewy on the floors and tiles, and the shower curtain was not wide enough for the stall...either you soaked your roll of toilet paper or created a puddle next to the door.The ancient, hard and lumpy mattress on a platform (no box spring) was next to impossible to sleep on, and I woke up both mornings with a back ache. The view out of our windows (with no screens) was an alleyway and the concrete wall of the building next to us. The street noise was constant all night long. The single electrical outlet made it impossible to charge two cell phones each night...what a pain!The lobby holds only 2 people, and there is no luggage storage except in the unsecured hallway. The lady at the front desk was friendly enough, but her clothes were dirty, and it gave a very bad first impression.We did eat at the attached restaurant, and the food and the server were surprisingly good although the restaurant, like the hotel, was not very clean.

The rooms were too small for one person...even a very tiny person. Honestly, the elevator was about the same size as our room. The entire hotel is trying so hard to be "cool" that it's ridiculous. From lobby to restrooms, it's worn, torn and makes you want to run into the streets to escape. Never again!!

After a long trip to Hawaii I checked into my room to relax and take a nice warm shower - only to find out they did not have hot water. There was no mention of this when I checked in, which would have given me the opportunity to change hotels. It was late the next day before the hot water was back on. I understand that problems do come up but felt that I should receive some type of discount for their lack of hot water. when I called the desk they said all they could do was credit me back the $26. resort fee. I paid $580. per night for a room without hot water and all they would do is give me a $26. credit! I emailed starwood/sheraton customer service to to let them know what had happened and all got back was a smug reply say they considered the matter closed. This is the last time I will stay at the Maui Sheraton

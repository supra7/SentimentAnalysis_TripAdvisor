At midnight the attendant could not find my reservation, even though I provided a confirmation number. He had me wait for an hour while he assisted other guests. He was very rude and would not let me use the phone to call other hotels for vacancies. Later the manager offered me a night in one of their associated hotels; another wild goose chase with unreturned calls and false promises. PLEASE don't give this awful chain your business!

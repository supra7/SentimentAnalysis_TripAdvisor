Come on Ian!!! I've spent nights at the Delano and the Mondrian and the Clift doesn even come close to my other experiences...For the amount of money you spend, the place was absolutely horrible ... My room was like walking into my grandmothers room and the staff was not even noticeable from the time you walked in the door to the time you checked out... very disappointing... Ian should be ashamed of himself...

We expected to have great weekend but we are very disappointed. We stayed at Mountainside. Room was dirty and stinky, very dark, carpet was wet, coffee table and night stands painted few times and cracked. Rest of furniture same. Blanket on the bed didnt look clean and was ugliest Ive ever seen. We didnt even stay there overnight. Thanks God we live in Phoenix only 30 minutes from there. Water park was ok. Very crowded. Staff was friendly. Dont get tempted buy their website. Everything looks great there with taste of luxury, but its only a good pictures.

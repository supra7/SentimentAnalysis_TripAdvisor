I stay at hundreds of hotels per year for work. I have a difficult time sleeping at night so requested a room away from the elevator. I reconfirmed this request prior to arrival. However, when I arrived my room as well as my mothers room who is also a very light sleeper is next to an elevator. The staff were unhelpful. I spoke to several managers including Humberto several times. After a very poor nights sleep he offered to refund the points for the rooms. I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation. The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family. While the offer of refunding the points was nice, it would have actually been netter if they followed though on that promise!. After several e-mails they responded they were only refunding a single room. I also copied the Hilton executive team and did not receive a response form them. I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either.

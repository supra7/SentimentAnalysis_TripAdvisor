Not up to scratch!! Quite disappointed overall with this hotel. It certainly is not a good representation of an Intercontinetal Hotel. Rooms are drab, awful colours and terrible cheap tacky bedspreads and curtains that would not even close properly so the light will come into the room in the mornings and wake you. Small adequate bathrooms shower not the best! Breakfast is Buffet only at $25 plus tax and tip!!! My husband and I neither eat a big breakfast only cereal, fruit, juice/coffee so its ridiculous to pay $60.00 for that! But they would not even offer al carte after asking and explaining we dont want and cant eat a full buffet breakfast! Anyway we ate out at a GREAT breakfast place just down the street called 'Sears' fine food which is a very popular place, I had oatmeal with banana and maple syrup and coffee and my husband had french toast and strawberries and orange juice the total bill was $23.00 and food is of good quality! The $65 for use of club roon is a total rip off too. The 'Top of The Mark' is quite tacky and very touristy NOT sophisticated, romantic and classy! My experience of similar hotel bars and restaurants with views in Japan for example (up to 80 floors high) was amazing!!! We did not choose to eat in the hotel as the menu was limited and nothing grabbed our fancy but we ate out at some great restaurants including 'Anzu' at the Nikko hotel a couple of times where the food is delicious especially the 'Fillet steak' with wasabi/mustard sauce with sweet potatoe. 'Roys' is always great too! In hindsight we both wished that we had stayed at the 'Nikko' hotel with its smart decor and 'L.C.Ds' in the rooms and there is also a swimming pool, either there or The W hotel for us next year!

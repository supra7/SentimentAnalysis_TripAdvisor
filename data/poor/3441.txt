Horrible experience here- I had stayed at other Affina hotels and I thought that they were a great deal. It is clear that they have not updated this place in a very long time. The carpet was dirty and had burn marks in it. The room smelled old and like smoke. Not convenent to a subway. And worst of all there is no lighting in the rooms- I felt like I was in a cave!

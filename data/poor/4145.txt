Stayed for four long nights as part of a reunion. The only thing good about this motel is the location. There is absolutely nothing else to recommend it, except perhaps for the free parking, if you didn't mind that one of the attendants was noticeably drunk at 8 am. This place is badly in need of a makeover in every possible aspect. The very small and ergonomically ridiculous rooms stank of cigarettes, the beds are hard as planks, and the noise from the outside and the air conditioner was deafening. In a word, this hotel is grim.

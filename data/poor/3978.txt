I stayed in this hotel. I was fined US 175 for smoking in a room. There was no advice that you cannot smoke in this room, there was no no smoking sign in the hallway, room door or in the room. Further there was ash trays provided in this room. The staff were not helpful and just quoted that there is a no smoking policy? I asked what efforts they had used to inform patrons of this policy and they said it was quoted on website and in a form you sign upon booking. Unfortunately a travel agency booked hotel! Wreckless staff and obviously high uneducated as they werent able to evaluate the situation themselves. Upon complaining to the hotel manager he hung up the phone. Terrible stay well clear of this dump.

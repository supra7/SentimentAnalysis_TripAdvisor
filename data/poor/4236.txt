Had my computer stolen from my room. When I filed a complaint with security they acted as though it happens all the time. I also filed a police report with the LosVegas police. The police were helpful that they asked for serial number (Which I had) They stated that they have a lot of Door Pushers? I pulled my door locked everytime I left because it did not shut properly. The only one who went in and out was the cleaning lady according to the hotel. They comped us a different room anbd guess what! That door did not close either. The third party claims insurance for the hotel of course has denied my claim so now it's on to the attorney.

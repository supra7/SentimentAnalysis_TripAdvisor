The Park Plaza is a beautiful hotel in a lovely location, very suitable for business travellers, although the rooms and decor are a bit dated and could do with a bit of refurbishment. The room service staff was lovely and very helpful. However, I would like to warn everyone to keep a very close eye on their belongings - I accidentally left a suit hanging in the hotel cupboard when leaving, and despite me noticing it and ringing immediately within 6h of departure, the item was nowhere to be found. Their security staff was extremely unhelpful, took ages to reply to my phone calls and only offered me a very poor recompensation - and no apology at all. When I asked them to check with the cleaners - who, according to their key card logs, had been the only people in the room since my departure - I was even told by the hotel's security staff that cleaning staff had been found on earlier occasions to have taken lost belongings home overnight by accident....by accident?? This is totally unacceptable for a hotel of this class - I will definitely not be back and warn everyone to keep a close eye on their possessions when staying here!

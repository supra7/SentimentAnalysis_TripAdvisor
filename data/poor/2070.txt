Had to stay at the Hotel Burnham for two days of meetings in Chicago--left after the first night. Here's why. The rooms and baths aren't just small--they're tiny. No fatties! Our first room had a bathroom reminiscent of an airliner's. The front desk staff--who were very pleasant and helpful--showed us to other rooms which resulted in a room that was a bit larger all around. This was offset, however, by the sound of the El running throughout most of the night and resuming in the early morning. Earplugs didn't help. The overabundance of silly decorating doesn't make the room any larger. We left the next day--once again, the front desk staff was very polite and friendly--and decamped to the Westin on Michigan Ave.--comfy bed and no trains. Oh, and on the way down we got stuck in the elevator--albeit briefly. Plus side--friendly staff, wine hour, architecturally impressive building. Down side--you can't sleep at night and feel like you're being prepped to be veal. You decide.

Cancellation policy is a scam. While the hotel suggests that they offer a 48 hour cancellation policy they would not honor it for me with a three weeks notice. Do not believe it. Yikes...now I am suck staying at this place in a couple of weeks! Others have posted about an arrogant attitude at this hotel...I'm experiencing it and I haven't even checked in yet!

Bad service We (4 adults, 2 preschoolers, 3 generations) splurged on one of their most expensive suites, the Governor's Suite, at $3,500 per night (same price as the presidential suite), and expected to be treated like royalty, but were utterly disappointed. Each morning we asked for 6 towels and 6 bottles of water when calling the valet for our rental car. First day they said their water shipment hadn't arrived yet, and only provided the towels. Fine. Second day, again no water and no towels, and no explanation. Third time, they provided 2 towels and 2 bottles, and said that's the maximum the hotel allows per car. But come on, we have 6 people and they expect us to share 2 towels and 2 bottles of water on the beach? So for 3 days in a row we had to either run back to our suite to take the towels, or drive around to buy water before heading to different beaches. This is the service we got for paying almost $15,000 for four nights! Compare this with Four Seasons on Maui, where the valet would fill our car with bottled waters without us even asking, even when we were just staying at their standard rooms. We called the hotel manager to complain before checking out, expecting them to somehow compensate us for our bad experience. But only got empty, half-hearted apologies. Worst luxury hotel service I've ever experienced.To be fair, the suite itself was spacious and gorgeous. It's the size of three smalled suites combined. The view was great, if you can expunge the parking garage roof from your peripheral vision. And our kids loved swimming with dolphins, and still keep asking to go back to Hawaii.

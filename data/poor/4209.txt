Instead of telling you how depressingly mediocre this hotel was in every way other than the pretty lobby and convenient location, I am going to issue a safety warning of sorts: This hotel locks the staircases. On the last day of the convention I was attending, someone decides to pull the fire alarm. Chaos ensues as everyone rushes to the emergency stairwells only to find that they are locked. You can have no idea how frightening this is until you experience it, so if you're into that then by all means, stay here. But unless you like the idea of being trapped in a burning building, I recommend staying elsewhere.

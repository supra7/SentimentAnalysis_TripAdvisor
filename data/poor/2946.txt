We stayed here for 3 nights and were not happy at all. If the booking would not have been done through and we had already paid upfront for 2 rooms x 3 nights I would have walked away from the hotel IMMEDIATELY after arriving to our room. So what was wrong: - Rooms are dirty and old. In addition for "normal" wear and tear there is stains all over the place and it's just DIRTY. We changed rooms TWICE during our check-in process and got slightly better rooms but be warned that even their "nice" rooms are having stains like one shown at my picture - Coridors are in very dark obviously to hide dirt, stains, holes and ruptures in the carpert - Rooms are RELLY TINY even by NYC standards. - Sfaff was rude and not helpful. They did not give us what we had booked but changed us to other type rooms. What was good: - Location is great! Neighbourhood is nice & safe (by NYC large-city standard) and everything is close by. Will NEVER visit ANY W hotel after this just awfull experience.

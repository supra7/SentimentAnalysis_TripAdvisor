Ok, if you come to Vegas you want to stay on the strip unless these things apply to you. You like being around old people. You are Ugly. Or like ugly people You are Weird, (like clinically nuts) or like them You want a sub par time. You dont like fun. If Lights flashing over your head is The Best it can get for you. If you like old or ugly wait staff, and employees serving you. (To be fair some are not old or ugly but few and far between) You like to wait a long time to get a drink. You like Small Rooms. You like old casino machines. You like tacky decoration. You dont care about ambiance. Basically, Vegas is located on the strip, not downtown, The Casinos there suck compared to the strip. The entertainment sucks compared to the strip. The people who go here are not attractive or exciting or fun or happy, unless they are stumbling drunk. You do indeed pay for what you get... Pay more and stay at a well known casino hotel on the strip, MGM, New York New York, Belagio, Planet Hollywood, Wynn, Encore, Paris, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandelay Bay, or whatever, Just stay on the Strip, you will enjoy your time and the people around you much more. You don't have to be a model or anything but I guarantee you will not be seeing any of these in the downtown area. I have learned my lesson and will never go back there again. Yuck. Im not stuck up, Im not vain. I am a normal guy who likes to have a good time, and feel like I am being treated when I go on vacation. I wish I could stay at Encore (a little too expensive, maybe some day) till then MGM, Mandalay, or the others I listed) Go downtown if you were offended from my comments in the first part of this message. Sounds cross, sounds even mean. However its true.

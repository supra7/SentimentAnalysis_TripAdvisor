WHAT A DUMP! Brief background. Married, mid fifties, active (surf on Wakiki, climb Diamondhead,etc), like to travel and soak up local food, customs and way of life. Never complained about a hotel room or sent food back in restaurant. Usually stay at Hampton Inn type motels. Don't stay at fancy hotels . Don't eat at expensive restaurants. Checked into Ka'anapali Beach Hotel after reading all the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Drive up to hotel which is quite close to road. Outside looks a little drab. Go into lobby and start feeling out of place. Everything is old and drab, carpet dirty, low ceilings and very humid. Get keys to room. Bellhop walks us and luggage over to building where rooms are and jokes that there are no elevators in the building. No joke. NO ELEVATORS ! Walk up to 3rd floor. Hallways and stairs are open aired, no A/C. Smell of mildew. Carpets are FILTHY. Walk into room and almost fall over from mildew smell. The room REEKS OF MILDEW! The mattress is filthy and has mildew stains on it.Walk aroung grounds and look at restaurants. They are all the same. Old, mildewy, hot, dirty and drab. The "Hawaiian Entertainment" is a young guy on guitar, a 60 yr old on guitar/singer and a 70 yr old white haired woman playng the uke. And they chitchat back and forth with each other. There are about 40 people in the crowd, scattered around about 20 tables. It was like a Saturday Night Live skit. We checked out in the morning. I went back and read all the glowing reviews of this place. They must have this mixed up with another hotel because THIS PLACE IS A DUMP! I have never stayed in such a run down, unhappy place. The free brerakfast was in a large windowless room which was as run down as the rest of the place. I hope this review saves you some heartache. This is a rundown dirty hotel from the early 1970's. DON'T STAY HERE! ANYWHERE ELSE WILL BE BETTER!

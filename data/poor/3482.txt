First of all, they would NOT let you check in untill 3 pm. This is NOT a hotel, Its MOTEL. Room is tiny, you dont really have any space to even put anything next the bed. The towel in the bathroom was wet when I checked in! Meaning it was somebody's used towel and they dont change if it looks clean. The TV does not work at all. which I didnt even bother to ask because the front desk people are UNBELIEVABLY RUDE, they laugh at you when you're upset with the services. One of the guy in front desk who kept my luggage put a prank on me that they dont have my bag and said that some guy took all my stuff!!! and when he saw my horrified face, he laughed at me and said he's joking because I looked tired!!!!!!!!!. If that wasnt enough, he continually enjoyed putting a phone prank on me saying that I signed for community services!!! What kind of hotel is this?? When I went to the front desk to complain about this idiot, they laughed at me saying that thats what he does!!!! Please, Please DO NOT GO TO MARRAKECH HOTEL. This hotel is a nightmare.

We went to Chicago to see Wicked and stayed at the BW River North . We had an awfull experience. Not only do their hallways and rooms smell awful, they are very run down. They gave us a smoking room when we requested non smoking and would not change due to the "hotel was full" eventhough my daugther suffers from asthma. We tried to save $$ on the parking and now are sorry we did. Stay Away.

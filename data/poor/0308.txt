The Edgewater's website boasts that it was recently named the "best hotel in Seattle." If that's the case, I can't imagine how bad other hotels must be. When we arrived, the front desk couldn't find our reservation. I provided a print out of our confirmation and it still took an additional ten minutes for the clerk to find our reservation on their system - not an auspicious start for exhausted travelers. When we arrived in our waterfront room our disappointment only deepened. The room was the smallest I've ever seen in a quality hotel. Although the kitschy decor was cute, the bed was so uncomfortable that I woke up with horrible back pain both mornings of our stay. I'd like to say that, at least, the room was clean, but the numerous, huge splotches of dried toothpaste on the inside of the bathroom door prevents me from doing so. The room service meal was reasonably tasty even though they "substituted" a sandwich for the salad that was ordered. I could go on with this parade of horribles, but I'd prefer to purge the memory of this hotel. Let it suffice to say that you couldn't pay me to stay here again. I'm told that there a many fine hotels in Seattle; do yourself a favor and stay at one of those, instead.

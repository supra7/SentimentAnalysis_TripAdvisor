Hotel staff does not know their responsibilities,Check-in a shambles, didn't ask us if we need smoking or non-smoking then we have to change room as a result,We were not treated friendly at all,Woman at the front desk rude and unapologetic,check in took ages!staff ignore you,We then had to wait half an hour for our bags to be brought up to our rooms, which eventually turned up after several requests and a visit back down to the front desk.The staff at reception is rude, have no common courtesy,the fridge was dented and dirty on the outside ,Waste lots of time waiting for elevators,The only good thing about this hotel is the location .

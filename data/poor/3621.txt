Seeping Sewage at the Touchstone We booked through a website. When we arrived, the hotel had no record of our reservation. We should have taken this clue and left quickly...but location convinced us to stay. Big Mistake! If the filthy rooms were not enough to send us packing the sewage seeping through the walls in our bathroom should have sent us on our way. The staff did little to correct the situation other than offer us a more expensive room at our cost! Such a deal. The help was surley, the cost more than we expected and the photo we saw on the internet not representative of the room we ended up with. I agree with the first reviewer: Don't touch the Touchstone with a ten foot pole!

As a current guest of ME Barcelona i regret to report i am absent of the following; 1) a clock in my room 2) 24 room service 3) decent lighting 4) an informed concierge 5) service by the pool bar is non existent 6) a clean room, had to call 2 times to get rooms made up after 4pm 7) hallways smell of bad odour 8) gym has no fresh water anywhere, new machines that dont work.... 9) a serviced spa, it seemed to be locked every day. Than i found out i need to pay extra for such facilities 10) a shower door that works, i am still waiting for this to be fixed after 3 days. Overall whilst not central the hotel does offer a poolside area to lounge and relax. Its location was not problematic as it close to a metro station. At check-in we were impressed with the check in experience but beyond that every other facility left a lot to be desired. As a frequent traveller who spends up to 100 nights per year in hotels this has to be the worst hotel i have stayed in the past 12 months. I feel the experience is best described as a well thought out concept which is poorly executed. If it not been for prepaying the entire stay i honestly would of checked out after day one and headed to the Le Meridien or another establishment. The only positive aspect of the hotel is DOS CIELOS, this is a wonderful restaurant which i would recommend to any individual wanting a world class experience. If only the Aura team were like the staff at DOS CIELOS.

Awful place. NEVER go there We stayed there for three nights in mid september. Hotel is very filthy: they do not even change the linen between guests!! The receptionist is completely unpolite, and the Big Boss is a mafioso. No words could define how bad our stay there was. I recommend you to absolutely avoid this place.

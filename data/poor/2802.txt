Rooms are incredibly cramped... but that's to be expected when staying in Time's Square NY. What's not to be expected is the dirtiness of the rooms with horribly stained carpets, stained sheets, hair all over the bathroom and room, a cracked sink, low class clientel, horrible service response time (it took 3 hours for an "engineer" to come look at my air conditioner and he couldn't fix it any way). Absolutely horrible Management team. I was able to get the name of the front desk manager Kanvar Singh, who would not come out of his office to speak to me. I wasn't asking for a discount, because it was my poor decision making for picking this hotel, I just wanted to inform him of all my troubles during my stay there at the Time. Kanvar Singh would not come out to speak with me, instead one of the front desk girls had to keep running back and forth between me and Kanvar's desk. After going into the back 4 times she took some mini bar charges off of my bill which I did not even ask for, there wasn't any problems with the minibar and I didn't see why she did that. Basically my main gripe is with the front desk manager Kanvar who seems to be too important to speak to guests. If I could have gotten to voice my opinion to him and gotten a simple apology I think that I would have left that hotel with a much better taste in my mouth. If this hotel reads these reviews this next comment is for you, There are plenty of people in this world who are willing to work hard for the money you pay them, don't ever settle on some one who can't even listen to a complaint when asked to.

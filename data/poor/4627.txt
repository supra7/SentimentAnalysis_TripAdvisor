My son is at Keesler AFB in Mississippi and we decided that he wanted to spend his first weekend off base in New Orleans. The front desk staff are RUDE, the maid service does not speak a bit of English, we were placed in a room with a queen bed when I reserved a room with 2 beds. I was overcharged for my stay, valet takes forever to get your vehicle to you no matter how far in advance you request it. The place was roach infested and they didn't seem to care when I brought it to their attention. I was charged a $150 fee because they claimed we smoked in our room when in fact we DO NOT smoke. They said there was evidence of smoking in the room (prior to check-out) but the fact is, no one should have even been in our room before our check-out because of the DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door. When I asked to speak with the person who was in our room without my permission, they could not produce anyone who spoke English. The elevator is extremely slow and the AC is set at about 80 degrees in the lobby. The AC in the room could not be set below 75. There is ice available on floors 3 5 and 9 but you have to know how to find it yourself. Vending is only on the 5th floor. The rooms are the size of a large walk-in closet. The only upside to this hotel is convenience of walking to anywhere in the French Quarter. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.

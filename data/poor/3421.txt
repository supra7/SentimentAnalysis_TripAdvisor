We had two rooms: one "upgraded" to a suite and the other not. The "upgrade" had no air conditioning in one of the suite rooms for two of the four nights we were there. Repeated phone calls were required before we could get a response. The wrong size sheets were used on one of the beds ie twin on a queen-size bed so the bed came unmade during the night. Pest traps for roaches were left on a nightstand. Towels in complete sets were never delivered even with daily phone calls. The "queensize" sofa beds are barely fullsize. We measured this and checked several online sites. This was not a good value.

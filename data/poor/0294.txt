If you are going to use a last minute agent to book this hotel then I suggest you choose another as you will be treated as second class citizens. I booked through Expedia, on arriving at hotel we was shown to a basement room, very dark and extremely small, I certainly not what you would expect from a 4* hotel. On requesting an upgrade for which we were prepared to pay for, we were told the hotel was full. Later we found out this was not true. The whole experience made sure we left our room after breakfast and did not return until we were exhausted from seeing the wonderful sights of Rome. I would not recommend this Hotel to anybody; there are far better hotels to choose from.

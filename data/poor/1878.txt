I had planned a romantic evening in Boston with my wife for Valentines Day. Since we dont get out much I figured I would book I would book a room at the Boston Park Plaza. We arrived at 3:00 for check in and were told there were not any King rooms available and they would call us in 45 minutes. After an hour and half I didnt hear anything from them so I decided to check. And I was told they were still working on it. It was not until 7:00PM that we were able to check in. The hotel was very loud and was jammed backed with conference goers. Even trying to get on the evaluator was a nightmare as it was filled to the max with young kids attending a conference. Once we got on our floor we noticed it was very loud and kids were running up and down the halls yelling. The room itself was not a king room that I had reserved but rather a small double room, dark and dingy, the bathroom was dirty and the trash can was filled. We called to the front desk and demanded a refund, which we were granted. However this experience ruined our weekend and rather then get another room we decided to make the 2 hour trip back home.

What a disappointment What a disappointment - in every regard. For a Christmas gift, I bought my parents tickets to a play and Saturday night at the Casablanca hotel. I chose this hotel because it was a great location - and the rooms and accomodations looked special - which I wanted them to have. The room was booked in December - indicating that the cancellation policy was cancel at least 1 day before day of arrival. Their trip was for Valentines day evening. On the day before, the hotel called MY home and left a somewhat threatening message - if I didn't call to confirm before 7:30 the night before - the room would be re-booked. I was out of town for the weekend already and didn't get the message until 3 days later.I reluctantly called my parents to find out about their horrible treatment - they were assured that the guests who were booked for Friday night refused to leave - and they can't kick them out. If that was the case, why did they leave a message the day before saying if we didn't confirm, we would be cancelled? Their solution? They sent my parents to Hotel 41 - which was a much lower quality hotel - which they didn't enjoy at all. To boot, they charged my parents the rate that I agreed to pay for the Casablanca hotel - which is much higher than the dumpy hotel they stayed at.When I called the manager - I was assured that the bill would be credited. However - my parents just received the bill with no credit. I faxed the hotel and received no reply.What a disappointing evening all together - thanks to the Casablanca hotel.

I got a cheap room at the hotel via Hotwire website. It was my first time booking through that website and it was an experience getting stuck with The Destiny Palms. The hotel location was obscure. It was barely noticeable behind a McDonalds and Houlihans Bar/Grill. The lobby staff was nice, which was the only pleasant part about the stay. I had a room on the third floor. When I walked into the room, it smelled like dust and old fabrics and it made me cough! So I then took a look at the bathroom area. There was no door, no nothing separating the tiny bathroom from the vanity area. The vanity area was ok, but the shower was a different story. The shower head was molded, grungy, and just nasty. The shower was redone but was also moldy and cracked with more mold and scum. I went down to the front lobby to get housekeeping to clean it early in the morning since it was about 11pm at night when I checked in. Luckily I was only here for a short one night stay after visiting Epcot. This was the worst hotel I ever stayed.

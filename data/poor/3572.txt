This turned out to be an overpriced tourist trap. Worst service and employee attitude! They charge for EVERYTHING! $32 for Valet Parking! $19 for a so so breakfast! Internet access $12.95/ Day! I have never been in a "4 Star" hotel with such bad employee attitude as this. I'm usually a generous tipper (at restaurants 20% to 25% is my norm if it's good service), here I could find no reason to tip. I tipped the bellhop for handling the bags, but did he deserve a tip? Not really, he was on his CELL PHONE the whole time and never even greeted me! The fact that the hotel manager allows the employess to use their cell phones during work hours is a big mistake for the hotel as well as for the employees (how can you justify a generous tip to somebody who is ignoring you?). Slovenly service and attitude ranks this hotel at the bottom of the ratings!

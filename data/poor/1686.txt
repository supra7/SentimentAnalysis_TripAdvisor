If your luggage consists of a hefty bag then stay here. The rooms are musty smelling, the wireless internet only works if you occupy a room close to the lobby. Your clothes will carry the ambiance of your room home with them. Front office staff is uninterested or motivated in solving any problems. Buffet breakfast consists of wheat or white toast with coffee. The good news is this hotel does have a supply of Febreeze on hand and is close to some restaurants so you can limit your in room experience.

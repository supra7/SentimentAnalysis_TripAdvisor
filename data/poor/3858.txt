Aston Maui Lu Resort 17 February 2008 My wife and I stayed in this "Hotel" for one night February 2nd as I was attending a Rotary function at the Marriott Waialea. This was the most disgusting hotel room I have ever stayed in. The carpets were dirty, the bathroom fixtures, although clean were showing rust, and the furniture appeared to be from the 60's. The bed was sagging. We requested a King bed but instead received two single beds. I will not stay at this hotel again and being a Kamaaina I do travel to Maui from my home on Oahu frequently. This hotel should be razed and a new resort built to todays standards. Hopefully all Aston Hotels are better maintained, but I would be skeptical to try one after this event. I just thought the tourist should know before they ruin their vacation by staying at the Maui Lu "Resort" NOT! I will say that the staff was very courteous and responsive but that does not make up for the devastating condition of the facility. Sincerely, Oran Spotts

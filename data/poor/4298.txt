DO NOT STAY HERE for the price, money and location you can get a better deal at Imperial Palace or even Casino Royale. We booked the pool package to get a cheaper rate and when I saw the pool, I wanted to die. The pool at my apartment complex is more fun. We arrived Friday night pretty late and we were starving, so decided to grab dinner at the cafe located near the Mardi Gras tower. The first two things I ordered on the menu the server told were horrible and to pick something else. My husband and I were both disappointed with our choices in the end. The next day I woke up to head downstairs to Starbucks, but the elevators on my side of the hotel were not working. The 5 minute walk and 20 minute wait at the other set of elevators almost made me want to take the 15 flights of stairs down. Finally returned to my room and got ready for the pool, the package included two free frozen drinks and pool bag. However, I never got my frozen drinks because with no power they could not blend anything. Saturday night around 10 pm I returned to my room and was greeted by a terribly RUDE security officer demanding to see my room key and my husbands, one key for the both of us was not sufficient proof we were staying at the room. We checked out Sunday morning around noon, returned home at 9pm and realized my husband had left a $100 polo shirt in the room. Called lost and found immediately and were told they would take a look and get back with us. I called back the following Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday with no response. My husband and I are frequent visitors Vegas, we go about 6 to 7 times a year and try new places each time, so I've stayed almost every where on the strip and have never been as disappointed and I have been with my stay at Harrah's.

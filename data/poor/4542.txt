I had to stay at Adolphus on this trip. A conference I attended was hosted at the hotel. Hotel is aging and it shows. Hallways have a distinct "old hotel" odor. Room is adequate - and very quiet, which was the only plus. Housekeeping did not replenish towels, glasses or water bottles. I think they just made the bed and emptied the trash. Breakfast room service came 15 minutes early - I was still in my pj's. The person who delivered did not apologize - just pushed the food in the door and said he had a lot of other deliveries. The conference also seemed poorly organized. Glasses/water were rarely replenished. Location downtown is nice - unless you're here on a weekend - then everything is closed. I wouldn't stay here again unless I had to. On another note - I had a discrepancy with my bill I had to work out after I left. The gal in their Accounting Dept was pleasant and accommodating. The one positive thing I have to say about the Adolpuhs.

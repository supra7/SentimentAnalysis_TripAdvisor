In all honesty, my experiences at the Holiday Lodge Hotel in Potts Point has not only left me disgusted and repulsed, i have been scarred for life. Utter filth! And im not just talking about whats behind the reception desk. The lady at reception named SALLY was ghastly and unprofessional to say the very least. We were asked to leave a 150 security bond which was never mentioned in the confirmation email. The room was revolting - holes in the walls - tv did not work - bathroom was rancid. I was appalled at the bedding as there was 1 sheet on the bed - no quilts whatsoever - what little sheets we had were unsanitary. The email said checkout BEFORE 10.00am, although sally didnt show her face until well after that time. My guests and I were forced to leave due to the fact we couldnt wait around for Sally to stroll in whenever is suited her. We had to call Sally numerous times and were told to leave both sets of keys on the back of the door and she would deposit the 150 back into my account. When I arrived home, Sally called to say id only left one set of keys and would not be getting my bond back. Sally is liar, a thief and personally I think she is deranged. All I can say is DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE DISGUSTED, ROBBED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

I booked this hotel based on all of the positive reviews I found on tripadvisor and I was very disappointed. The first room they put us in had dirty, damp carpet and smelled of mildew. They did move us to a "premium" room at no extra cost, but the premium room was simply a bigger room with slightly updated carpet and the same outdated furnishings and dingy linens. The front desk staff was decent and the pool area was pleasant, but everything else was just really bad. Both elevators broke down while we were there and the breakfast was terrible. All of the food was tasteless and cheap and they served it all on paper plates and with plastic silverware. Don't bother - there are a lot better options in New Orleans!

We booked based on an online ad. Though I shouldn't be too surprised given that it was the cheapest hotel in the Seattle area I was still pretty grossed out. It smells bad (combination of mold and urine) and you get the strong sense that they book rooms on the hourly basis as well. We checked in and then checked out again in about 3 minutes. There are quite a few decent and reasonably priced hotels in the area so it wasn't too much of a hassle. Next time I won't book the cheapest. You get what you pay for!

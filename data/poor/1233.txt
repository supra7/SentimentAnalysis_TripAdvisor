We got to the hotel and checked in, while checking in I noticed the hotel clerk swiping my card twice and he didn't say anything. I got up to our room and checked my online banking and the hotel charged me $160 twice. I called the front desk and she stated she was going to let her manager know. The shower did not have hot water and the shower didn't even work. When leaving the next day, I talked to the manager about his hotel double charging me and he said well your going to need to call the number and right when he went to finish, I said don't tell me that I need to call the number on the back of my card to get a hold of my bank, because I work for the bank and I told him he needs to fax a copy with his letter head showing he double charged me and for my bank to release the funds. After I told him that and he asked for my fax number, he didn't apologize and he didn't even look at me anymore. This hotel is HORRIBLE and I love New Orleans but they need better Management at this hotel and all there problems need to be fixed....

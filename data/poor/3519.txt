This hotel was really a disappointment. The lobby looked really cute but that's about it. The hotel is really far from all the tourist attraction and is dishonest on their website when they say it is 1/2 mile from Times Sqaure (it's 50 blocks away). The stairways and hallways were dark, stinky, and dirty. The room was tiny and smelled bad too. I would definitely recommend dtaying in a hostel for much cheaper b/c they will be better located, cleaner, and definitely cheaper. Don't be fooled by this hotel's fallacious website.

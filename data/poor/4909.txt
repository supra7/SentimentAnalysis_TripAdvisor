I would never refer your hotel to anyone. We had stayed there on 03/23/10 and wasted $199.76 on the room. I had contacted customer service by this website before with no response. Our room was gross, there was dirty clothes from prior guest. Someone had wiped snot and blood on the window in our room prior to us checking into it. For the price we spent was outrageous. The waterpark had so much chlorine in the water, that several kids vomited in the water, thus closing that area. The beds were so uncomfortable we ended up getting upset and checking out that night. All was said to us was "oh". This goes down in my book as the lowest hotel ever, worse customer service ever experienced.

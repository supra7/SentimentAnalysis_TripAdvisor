I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. My friend and I stayed in a 4 person dorm room and became infested with bed bugs. It has been a nightmare trying to get rid of the spots. I was quite impressed with the lobby area - which is very pretty. It is a shame they can't pay a little more attention to the actual rooms. Also, the bathroom on my floor was out of action, so there was always a long line for the bathroom in the mornings.

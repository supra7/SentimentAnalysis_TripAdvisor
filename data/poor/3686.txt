Tired, dirty, and sketchy Our client put us up here for a week on business. Location is very convenient to downtown businesses.Unfortunately hotel suites are very dated (last renovated in the 1980s). The first room were given stunk of mold. Moved to a second room which was tolerable, but very tired. Lots of stains and wear and tear - especially in the bathroom and kitchen. We were staying on the top floor of the hotel, and could hear very loud industrial fans on the roof of the building. Very annoying and disturbed our sleep. The neighborhood of the hotel is kind of sketchy, lots of drugged up and mentally ill homeless, just steps away from the hotel. Its fine during the day, but can get rather sketchy at night, and especially on the weekends, when downtown business crowd disappears. Front desk tries to be friendly, but gave us wrong directions twice. Once I requested a flower shop and was sent on a wild goose chase 10 blocks away...instead was more sucessfull using google map on my blackberry and found a flowershop just across the street from the hotel! Another time, we were sent three blocks away to pick up the bus to go to waikiki and waited 30 minutes until we discovered that the bus we were told to take didn't pick-up where we were told to go...instead the bus we needed stopped directly in front of the hotel. Clearly front desk staff do NOT know the local area.Unfortunately, there are few if any other hotel choices in downtown honolulu. Next time we are staying waikiki, and taking the bus to get downtown. Worth the 20 minute commute.

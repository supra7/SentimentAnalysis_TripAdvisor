Arrived at 1 am to find telephone didn't work, light bulb out, window blind broken, refrigerator so noisy I had to unplug it. On check-in we were assured that the room was quiet but in practice it overlooked a freight railway line that ran regularly through the night,. Great views promised on the website though... All this for $300 per night. Never again.

This hotel has definitely seen better days ... the decor is from the last century (80's) and appears worn, drab and quite frankly, dirty! The sooner Intercontinental decides to do a facelift and remodeling of the hotel, the better. The only redeeming quality of this hotel is its central location ... but there are so many other more appealing hotels in New Orleans that offer the same. My advice: stay somewhere else if you can!

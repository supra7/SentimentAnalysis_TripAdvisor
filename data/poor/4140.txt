I see there is a new option here on Tripadvisor.com that allows you to add photos! I wish I had taken pictures of the peeling paint, the mildew on the shower curtain, the water stain on the ceiling, grungy carpeting, dirty grout... You get the picture, this is NOT the special place, the "boutique" hotel, they would like you to think it is when making a reservation! If that's what you're looking for, stay around the corner at the Tremont! Yes, we got it for the bargain price of $139 on a weekend Travelzoo special, but there are plenty of hotels (even in similar excellent locations) where you can get that kind of price on a weekend in Chicago. I would have to echo an earlier review here on tripadvisor.com: "The Whitehall is listed in the publication "The Best Small Hotels in the World." Please. The Whitehall is the worst Chicago hotel at which I have ever had the misfortune to stay. The location is excellent - one block west of Michigan Avenue. That's where the good news ends. The staff is uppity. The rooms are VERY small. The hotel is badly worn, in need of a face lift. The noise from the pipes is awful. This is an expensive hotel. For the same price you can stay at wondeful Chicago hotels - Fairmont, Peninsula, Meridien, Intercontinental. Do yourself a favor - avoid the Whitehall."

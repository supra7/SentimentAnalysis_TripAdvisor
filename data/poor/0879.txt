Let me begin by saying, I have frequented many resorts in Vegas and this is by far the worst. First, I check in and am fairly impressed by the entry and first glances. I wanted to get some gaming in, so I went across the street to the Wynn where I played poker, roulette, and blackjack till around 2am. I came back to unpack and get my wardrobe ready for some morning meetings. I opened the closet to find a dildo, leather chaps, and some type of whip hanging neatly in the closet! Completely freaked out, I went to the bathroom to see if someone was in this room. Luckily, no one was there. It appeared housekeeping had cleaned the area and perhaps left the closet alone out of disgust. Completely repulsed, I decided to grab the phonebook to find another hotel. When I opened the drawer, I found a used condom, dirty rubber glove, and ky staring me in the face! I was so freaked out and too embarrassed to call the front desk, I threw out all the perverse gear, slept on a chair and checked out the following morning. I claimed the train was too noisy and had my company put me up at the Aria. I can't believe housekeeping overlooked this/ ignored, but I suppose it is Vegas but not something I would expect from a 5* hotel. Stay Away!

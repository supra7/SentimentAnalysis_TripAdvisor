I have a hard time understanding how anyone could give this hotel a five-star rating. The only thing that is "boutique" about this hotel is the size of the room. I wouldn't say that this hotel is a scam, but it's clearly false advertising. The rooms were cramped, worn-out, and the walls were paper thin. You could practically hear everything that was being said in the other room. The only member of the management that was pleasant to talk to was Miguel. Everyone else was either rude or dismissive. The elevator was just filthy. For the price we're paying, they should at least have the decency to clean the carpet. And the view was just depressing. We were right next to a brick wall. Avoid this place if you can. You can get a better deals at other hotels in the city. I've heard that this hotel was recently renovated. But the only thing that wasn't old or dirty was the elevator at the front desk. Some people may enjoy the location, but Times Square isn't really the most enjoyable part of New York for us.

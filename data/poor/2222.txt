Our experience at the Plaza Ocean club was a very miserable one. When we first showed up to check in we had to wait ten minutes until the front desk staff was done joking around with drunk guests from the pool, acting completely unprofessional. Once we checked in we went up to our room via elevator in which all the ceramic tile on the floor of it was cracked and broken and was incredibly slow. Once we arrived to our floor we stepped off the elevator into a dingy hallway with vomit stained carpet and it smelled like cat urine. We got to our door and it looked like someone had tried to kick it down it was so incredibly dirty and scufffed. We then entered our room where it just got worse. Starting with the bathroom there was mold all over the wallpaper border, the tub did not drain at all, the floor had black hair all over it and looked like no one had cleaned it, the blow dryer was missing and it appeared that it had been ripped off the wall. It was disgusting. The bed spreads had cigarette holes burned into them, there were bugs all over the floor and there was an odd smell in the room. The balcony which was suppose to provide a beautiful view of the ocean was covered in bird droppings and since we had a view of the roof we could see mounds of trash that guests had thrown off their balcony, liquor bottles, towels, beer cans, food, wrappers, you name it. Again, very disgusting. This hotel makes it very obvious that they cater to the spring break partiers and everyone who works there is completely unprofessional and rude. Everything from the front desk, to the pool was dirty, that hotel needs to be torn down and replaced. If you are looking for a nice vacation spot this is not the place for you.

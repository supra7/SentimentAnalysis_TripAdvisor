Literally this was the worst experience I've had in a hotel... So bad that it cost us $100.00 for the night and we checked out at 1:30am... (didn't even make it through the whole night). We checked in and learned that the hotel's parking was below the bulding.. (Not a big deal) except in the 1950's when the hotel was built there was no elevator installed.. Kinda makes it rough to carry 6 bags of luggage up stairs. We checked in to our (newly remodeled room).. What a joke.. The sliding glass doors were not even locked when we got to the room. When I tried to locked them, it was close to impossible.. The air conditioner never did work.. I guess the dirty occilating fan was suppoed to blow dirty warm air on us in the night. The freshly painted closet doors that would not close was aweful nice and the rock hard bed made me wonder if the bum I spotted on Fairfax was going to get a better night's rest them I was. As the night approached we learned that half the lights in the room never worked (I had to let the front desk give me bulbs to install myself) and then the creepy moaning and taping on our windows made for a nice sleeping conditions. Within one hour of this experience, we checked out immediatly and found a very nice hotel up the road. Maybe Janis Joplin is still there in spirit? Creepy!! Would not recommend to anyone!!

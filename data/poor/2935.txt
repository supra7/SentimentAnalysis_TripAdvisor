We just stayed at the W New York this past weekend and what a disappointment. The hotel is old and the rooms need a big renovation. It is not a W! It is worse than the Holiday Inn! We paid over $980 for 2 nights and were given a tiny, tiny room (with a double bed which was supposed to be a queen bed!) that didn't even fit our luggage. The room was on the 3rd floor facing a garage building and garbage cans. The carpet was dirty, the air conditioning made weird noises and the paint was coming off the wall. We called to complain and thank god a super nice guy tried to help but told us nothing else was available. After 1 hour with him on the phone he got us a different room. However, it was the same size and similar bad shape, just on a higher floor. The bathroom was tiny too, without a bathtube but with a shower curtain and no doors (which meant super wet floors). Seriously, we had stayed at the W Times Square twice and it was definitely worth the price tag, but this one is awful! This hotel cannot be considered a W. It does not live up to the chain's standards. I understand this was the first W ever, but if they want to keep up the image they need to renovate this NOW. For now, you might as well pay $300 for the Holiday Inn.

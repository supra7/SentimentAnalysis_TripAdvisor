I did not care for this hotel in the least. I was expecting a cozy trendy room and was sadly disappointed to find a tiny run-down room with a strange odor. The bed was practically floor level and I was afraid to put my head on the pillow. There was no warmth to the room, just the bare necessities. I feel I could have found a better place for the money, not to mention $30.00 for mandatory valet parking.

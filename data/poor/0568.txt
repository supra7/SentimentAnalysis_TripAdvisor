Horrible Service My mom booked rooms for us at the Red Lion and was told that they had a shuttle bus that would pick us up at the airport and could take us anywhere we needed to go for the day that we would be staying. We were supposed to be recieving two rooms with two queen beds and were quoted a price of $49 per room. My family and I (seven of us) flew into Seattle at 1:00am. We were all very tired after a day of flying and wanted to go to bed, but that wasn't the case for us. The manager at the front desk was able to confirm our reservation with my mom's confirmation number but told us that the rooms were going to be $79 each. After a very long arguement with the very rude and ignorant manager we were able to get rooms for $55 each with two double beds. The manager explained to us that when we booked the rooms they thought we were airline employees who are contracted to stay at the $49 price. When we were taken two our rooms, my mother was given a key to a room that was already occupied! Our room was freezing cold and the beds were hard as rocks. The next morning there were many people at the front desk complaining of the bad service (no wake up call, missed flights, etc.) We had to wait about 45 minutes for the shuttle van to arrive to take us to breakfast just down the road (the driver stopped to pick up his dry cleaning). Our driver should have his license taken away! He was speeding, didn't use his turn signal to turn or change lanes and ran a red light all in about 1 mile. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, ever!

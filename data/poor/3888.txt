We only had two weeks notice before my step-daughter and I had to be in Maui. Being the peak season hotel selections were few. The Maui Lu's description on the internet sounded as though it was what we needed. However, we checked out after three days and moved into a one-bedroom condo, that cost less and had more! Check around for other places. This one is over-priced for what you get and even if you don't stay in your room all the time you still want a clean bathroom and clean sheets. Our bathroom had mold and mildew growing on the ceiling, in the corners and the pillows smelled!

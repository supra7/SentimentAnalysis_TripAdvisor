We booked this hotel online and we love staying in "boutique" hotels when visiting new york, however this is the worst one we have ever seen. The rooms are tiny, dirty don't have any furniture for storage and we made them move us to 3 different rooms before we found 1 that was worth staying in. Even the European backpackers who are used to staying in hostels were complaining about how nasty this hotel was. The doorman spent most of the time checking out the girls at the top of the stairs rather than actually holding the doors open on the street. The hotel is on the second, third and fourth floor with no elevator in the halls were so small it to people cannot pass each other and is definitely not handicap accessible. When we ask to speak to the manager he basically hid in the back room and forced his employees to deal with us, and the woman named "Charisma" that worked the front was the only bright spot of our whole stay. They also claim that this place is recently renovated, but in the Tip Advisor member pictures you can see that the rooms look the same in 2008 as they do now. We also used their crib for our son and the next morning he had bumps on his arms and legs that look like bed bug bites. We will never stay at this hotel again!

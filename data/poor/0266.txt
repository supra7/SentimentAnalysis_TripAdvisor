I booked a room here for a conference. I should have known that this stay would be a disaster when they told me they would have to move me from one room to another mid-stay. In order to avoid this, I am now paying extra for my room above the printed conference rate. Well, as I write this review, I am sitting in the hotel lobby. I have been here for about two hours because my room is not ready. Granted, check-in time is supposed to be at 3:00 and I did arrive early at 1:30. However, it is now 3:00 and I have just been told that I need to wait another hour. Apparently, in this entire hotel, there is not room ready for a guest?? No effort at all from the front desk except "housekeeping is working as fast as they can." They did not have a perky response when I noted that other people are being checked into their rooms. I know because I have been here for 2 hours watching! I have not even seen the room and I already dislike this place. I will not be returning and I will also suggest that my colleagues stay elsewhere when they attend conferences or vacation in Seattle.

My company booked me a room here for my week stay in Boston for work. I arrived at the hotel around 1pm and I was told my room would not be ready until after 3pm. (this was a little irritating because I was sick with a fever upon my arrival to Boston, but that was not the issue.) I waited in the lobby area for over 2 hours. I watched countless people arrive and check into their rooms. After 3 pm I went back to the front desk where a very rude woman informed me my room was still not ready. I waited for another hour in the lobby!! Finally around 4:15 my standard room was 'ready'. I checked into the room and was about there for an hour when the front desk called and said they had given me the wrong room and I HAD to change. I had to re-pack my things and move to another floor to a room that looked almost identical. The room itself was old and the bathroom was tiny! (not to mention the huge dust bunny i found next to the bed!)Every night the person in the room next to mine had somebody smoking, and the smoke filled in my room. I called the front desk, and they informed me that it was a smoked free hotel, but clearly my neighbor did not care. And no surprise when I checked my credit card when I got home they charged for 2 rooms the first day. They did take charge off when I called, but it only added to the miserable experience. I normally don't complain about a stay no matter the experience but this could not go unspoken. The staff was rude, the hotel was out-dated, but the location was great.

this hotel is well located and most of the front desk staff are lovely, but that is about where it ends. the property is very dated, and the decor is dark. the outside of the building is filthy, and the dark colors inside make it a bit depressing. some of the rooms require long walks and staircases between where buildings have been joined. those rooms have low ceilings and are long and low and have lift windows which make them feel like bunkers. The food is very average and in four days, i am unable to get a bottle of water out of a ending machine. room services delivers without enough plates and silverware and no water on the tray. i am so sorry this was out choice for our trip.

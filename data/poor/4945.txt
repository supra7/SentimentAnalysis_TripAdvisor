Th place was so filthy and stinky that we had to pack and leave. It was a nightmare. Everything was old and dirty we didn't have the heart to let our kids touch anything. So we checked in a hotel. It was expensive because we had no resrvation, but worth it. On top of all that , you had tram running on top the whole time.

I made reservations here online for a business seminar two months in advance. Soon thereafter, due to work scheduling, I could not make it so I decided to cancel. Little did I know, the reservation I made included a small print statement of full pre-payment with no cancellations. I spoke to two people there and discussed my situation and noted the early notice to cancel but they would not bulge. No customer service whatsoever and sounded like some cheap motel receptions. WHAT A SCAM! I realize the economy is unstable but still, they have no effort to live up to their name, or what I USED TO think of their standards. NEVER MAKING RESERVATIONS WITH HYATT WORLDWIDE!!!

We reserved a 2 bedroom suite - which was essentially a run down old apartment. The tile floors in the bathroom had huge cracks large enough to pour water in. The toilet rocked when you sat on it. The towel racks had been relocated up the wall 3 times and the old holes remained in the wall - unpatched- wall paper torn. The sliding glass door to the balcony took 2 people to open and close. A complete kitchenette with empty cupboards - no utensils, dishes, pots, pans. The outlets were not grounded so the microwave had an adapter plug to accomodate the 2 prong outlets. I can only imagine how long its been since the carpet was cleaned- and I had to wonder what sort of activites had taken place on the couch - ick. There was a dirty spoon behind one bed. The upside... surprisingly enough we did NOT see any bugs and if you looked beyond the rusty drains and fixtures - the tub, sink and toilet appeared to be clean. The front desk staff was pleasant and the housekeeper was very helpful. This was not worth $120/night.

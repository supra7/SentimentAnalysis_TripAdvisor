We were promised a King-size bed but were given a Queen-size bed. When this was reported to the front desk, the response was short. "This is all that we have. Would you like an additional bed?" I had to keep reminding myself that we were supposedly in a 5 star hotel. The service was appalling. The security guard at the entrance to the elevators was extremely rude. During my three night stay, the same guy asked me for my room key three times. On two of those occasions, he ignored other well dressed White gentlemen to ask me. Those occasions embarrassed my wife and me a great deal. We were there on a holiday and to get some relaxation, not to be harrassed by some big bouncer-type guy. Then, we had a poor in-suite dining experience. The waiter dropped a glass of water, broke it but assured us that everything was fine. He then left after which my wife and I found a number of glass pieces. The waiter never came back to clean the mess. This hotel does not warrant a 4 star rating, let alone 5. I don't think I'll be booking into Trump International in the future. There were a number of other Hotels that we visited in Las Vegas that had better staff service. I guess all that glitters is not gold.

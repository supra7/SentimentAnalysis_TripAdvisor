We will not be staying at this hotel ever again. First, I was told that there would be parking for guest, then when we discovered the garage closed, we were told to circle around the building to another garage. This garage was also full, and we were assured that we would be allowed to park in the first garage if we presented our room key. Well that certainly did not happen, and after being told rudely that we would just have to find someplace else, we ended up parking 1/2 mile away (would have been nice if we could have at least unloaded our luggage). So I call the front desk when we are in our room, and they assure me we will NOT be charged for parking. You can guess what happened then --- morning receipt shows parking charged against my credit card. When I go downstairs to registration and say we have been overcharged, the clerk argues with me about whether being charged for parking (when you couldn't park) is actually an "overcharge". Again rudely informed me that I was using the wrong term. Embassy Suites here we come.

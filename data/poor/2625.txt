If you go to bedbugregistry.com you'll see this hotel is listed as having bedbugs on several different ocassions. See for yourself. I attached photos of the 18 bites she woke up with. We spent the week at the urgent treatment center, dealing with disrespectful staff, and having to get rid of our belongings. I'm still disguisted with their desire to keep the incident hidden from other customers only. They accused my coworker of lying about the bites only to have another traveler capture a bed bug in his bed a week later.

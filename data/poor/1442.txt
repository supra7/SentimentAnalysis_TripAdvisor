Room smelled like ther was mold in it, they claim to have Wi-Fi...could never get connected...even tho my Lap Top worked at the other two hotels we stayed at. One clerk was a racist, whenever we would tell her something was not done right with our room...soap, room make up etc...she always said "it's those foreigners who we have working here", The whole town for that matter was not worth the time and money we spent..we can say I guess, we done that and been there...thats about it.

I'm generally not that demanding and can tolerate some pretty average places. But this hotel is chuff. Two normal size adults can't both stand in the room at the same time. The suitcase just about fit up the stairs, but I might as well not have bothered since it then took up half the room. Even if it was cheap, which it wasn't, it wouldn't be worth putting up with. Don't bother.

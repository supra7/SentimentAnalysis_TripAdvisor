I was traveling into Chicago from out of state early Saturday evening and was literally pulling onto Ohio St. when Best Western called to tell me they didn't have a room for me anymore. This is after I had booked the room online and secured a confirmation number. They were upfront in that they had secured another room for me for free - at O'Hare - another 40 minutes away. Well, not wanting to drive any further, not to mention the fact that my entire evening and next morning was planned out and depended on a downtown hotel location, I just couldn't accept this proposal. I had two options to call friends that lived closer than O'Hare and that I would rather try them. So, I let the room go at O'Hare. Sad to say, I couldn't reach any of my friends, so swallowing my pride, I called Best Western back. Sorry, the room had been released and I would have to make any reservations myself now and pay for the room myself. I explained that I had a wife with me, a two year old, and a 6 week old and had no other options. Sorry, once I released the room they had no other obligation to find me another one or to pay for the courtesy of totally screwing my family and me. Should I have taken the free hotel room at O'Hare from the start? Maybe or maybe not, but what I do know is that this is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.

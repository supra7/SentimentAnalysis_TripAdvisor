We drove up to the doors of the Plaza and were greated by the Valet that charged 36.00 US for parking. The lobby is impressive - but then there is the 1 star motel room. This place is a dump. Very dirty rooms. Our floor was supposed to be non-smoking but smelled like a cigar bar, You can bearly fit your suitcases in the rooms they are so small. The walls are thin and you can hear everything in the next room. The hotel is in a good location but not worth staying at. I wouldnt even get under the comforter as the room was that dirty. If you travel often as I do I would warn you against this hotel. The rooms are really that bad. Stay somewhere else!!

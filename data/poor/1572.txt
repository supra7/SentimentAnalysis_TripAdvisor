My friend and I stayed at The Sterling Hotel Dallas Oct. 10-12, 2003 and it was the worst hotel stay we've ever had. Once you stepped off the elevator (4th floor) the carpet did not look like it had been vaccumed. Our room smelled like dog and the carpet had a damp feel to it. This was before and after the room had been cleaned. You could clearly see that the bedspread had not been washed (stained). The maid only left 1 washcloth and said she couldn't leave any more than that. After 4 unsuccessful calls my friend finally went to the front desk and got some. Upon check out we were told that they had run out of clean washcloths. No compensation or restitution was offered. Not even an apology.

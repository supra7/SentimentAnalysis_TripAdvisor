This is an absolutely appalling hotel - the rooms are dated and it smelled! The breakfast is almost inedible: bacon, scrambled eggs looked like food you could feed your dog!, watered down fruit(?) juice! There are serious buildings works outside the hotel! The hotel staff seem friendly but I'm sure as hell not going there again! This hotel is rated a 4* but the hotel is so bad the 4* seems like a joke - someone's having a laugh for sure! "DREADFUL"

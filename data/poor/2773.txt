I organized a group of 7 people plus myself for a week long business trip. Having stayed at The Time several months ago and had a great experience, this time was horrible and embarassing for me, being the organizer. Everyone had room problems which included one or more of the following: - broken TVs - Air conditioning not working - No water pressure - shower heads leaking and spraying water all over the bathroom - Internet service issues (service down for 2 days) - some of the rooms are so small there's only 12" between the end of the bed and the wall The staff is generally nice, but not very competent. They're very young and seem rather "green" when it comes to hotel customer service. They want to help, but not really sure what to do. There's potential here, but the management needs to step in and the rooms all need serious maintenance work.

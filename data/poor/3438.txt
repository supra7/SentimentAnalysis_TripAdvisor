The WORST hotel I've ever stayed in. A lifetime traveller, and someone who frequently stays in New York hotel, I ended up in this pit after my usual was booked. 1) The staff has an attitude. The front desk manager, a man named Chris who must have graduated from the Al Queda School of Personality Dynamics, is, without a doubt, the most hostile service employee I have ever encountered. 2) In 2007, a New York hotel where the heat, television and internet doesn't work??? I spent nearly two hours on the phone trying to get online, and complaints about heat and television resulted in NOTHING. 3) At nearly $500 a night, I would have done better sleeping in a cab for the night and it would have been a whole lot cheaper. 4) There should a college course entitled, "How Not to Treat Guests - a Case Study of the Beekman Tower Hotel." In a word, DON'T.

My husband and I recently returned from our honeymoon on Maui. We stayed at the Grand Wailea, and it was WRETCHED! I was truly astonished at the rude staff, the absurd prices, and my personal favorite.... the screaming kids outside of our door at 7:00 a.m. (every morning) I complained to the front desk three different times, and was met with apathy or worse. There is an adults only area that was overrun with smoking teenage girls, and mommies thinking it was very cute to watch their children swim the distance of the pool splashing everyone in sight. Yes, I realize it is a swimming pool, but come on..... There is a huge area for the kids to play to their hearts content. We asked security to remedy the situation and were once again given the disdainful look. I would highly recommend to anyone considering this hotel to NOT DO IT! I could spend all night speaking to the ridiculous policies and terrible service, but you get the point. On a closing note just for those of you who are still considering it, the cost of a bottle of water is 7.95. I swear! ps we had fabulous service at the Four Seasons that is located right down the street.

Since this hotel got good reviews I decided to stay here. Firsty my room was so dirty, filthy cupboard doors, kitchen surface, oven, table tops, hair on the floor, dirty rugs, I wiped to surfaces with a white towel..it was black. I had to get housekeeping to come and clean the place..at 10pm at night, and vacumm the apartment myself. When I went to go to the airport at 5.15am, all the staff were asleep on the front desk and chairs in the lobby. Breakfast was terrible, dirty room, cockroach ran out from under the bread basket. Pool was closed. Corridor outside my room smelt like a toilet. Woman at the front desk rude and unapologetic. They charged me a horrendous price for 4 local calls and there was no sign or information saying that calls would be charged. My family arrived from NZ, and I had organised this hotel, I was embarrassed to have booked this place. I wouldn't recommend anyone stay here.

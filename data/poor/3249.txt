I booked two nights at Encore as a gift to my parents and my aunt. When I was booking the room through Expedia, I specifically asked for two queen size beds instead of one king size bed. They put me on hold for several minutes and I got the confirmation in the email for the two queen size beds in the room. Then I called to confirm it again just in case. However upon my parents arrival, the front desk gave them a room with ONE bed then had told them that this was a special request made by a third party (Expedia) and that they do not guarantee such request and that they did not have a room with two beds available at the time. SO I called Expedia, and now they are telling me the same thing and that I should re-read all the fine prints on my confirmation email. Then when I asked to speak to a manager, they put me on hold for a while then told me that they contacted the hotel and they gave my parents a different room with two beds. By then, I didn't feel good about how this was handled. Why all this unnecessary time and phone conversations?? So I called Encore front desk and she was so RUDE and was not willing to listen. When I was trying to explain that I had the confirmation emails through Expedia, she told me that they don't honor third party requests . Then why do they even have services through Expedia?? It wasn't like I paid less than any other customers. I did not understand where the rudeness was coming from. I paid high prices for their cheap services. Like I said, this was supposed to be a nice gift to my parents but the hotel service made my parents feel like I got them a room through some kind of a cheap discounts when I paid over $450. I really wish booked the room somewhere else and used a different service.

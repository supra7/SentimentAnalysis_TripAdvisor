Think twice about staying at this hotel. They do NOT care about their customers at all. My daughter and I booked two nights at this hotel. We informed the hotel that we would be arriving late. I booked a "deluxe king bed" room. We checked in at 11pm. They made small talk to us at checking in. We were sent to room 1615 on the 16th floor in a dark corner of the hallway. To our surprise and dissapointment, it was a closet sized room with a full bed. Not a king size, not even a queen. It was a full size bed pushed up against a wall. I immediately called the front desk and they informed me that I booked a queen. Well, if I did, then why did they give me a full? So, I said that I had the printout from the internet and re-confirmed it before I left. So, the girl shut up, but the proceeded to tell me that they were fully booked! My daughter had to sleep on the floor because the bed was so small. She is a size 1 and I'm a size 12, so it wasn't because we were large people. It was so tiny in there. The bathroom floor didn't even close. We had to prop it closed with a phone book. It stunk in the room as well. The sink was all cracked and it was a horrible place. They took 70 bucks off of my 250 dollar room. BIG DEAL! I was moved into a deluxe king room the next night. It was a little too late. It was what I should have gotten in the first place. And, even if they did give my room away and were sticking me in this full size bedroom, why didn't they tell me this when checking in?? They apologized, but nobody got the manager for me. It was not a good place to stay. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!

I had a negative experience here. I was staying with my elderly father, and there were no non-slip strips in the bathtub, nor mats. Long story short, he fell (fortunately he was ok), and so I asked for a change of room to a walk in shower. Frankly, after he fell, they should have comped us the room. We could totally sue for negligence. At any rate, the new room had a funny smell and an odd hum, which was later identified as the air conditioner of the conference center. Nothing they could do. They had no other room to change us to, and actually offered to give us a "discount" on another room! Further, the handicapped room had no place to hang clothes that were knee length (as if disabled people do not either travel with able bodied people). When I finally expressed my dismay, they gave me a discount to the hotel restaurant! (I don't live in Champaign--when am I going to use this?). The hotel staff was disingenuously nice. Yuck! I'm staying at the Hilton the next time.

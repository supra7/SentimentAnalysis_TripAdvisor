I was given an upgrade to as suite because of my gold status which should always be a good thing. The suite smelled musty or just old. There were cigarette burns in the rugs and the sofa as well. When I did mention this to the front desk, the person told me that they can't help it if people smoke in non-smoking room. Of course, I know that's true, but you can change rugs and such if there are holes in them. If this was an upgrade, I didn't even want to see the regular room they might change me too. I stayed at 11 diff Hilton properties in the span of 3 weeks and by far this was the only disapointment. I am used to having a clean nice room whether it's at a Hampton or Homewood or Doubletree etc. I so would NEVER go back there again. To top it all off, it turned out to be the most expensive on my trip through the US. Go somewhere else.

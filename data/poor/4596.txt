My friends and I stayed at this hotel for EMF 2012. It was definitely not what we expected from an Embassy Suites. Rooms in terrible condition, 2 hours for breakfast. The worst thing was being robbed. We left our hotel for a couple of hours only to return to a clean room, but our IPads, money, MEDICINE, jewelry, GONE!!! Hotel staff was too accommodating, but overall, we were told by letter that they were not responsible since we did not utilize a safe. We will be seeking legal action!

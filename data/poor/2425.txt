Horrible experience at this Ritz Carlton. We checked in, althought the grounds were very pretty, the hotel itself left MUCH to be desired. We stayed here on our honeymoon & our travel agent recommended it. Our biggest problem was that the hotel was infested with roaches. We checked in and thought everything was fine. The food was a bit pricey, especially for the quality. I have stayed at many Ritz Carltons, but this has been the lowest in quality (not only from a Ritz Carlton standard, but from a hotel standard in general). The food was ok....nothing to rave about, at all. Getting back to the main subject....we enjoyed the day travelling around, but when we came back to the "Ritz", we relaxed in the lobby- had a drink, then went back to our room. We turned on the lights in the room & we saw roaches scurrying to avoid the light. Then we tried to step on the ones on the floor, but there were at least 15 in sight (on the walls and ceiling). When we turned on the bathroom light, the same thing occured. I was livid and I complained to management, who told me that this has been a problem and they are trying to deal with it. They did not have another room, so my husband and had to sleep with the light on and take turns staying awake. Needless to say, we left there in a hurry in the morning. I would not recommend staying here - what a poor choice for our honeymoon.

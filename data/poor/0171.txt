I knew that this hotel was 2/3rd the cost of the W next door, so didn't expect luxe accommodations. But my floor reeked of mold from the broken ice machine, the "air conditioning" couldn't bring the room temp down a single degree, and the window opened only a fraction, so sleep was hard to come by. Other issues: - Mattress was well past its prime, you could feel the springs through the top foam - Room was very small, bathroom awkwardly small - Tub didn't drain properly - No desk to write at (odd for a hotel named Executive) Water pressure was good, and staff did their best with what they have been given. Mgmt needs to invest in the infrastructure though. I'm going to ask my company to take this hotel off its list of preferred vendors when I get home. Lots of overseas visitors -- it makes me sad that this is their first stop. If your budget is counted out to the pennies, and you plan to do no work in the hotel room, just sleep there, and you don't mind a room temp closer to 80 than 60, and you aren't allergic to mold, might be your best option in this part of $town$.

My husband and I stayed here for the final two days of our honeymoon much to our regret. We had great expectations of relaxing in an Ocean View room - but could not see the ocean from the room and only a partial view from the lanai. We complained that the room we were given was only a partial ocean view. I was appalled when the front desk rudely told us that we should have read the fine print - an ocean view room is if you can see part of the ocean from any where on the lanai. When we tried to work with the front desk for a room closer to our expectations they asked for an additional $443 per night - too much for us to afford. We were so disappointed I wanted to move to another hotel, but the front desk informed us that since we didn't cancel 72 hours in advance we would be charged for the room anyway. This was a disappointing end to our honeymoon and we would recommend that you choose another hotel. Thank you.

We traded in 250,000 Hilton points for quick and inexpensive trip to Hawaii. Let me tell you, this property all around is BAD. I'm a Hilton Diamond person, so I've stayed a lots of Hiltons, from NYC, to Buenos Aires to Omaha! This was the worst Hilton property I've ever stayed in. They advertise rooms at about 650 sq ft, which is really large for a hotel room. Their standard rooms aren't anywhere NEAR that size. We found the hotel to be filthy. Lobby area tables littered with garbage. The tile floors chipped and in bad condition. The baseboards were not only filthy but almost black from the wear and tear. I did let the management know how disappointed I was and they put us in their $1300 per night suite for $200 bucks per night. While it was roomier, it was still outdated, worn down and tattered. We walked out the next day giving up our points to pay $650 a night at the Ritz Carlton and I'm so glad we did. What others wright about having to fight for pool chairs at 7 AM is absolutely true. This hotel was sold out while we were there. So they can definitely fill the rooms- maybe that's why they don't make changes. But, if you are expecting luxury here, run away fast cause you won't find it at the Grand Wailea. The Rizt Carlton on the other hand was aboslute perfection. Sorry for the bad news here, but what I say is 100% true.

I'm not sure where to begin. I'm depressed just thinking about it. On our honeymoon, we came to Harvest House from Milliken Creek (which was phenomenal) and all we wanted to do was leave. We first booked a Spa Vineyard room and were greeted with a 1970s style room with an inflatable hot tub and disgusting bath fixtures, peeling wall paper, smelly, ugly curtains, a mini fridge that looked like it came from 1977, and cheap patio furniture. For what we were paying, it was dismal. We were moved to a Fountain room which was at least updated with a new bathroom, but at the cost of being on a parking lot next to the highway. The breakfast was atrocious. It was like summer camp but worse, with fat kids sticking their hands in bowls of hard boiled eggs, extra charges for espresso and literally zero variety beyond sugary pastries. You sit at tables crowded in a room designed to look like a 1970's hickville storefront with soggy salami on plates and hokey EVERYTHING. I wanted to get out as soon as I sat down. The shower, even though updated with nice slate tiles, was horrible, too. I froze to death and the floor was covered in water. For the price, save yourself the despair. This place reminds me of something I would have liked at age 9 in the 70s. Strips of Christmas lights adorn all the brick walkways, the decor is tired, sad and ugly and ruined 2 days of our honeymoon. Never again.

This hotel was simply not worth it! The customer service leaves much to be desired. The room service was terrible. We didn't receive new coffee or water bottles daily. No newspaper was brought to our room. They didn't refresh the room with new towels, soap, or toiletries daily. When I went to complain, the manager was too busy (after making us wait 10 minutes). Staff was not very nice on other occassions... The location is good, and the view from the Ocean Tower is great, but the service was not up to par.

We were looking for a nice hotel in the St. Charles/Prytania area. It looked good in the pictures. It was awful. We were on the 3rd floor. They negleceted to meniton there was no elevator (well there was one but it did not seem to work). The high ceilings gave great ambiance, but it meant going up 2 flights was 6 sets of stairs. We got there and the room did not seem bad. A little musty and old, but not awful. THEN: We climbed into bed and there was no bed pad or pillow liner. The towels were cheap and small, the spread was old. The shower was clogged. We finally asked to move. We were moved downstairs. Still no bed pad or pillow liners) We went out and when we came in there were a few personal items we had left in the other room. They were in a clear trash bag on our bed. I openedit up and my husband said: wait a minute there is trash (truly most discusting stuff you can imagine). My husband went down to talk to management. I tried to wash my hadns and found yellow water coming out of the faucet. We checked out and went across the street to the Comfort inn. $20 less a night, clean and breakfast and a lap pool.

We had booked a 4 night stay at the hotel, but left after the first night. We stayed in a 1 bedroom with 2 double beds that was located behind the reception. The room was in very poor shape, the kitchen and bathrooms were very old, the air conditioning did not work properly, the bathrooms were not very clean, the bathtub plugs were broken, the taps dripped all the time, and the beds were not comfortable. The people who were in the room before us also left early. We asked for a different room, but the only one offered had only 1 bed, but it did look in better shape. The largest pool is also not very nice, it is all surrounded by concrete and located on top of the parking garage.

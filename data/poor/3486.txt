Stayed only one night (THANKfully) and the smoke alarm would not stop screaming during the night. My husband had to get dressed and go to the front desk. Someone then came back to the room, turned on the lights (at 3:30am) and had to remove the smoke detector (AND it was one that spoke saying carbon monoxide had been detected!). After all this, we were still charged full price. As we were heading out for breakfast, the front desk told my husband feel free to check out between 12:00pm - 1:00pm. When we checked out at 12:30pm, we were told that due to our inconvenience through the night, they were waving the late check-out fee which is normally an extra $50-70. How about telling us upfront that we could check out late due to the inconvenience or have $50 taken off our bill when we check out on time?!! I am completely fine with paying for what I asked for, which was a room for one night, but I think it's bad customer service when the facts are not laid out up front only so they get what they want in the end with no regard for the customer.

Well, I paid $200 for a night of fun in the Tower on New Years 2010/11. What a disappointment: the Skydeck was closed to the public which meant shooting photos through glass only, the line up for drinks was 1/2hr (no joke) and the "food stations" were empty by 10:pm. A very drunken patron spilled his drink on me (and my very expensive Armani suit) while Security seemed to be nowhere. Don't get me wrong... I LOVE Vegas but save your cash and party on LVBLVD like everybody else!

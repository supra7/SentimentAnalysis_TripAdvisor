We stayed at the Maui Ritz Carlton for 4 days in early July. Although we are frequent visitors to Hawaii, we had never stayed at this property before and we will never stay there again. I am not one of the hyper-critical reviewers that you come across online but I do have high expectations when I stay at a property such as a Ritz Carlton. I'm happy to pay $400+ a night but I hate to get ripped off with poor accommodations and poor service. I've stayed at some very nice Ritz Carlton properties such as the Chicago and Hong Kong locations but this Maui resort is not one of them. We had two rooms and they were both quite worn. The cheap furniture(especially the TV credenza) has not aged well. The TV was something you would find in a 1970's Ramada...very strange! Overall cleanliness should have been better, especially around the toilet paper holders...gross! They use an industrial strength air freshener in the rooms that can be quite overwhelming. At least the bed was comfortable. Where are the flowers? At most Hawaiian resorts, you are surrounded by fresh orchids in bathrooms, hallways, etc. There were very few at this property. The room service that we used several times did not even come with a flower...something that a Marriott in Kansas City can do...why not the Ritz in Maui? There is a very stinky type of plant they have on their grounds near the rooms...why don't they get rid of them? The beach is not your typical Hawaiian resort beach...way down the hill from the hotel. It looked more like a beach you would find in Wisconsin. Dark murky water and mostly pine trees. The hotel pool was small for Hawaii standards and void of any character. The staff was less than helpful. Not once did they ask if we needed directions when we picked our car up from the valet(we encountered this courtesy at every other resort we visited during the trip). Details make the difference and this hotel is lacking in them. There are some superb resorts in Maui but this is not one of them.

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE HOTEL. If you have the option, please do not stay here... there are several other oceanfront hotels in the same price range that actually have clean rooms, respectable management, and adequate maid service. Ive been going to Ocean City since 1991 and this hotel was by far the worst experience Ive had. couples, families, young people...avoid this hotel and their rude management at all costs.

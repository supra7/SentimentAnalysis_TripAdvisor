I have stayed at this hotel for the last 4 years and had no incidents. I like the location and have found the staff pleasant. However this year the woman who checked me out was so abusive towards me I will not return. We did not exchange more than 10 words the entire time I was there. I have no idea why she treated me this way but taking my 2600.00 while treating me with such abuse is degrading. I can only assume this woman thinks she can judge people then treat them as she pleases. I will not let this woman abuse me again. What she did was painfully traumatic.

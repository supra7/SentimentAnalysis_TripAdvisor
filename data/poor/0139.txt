This hotel is quite deceiving. Visit their website, read their literature, even walk into their lobby, and you'll believe that you are in for a treat... though quickly you'll be terribly disappointed. It wasn't long after check in that I needed some ice. After roaming the halls and not finding an ice machine I call the front desk, only to find that there is no self serve ice machine... ok, I could live with that, but waiting for it to be delivered (30 minutes later) was not okay. Next up, I decide to take advantage of their shuttle service... of course that is not as advertised- it must be arranged 24 hours in advance and only stops at a few locations at fixed times throughout the day! Inconvenient and impractical. Ask the front desk for directions, tourist advice, ANYTHING, and you're confronted with a whole lot of Uhhhh's and hmmmm's. Not helpful! All of this I could deal with, but the clincher came when the "free wi-fi in every room" wasn't working in our room. I went to the front desk and told an (overwhelming) blond agent my problem, and she said that the wi-fi was complimentary and thus not guaranteed. When I pressed the issue, she said she'd talk to the manager, but as I walked away she said some incredibly rude and degrading things about me!!! Of course, I was eventually contacted by a manager who said there was nothing she could do about the internet, but when I told her what the front desk agent had said,she said I must have misheard!!! Urgh... I've never been confronted with such an overall lack of professionalism and ineptitude in all of my travels. There must be better places to stay in Seattle.

We booked a July 4th stay to watch the fireworks. When I called I told the person at the hotel we were staying there to WATCH THE FIREWORKS. Instead of telling me the fireworks would be at Grant park on that night only and would not be viewable from the hotel at all, he said that an act of god might prevent fireworks viewing. Now to me an act of god is bad weather, not 5 tall buildings blocking the view. I felt misled and cheated. I brought my 80 year old mother there to see Chicagos fireworks and instead saw nothing. The Swissotel really misled me. Instead of a future customer they have a disapointed former guest who will not be back. We spend alot of time in Chicago on weekend trips. It will never be at this hotel again.

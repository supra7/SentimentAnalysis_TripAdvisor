i would not recommend this hotel.. checked-in room was small considering the price...pool was small and "green" could not let the children swim. family members found the bar maid at the outside bar rude and unprofessional..after speaking with the manager about these issues we decided to check out immediately . Found another hotel more modern less expensive with great amenities extended our stay for an additional 2 days. I agree with the review written by roxi06 from nj...

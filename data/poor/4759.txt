The was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. The moment my wife and walked in I knew there was trouble. The carpet was filthy and had an odor in the lobby. We switched our first room because of the odor and the next room we got had gum stains in the carpet, not to mention stains on the bed spread. Simply Horrible!

This hotel is a one star hotel and for the money there are lots of better options. Upon arrival, I tried to call the front desk to ask if I could change rooms. Of course, the phone did not work. I went to the front desk to let them know that the phone didnt work and that the smoke alarm was gone and to see if they had a different room because the one I was in was so dated and the carpet was so old and worn that it was gross. Well, they didn't have another room and during my three days they never fixed the phone. It's really just a run down hotel and not worth really any amount of money with all the options in NYC. Don't stay there.

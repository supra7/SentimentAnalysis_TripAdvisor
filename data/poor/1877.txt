My boyfriend and I (in our mid 20s) were treated like delinquents...not allowed to have beer in our room, followed by bellmen/doormen. We paid a steep price and requested 2 beds since a couple friends were staying with us and they had to sneak in or risk getting kicked out or charged extra money. You can't use the elevator unless you have a room key, so it's a complete hassle having anyone visit or come by your room. Very tiny rooms and bathrooms for such a "nice" and expensive place. Great location but that's all it has going for it.

The rug in the room was very dirty, front desk staff were very rude, they gave us a single room instead of a double which we requested. Rugs in the hallway also very dirty. I've stayed at many hotels over the years, one or two may have been just as bad, but at least the front desk staff were kind and curtious, and made you feel welcomed. Will not stay there again or recommend it to anyone!

Pirat's cove was filthy, and old. No bar, no restaurant, no one at the front desk when we arrived. Our room key and parking pass was left in our unlocked room. The room was dirty, with out dated furniture, and bugs. We were suppose to stay four nights and left after one. We wouldn't of stayed the one night but we arrived from our flight late. we went right up the road to Holiday Inn Express, which was great by the way!

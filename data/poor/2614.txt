Unfortunately it was NOT what some reviews said. To start off the location is great but not the hotel itself. The rooms are very beaten up, the air conditioner unit is very noisy, there is great humidity which leads to mold, which is visible in bedroom and the bathroom walls, and not to even mention the smell of the room was just unbearable. The closet hangers are embarrassing- old abused-wire dry cleaning hangers, the door handle was broken. Every time we opened the door the handle would fall on our feet. I did let the front desk know, but there was nothing they could do about it, and no offer of any option to reacommodate us or look for a solution.

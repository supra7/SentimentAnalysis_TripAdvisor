Ew! What a terrible place! The best comparison to this place would be a random roadside Motel. Old rooms, tube tv's, tiny bathroom, postage stamp sized towels - the whole place just looked and felt dated and dirty. The food offerings were barely a step above fast foods. The crowd this place attracted looked more like a methamphetamine convention group - tatoos, grossly obese etc. - I could not wait to leave and get a clean shower. The room furniture was old and the place looked like they ran out of money for maintenance/updating. I would not put my toe in any pool/water park water - this place just gave me the chills and grossed me out in all respects.

For the price I really expected so much more (I stayed in one of their suites). Their photos on line looked way nicer then the actual room. The walls where PAPER thin. I could hear the person in the next room taking a bath (at 6am) and the sound was amplified and echoed through my room. I payed the extra 10 bucks for their business package. I was still charged for parking (they took it off eventually, but I had to ask them twice). Even though my checkout time was 4pm (part of their business package) the maid service knocked on my door 3 times! (I should mention, I had a do not disturb sticker on my door) Then, the maid service actually called my room to find out what time I was leaving. I have NEVER had that happen before, late check out or not. Lastly, I was locked out of the elevator twice and had to go to the front desk to get back in to my room. I will never stay there again.

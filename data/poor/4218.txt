Darn these beds are like sleeping on rocks. Nice location and lobby but the double bed garden view rooms are lousy. From your bed you can see the silohuette of the person in the shower. Nice thing if you are with a lover but lousy if you are traveling for business and sharing room with a buddy. Overall one of the worse room I have stayed in many years. Take this from a guy who travels one or twice a month.

My boyfriend and I stayed there 4 days/3 nights in late November of 2011, few days before Thanksgiving. Upon checking in, I noticed a black stain on my pillow case. I mentioned it to my boyfriend, and we assumed it was a stain that didn't come out during the wash. Next day, after having specifically requested the room to be made and sheets/towels to be changed (because we were in and out of the room and had wanted it done while we were gone), we came back to the room to find the same pillow case with the stain on the bed. I then lifted up the comforter and found hair still on the sheet. We called the front desk (Chris) and complained. Because it was late at night, he was the only staff on duty, besides security, he offered to let us have another room. We went up to check the cleanliness of the new room, with the security, and found the same exact problem. The sheet in the new room had hair and stain on it as well; they were never changed from the last occupancy. We then went back down, and that's when Chris told us that we were the 3rd complaint of the night. Other people noticed the dirty sheets/rooms as well! Because it was so late at night, we compromised by accepting fresh sheets from the dryer from Chris (and made the bed ourselves) and he comped the night, promising us the manager (Rick) will call us the next day. The manager never called, and the sheets never changed. If Hotel Indigo doesn't clean the room when there are guests and doesn't clean the room when they leave, when are the rooms ever cleaned? We will never stay again.

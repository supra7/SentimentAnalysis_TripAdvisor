Disgusting Hotel !! We choose this hotel from the pictures on the internet. Well this hotel is definitly not anything like the pictures. I found a cockroach in my room and my friend found a white worm in her milk!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now thats what I call disgusting. It is not because the hotel is inexpensive that it has to be dirty.The rooms are small, so are alot of hotel rooms in Europe, I personally didn't mind the size but hygene should be a priority. I do not reccomend this hotel.................

Five star prices, one star hotel I went to this hotel in 1978, I've changed but the hotel hasn't changed at all, same carpet same furnishings, same everything. It is inconceivable to me that after thirty years the Kahala has not spent a dime to upgrade the facility. If you are looking for a time warp to the 70's, by all means book a trip. If not go someplace else.

Moldy is the best word to describe this place! Despite being in a no smoking room there are people smoking cigars and cigarettes all around us! The room is old and dirty and smells like mold! And it is over 300 a night for this! I have never written a review before but this place takes the cake. I'll be attempting to book the Marriot or Sheraton tomorrow. And checkin takes FOREVER! Parking is a hassle! I loved the Hyatt in Waikiki but this is really no comparison!

Mold and mildew galore! We arrived at the RH n October 8th. Check in was very fast and the staff were very friendly and expedient.We had booked an oceanfront room for two nights in the newer tower at a rate of $373/nt. Upon opening the door, we were assaulted with the smell of mildew and mold. We opened the lanai door, unloaded our stuff and went for a walk, hoping that some freh air would solve the problem. Unfortunately, when we returned it was just as bad as before. I have a severe allergy to mold and mildew and knew I could not stay in the room.I went down to the front desk and was given a key for another room. Unfortunately, it was as bad as the first room. So, we packed up our stuff and went down to check out. The front desk staff were very understanding and waived all of our charges. He even let me use the phone to book a room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. (see my other review)We spoke with some other guests at the RH who didn't seem to have the problems we had, so perhaps we just had bad luck.The RH is closing next June for a much needed renovation. Word on the street locals is that they are closing b/c the mold and mildew problem is widespread and even dangerous in some areas of the hotel. Again, this is local scuttlebutt, and hasn't been verified.I do hope they get the problem under control; the RH is such a grand old dame, truly regal and deserves to be restored to her former greatness.

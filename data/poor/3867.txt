I don't know what these other people think is decent but this place is not what I call decent. I read the reviews and thought it wouldn't be so bad. I wish someone would have told the truth so I would not have wasted my money. There are two things I can say that was decent at this place, the grounds were tropical and large and the air conditioner worked great. I have never written a review before but I thought this deserved one. I don't want to be unfair but I am going to state the truth. The room was filthy, they did make the bed everyday but they did not clean the room. They did not bother to clean the sink and counter in the bathroom everyday. The ceiling was cracked and falling, rusty pipes on the ceiling, moldy shower curtain, it was terrible. The "small beach" across the street was "No Beach" at high tide. There is a part of this hotel that is falling down and boarded up. You would be advised to spend a few extra dollars and go someplace else, I would have but I prepaid and didn't have that choice. I don't know if we just got "lucky" and had a bad room but I would not recommend taking the chance. This website is to research hotels and I hope people pay attention to this review. Again, I wish someone else would have been upfront and truthful so I could have made a different choice. You go to Maui to enjoy the island but what time you are in your room you would expect that it would be at least clean. I see other pictures and the ones with rooms look nothing like ours. The others show views which I will admit was nice but regardless this is an old hotel that needs to be taken down, it has outlived it's life, which is obvious because half of it is boarded up and falling down. No one else has mentioned this!

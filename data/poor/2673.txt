Beware in making your reservation. My fiance and I each called separately to book a three night stay during Jazz Festival. We were told which room they had available and we booked a room for our stay. We then book our non-refundable airline reservations. The next day we received our fax confirmation that had us staying 4 nights instead of 3. I called and was informed that they had a 4 night minimum during Jazz Festival. the reservations agent had not told either of us about the minimum, nor did their fax state that there was such a minimum. I tried to rearrange our schedule, but could not. Since the hotel had not mentioned this during our multiple calls reserving the room and we had paid for non-refundable airline tickets based our our converstion with their reservation agent, I hoped that they would waive the 4th night requirement and allow us to stay the 3 nights. They apologized for the "misunderstanding", but refused. I have heard that the hotel is beautiful, but I would never stay there or recommend it to anybody due to the way we were treated.

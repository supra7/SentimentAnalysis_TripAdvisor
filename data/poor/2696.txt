I booked/reserved my room 1 month in advance and was quoted a rate of $185. When I arrived They were charging me $265. When I complained that that was not the rate I was quoted ONE MONTH BEFORE WHEN I RESERVED. A woman that should be fired and who said she is the ONLY one who takes reservations...said "you don't have a reservation...oh wait...you booked it yesterday...oh wait you did book it one month in advance but I did not take that reservation and so it is the rate I am telling you. You want to stay somewhere else...fine be my guest" When I asked to speak to a Manager I was told "There are no managers". I am not making this stuff up. So...If you don't mind a staff that could care less that you live or die and is willing to steal your money. You should stay here. Don't believe me? Read a few of the other reviews here. Since there seems to be nothing else I can do about this I guess I am trying to do what I can to let others know.

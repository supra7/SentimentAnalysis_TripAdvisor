You are only a few blocks from the space needle. But this is not the place to stay. there was no fridge in the room. only one outlet works, but they do have tons of extension cords. Thats a hazard. They told me they could possibly move me in the am. My food went bad due to no fridge. But in the AM, they said they will either move me or put a fridge in. where Im not sure. There are not enough outlets. The swimming pool is empty. We are in the middle of the summer months.

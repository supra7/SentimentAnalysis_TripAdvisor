i stayed here with my mother last june, in our reservation we had requested connecting rooms which was confirmed to us, however upon check in (which took an hour to complete) apparently no one knew of our request. we reserved two rooms at $459 a night!!! front desk staff are careless, rude, and have a very bad attitude! trying to check in took an hour, and checking out too! there's only 1 or 2 ppl at the desk at any given time. our rooms that were thankfully on the same floor at least had paper thin walls, i am typically a heavy sleeper, i could not sleep, the rooms overlooked the baseball stadium, (FYI they dont always turn off the stadium lights at night) and the curtains/blinds were not equipped to block out that much light! next morning, we ordered coffee and bagels with cream cheese to our rooms, it took about 1 hr and 35 mn to get our food. conclusion: instead of staying 2 weeks, we stayed 2 nights.. really awful hotel!

I've picked up the assos hotel name from the internet, and on 1/9/2010, I requested from them to book a room 16-17/9/2010, and gave them my arrival flight's details. They confirmed the booking on 6/9/2010 no. 4069 at Euro 55.- BB/single. On 16/9, when I showed up, they simply said: Sorry, the hotel is fully booked!

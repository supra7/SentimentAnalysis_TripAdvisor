I booked 2 non-smoking rooms 12/28,but called them ahead saying that we are running late,will arrive little late.When we arrived at 7:00 PM,we were told only smoking rooms are available.We were not ready to take the smoking rooms,so they told us to wait for 1hour for the non-smoking rooms to be cleaned.We waited for 1 hour and 30minutes,when we checked the status,person in the front desk told us to wait for another 30minutes.Then checked the status again,they asked for my mobile #,so they can call me once the room is ready.Its almost 2hours past,i talk to the manager,he said the room cleaning could take upto 4hours.Then i asked them to cancel my rooms and refund the money back,the manager went in and came back saying wait for 30minutes,if its not ready by then we will see what we can do.Finally i got my non-smoking rooms ready but after waiting for 2hours and 30 minutes.I will never go there again. 2days ago 12/26 i stayed in monte carlo,that place is very nice and $20 more than Harrahs.

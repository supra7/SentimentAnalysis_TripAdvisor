Checked in with family into a 2 bedroom suite. Design of the sliding bathroom door is such that one can look right into the bathroom toilet through the gap between the door and the wall. The guy who came to fix the problem tried to avoid doing anything by saying that is the design of the hotel. I then escalated the problem to the manager before the same guy came back to fix it. The following day, we came back from to our rooms at 5pm, expecting to take a rest before going out again for dinner. To our dismay, the rooms were NOT done up. When I reported the problem, the woman answering at the "service express" said that the time for doing the rooms each day is 9 to 530pm - meaning there is nothing wrong. Came 5:30pm, still no one came to clean up our rooms until I called and complained again. Do you need that when you are supposed to be relaxing and unwinding? No more Westin for me, I am afraid.

The hotel lobby is spectacular, i got a lot of time to admire it as it took over 20 mins to check in. I wish the hotel had paid the same attention to the rooms..very old fashioned and in need of a makeover. No coffee maker in room..there is a $12 charge to have a pot of coffee delivered to your room. Gym is also a $10 per useage charge plus as ever they charge for internet as well. Stay at Trump towers or any of the other major chains where they look at customers as a chance to offer a high level of service and not a chance to rip the customer off. Incidentally i made a comment about the $12 coffee charge to a colleague in the elevator..the response from the other customers in the elevator was very strong to say the least...Congrat Palmer Hilton management because of your nickle and dime approach you are pushing customers to other hotels..oh and did i mention the noiise from the trains!!

Worst experience with a hotel that I've ever had. I booked a room for June way back in April. First they lost my money and said they had no room. I have been fighting with them for the past few months trying to get it straightened out. It is now mere weeks before I am headed down there and it still isn't in order. Management it absolutely terrible. The people answering the phone were incredibly rude. You couldn't pay me enough to go through all this trouble again with this hotel. DON'T BOOK HERE!

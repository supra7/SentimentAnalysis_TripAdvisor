This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. From check-in (which was botched) through check-out, we had a terrible experience. 1) The sound of the El train is so loud it sounds like the next stop is in the room. 2) The bed was like a marshmallow. Our backs were in spasm each morning. 3) The exercise room is on a timer and doesn't let you in with your key-card until 7 am. I had a 7.30 meeting and needed to work out the kinks from the bed at 6;30. Couldn't get in the work-out room. 4) The first room I check into had no toilet paper. 5) The second room I checked into had a fan running in the bathroom that could not be turned off. My client's TA booked us here...whatever you do, don't be fooled into staying here.

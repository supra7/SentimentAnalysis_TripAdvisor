Do not stay here If you're going to Miami, you'll want to find another place to stay. The rooms are small and dirty - stains on the rugs, paint chipping in the showers, bugs, dirty bedding, etc. The pool was not much better, no clean towels or anyone ever available outside to help you. To top it off the staff is extremely rude and helpless. They'd actually rather not have your business than try to fix your problem...unbelievable! To say the least I'm extremely disgusted by the whole experiece. I would never go back there.

The things they do right, EVERYONE does right--reasonable price during the week, nice pool, fine buffet, ok slots, etc. So, housekeeping errors made this too much of a compromise for the convenience and price. They never did make up our room first day--at ALL. Then second day it took FOUR phone calls to get the room made up by 8:30--so we had no clean towels to shower for dinner or shows. Main problem was that they kept PROMISING to be there for hours and hours so we would leave to give them room to clean--in effect we were kept out of our room for the SEVEN HOURS-four phone calls and empty promises--it took to get them there. It finally took a call to hotel manager--it was unbelievable--I could not even get them to bring me towels for three hours. NEVER again--there are just too many other options. (Have to say, Valet service was outstanding and location at end of strip made for easy in/easy out for day trips though--that was a plus) Next time I will try for the other end of the Strip--we spent a great deal of tiem at Luxor and guests there were very pleased and atmoshpere was cleaner, more professional.

Despite having a prepaid reservation, when I arrived with my 3 young children at the hotel at night, I was informed that the hotel was oversold and that we would be accomodated in a Hospitality Suite. Basically, this was a meeting room with rollaway beds and a bathroom. the next day we were upgraded to a suite. The suite had beautiful views but a broken light bulb with dangerous glass sticking out, and a fold out bed that literally sagged so much it touched the floor! I was sent an apology letter by the assistant manager, asking that I contact him in case of any problems, I left messages for him and the other manager to no avail. The day I checked out, it took them 45 minutes to locate where they had stored our luggage. Yvonne the concierge is a true professional and the highlight of the hotel. The rest of the staff are slow, and unresponisive. The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible!

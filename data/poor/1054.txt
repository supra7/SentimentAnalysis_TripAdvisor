Because everything they say is TRUE! This place ----!! DON'T STAY HERE! Our first night the ceiling began leaking--big time--at 3:30 AM. The person at the front desk--a VERY young man--would not go in the room above ours to check on the problem. (Good thing it wasn't smoke!!) He suggested instead we pack up and go to another room!! But when we finally did that at 8 am they said there was no room "ready" that we could move to!! (Evidently they were planning to "make up" a room already used -- at 3:30 am. With no maids on duty, how long would that have taken??) For our troubles, they offered a $25 discount (the cost of the room--with taxes--was $150). And when I asked to speak to the manager, the people at the front desk told me they could not give me his name or number. Who ever heard of that kind of hotel customer service? [Fortunately, I paid by credit card; I am "challenging" the cost of the room with them.] The parent company--CHOICE hotels--was no more helpful. After I filed a complaint I was instructed to wait 7 to 10 days for someone to get back to me. Of course, that time came and went with no response. When I finally called CHOICE back, they insisted we should have packed up and moved -- at 3:30 am -- to a room that needed to be cleaned. (In fact, their handling of this matter will keep me from staying at any CHOICE-owned or operated hotel in the future.) This dump's location is all it has going for it. I urge you to pay a little more and stay somewhere else. Believe me you won't regret it.

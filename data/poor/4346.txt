Upon check in we were not given any information about ammenitiesof the hotel. We checked in on Saturday, the electricity went out (Things happen) sat in the Roxy for 40 minutes before we were told they could not serve us. We walked to I-hop very scarey, shady area of Las Vegas. The staff at the Stratosphere were very rude other then the bell hop guys- SUPER friendly men. When you would ask Staff a question you would never get a straight answer, we were given 3 different prices for a limo (UGH). The pool was nice. We awoke to an emergency alarm to evacuate the hotel. NO STAIR WELL SIGNS. Just EXIT signs, which were closed for emergency.That could be a real hazard in a real case scenario. After going down 23 flights of stairs with scared , upset people in their PJ's we were told it was a false alarm and we were literally laughed at by Security.

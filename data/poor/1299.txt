The halls and elevator smelled, the carpet was very old and dirty, the shower curtain had never been cleaned (or so it seemed), the sheets didn't fit the bed, the coffee pot in the room didn't work and broke while trying to brew, the coffee in the lobby was undrinkable and the rooms felt grubby. We only stay at Marriott hotels so this came as a surprise since we always like them.

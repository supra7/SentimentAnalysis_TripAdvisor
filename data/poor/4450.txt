I am very suprised that Expedia list this hotel as it is appalling. I arrived at 6pm (check in was from 3pm) but was told my room was not ready. I asked if there was anywhere to leave my luggage while I went for a drink and waited, I was told there was no where. So I was left standing in the grottiest casino in town surrounded by the dead beats in the casino. I asked again after 20 mins and the unhelpful, unsmiling desk guy said he would give me another room. I eventually went up to it and to be fair for what it cost it was ok. I opened the curtains to see the back of 5 airconditioning units and several filters that had been left on the roof. I kept the curtains closed for the rest of my stay. There was a TV but no remote control. Everytime I went out or came back I had to walk through the horrible dirty casino. It was always full of dodgy looking low life. The hotel is only 1 block from Fremont Street which is why I chose it but beware there are many homeless bums in this area. When I checked out I asked them to phone a cab for me but suprise suprise it never arrived. I don't think they ever rang one. I walked round the corner & hailed my own cab. One night I did have a bit of fun splatting a huge cockroach on the wall of my room with my shoe. I left it there for them to clean up but they never bothered. Take my advice there are plenty more cheap hotels in town that are better than this one. Give it a miss.

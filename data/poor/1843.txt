I am writing this review from their hotel. This hotel is outdated and I have received better service at McDonalds. On a 75 degree day i called about the air conditioner not working and they said its late in the season and the heat is on. The wall paper is falling off the walls and the bathroom door handles have no screws in them so you get locked in if not diligent in your efforts They advertised free wifi in the lobby which was a selling point to me as I was here on buisness/pleasure trip. When I went to the lobby i asked is their a pass code for the free wifi The staff advised oh that changed 3 days ago. The manager advised that I could walk to Starbucks or pay the 13 dollar charge.. When we first got the room u could tell it was not cleaned after the last guest left ( I will not get into details). To top it off the maid service even put the sheets on backwords. so the sheet was on top of the comforter, a five year old knows better. If your business is fronting the bill it is acceptable but fronting the 350 dollars a night for this is a joke. The location is good, which is its only real salvation. Pay the extra 20 bucks and stay at the "W" two blocks down...

Some friends and I stayed at this hotel from 7/31-8/3 and it was the absolute worst. We were told that the rate was so reasonable because it was the "off" season but it was horrendous. The housekeeping staff was terrible. We were actually ASKED if we wanted our bathroom cleaned. The tub backed up while showering so you actually were standing in this dirty water while rushing to shower to get out of there. This "so-called" maintenance man came and pulled all the gunk out of the drain with his bare hands whic was totally gross and as a consequence, 2 of us caught Athlete's Foot! We had to ask for clean towels twice. The entire floor we were on smelled terrible!

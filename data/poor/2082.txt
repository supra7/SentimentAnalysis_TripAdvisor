The in room WiFi is the WORST I have found in ANY hotel EVER. Support is off site and there really isn't anything they can do (except install more wifi hubs). The WiFi signal on the rooms is ridiculously low and cuts out frequently. So much so that I am writing this review on my iPhone with 3G. DO NOT STAY HERE if you are in Chicago in business or otherwise if you have any need for internet. I'm in 2109 just outside the elevators where there's supposed to be a WiFi transmitter and it is impossible.

Bugged at Beck's The management at Beck's cynically does as little as they can get away with for the comfort of guests. (And this inspite of the fact that the Beck is fairly expensive.) They count on the Castro location to cover every shortcoming. Forget about smoke-free rooms--the entire place is saturated with stale smoke. Forget about amenities. In my room, the coffeemaker was an absolute hazard. Two of the three lamps were broken, and a towel bar was broken. There's a serious ventilation problem. The bedroom window can be opened only a couple inches. The bathroom is actually more pleasant since it has a small barred window which admits fresh air. Worst of all is a sleazy lockerroom ambiance (and I'm not talking upscale lockerroom here) which is caused by constant aggressive cruising. In fact, the word aggressive hardly covers it. Personally I don't like strangers' faces trying to peer into my (curtained) bedroom window at all hours of the day or night, or drunks shrieking obscenities and having interminable arguments in the middle of the night. The Beck is particularly inappropriate for families, and straight women traveling alone. The Castro district has many charms, including fine restaurants, bookstores and the grand old Castro theater, but next time I'd find a way to enjoy them without staying at Beck's.

Went for the weekend. To first stand in the registration line for 45 minutes. I was recieved by a lady Sharon that was rude, not helpful and did nothing to help harrahs overcharging of the booked rooms( booked back in April for myself/husband and mbrother/sister in laws). Our room was dirty. Management sent in the cleaners but took for ever. For our 2 night stay we onely stayed one night. They wanted to charge extra $400 for the two rooms. Whatever u do, do not stay here. There is a reason why they have so many bad reviews. They suck!!!!!!!!!! Do not stay here!!!!!!!

Terrible service, Lacks "aloha" I tried planning my wedding here and the customer service was just terrible. The ladies in the catering department were rude and not helpful. I emailed one of them with a menu question and she rudely replied back to go look at the website (most hotels will email/mail you pdf files of the contract, menus, amenities, misc). I emailed her back with more and some of the same questions she didnt answer and still 2 weeks later, no response. I contacted them once more because I wanted to go and look at the wedding sites. The catering lady said that she would call me back because she had to look at the schedule. Well she did call (twice), but I was busy at work. So I missed her call(s) and both times she left messages to give her a call back. When I did call her back it was maybe a minute after she called me the second time and she didnt pick up. Finally got her an hour later after constantly calling her. I apologized for missing her 2 calls. She never said anything and then told me that she would call me tomorrow if anyone was available to take me on the tour ... she never called me back... maybe the nostalgia of the hotel is memorable.. but without aloha what do you have?

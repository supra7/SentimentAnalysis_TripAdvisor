Good location and nice rooms. I recently made a reservation for a suite, two rooms for 3 persons. I was planning to arrive late about 11:00 pm. At 10.30 pm I got a call from the Hotel front desk telling me that they will cancel, my already paid reservation, and give me a smaller room with only one bed. No explanation. Went to the hotel anyway and even the supervisor Ms Villafana was no help. No nice treatment for the guests. Be careful if you get a good price and make plans to arribve late. Better drop my the hotel early and check in, or you may left with no room. Or look for another hotel

I stayed in this hotel for easter weekend. The service is really bad. Nothing is near this location.You won't feel you are staying in Marriot. There is no breakfast buffet. The housekeeping will replace only few things in bathroom. The refrigerator in my room was n ot working, infact it was a refrigerator converted in to closet. when I complained, the staff told me that I am on wait list. Wait list to get a refrigerator and that too when its n one of my fault. Wow, that's Marriot, I can't belive. All tall buildings nearby and no city life to see. If you are planning your vacation for few days and want to visit Universal/disney and hollywood tour, I suggest you take hotel near hollywood. That will be much convenient and better for sure.

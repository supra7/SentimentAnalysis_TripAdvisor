Yes I know it an airport hotel. But it is a Marriott. Should be a Motel 8. Rooms are small. They gave me a corner room on the exec floor. HORRIBLE BED. Could not find a comfortable spot (like the mattress had holes in it). Restaurant was down (yes out of service for remodeling). So you are forced to use the Terrace restaurant by the pool. Exec lounge -- tiny. 3 floors of exec rooms and such a small lounge. OK if the lounge was small. But good food -- NOT. The evening snacks were some tired spring rolls and some salad sticks. YECH...

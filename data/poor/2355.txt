After spending a 7 days at the Grand Wailea in Maui we had over $8,000 worth of jewelry stolen from our bags while they were in the possession of the bell staff of the Grand Wailea. What a way to ruin a nice vacation! It was the last day of our stay at the GW. We checked out of our room around noon. Our flight wasn't until later that evening so we checked our bags with the bell hop and spent a few more hours at the pool. When it was time to leave, we picked up our bags and headed to the airport. As soon as we arrived, my wife checked her jewelry and found her one caret diamond necklace, a Mavado watch and a diamond tennis bracelet were all missing. We spent the last hour in Maui filing a police report at the airport and the entire flight home sicken by what had happened. After several conversations with the GM at the hotel (Mr. Johnny So) they refused to offer any compensation for what had happened. If fact, they claimed that we made up the entire story. Not the kind of treatment I expect after spending over $4,000 at a 5-star hotel! Word to the wise... Be on guard - especially at the Grand Wailea

A few problems: 1) When booking, we reserved room with two queen beds. Instead, we were told when we arrived there were only twin beds. We had three guests in our room, so one had to sleep in a cot. 2) The room is very small, very cold, and damp. When we complained about the condition of the room, we were told that there was no heat available for this room, and basically just to stick it out. 3) I became ill halfway through my stay. When I called down to room service to order tea, there was no response. I tried twice more before calling the front desk. No response from the front desk. I tried once more. No response. 4) I walked downstairs, saw a note at the bar that said "No room service or bar service, as staff is at a holiday party." Okay, understandable. I walked over to the front desk, where not one, but TWO women were standing chatting. I mentioned I called and that I would appreciate a pot to take some of the hot water available in the lobby up to my room. They said the kitchen was closed and they couldn't get anything for me. I walked up the block to Walgreen's. 5) Overall, the service offered at this hotel is minimal. No concierge, no bellhop, no doorman. I couldn't even catch a taxi out in front. I walked to another hotel to do so. I would not recommend this hotel.

Too bad you can't smell pictures. Don't stay here...The lobby is dingy, carpet not clean...I lasted 10 minutes and left. I was told there would be a fee of $50.00 to withdraw my reservation which I agreed to pay. Two days later I was charged $187.00 for one nights stay and the cancellation fee. I called and disputed this charge and was told that the desk clerk was wrong. The final response from the manager was..."I cannot reverse any fees because our computer system is not capable of doing that." Some things are humorous...others are funny...but that is laughable. I am certain, based on my reviews of the overall reviews, this Hotel can't afford to reverse charges for early checkouts or they would go out of business. Stay somewhere else...it will be worth every penny!

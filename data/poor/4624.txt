We stayed @ Parc St. Charles June 2011... It was horrible!!! The only reason i stayed after seeing the rooms was because i couldn't find another room near by. The carpet was Disqusting!!! The smell of the room was moldy... I went to the store and purchased sheets along w/cleaning supplies for the bathroom. While checking out i asked the clerk to please tell upper management to update the pictures on the website because that is False advertising...maybe the rooms looked like that 10 + years ago... The room was disqusting... Please read other reviews before booking this or any rooms....

When our travel agent suggested the Secrets Maroma Beach my wife and I scanned the web. We found that the folks here had a good time so we booked it. We arrived and all seemed well - nice room with an ocean view. However, the problems started the next morning when we were awoken by jackhammers in the next room. We called the concierge many times and finally they stopped -- only to restart again soon later. We spoke to the staff and found that this was a new hotel but all of the plumming needed replacing so they must use jackhammers to dig up the tiled floors. EVERY ROOM in the hotel is going to be ripped apart like this. They have 8 buildings and work in at least 2 buildings at a time so you have a good chance of not having a quiet vacation. After 2 days they finally agreed to move us to a different building and room. It was nice but had no hot water as it was one of the rooms that had not been fixed. A cold shower for the rest of the vacation. That night we went to their seafood resturant and got severe food poisioning. The next day we eventually fell to sleep only to be woken again by jackhammers in the next room. We finally were able to stop them so we could sleep. After 2 days we were not better so called the doctor. He gave us some shots and then came back the next day a gave more shots. By Sunday, our last day, we were strong enough to get out of bed. So I spoke to the management to see if I could get a refund for part of the vacation since we had 2 days of constant noise and no sleep then 3 days of food poisioning. They said no refunds at all. You may be lucky at this hotel and get there when it is empty so get a quiet room and so long as you do not eat at the seafood resturant you should be okay. However, since this construction is planned to last a year at least, I doubt it. Stay away and go to one of the many other hotels in the area.

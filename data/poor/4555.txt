We made reservations for 3/2012 and just this morning, tried to talk to the manager and OMGosh! She was rude and down right nasty! Going to see if I can get out of the reservation! Can only image how the the weekend stay would be if she is a crab over the phone! Should have listened to others complaining about management and staff!

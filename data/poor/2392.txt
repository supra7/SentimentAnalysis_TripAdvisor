We booked for my wife's birthday and our 12 year anniversary. I usually give good reviews, but this time we were very disappointed. We booked through Pleasant Holidays first and were told our rooms would be right on the beach. Not exactly. We can live with that. Checking in we found the staff to be unfriendly and short which did not change our entire 8 days. Living on an island and seeing thousands of people gets old I am sure. Our rooms were on the older side. The free in room Internet access is hard-wired and not wireless. (Our computers are iPads so we could only use the Internet in the lobby). The rooms had a rustic and moldy smell. Place was built in the sixties so you can imagine how old the rooms were. Wife found various bugs inside our room - gross. We didnt make a stink about it to the resort because we were either at the beach or traveling the island. We primarily used the room to rest and eat. We were looking for an experience and did not receive it from the resort. Staff just wasn't friendly - sorry. Snorkeling, beach access, surrounding areas were beautiful. We absolutely loved Lahaina. So amazing and elegant. Great food and fun. Make sure you check out the Banyan Tree Park - unique. Stop at Costco on your way in and fill your fridge. Food on the island can be expensive when you have kids. Hope your experience was better.

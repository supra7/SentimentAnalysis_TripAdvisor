I stay in a lot of hotels and rarely complain. I have even stayed here last year and had a reasonable experience. Both stays I booked on Priceline and paid about $40 (plus taxes). This stay we had a car and were just there for one night. On check-in I told the agent I had a Hilton Honours number and he said I couldn't use it with priceline but they could add it to my account for tracking purposes. Whatever that means. Then he said it was $26 for valet and $20 for regular parking. (I already knew this so did not really care). Next he offered to "upgrade" us to a king bed for $10, the hotel appeared to be deserted and I obviously if I only paid $40 for the room they are not busy. Anyway, I said no, and we got a room on the 4th floor. Basically this room was the exact farthest room from the parking lot even though they knew we had a car. The room was fine until we realized the toilet wouldn't flush and the free internet they offered us did not work. The part that really made me give the review a low mark was the next morning at the coffee bar. I stood there for 5mins while some bartender looked at me a few times and went on moving bottles around. Then I saw the hostess staring at me so I waved at her asking if anyone worked there and she just looked away. Finally I looked back at the line forming and stated I don't think anyone works here and walked away. 2 mins later the lady behind me comes up and says she found someone, it was the same bartender half halfheartedly operating the coffee bar. I said thanks but no thanks. Anyway, they should learn that a tiny bit of customer service can avoid being roasted on the internet by a disgruntled traveler. We also stayed at the Double Tree early in the week and had an experience 1000times better, I would recommend staying there to someone looking for a place at Seatac.

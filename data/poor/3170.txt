worst hotel I have ever stayed at A friend was having a party at the hotel for his 40th birthday. It was cocktails and dinner in the Cuba de Asia room. He had about 10 rooms of people staying over. I checked into my room and was handed an envelope immediatly. Inside was a letter from the manager stating there was a change of plans and to meet at a restaurant across town. My husband and I quickly dressed and caught a cab because of the earlier time. It was raining and my ankle was sprained. The bay bridge on ramps were closed for the bridge remodel and it took 45 minutes to go across town. After $50 for the cab we got to the restaurant only to find that there was no party. I managed to reach one of the other party goers who said they didnt receive a letter and everything was still on at the hotel. I called the hotel to see what was going on and was hung up on by the manager. We got back to the hotel to be told the manager was busy and we needed to wait to talk to him. He came and rolled his eyes and said there must have been a mix up and it was no big deal. Apparently another guest has a similar name to mine. I guess it wasn't his $70 in cab rides and 2 hours wasted. I wrote a letter to the manager and they sent me a coupon for $50 off my next stay. OH BOY WHAT A DEAL. The party was good buy my friend was upset by the hotel service that he got after spending so much there. Also the hotel was a case of the emporers new clothes! The decor everyone raved about was straight out of clearance at IKEA!! I was not impressed by the snobbishness of it all. Good service includes graciousness. Also if they screw up they should take responsibility. This is the first complaint letter I have ever made. So much time has past since it happend but a friend just mentioned they would be booking some family here. I felt it important to list this so people weren't taken in by this supposed 5 star hotel.

The road noise was terrible here- I don't know if the windows are gto thin, or its the angel of the building in relation to the street, but I could hardly sleep during my three night stay. Also, there are thin white window shades but no curtains. This means that I had to put up with street lamp light coming into my romm all night. The wfi-fi was of better speed than most other hotels Ive stayed at. I would never stay here again.

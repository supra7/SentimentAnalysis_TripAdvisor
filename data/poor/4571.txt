I have travelev extensively having visited every state and major city in the Untied States and many abroad. This hotel is just ridiculous! My son is a musician and had a gig in Chicago so he booked through one of the many on line sights as he usually does and ended up booking a room for 2 with double beds. Well, we ended up with 1 queen bed in a room that didn't have space for a roll away. The front desk claimed they couldn't do anything and didn't amazingly poor service. I slept in the queen bed and my son slept on the floor in a space that was approx. 3 ft wide. Oh, and they couldn't supply any morw bedding either. Ecco friendly OK whatever, but certainly not consumer friendly. The worse place I have ever stayed in I felt like we were in a closet.

First off I didnt book this hotel it was a package for my daughters cheer competition. The location was great for out visit.This hotel is HUGE so expect a long walk any where and it includes stairs and ramps. The parking is $17pd for valet and $9pd for self parking 2blocks from the north tower in which we were in.Valet guys were very nice and informative especially Jesse. Unfortunatly with as much as we needed our car which was 7-10 times a day over 5 days valet wasnt tipped for their service as they expect to be.When you pay $230pp for the trip parking should be free. To get to the rooms you must have you must have you key card which can be annoying and anyone can get to the floors regarless by telling someone to push your floor. The rooms were out dated.They didnt have the marble counters of the Hampton inn's I have stayed at or nice plush towels.Paint and wall paper was peeling.The balcony was what they call a "toe bacony"and they mean it.It was a nice view of the ocean.You do how ever have to choose between the beautiful sound or heat cuz if you open the door the heat turns off. The restaurants were only open during certain times and to expensive for the average person.Housekeeping was horrible.They didnt clean our room for 2 days even though we called numerous times.The shower didnt drain properly and when it did it backed up into the sink. In all I would not choose this hotel in the future.It is out dated,over priced,under staffed,and way to large.

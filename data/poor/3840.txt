This was our 12th or 14th time on Maui (lost count) so we are aware that in a tropical climate, cockroaches are sometimes part of the landscape. However, to find one crawling in our bed as we pulled back the covers is just unacceptable. That's what we found in our bed at the Maui Lu! On this particular trip, we rented a condo in Kapalua but wanted to spend one night in Kihei during our trip. It was also my birthday and my favorite restaurant is in Kihei so we thought it would be fun to pack a bag and party it up in Kihei for my birthday. We used Priceline and ended up with a room at the Maui Lu. After a fun night in Kihei, we returned back to our room, pulled back the sheets and crawling under the cover was a cockroach! My wife screamed, we packed our bags and drove the 45 minutes back to Kapalua. Thank goodness the drinking had worn off and we had the option of another place to sleep. Beware of this place.

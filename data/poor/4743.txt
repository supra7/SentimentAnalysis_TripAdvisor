We checked in and we were told that the parking next to the rooms were all filled up and that we would have to use the parking thats a mile away from the actual rooms! Which by the way cost 12.00 just to park there. Ridiculous!!! We were also told that a golf cart would pick us and our lugguge up and take us to our rooms so we would not have to walk the distance. We passed 5 employees standing around. No one had a golf cart and no one offered to go get one. If they are going to have parking such distance away then they should have golf carts ready and waiting to take people to their rooms. We walked the whole (Seemed like a mile, no joke) way with our luggage. We have stayed in alot less expensive hotels and received better service. We will never return!!!! We were looking for a monthly get away, this will not be it!

We got stuck with this hotel through priceline at $150 a night. Don't be fooled by the four star rating. I would give this at best 2 or 3 stars at the most. It maybe a historical hotel but that doesn't mean it needs to be run down and dirty. The water for the sink and shower cuts in and out. There were cob webs on the ceiling. There was a fake decorative tree that was covered in dust. There was pop spilled down the wall. The only nice part was the bed. The matress is amazing. The owners need to spend some money and redo the rest of the room. There were tears in the wall paper. One of the worst hotel experiences we have had.

To start with they had our resorvation's for the day before our check-in and informed us we were cancelled as a no show but would see what they could do. The next day when I went to take a shower the shower handle kept slipping up to hot, THANK GOD I checked before stepping in or I would have been burned and then the water did not shut off & dripped & dripped,when I called (4am) to inform them they asked if I wanted someone to come & look at it...DUH....YES!!!! On our return to our room (10hrs after my call) NO ONE had come to fix the problem so I called again & someone came to look at it & informed us HE knew of this problem from a previous complaint, but could not fix the problem without drilling the shower handle. No One called to find out if our problem had been resolved or to change our room with a working shower, So instead of a nice shower with my husband he held the handle from outside the shower to make sure I did not get burned. WHAT A VEGAS EXPERIENCE!!!!!

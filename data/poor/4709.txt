I guess you get what you pay for. This hotel was suppose to be a 3star but it was no where near that. the bathroom was nasty, the room smelled, and the remote to the television did not work the whole time. instead the manager had to give us the master remote. there were strange knocks at the doors at 3in the morning. it was terrible. the breakfast included a basket of muffins and fruits at the checkin counter. you even have to pay for the internet service. its not included. It was TERRIBLE. the staff were ok but damn it never again will i stay here

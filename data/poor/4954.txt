This place is not a resort. It is also way oversold on what it is. It is a very sad set of run down apartment buildings which were once projects - some of which are still in utter disrepair and boarded up in and around the "rennovated" buildings of Summer Bay. I use the term "rennovated" very loosely - they've basically painted them and a few have had some landscaping done - as for the rest - a paint job is about the best you can hope for. The rooms smell, the furniture is run down and stained badly - parking is relegated to a back alley next to boarded up buildings and large trash bins for some of the units - and you're guaranteed a boarded up building view. You may or may not be lucky enough to have a tiny hot tub or even smaller pool for some of the complexes. If you do find yourself staying there based on price, location and it's rating - be sure to ask for the "Tower" building. This at least has some semblance of a 3-star rated facility with decent furniture. However, even there you'll get plenty of mildew in the showers with curtains that are barely in place and torn up balconies. The cost is affordable and the location is great, but I think you're better off spending a little more money and heading to a Best Western.

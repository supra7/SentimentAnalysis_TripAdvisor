We went in and one of the staff members told us that the hotel had been bought by a motel company and that this was there first hotel so they DO NOT know how to run it and are very cheap. They told us that 200 people were fired. This hotel was not clean and had fire hazards because the doors didn't open well. We were in a suite and it was not nice and smelled like dog shampoo on the couch. We asked for a rollaway since it was false advertisement and instead of a king they gave us a full and it looked like a hospital bed. The mattress' were so hard and it was terrible.

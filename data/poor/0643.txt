Today we checked in for our wedding with our group of 32 people and we were treated absolutely awful. Everything from step one was a total disaster. If you are even considering booking this resort for your wedding, THINK AGAIN!!!!!!!!! I spent all day arguing with the nasty and unaccomadating staff. Never once was I, the bride, apologized to. They only addressed the men in the group and after 3 hours of arguing, when my father was finally involved, did ANYTHING get solved. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF HAVING your wedding or a group vacation here. IT's RIDICULOUS how disrespectful the staff was even when I was in tears. THEY RUINED MY WEDDING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will never forget how awful this experience has been. More to come in future posts with details. Just wanted to give all brides a HEADS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are so many amazing adult only resorts, DO NOT COME HERE!

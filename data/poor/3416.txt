This is without doubt the most disgusting hotel we have ever stayed in. If you are daft enough to stay there after reading the reviews make sure that you never take off your shoes and wear gloves wherever possible!! It is filthy and the owners / staff show no interest in the welfare of their guests. When we complained about the standard of the room we were given, the guy opened and showed us rooms occupied by other guests !!!! He had no idea what rooms were in use or what rooms had been `cleaned` and in 1 case the guests were watching TV !!. We had missing floor tiles, lights didn`t work, electrics were in a terrible state, carpet beyond belief, ac sounded like a jet aircraft, pool was awful, no elevator, dim corridors, patio door didn`t lock, awful damp smell .... could go on and on. I have read reviews which give this hotel a mark of 4 out of 5. Take no notice as these must have been written by the staff or those related to the staff. Fortunately we were only there for 2 nights. The homeless had the right idea ... sleep outside on the grass verges ... cleaner and safer. This is a truly nasty place with only 1 redeeming feature which is its location.

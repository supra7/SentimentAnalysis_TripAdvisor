Arrived to find Safe locked called Housekeeping said engineering would be right up. Asked to wait for them in room. Called and went to see Manager on Duty after they did not arrive, Manager said it was out of his hands.Bottom Line went waited 3 1/2 hours then left called in the morning and the lady oin Housekeeping replied "Oh No they still have not been there". I really question ther Customer Service. Question who has the power in my world Customer Service brings them back. I guess they want us to visit Mirage Hotels

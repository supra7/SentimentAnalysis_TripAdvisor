Management was very unhelpful and rude. My family has stayed here for years and enjoyed the experience, until this visit. We were told at 10:30pm the night before check in that children under the age of 12 were not allowed. This would have been O.K. had this information been provided to us at the time we booked the room. Or if it was even on their website. They were adament about their policy, even after a different employee told us that kids under 12 had stayed there the week before. We spoke with the owner who could not have been more rude or unhelpful if she tried. They didn't even try to help us make other arangements. We told her that this attitude would cost her alot of money just from our family never staying there again and she could have cared less. These people need to get out of the service industry.

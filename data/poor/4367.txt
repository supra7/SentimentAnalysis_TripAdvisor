1. Worst night's sleep in two weeks holiday. 2. Walls thin, with adjoining door 3. Our room next to lift. All of the above fine; unless - 1. You have been up for 40 hours getting to Vegas 2. the people in the room next door hold a party and start screaming and shouting like drunk obnoxious idiots 3. the lift is annoyingly loud and used appromimately 5 times a minute all night!!!

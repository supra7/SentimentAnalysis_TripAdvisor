I have stayed at W hotels before, I have stayed at "no-tell" motels before. I cannot decide which is worse. This was BY FAR not a 4 star hotel. Our room was an absolute utter disgace. It was approximately 80 square feet. BEWARE if you are over 5'9" and need to sit on the toilet. My husband injured his knees when they hit the wall (I'm not kidding) as he was sitting down. We requested to be moved, but the hotel was at full capacity (were all of the other guests complaining I wonder?) and we could not be moved. To boot, they double-charged our bar tab to the room. All I can say is thank G-d we only stayed for 1 night. We had an entire day planned the day of our departure that we opted to cancel because we needed to check out of this hellhole at 7am on a Sunday. I have never felt so claustrophobic in my entire life. There are soooo many other great hotels in this city. DO NOT stay here.

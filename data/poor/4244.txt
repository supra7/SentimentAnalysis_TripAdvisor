Everyone, please beware of Harrah's Las Vegas. On other travel sites, there were complaints of items missing from guest rooms. Guess what, it's TRUE!! Our room was broken into and our laptops, ipods, headphones, and other items were missing. Harrahs' has NO CAMERA'S in their hallways, does that make you feel safe!!! You can be in the hallway and someone can beat the crap out of you, take your money, and get away with it!! We reported the incident to Harrah's and they basically did nothing about it. They continue to blame us for leaving the door unlocked. The have such a pathetic security staff. They're all old, fat, and worthless. Trust me, they have people scoping the hallways to see when you leave. The way it looked, is seems to be an inside job. This isn't only my opinion, see the other opinions on the other sites. PLEASE BEWARE!!! I'm an honest and hardworking individual and it angers me that these scumbags at Harrah's steal from you or allow you to be stolen from. Please spread the word and do not stay at this crap hotel. Pay a few more bucks and be safe. Thanks!

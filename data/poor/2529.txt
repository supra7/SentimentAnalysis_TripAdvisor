Hated It !!! I was very disappointed with this hotel.When I made my reservations several months in advance and asked about parking I was not told they may not be able to accommodate me. None the less when I arrive I am told I will have to park several blocks away from the hotel and pay $20.00 a day to park there. After that I get to my room and feel as if I am in a closet. It was very small. I thought I was in a cheap motel. The tiles in the bathroom were cracked and sticking out. My TV was not working. I went down to the front desk to complain and was told it was only one person there and would have to wait. After about one hour of waiting I decided to plug it into the bathroom outlet. Would you know it worked. Apparently the outlet for the TV was not operating.My room was next to the elevator so all day and night I heard the beeping noise from the elevator.The staff was very unfriendly and rude!!I would never stay there again.

I was just recently at this hotel the first weekend in June with my boyfriend and our 2 best friends. Throughcheck in the staff was friendly and there was no problems, but however when it came time for bed neither my boyfriend or I slept comfortably due to the beds. The beds were absolutly horrible you could feel every spring. It literally would have been more comfortable to sleep on a piece of plywood. Then after coming back from the beach the next afternoon I went to take a shower and there was like no water pressure, not to mention the water went from scolding hot to ice cold. After showering the electric went out 4-5 time on me and 1 time on my friend. When we caller down stairs they told us that the room next door was using a blow dryer as well. We even turned all the lights out in our room so I could try to dry my hair and the power still went out. The only thing we got was a coupon for breakfast upon checkout. Neither myself or my boyfriend will ever stay at this place again! That was absolutly unacceptable for the electric to turn off that many times, I didn't even get to finish drying my hair!

On Dec 28th to 29th I stayed at the W New York in room 659. Upon arrival I was told I was upgraded to a "spectacular room". I was late for dinner reservations so quickly dropped my things off and went to dinner. Later that night I returned to the room and upon further inspection found the following problems - a hold in the wall in the bathroom, a significant tear in the rug by the bed, an unsightly area around the heating/air conditioning unit, and really, in general, just an awful room. Given the late hour I had neither the patience nor the energy to head down to the front desk to complain and figured I'd discuss the problems at check out in the morning. Wow, was I wrong. At check out I explained that I have stayed at Starwood properties for over 130 nights this year and that I was wondering if there was any sort of discount or points allotment that I could receive for my less than spectacular room. I was told by the front desk attendant that there was nothing that could be done. I find this appalling. The basic rooms at the Sheraton Chapel Hill which I stay at for business are much nicer than the room I unfortunately received at the W New York. This was by far the worst Starwood stay I've ever experienced!

Will never return to the Clift Overall I really disliked this hotel. I met an old college room mate Nov 5-8/07 and she booked the room. She had stayed in the hotel years ago with her Mom and loved the old fashioned atmosphere and the bar. The hotel is now a plastic,poorly lit and unfriendly place - or I am just too old to appreciate how cool it is. The lighting in the room was terrible, the furniture was ugly and actually non functional - we could not unpack our clothes as there was no where to put anything buta dimly lit closet (painted deep purple). The bathroom was tiny (not so unusual in old hotels) but why was there no where to put anything or even hang a towel? The walls were mainly large mirrors - with huge curtains - it was scary. In the hall by our elevator stood two GLASS chairs. The elevators were basically plastic cubes with no lights in them.These same plastic cubes in orange were our night tables. The lobby is dark and cold and the decor is boutique style ridiculous. Thestaff were hot and cold - mostly cold ( nice concierge though).The safe in the closet is too high to reach for anyone under 6'3. Overall if you are over 30 do not stay here - you will be uncomfortable and feel ripped off.The towels and robes are very nice though. I wish I had better things to say - I love San Francisco - next time I am hoping to find a comfortable place to stay with a nice happy feelto it .

Front desk did not recognize Platinum status and did not offer any elite benefits. The clerk who checked me in and out was unfriendly and cold. I was given a room so tiny that my walk-in closet at home is bigger! Internet connection required re-logging in every time the laptop reawakened from hibernation, which was annoying and time-consuming. The queen bed was one of the worst I have slept in, totally unsupportive and with a deep sag in the middle. Bathroom amenities were poorly supplied with some items missing. The climate control system was very uncomfortable ... it was loud, and alternated between blowing hot and cold air which was very strange. Soundproofing in the room was very poor, and noises from the street and from the hallway were both clearly and disturbingly audible. Breakfast was indifferent, they were out of hot water for tea, the omelets had been sitting in the chafing-dish for so long that they were leathery, and the bananas were bruised and over-ripe. The only good thing was the location.

Confirmed reservations secured with a CC mean nothing here. Arrived in town for convention and when to hotel at 3:00 pm to check in , and they did not have a room for me, in spite of the fact we had booked our reservations 4 months in advance. Apparently some large company came in and booked a bunch of rooms, so they had no room available for me. And they really didn't even seem to feel bad about it. Just matter of factly insisted they had no room there, but could put me up at the Sheraton (all Starwood hotels) by the airport, which was by the airport and close to convention center. The only good news is I was able to get a room at the Omni at the last minute for about the same price and it was a much nicer hotel and next door to the convention center. So beware booking reservation with Starwood hotels -- they think of only themselves and not the traveler. E. Yoder

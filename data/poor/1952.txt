I had a reservation to stay one night at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. Upon my arrival, I was informed by the front desk that the hotel was overbooked and that even though I had a confirmation, there was no room for me. In addition to that, all of the hotels in Boston were sold out due to several conventions taking place. The front desk manager was less than apologetic about THEIR error. They offered to put me in a lower quality hotel - 40 minutes outside of Boston - period. Take it or leave it attitude. In addition to the poor experience with the front desk, the bell staff was also very rude. Unbelievable! I will never return to this hotel.

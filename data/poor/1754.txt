I booked a stay from 08-24-11 to 08-29-11. I placed a deposit of 140.00. I was looking forward to my first trip to the beach with my cousin. My parents were in a car wreck. My father died & my mother was in critical condition. I called & to cancel the trip on 08-22-11. I was told to call back about my refund. My mother is still in ICU & lost her leg due to the accident. I called today, 09-07-11 & was told I would not get a refund. They have a strict refund policy. The manager suggested I e-mail a copy of my father's death certificate & "maybe" they would take a look at the situation again. However "they have a strict refund policy unless you cancel 10 days in advance". Maybe I should dig my father up & tell him he should have died earlier !! I suggest travelers stay any place but here! Pay more but book with a corporate hotel that is not family owned.

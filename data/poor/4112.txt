My family and I had made reservations at The Whitehall for a family wedding.. Upon arrival, our rooms were not ready..We had to get two rooms to accommodate our family..The elevators were so small that we had to take separate trips up and down.And when we were leaving, we had to wait through 7 full elevators on our floor..We had to go down one at a time so we wouldn't miss our flight waiting for the elevator. There are no ice machines on any floors..They have ice buckets?? But no ice machines?? The rooms had a smell in them and we actually received a letter under our door accusing us of smoking in our room..They said they would charge us 250 dollars if it continued.. This 'luxury' hotel needs to close..It is old and worn out..Time to say good bye. Terrible Service, Terrible Management, Terrible Hotel!!!

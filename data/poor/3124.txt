Stayed here a few weeks ago for a couple nights. Asked for no maid service as did not want to be disturbed. The next day after we checked in got a call from housekeeping, stating they MUST get into our room as we had been there too long. Tried to explain they were mistaken. When we told front desk about the mix up they said that was their policy to make sure we didn't want maid service. When a complaint was made they did not want to hear it. Apparently the housekeepers are more important than the guests. Later asked for a listing of TV channels as there was no info in the room. Front desk gave us a sheet of paper with channels and numbers and they told us it was not accurate. So each guest needs to go through all channels to see what was on what number channel. Meanwhile there are a number of people 'working' behind the front desk, some just sitting there or talking and laughing with each other. You would think one of them could take time to make a TV channel listing that is accurate, so each guest does not have to do this themselves. In all, the service was very lazy and the staff is not helpful to guests. Also the day we checked in our room was not ready on time so we went to restaurant for bite to eat. Came back an hour and a half later and room was still not ready for us. When we checked out the front desk person did not ask how our stay was did not seem to care.

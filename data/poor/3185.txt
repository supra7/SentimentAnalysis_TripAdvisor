Most disappointing SF hotel stay ever NEVER in my life have I been so disappointed as with the Clift Hotel this weekend. I live in CA and travel to San Francisco frequently--at least 6 to 8 weekends a year. I have stayed in many of the three and four star hotels in the Union Square area. To say that the staff was inattentive was an understatement. The doorman often ignored persons trying to enter the hotel. The front desk clerk completely ignored a reservation that GUARANTEED a king size sleigh bed. The staff ignored the privacy please sign on the door. Clearly dressed for a special occasion, we were seated at a table in the restaurant that was half in the restaurant, half in the bar -- the music was so loud we could hardly hear ourselves think, much less talk.The room was modern -- CHEAP modern that tries to pass itself off as being cool but fails miserably. The lighting in the bathroom was so flourescent and the tile choice so awful (sickly white 12 tiles) that both of us remarked that we felt that if we stayed in the shower too long, we would require institutionalization, as the awfulness of it would make us crazy. Not only that, but the floor wasn't particularly clean and the tub caulking clearly needed redoing. It was terrible.If you are looking for a hotel with an ok web site but horrible service, disappointing rooms and inattentive staff, stay at the CLIFT. Otherwise, keep looking. There are SO many options in the Union Square area, there's no reason to settle for such disappointment, especially for this price.

Came down here with my bf for a 2 week work trio, unfortunately im still stuck here and counting the days. Rooms are gross, not throughly clean. service is horrible they put sheets in our room to make our own bed! The floor manager also literally harassed me out of the casino because i left my id up at the room but i wasnt even gambling, i was getting my key from my bf! found mold on shower hose, asked for a new room, and the other room was still dirty. I Call front desk about a new problem everday! They dont do anything. i also just got out of taking a 2 min shower because they shut off my water without even a warning!! Never again

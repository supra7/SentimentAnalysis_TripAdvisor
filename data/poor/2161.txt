Our flight was coming into Chicago quite late due to the time change flying from California. I called ahead before leaving to confirm our reservation and tell them we would be checking in late. No problem...until we get there. No rooms, they move us to another Hilton nearby that was so slammed with people moved from the Palmer House overbooking that they put in normally unused rooms, which were right beneath the laundry! Loud loud loud. I don't blame the other Hilton though as they were trying to absorb Palmer Houses overspill. We met other travellers in the same situation in their lobby. Back to the Plamer though...we were promised a comped stay in any Hilton. What we got months later was an offer for a one night comp'd stay at the Palmer House. Useless, since we're never in Chicago and not what we were promised. The lobby was fantastic, but good luck getting past it! STAY AWAY!

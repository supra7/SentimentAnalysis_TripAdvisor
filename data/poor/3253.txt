After staying at the Encore at the Wynn in Las Vegas I would not recommend staying in the hotel if you want piece of mind. During the entire stay they were doing repairs on in the guestrooms and constantly were accessing the rooms. The room service was mediocre at best and the final touch of class the Encore added at the end of the trip was to rip our bag when they loaded it into the cab for our return trip home. I noticed the tear in the bag when we got to the airport and photographed the damage and sent it to the security department of the hotel along with a phone call. It took them 5-6 days to return my call after numerous attempts. They finally issued a report and stated that the tear was not their responsibility because they could not find the video. If you value piece of mind and you property, I would recommend staying as far away from this hotel as possible.

All I have to say is ROACHES!!!!!! Hundreds of them we stayed on the 1st floor Oceanfront at the DUNES MANOR MOTEL ...... Just they worst place we have ever been they room seemed to be clean until we came back at night and went into the kitchenette and on the floor were hundreds of ROAHES.......OH MY GOD ..... W packed up and left that dump..... NEVER stay there ......for $200.00 a night it should have been insect free......totally ruined our vacation....

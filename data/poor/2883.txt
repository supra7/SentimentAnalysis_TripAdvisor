This hotel although located is like being trapped in a bad episode of CSI . Very low blue light. The rooms are tiny, poorly laid out and have almost no light. The windows have no privacy curtains so leaving curtains open may not be an option. A queen room is too small for 2 people to share. Service is surly at best. The doorman are purely decorative. Really absurd overall.

we reserved several weeks ahead and requested a quiet location. We were placed in a corner room with large fans from adjacent buildings below on both sides of the room. The room sounded like being next to a freeway all night. The room was very tired in appearance. There is a safe in the room that would not close. The bathroom turned out to need a lot of cleaning and repairs. The shower grout was black in several areas, the ceiling over part of the shower area was peeling, there was no stopper to take a bath. The dressing mirror would not stay in place. The location is good, but the hotel needs refurbishing, and to honor clients requests when placing them into a room. We were offered a different room and declined. We cancelled the balance of our stay and the staff wanted to charge us a cancellation fee. The manager was called and there was no cancellation fee. We then moved to a lovely hotel a block away at a simular rate.

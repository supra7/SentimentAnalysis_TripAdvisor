I booked this "hotel" as I had to stay overnight in London and like the Nottinghill area. They has classified themselves as a 3 star (based on what???). I had looked at the photos online and they seemed basic but looked ok for 50 for a short notice booking. The location was good but as soon as I arrived I had concerns. Before anything else I was being asked to pay and informed that my room would be small and the toilet was down stairs next to Reception. This was pointed out in the small print, clearly something I'd overlooked. When seeking clarification from the man at Reception over entering my credit card details onto their paperwork he sarcastically spelt out the word S-A-M-E ie if the card is the same you dont need to re-write it? Funny as English is my first language and I didnt appreciate the rudeness at the start of my depressing stay. I dragged my heavy suitcase up the stairs (without any offer of help) to my "room" and just couldnt believe what I'd paid for. A converted broom cupboard is the only way to describe Room 26. You can stand up and touch both sides of the wall with your hands, the bed is a small single that dips in the middle, the walls are scuffed & filthy and there is a small narrow window that opens behind your pillow. So freezing head if you fancy some fresh air. I asked for an upgrade but was told they were full and had a look in the area but couldnt find anything so resigned myself to staying in this hovel. Next morning, no hot water for a shower! Breakfast, a dismal selection of cheap white / brown bread; sliced cheese and cereal. A depressing end to a terrible stay. They said this room was originally 85 but on this website it was 49 (then they charged 4% service charge to use my card!). Do yourself a favour and just pay the extra to stay well away from this poor excuse for a hotel.

Our room was up 100+ stairs, top floor, no lift, extremely hot. The room was crammed with a single and a double bed. My son refused to sleep under the covers for fear of what might lurk beneath. Carpets filthy, walls filthy. Light fittings hanging off the wall. Big holes gouged out the walls too. Bathroom was tiny but better decorated than the bedroom and cleaner. I was embarrassed to take my family here. Would never use again. The price may sound inviting but come on guys, you are worth more than this place!!!!

Traveled around the world twice! Location amazing, noise level at night "way to loud to sleep" Heater and Air conditioner way to loud to sleep" I asked four other guests who agreed! Front desk Kennady was the best, the rest were mediocre at best. The concierge was very nice but lets face it we had a reservation at three places "the most hip in town" The name Dana pulled 0 weight! The lobby was not very inviting to sit and relax! Get a couch. There is comfort and style available. The parking crew were amazing and very helpful!! The spa had no men massage therapists and a women had to get me a locker four times and men were always in the locker room so I had to wait four time! Not very relaxing for anyone!

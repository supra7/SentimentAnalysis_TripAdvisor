I stayed here a few years ago, but wanted to warn other TA members about this place. I'm not sure if things have gotten any better, but I don't want to risk finding out. I would never stay here again! Although the hotel was brand new and in a good location, the service was terrible! We should've known when we checked in. There was a woman who was upset because she was taking a shower and other hotel guests had walked in. Well, it turns out that the check-in desk had given them keys to her room thinking it was empty. Eek! Then it was our turn. We had booked a room with confirmed double beds (for four people) and when we showed up they had apparently given all the double-bed rooms away and ran out of rolller beds too. We had to alternate sleeping on the floor. They offered us no compensation except to not charge us for the roller beds when we finally were able to get one! This is not 4-star hotel service for sure! Valet was an additional price (expensive, but that's the norm in Chicago). However, it took them at least 20 minutes to get our car each time! By the third time we needed our car, we learned to call at least 20 minutes in advance from when we wanted to leave. In conclusion, we had a terrible experience here and the staff was not apologetic at all when we expressed our concerns.

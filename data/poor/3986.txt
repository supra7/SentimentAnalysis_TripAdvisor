I booked two nights in this place during 4th of July weekend and could not wait to get away. In a world where hotels are all beginning to look the same the end difference is the service and how one is treated. This is where the Langham fails miserably. Lets get the good out of the way first...clean rooms, nice room styling, well equipped gym and pool (small) and in middle of financial district. On the negative side...room was tiny, minbar was v v overpriced even for a four star hotel. But the cherry on the cake must be the staff. I was met a the door by a rude and abrupt consierge who ordered me to "hurry up" when I checked in case I left my car too long in front of hotel. Same gentleman decided not to hold the door open when we dragged our luggage through the hotel to reception. We decided to ask at the consierge desk for advice on where we could find a restaurant...sum total of their help was a map and "we are here" pointed at the map. Thanks. Floor staff were more like accusing bouncers looking for a reason to have a power trip rather than helpful courteous staff. With an early flight I rang down to reception for a taxi only to be told abruptly that there was a taxi rank outside the hotel and I "should be able to call it myself". Thanks again. Whole hotel needs a crash course in common courtesy. If a hotel claims to be 4 star it needs to act like it all over. No point in promoting an old world hotel charm (which they clearly dont have ) having arrogant bully boy staff on the floor incapable of smiling or being courteous unless you slip them a $5 tip!

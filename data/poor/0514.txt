I had booked and prepaid for this hotel. I confirmed 2 days before we arrived, late check in guaranteed. We arrived after a long drive from Vancouver only to find there was no room for us. They did arrange for us to stay at another hotel in Seattle, miles away at Lake Union; evidently there were no other rooms available in the downtown area. The check-in agent seemed put out to have to relocate and accommodate us. He did arrange for us to have a car service with one transfer downtown. It would only take 5 minutes for the car to arrive. We moved hotels and called the car service, only to be told it would arrive in roughly 90 minutes. This was supposed to be the cap-off of a long 10 day vacation, and it turned out to be a horrible experience. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially after the poor service they showed in dealing with their mistake in overbooking us.

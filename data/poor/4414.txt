Awful hotel; I stayed in better Motel 8s. Rooms are noisy (loud air-conditioning+highway noise) and dirty. There was no shampoo (I had to ask for it specifically). Beds are uncomfortable. Pool reminds me a municipal pool in Brooklyn; the 25th floor adult only European sunbathing pool is a joke; it has the ambiance of a high school parking lot. The hotel leads you to believe that the rooms are in the tower; but they are in a separate buildings. Location is also bad; it is the last hotel on the strip and the neighborhood is very unattractive. Rooms in Riviera (several blocks toward the civilization) are much nicer.

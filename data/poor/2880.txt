Just visted New York city during our Canada's Thanksgiving weekend. Beautiful city and we stayed at the W Hotel on Lexington and 53. If you are claustrophobia and fear of darkness then this hotel is not right for you. Rooms are dimmed dark. This hotel is for young teens who like "Club Atmosphere" settings. I booked using Priceline which was a mistake because I set the ratings to be a 4 star hotel and I ended up with this actual 3-3.5 star rating. Valet parking put some small dents on my doors so please check your vehicle before leaving the hotel. I would visit this city again but not any of the W Hotel chains.

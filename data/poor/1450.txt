incredibly small room, no views - windows look straight into another room, bathroom tiny, nowhere to put vanity bags or items, dirty edges on bathroom floor. No guides or instructions in room, very limited tea coffee facility - both in items and space. Two single beds pushed together although the ad says queen bed. Very limited in every way. Would only rate 2 star. Reception staff very rude as we were vacating.

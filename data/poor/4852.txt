Still in the hotel, only because booked two nights prepaid. While the front desk and bell service are good, housekeeping is extremely bad. The bathroom is dirty with hairs left on walls, nobody really cleaned bathroom before and during my stay. The carpet in the room was not clean and wasn't cleaned/vacuumed during our stay (same bread crumbles stayed untouched). Towels look to be used for ages having some yellowish stains. The bathroom feels and smells rather like a public restroom rather than "luxury hotel" bathroom! General feeling was that the room was not cleaned for us when we came in, but rather got 5-minute touch-up to look OK. All amenities and gadgets that they put in the room don't make it looking bad, but rather odd. Couple years ago we stayed in a small 30-buck motel in Southern California - that one was really clean comparing to this dirty monster. Really - my WORST hotel experience in many years.

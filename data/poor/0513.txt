I booked this hotel thru Clipper Vacations with a guaranteed arrival Thurs nite, Sept. '07. However, when we arrived at 10:30 PM, the desk person checked for our reservation and then replied that our room was not ready. When we finally got a room we found that upon entering the room, a super tiny one, it had a double bed, not the deluxe room with queen bed we ordered and had paid for. The next morning I complained to the Front Office manager to no avail. The hotel: Aside from being in a good location, it has LITTLE or NOTHING to offer. Rooms are very small, but reasonably clean. The bath room is very small with one stand alone basin. However, since it is an old hotel, most rooms will probably be on the small side. Internet access charges are steep, a flat charge plus 10cts/min. There is no guest computer, although the lobby is a nice sitting place. Even without the problems, I would not recommend this hotel. It is not a good value for the price.

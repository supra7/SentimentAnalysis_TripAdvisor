I've been to Maui many times and have always stayed at the Whaler. This trip was the most (actually, the only) disappointing one we've taken there. Heed warnings of prior reviews...the construction there is awful - no landscaping, jackhammers and backhoes running all day - it's like Beirut on a bad day. Future visitors be forewarned - they are closing the pool in September. Maybe I'll go back one day once construction is complete, but I won't rent directly from an individual unit owner again. We weren't told about the construction prior to our trip (even though the owners KNEW we had stayed there many times and that we chose the units we did because of the great courtyard view, people watching and "serenity"). I feel like I've been duped. If you do go between now and end of 2009, book through the Whaler itself. Occupancy seemed pretty low (gee, I wonder why?) and at least by going through them you have the option to change rooms to one of the outward facing sides vs. courtyard facing. We had no options but to deal with the deafening noise, dirt and ugly view. If you do get stuck there, go to the Barefoot Bar at Hula Grill and ask the bartenders for a Jackhammer (Amy's special drink with a dark rum floater). It takes the edge off! Good luck.

We checked in, saw the room and checked back out. I can't add anymore to the description of the ugly, mold infested, creepy room than what has already been said from other reviewers. But I can tell you that it wasn't easy to find another hotel room on a Saturday afternoon. After calling nearly every hotel downton, we lucked out and wound up paying over $200 for the last room available at the Hampton Inn (which was beautiful). But I still shudder at the memory of my very short stay at the Hotel Seattle.

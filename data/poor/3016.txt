I was in Phoenix for a convention and tried to save my organization some money since I do not share a room. While somewhat cheaper than the Sheraton, Hyatt, et al., the San Carlos can always fill because of overflow and overbooking at surrounding hotels. It is Historic and it is OLD, too. One of my colleagues did experience a strange encounter but I really think it was a homeless person roaming the hall. Rooms are small. The closet is bigger than the bath. You have to exit the bathroom to turn around and there is no place to put things in it. It is also nasty. The A/C is central. You have no control. It gets hot and it gets cold. Because of constantly changing water pressure it is impossible to take a shower (and there is no tub) without getting scalded. TV reception is limited and horrible. No amenities other than free internet which doesn't work all the time. The staff are very friendly but don't take care of anything you ask them to. Note they charge an early departure fee which may prevent yo from leaving early because you don't like the place. You would be better served to stay in one of the burbs and commute in. Parking is reasonable at parking garages and the the money you would save along with the better accomidations would be worth it.

What a disappointment! This well located Midtown Manhattan Comfort Inn had a nice facade - clean lobby, breakfast area, nice computer room and small exercise room. But once off the lobby area it all went downhill fast. The room we stayed in on the 5th floor was very small and cramped. The TV armoir was so close to the beds and bathroom door it made manuvering around it at night a hazard. The standard mini coffee maker was located in the bathroom - above the toilet no less! Talk about an unappetizing and unsanitary place to be making coffee - by the john. The rug was so stained and soiled I wore my socks or shoes the entire time we were there. The bedspreads were worn to the point of being almost threadbare. The sheets were standard white, with the added bonus of a few ink or who knows what stains on them that had not come out in the wash. As I was in the manager's office complaining, I realized that her office was just as bad! The carpet was stained, her desk a mess and she offered no remedy or compensation. She did say that the upper floors of the hotel were undergoing renovations and that the 5th floor and below really needed it too. Other than the location and pleasant front desk staff, we were not pleased with this Comfort Inn. I would not recommend staying there. By the way, the cost of this room for one night, on a Monday mid May was well over 200 dollars.

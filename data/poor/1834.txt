We paid extra to be on the top floor. There were 2 barking dogs that the management refused to acknowledge. Finally, they told us they would talk to the owners so they could "talk to the dogs" to get them to be quiet. We then changed rooms. But, unknown to us, there was a confrence of 2000 college students who took over the hotel from Wednesday to Saturday. They occupied the lounge that we paid extra to use. They sat on the floor of the 15th floor having meetings. It was out of control. Even the elevators were hijacked. The express elevator was used by these students and every floor was punched in. We first complained to the maneger who offered us a free nite and room service breakfast. Afterwords, he balked and offered us no food and half price for the nite. We stood our ground and we won. The free internet service in the lounge on the 15th floor was down for 4 days. We'll never go there again.

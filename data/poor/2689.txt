This hotel has great location, close to local music and restaurants. That is its best feature. I had the unpleasant experience of a dirty, unmade room. There were no sheets on the bed, no towels in the bathroom, and the floor of the bathroom and shower were dirty. The night clerk was nice, but reluctantly brought sheets and towels to my room and made the bed. No cleaning was done. I was to stay 2 nights, but cancelled my second night. When I checked out in the morning, a different clerk asked about my accommodations and refunded $25 of my stay, and apologized for the terrible service. It was definitely nothing like it's on-line description. I will go back to New Orleans, but never to this hotel.

Avoid Don Ho Show at all costs After living on Oahu for several years, we have recently decided to try out some tourist activities on the island. This past weekend we decided to check out the Don Ho Show at the Waikiki Beachcomber. I can say this was, without a doubt, the worst performance I've ever been to. Don Ho is either senile or on drugs or alcohol, as he was unintelligible throughout the 3 hour show and kept forgetting the words to the songs and punchlines to the jokes. There was a lot of blue humor as well - I wasn't personally offended, but I was surprised at the jokes being told at a so-called family affair. The side entertainment featured a hula dancer, uke players and a painfully unfunny stand up comic. Approximately 25% of the audience (including ourselves) left before the end of the show because it was just too boring and painful to witness. We had discount tickets and we get to experience the beauty of Oahu every day, but I strongly urge anyone who has limited time in Hawaii to do something other than the Don Ho show. Stroll along the beach, go to a movie - just avoid seeing Don Ho.

We stayed here in September 2001. We arrived in Boston after a flight from the UK on Labour Day weekend and were staying for a week. When we arrrived, having booked and paid for a double room with Virgin Holidays, we were given a single room with a sink that did not hold any water, next to the air conditioning unit and facing a brick wall. This was at 6pm on the Saturday night of Labour Day. They had given all of the double rooms to people staying just for the weekend - it seems that staying for a week meant nothing to them! Went to reception to be told that we would have to stay there until Monday when more rooms became available, even though people were still checking in and getting double rooms! Started off polite, reception staff were unprofessional and totally useless. Took threatening and public humiliation on the Sunday morning to get the room changed - along with 20 other people at reception changing. Food trays stayed outside doors for days, cockroaches in the halls and some rooms apparently! I would not put my worst enemy in this hotel and would certainly wish to discourage anybody else to stay there! I am well travelled and would expect much better service and maintenance from such a hotel, especially in the USA, but have to say that their customer service stinks! Just hope that they read this one day and realise how many holidays they have ruined! Hardly the thing you want to deal with after a trans-atlantic flight!

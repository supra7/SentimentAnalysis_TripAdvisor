I stayed at this hotel during Mardi Gras weekend and my experience was not good at all. First the hotel does not have a parking garage. I was told on the phone that they offered valet parking. However, upon arrival to the hotel I was told that during Mardi Gras weekend the hotel does not offer valet parking. So I said ok where is the parking garage, they said we do not have a parking garage but we recommend you parking at Howard Ave. parking garage and pay $25 a day - and mind you the garage is about ten to fifteen blocks away from the hotel and did not offer shuttle service 24/7. We had to call a taxi to take us back to the hotel because it was raining and cold. When we first arrived they gave us a room by the stairwell - the hallway was wet from the ice machine - the room smelled like mildew - and the all the towels were still wet and damp. We requested another room and was moved to another floor. This room was more acceptable - but for the price we paid for the room - we were very disappointed. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone during Mardi Gras or any other occasion. The hotel is old and does not have any updated features. The TV was plasma however the picture was not clear at all and showed fussiness. Checking out the hotel was the same issue we had to walk all the way to the parking garage with our luggage - we could not get a taxi because all the streets were blocked off and taxi's that did come by would not assist us. Just imagine four women walking ten to fifteen blocks with suitcases, clothes and bags in hand. This was a horrible experience and this was my first time to New Orleans. I will forever stick with the hotels I know such as the Hilton and Crown Plaza. I wish I would have known we could attach photos to this site i would have taken pictures but I was to embarrassed to even show the pictures to anyone. Lesson learned!!!

This was my worst hotel room experience ever. The check in-time was about 30mins and then we got a room size little bigger than a match box. The room was facing the street and we had a sleepless night due to traffic. Next day the room was not changed till 8pm and we had to sit in the bar cause our promised room was not ready. The new room the heating was broken and we had two absolutely freezing nights. The last night the hotel delivered a crummy room heater to help (Picture attached). The room sign was falling apart and taped to the Wall!! (picture attached). The concierge booked us in a comedy club for paid tickets, where on a basic online search we found free tickets!! As a cherry on the cake we left our luggage at the concierge and they nearly lost the luggage! in a nutshell a horrible horrible experience. I have no idea what other people fouind nice at the hotel. It is Crap!!

We were lied to about them having rooms with 2 beds. We were lied to about being able to reserve a adjoining rooms. The rooms are old and outdated. There in NO Jacuzzi and the pool is tiny. The rooms service is very expensive. The 30$ a day for parking is a joke. The lobby is nice but that is about it.

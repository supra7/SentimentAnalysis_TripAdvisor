Stayed for 4 nights at the Time hotel, it is fine, fairly average for New York, small rooms but clean and great doormen. Not worth a review in either direction until the morning of check out when we were DISTURBED THREE TIMES BEFORE TEN AM We knew that they were booked at full occupany and needed a prompt check out at 11am as stated, but we were not prepared for the rudeness with which we were treated that morning. 8.15am telephone call - "did we have a problem with our safe?" "no" 8.30am knock on door - "had we asked for someone to be sent up from downstairs?" "no, definately not" 9.30am second knock on door - "when did we think we might be checking out?" "please stop harrassing us, we're awake , packed and leaving alright!!" This is an unforgivable strategy to ensure our prompt check out. They started 'accidently disturbing' us nearly 3 hours ahead of the scheduled check out time. The first two time I could have considered an honest mistake, by the third time I was suspicious and when I asked a fellow guest who was leaving the hotel at the same time as us... suprise suprise, they had also been disturbed twice that morning. We ended up checking out an hour early (which I am sure they were pleased about) but will NEVER stay there again (which they should consider when they next try this tactic.) and were so angry about this treatment that I have written a review for the first time ever (which I hope will mean they really reconsider this tactic) This ruined what would have been a perfectly reasonably stay, unless you have an early flight out I would not recommend this Hotel.

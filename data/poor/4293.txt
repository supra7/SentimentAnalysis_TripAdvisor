Made my reservations on line using the Total Rewards site and selected and offer code to for the Spring Fever Invitational. A list of hotels came up with the code so I selected the one I wanted to stay at. Now I am told I can't participate in the tournament because I didn't stay at Imperial Palace. I had called Imperial Palace and Harrah's Las Vegas back in February to see if I needed to stay at a specific location, both places told me it didn't matter which Harrah's location I stayed at for the promotion. Of course now I am told that is not the case. What a wasted trip for incompetent Harrah's staff and information!

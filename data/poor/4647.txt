we gave the hotel every opportunity possible to make things right, but since we pre-paid for a room during jazzfest, we got the shaft. the hotel boasts 45 rooms that overlook the courtyard or the quarter, which is a LIE. we were put in a dungeon-like room with no windows next to the cleaning quarters. the sliding lock inside the door was broken. we ignored these two things, and it got progressively WORSE. the maids woke us up every morning with yammering and clatter in the hallway. you could peek through the door blinds to see inside the room the eucalyptus above the tv was covered in months of dust the vents had dust there was to temperature control, just on or off for the air the wall paper was peeling the cable tv had static reception the hallway was cluttered with trash and extra crap left out by the hotel there is no video camera in the main gateway, through which strangers came in on a regular basis to admire the courtyard and to top it all off, we got a visits from a HUGE cockroach in the shower (no tub) the final night, and my girlfriend found a little roach near her muffin in our room the next morning. all this for five nights for only $1000? what a bargain! WORST HOTEL STAY EVER. and we have stayed at hotels of all types the world over.

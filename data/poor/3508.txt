My brother and his girlfriend have just returned from a stay in this hotel. My brother was woken at 0500 to a half eaten bar of chocolate on his locker and a rat (aaaaaaacccch) scurrying about his room. They tried to check out with Reception but were told that they'd have to go through the website they booked it with and would lose their deposit. Reception assured them that rodent control visit every 2 weeks and that they'd have to understand that the hotel is very old. They were offered another hotel room and because they'd only be in New York for a few days and the hassle of getting another hotel and sorting it out with the website they decided to stay. I'd have been out of there prompto! I told him that he should have visited Trip Advisor before he went and asked had he any bug bites, no he hadn't received any bites. Luckily none from a rodent either! Disgusting, I've never heard worse. Visit this hotel at your peril!!

This hotel's website says that the hotel is "relaxing," and many TA reviews comment that the rooms are quiet, at least those that face the inner courtyard. Based on that information, we booked (and prepaid) for a room facing the inner courtyard. During our stay, the hotel hosted a large party for more than 100 in the inner courtyard. The party featured a very loud DJ and a lot of screaming, cheering, etc. The noise in our room from the party was so loud that it exceeded the top volume of the room's TV. The party continued until 2:00 a.m. After the party, the hotel staff cleared tables, dishes, etc. which, while not as loud as the party, was not exactly "relaxing." I complained twice to the front desk (at 1:00 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.), and I was told that nothing could be done for me. (However, when I told the man at the front desk that it would be easier to sleep at Termini, the main rail station in Rome, he nodded in agreement.) When I checked out the next morning, other guests were complaining about the noise from party. Because I was literally unable to sleep at the hotel, I asked for a refund or a partial refund of the $450 I paid for the room. My request was refused. Because of the configuration of the hotel, its use as a late night party venue is totally inconsistent with its use as a "relaxing" place to sleep. By the way, the front desk of the hotel displays a plaque touting its rating on TA. I guess once you have enough good reviews, you don't have to care about your guests any more.

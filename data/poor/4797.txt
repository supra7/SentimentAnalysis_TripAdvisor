We have stayed here previously and found it acceptable. It is close to the beach so we decided we could overlook the traffic noise. Since our last stay a bar/night club opened right across the street. At 2:00 am they push everyone out and onto the street. We were awake from 1:30 am until 4:40 am. The office closes at 12 midnight. How convenient. When I complained at 8:00 am the next morning I was told that yes a club had opened within the last year and it got very noisy. I told them after the people left the club they came into the parking lot to continue partying and fighting. They did refund my next nights stay, but that meant we had to drive home for seven hours after being there for only 24 hours. Thanks for ruining my get away weekend.

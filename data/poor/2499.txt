I was assigned to this hotel by Delta Airlines because they cancelled my flight. It was late, I was tired and the rest is a nightmare. The person behind the desk was nice, but distracted by other employees. Never looked up at me when I asked about the restaurant, which is a whole other story -ouch! The room I assigned to was I am sure on the runway. FedEx was flying at 3 am and that was my last sleep. The hallways and my room smelled like Jet fuel. Breakfast was unappetizing. It was a buffet with undercooked bacon and over cooked green eggs. I couldn't wait to get out of there.

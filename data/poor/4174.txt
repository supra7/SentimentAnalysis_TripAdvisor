The Unprepared St Regis Probably this hotel will be ready in another 6 months from now, but as is now, they should not charge the hotel like staying at the regular St Regis resort with its famous services. We stayed here for a night, but everything went wrong. First we found that our kitchenette in our lagoon villa was flooded with water coming from the AC. For 4 hours there were the maintenance guy with us in the villa. Secondly, during breakfast, they were trying so hard to deliver flawless service by offering all kind of bfast things just like in the Dim Sum place, that they forgot to deliver my husband's breakfast order. Then, the AC in the living room was so warm, even we set it as 15 deg Celcius. Then, lastly, the one that really made us disappointed, when we cancelled the luggage pickup service, when we left the room, they took all our luggage and bags and clothings and leave it up at front by the drop off area. Not recommended.

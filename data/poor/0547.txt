Avoid at all costs. The positive experiences associated with this property:The front desk staff on duty at 10 pm August 29, 2007The shuttle van driver for the 7 am shuttle, August 30, 2007The negative experiences associated with this property:The entrance to the guest area appeared to be accessible only by room key. In fact, at the two entrances I tried, neither was locked. No guest security at all. The hall had random abandoned chairs and benches.My first room, 265, had a king bed. I was unable to find the TV remote. The front desk brought up a spare. When I pulled back the covers, I found the remote in the sheets. The sheets were dirty.My second room, 248, had clean sheets on both queen beds. However, there were used tissues on the floor hidden by the bedspread. The bedside table drawer contained a half full box of condoms. The deadbolt lock lever was missing. The front desk clerk who was on duty at 6:45 am August 30, 2007, had ordered a taxi for another guest. When the axi?arrived, it was a Lincoln driven by an older gentleman and did not display any taxi signs, names, or meter. Prior to departing, the older gentleman tried to hand off what appeared to be a kickback to the desk clerk. This same guest told a similar story of filthy sheets, waiting 30 minutes for clean sheets which she put on, and a bath with hairballs.I have stayed at Red Lion Hotels before and been pleased. This property is a disgrace.

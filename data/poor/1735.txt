Ist let me say This is a hotel for business travelers. 2nd The 2nd night we are there security knocks on our door at 11:45 pm telling us we have a "package" We did not and never opened the door. No apology from the front desk about that. The shuttle service provided by New Way is horrible. The drivers knowledge of the english language is poor at best. All they know is how to get the guests driven to the various parks. They have no knowledge of other things like places to eat etc near the hotel. The concierge consists of a flat panel tv that you do research on your own. The shuttle company also is not aware of the various hours that the theme parks may alter during various times of the year.example seaworld closes at 7 pm on a m onday had to wait till 8 pm for the shuttle and we were the only 2 on the property when it's 33 degrees out. Also 1 dropoff time and 1 pickup time 10pm is not convient for lots of people especially if you have kids which I don't. So overall for the cost we paid for the 7 nights we stayed here I will stay somewhere else nhext time I'm in Orlando

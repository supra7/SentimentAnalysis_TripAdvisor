Myself and my partner were traveling around the East coast and were staying in Boston for 2 nights. Neither of us had ever been to a baseball match so we decided to ask the concierge the best place to buy them. He was very happy to tell us that he could get us tickets. We thought the tickets were very expensive but decided to go anyway. We met a "vendor" outside the Red Sox stadium and handed over the money. The tickets cost approx $15 each we handed over approx $150!!! We complained to the hotel and they didn't want to know. If you want to go to the game buy them outside the game or print them off yourself. This incident spoiled our view of Boston.

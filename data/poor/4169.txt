A Warning - You Know we all have that sixth sense that we should listen to...i didnt on this one .. The warning Bells should have sounded when we arrived at reception and they couldnt wait to get my credit card out of my hand to pre - pay ...now thats never going to happen again... The bells should have also sounded when after half an hour of waiting in the Lounge ..or should we say first floor wating area the desk attendant seemed to be carryin half a bed up stairs...still the bells didnt ring. We where then shown the room - 508 you couldnt swing a cat in it - small does not do it justice ... a 'double bed ' that really wasnt, small furniture to try to make the room look bigger, and the killer was a 4ft high cupboard masquerading as a wardrobe to hang your clothes in - 4 coathangers only and i'm having to hang a suit in for an exhibition i'm visiting. But lets also not forget about the window that when closed lets the rain sweep across the window ledge ..so bad we put a towel on it to stop it going on the floor ..and reported to cleaner who gave us a smile and said 'yes we have known about it for Months' This Hotel is based on our experience a rip off ..we have stopped in far superior hotels in Amsterdam ( at least 7 times before). And The Bells i Keep refering to are the Tram & Bicycle Bells the street noise even when the window is shut at 3am is loud ....but they do issue you with 'free' earplugs if you ask-what about better quality insulation.!! Please the only way we will change poor hotels such as this is by not going ... Amsterdam is a tremendous city it doesnt need this type of underperforming establishment And on a final note ....I Regret not checking 'Trip Advisor' before we booked it ...

In town on business, so needed a place with reasonable amenities and a good night sleep. Free wifi, good TV selection, kitchenette and comfy bed looked promising, but in the first room I went to, I could hear everything in the room next door (there was an adjoining room door). I knew this would be a problem so asked the manager if he could find me something quieter, so he moved me upstairs. Same setup, same problem, and they couldn't change room types. I can hear every word, sound, conversation and bodily function from the couple next door. When the lights are out, I can see light around all edges of the hallway door, so assuming they did something similar with the adjoining room doors. Staff is friendly but unhelpful. Never been in a hotel with such poor sound insulation - without a good night's sleep it's hard to appreciate what they did right with this place.

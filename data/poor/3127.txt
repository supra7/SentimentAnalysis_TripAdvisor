A lot of mold in the shower, unexplainable brown smudges on the interior of shower curtain. Shower head was horrific, more over spray than water. Cheap looking, unfriendly and uncomfortable decor. Felt more like the room was rented by the hour. The door to the room had a gap between the door jam and door so wide we could see people walking in the hallway, not to mention the 2 inch gap at the bottom of the door. No second lock on the door we had to move the table and chairs in front of the door for fear someone could get in.

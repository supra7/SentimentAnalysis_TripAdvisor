We booked a room directly with The Point in January of 2011 for a long weekend stay to visit relatives and go to Universal and Sea World. We booked a one bedroom suite after being told on the phone by the reservations agent that we could also have a cot so that our daughter wouldn't have to share a bed with our son. The agent also told us that they had a great business center and Wifi. When we arrived the front desk personnel were brusque almost to the point of rudeness. They looked like we were inconveniencing them by checking in. When we got upstairs to our room there was not cot. We called down and were told they have no cots. We spoke with the manager on duty and he began to grill me about who I spoke with and was I sure that they told me that and basically called us liars. He then began to negotiate with me to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom suite. I asked to speak with the general manager and was told he wasn't there. I then asked them to call him at home and he said he would think about it. I got a call from the general manager who apologized and then gave us the upgrade. For the remainder of the visit the front desk had the same bad attitude as when we checked in. When we asked about their partnership deal with Universal for tickets which was advertised in their lobby the desk staff knew nothing about it. When we went to check out we asked to use the business center to print our boarding passes for the return trip. The business center had a card system where you had to buy preset amounts of time for a large sum which you lost if you didn't use it all. They also only had wifi in their lobby not the rooms. The rooms did have wired internet service but with limited cord size so you were somewhat restricted as to where you could use it. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone because of the staff attitudes and the general misrepresentation of their facilities and services.

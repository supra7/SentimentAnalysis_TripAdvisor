I booked a room through a main website and there were problems with the price: it was much higher then expected. I then cancelled the booking and contacted directly the Hostal. They answered, confirmed the booking with correct price and asked me to re-confirm few days before arrival. Unfortunately when I wrote back few days before arrival, they didn't keep my booking and they hadnt any available room. I contacted them sending the emails we exchanged and they didn't even reply!! Its not in the centre of the city, and with the same amount of money you can easily find better value. I definitely don't recommend this Hostal.

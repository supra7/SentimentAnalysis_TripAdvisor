I agree with all the comments about it being run down, and in dire need of updating. Our problem was that starting at 3am there was a steady stream of very loud "partygoers" going down our hall and screaming laughing etc. We called the front desk and the one man supposedly on security came up and told us that he had warned them and there was "nothing else he could do". Furious we pack our bags to head home, at 4 in the morning. We are then offered a better room because he didnt want to go and get our car. we later learned by staff in the restaurant that that night gentleman had let 35 people into the presidential suite and they were having a party. This was disgusting service and a real let down. this place is no long Indy fine hotel. It is attracting a much different crowd. STAY CLEAR

My wife and I just returned from a two-day stay in Boston. We simply had to comment on how terribly disappointed we were in our choice of hotel - the Boston Park Plaza. Mind you, we booked through Expedia and relied on the photos on the website. We reserved a 'Deluxe' room specifically because we understood that it would have a king-sized bed. Once we got to our room we were shocked to find a dingy, dirty room with a queen-sized bed. The carpets were filthy, the bedspreads stained, the walls marred and scuffed, and the bathrooms antiquated. We went to the desk and complained which resulted in our being moved to a room with a king-sized bed - a SMOKING room. The room reeked of cigarette smoke. The rugs had innumerable cigarette burns and was in the same sorry state. In addition, the liner of the bathtub was peeling up from the tub, the air-conditioning didn't work and did I mention that the halls were filthy? Going back to the front desk we were told that we'd be re-accomodated in a non-smoking room the next day. Resigned to our fate, and tired of moving, we bought a scented candle and tried to make the best of it. However, I felt compelled to make a statement here in the hopes that it would save someone the trouble of booking at this hotel. For the money (approx. $150/night after tax) it was very much not worth it. I stayed at the Best Western at Longwood Medical Center a few months back and the rooms were spacious and immaculate - for $100/night. Save your money - avoid the Park Plaza - shop around. It'll be worth you while.

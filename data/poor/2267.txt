If you love cramped quarters, filthy bathrooms, cold showers, and non-functioning basics like the ice machine and room thermostat, then the El Cortez will thrill you like no other hotel I've ever seen! After my recent stay there, I'm convinced "El Cortez" is Spanish for rathole. While I expect the casino to be smokey, the smell of smoke is pervasive throughout the building - even in the non-smoking rooms. The casino itself is the smokiest, and most poorly-lit I've ever seen, as well. The bottom line - if you're a smoker who plans on spending only enough time in the hotel room to wash your face and crash, then this might be the place for you. Otherwise, sleeping in your car and taking spongebaths in the local 7-11 will be more comfortable.

At a resort of this caliber you would expect that the hotel management would not allow construction work to take place at 1:30 am. However, work continued even after three calls to the front desk manager. On the third call the manager advised that the night work was authorized by the General Manager and it would not be stopped. To allow masonry work, involving tile saws, drilling, hammering and load talking to take place at these hours shows total disregard by the General Manager for his guest.

Just got back from a business trip and chose this hotel has a convenient location. I am not picky at all about a hotel as it is just a place for me to sleep. Please note that it appears people from the office do not answer the phones from the rooms as I tried calling several times about a wake up call with no answer. My alarm clock was malfunctioning and they did not have an automated phone wake up call. One star goes to the maintenance guy who helped me get an alarm clock the next day. He actually acted as though he cared. Asked the front desk for regular coffee and the front desk did not have it delieverd to my room by next morning. Would have asked a maid for coffee in the hall as I often do but never saw one. Next day I asked again, this time a bit aggravated, and believe it or not, all the front desk person had to do was take a few steps and get it! To top it all off, there was a guy that was stuck in the parking lot as his car would not start . I helped him push the car out of their lot as this guy told me that they were going to call the cops and have him towed. Not sure what the story on that was but the front desk people at this Hampton Inn was the laziest workers I have seen in a while.

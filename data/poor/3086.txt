The hotel is certainly in the right location, however the service was hideous. No returned phone calls from management, the walls are paper thin and it's not in the best neighborhood (if you're going for spring break, then cross that thought out). Breakfast was horrible (toast was not toasted- literally right out of the bread bag, no jelly, butter, salt or pepper and they actually charged $2 each for tap water??? Unbelievable. I was very excited to finally arrive here after reading the reviews, but if you are looking for service, stay at the Hyatt LaJolla or W downown.

Our room was average. The one good thing about the room was it was on the 22nd floor and we could see the strip and people jumping off the tower from the sky ride. If you want to upgrade to a jet tub you can not smoke in your room. Thats a big deal to me because i smoke and at Bally's you can have a jet tub room and smoke in it. I got a horrible rash All OVER MY BODY!! I have stayed in Vegas before and never got a rash, I stayed in Cuba and never got a rash, i stayed in Freeport, Bahamas and never got a rash. They advertise unlimited to go to the tower. I guess i didn't read the fine print. I thought that meant unlimited rides up there. Of course they aren't included. For the first 7 days there we would go to the bar to get a tea and a water. The charge was $2.50. Then on the 7th or 8 th day. The bar charged me $5.00 for a tea and a half bottle of water. My husband told the bar tender the water is free. He said you HAVE TO BE AT THE SLOTS FOR IT TO BE FREE. WHILE WHY IS THAT NOW? HE HAD NO ANSWER AND so we went to put in a compliant. We went to the front desk.The manger of the front desk was really nice and GAVE US 2 WATER'S FOR FREE and sent the food manger to us. He was like YA, THEY CAN GET FIRED FOR GIVING YOU FREE WATER. YOU COULD BE A PERSON OFF THE STREET. WE HAD SHOWEN THE BARTENDER AND NOW THE MANGER OUR TICKET FROM GABLING AND ALSO WE HAD BEEN PLAYING ON THE SLOTS FOR HOURS AND NOT ONE WAITRESS HAD COME AROUND. THE FOOD MANGER WAS LIKE OH, WELL, SUCKS TO BE YOU! AND SO, I SAID I WILL BE PUTTING THIS ON THE NET. WHEN WE WERE WALKING AWAY.. HE WAS LAUGHING AT US. It's not the money, its the point either the water is free or not. I GUESS THE MANGER AT THE FRONT DESK SHOULD BE FIRED TOO CAUSE SHE GAVE US FREE WATER!! So, the next day i phone the manger of the hotel to tell him what went on with the water and the food manger laughing at us. I told him how i have this RASH ALL OVER. I was pretty sure they advertise that they have a doctor on the place. I asked him if they have a doctor and HOW MUCH WOULD THAT COST? His repley DO YOU WANT AN ABULANCE TO COME SEE YOU? SO, THERE IS NO DOCTOR BUT THEY CAN CALL 911 FOR YOU!! How rediculious!! Ya, i want an abulance attentent to look at my rash!!! Very poor customer service!! I would never stay there again! I DON'T RECOMMEND STAYING THERE! IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING!

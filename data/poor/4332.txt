Where to start... Long long long line to check in. Booked over phone and was told I was in a newly renovated room on a high floor. At check in, was told I did not have a renovated room and would be extra $15 per night. No AC in room. Shower didn't drain. Air quality was horrible, seems to have no air circluation in hotel.Felt like I was in a ghetto hotel. While walking down the hall I could touch the ceiling and I am 5'5". This should be a 2 star hotel.

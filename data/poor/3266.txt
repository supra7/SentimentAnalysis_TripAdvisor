It took 45 minutes to check in. Only to be told none of the four rooms I had booked were ready. When we returned - the wait was 30 minutes - only to be told ONE of the FOUR rooms was ready. Several more hours went by...another lenghty wait in line and ONE more room was ready. The guest went to her room, opened the door and was quite surprised to find it occupied by a couple who were in the midst of a romantic encounter! When the remainder of the rooms were FINALLY ready - we were not given queen beds as requested. We were told there were no queen beds at this facility - yet when the reservation was booked we were given the choice. Our rooms were all on different floors. It was 5:00pm by the time we all got our rooms. This was BY FAR the WORST experience I've EVER had at any hotel.

We stayed Le Westin Montreal on 9/4 and 9/5. We were really looking forward to staying at your place because we heard that this hotel place is bland new, and we really enjoyed stay at Westin hotel when we lived in Japan. However, we had a miserable night at Le Westin Montreal. First, after we checked in, a porter lost my wife's jacket while he brought our baggage to our room, but he never admit that and claimed that she had left it in the car. My wife went to "lost and found" by herself and found it. It turned out that the porter had dropped her jacket on the hallway and somebody had found it. Second, this hotel is still under construction. There were tons of tools everywhere. The pool looked good, but the changing room was not ready. no shower and no locker there. The water was so cold and we couldn't stay there more than 10 minutes. Third and most importantly, the service was awful. We came back from the pool to our room shivering with cold and we wanted to take a shower in our room, but we could find bath towels. I asked room service to bring them, but they never came. I had to make a call to room service three times (we had to wait for 2hrs) To make it worse, no hot water came out. So I send an email and complained, and I got auto email reply saying "we will give you extra starwood points for your inconvenience". We have decided never ever choose Westin for our next trip.

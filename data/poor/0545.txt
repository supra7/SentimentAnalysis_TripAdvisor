Needs Staff, Needs Repairs, Poor Security, Disappointed ! Interesting place to stay if you are into...living through minimal staffing, rooms in need of wallpaper and window screen repair, soiled  stained room furniture (gross), torn shower drapes, outside security doors that don't lock. Plus returning late at night to your 3-day, fully paid-for room  discovering that you have been issued magnetic door lock cards that have been deactivated after the first day (nice touch at 11:00 PM); room service that has been missed (towels  room clean-up that has been skipped or missed by housekeeping staff); sealed bags of trash and excess furniture left outside rooms in hallways for days on end....and banquent facitlities that are left open and uncleared for 2 days following social gatherings. In short...save your money, this Red Lion location is a post dorm party catastrophy in the making! One of the poorest maintained, poorest staffed motels we've stayed at in the past 10 years...rate this one as 1/2 star, may it RIP : ( A piss-poor excuse for an accommodation at any price.

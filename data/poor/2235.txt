on june 4th,2004 my wife made a resevation at the tropical manor from a referral from her cousin(who had stayed there) for a week. we was quoted by the motel for $595 plus tax for a week to stay.(this was not only quoted to my wife but to her cousin as well). we paid our $200 deposit and when we got the reservation confirm. they had raised the price $200 more dollars. of course i called and was told that they had to change it and we was misquoted. i asked to speak to the manager and was told he was not there(this was on the 14th of june), but the man i was speaking to told me her could do the room for $650 for the week and i agreed for that. but on the 15th a girl called and said our room was cancelled due to the fact it was over booked. my question to this is how was this room booked twice by me and then it was gone, i think they tried to jack the prices after i made the reservations. i then asked to speak to the owner and she was not thereand then the manager and he was not there. i asked dave(the man on the phone) when he would be there and he told after 5,so i called after 5 and asked for (al green-mgr) and was asked who was calling. after i tokd dave who it was,he notifeid me the manager was not available. i asked for him to call me back but was not told that he would not. i was also notified by dave that my business with them was over.and that now i have to find reservations for my family and i(2 adults and 3kids ) for a week of june 26th. all we wanted to do was take our baby to the beach for the first time.But the bottom line to all this is that quoted the price to not just one person but to two people, and then after I paid the deposit raised the price. But when I said something and questioned this I was treated very badly and my reservations was cancelled. If you have any questions over this please call me at home (478)956-1985.

This is a bait & switch type of place. We stayed there before our cruise to Alaska, and I called from Pennsylvania to verify non-smoking. The staff would not listen when I said I refused to stay in his horrible smelly and dirty room. The lobby was also dirty, and they cannot accommodate a group of people before a cruise. About 4 hours later, after they sent a man with a can of spray to remove the smoke???? really a can of spray???? YES!, and I refused to stay there, they found a room with 8 spotlights in the ceiling, no towel bars on the 2nd floor that was non-smoking. I wonder what this room is used for during other times, because no other hotel room has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???? Perhaps the police needs to know about this place that has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???!!! We had to move our things ourselves after fighting with them for hours. And the consierge gave out bad advice about what time to leave for the ship. They said they have a smoking floor for over 20 years, and there is no way they can remove the smell of smoke from a room. I said I called long distance from Pennsylvania a week before the stay, and they said no problem. Don't waste your time or money by staying at the Warwickand they do nothing to help you. if you want a great place try the Doubletree Suites at Seattle, WA SEATAC near the airport for a large room with great accommodations and a great staff and they have people in the lobby to print your airline boarding passes with complete gracious, efficient staff for everything!

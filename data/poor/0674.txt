If you've ever really wanted to know what it would be like to sleep in an ashtray, book yourself in. The rooms here are pretty bad to say the least. To give it 1 star would be generous. Apart from the intense smell of cigarette smoke, the sheets, furniture and bathroom date back to Byzantine times and have seldom been cleaned since. The restaurant on the top floor need not be there at all. They certainly don't need a menu as nothing on it was available to order (which I dare say was probably a good thing). I fervently recommend that you feed elsewhere or not at all. To top off my stay, a curious member of staff was opportunistic enough to steal USD$160 from an envelope that was hidden deep in my backpack, locked away in my room. Management were less than helpful, to the point of not caring at all. FIND ANOTHER HOTEL AT ALL COSTS!

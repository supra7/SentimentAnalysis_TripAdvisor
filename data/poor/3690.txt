bring your nose plugs booked this 4 star hptel on priceline and i got a gardenview room.after a long flight we checked in and when we opened the door the smell overtook us. The room seemed like it was barely used and smelled the must of your grandmothers 50 year old furniture. The mustiness was so bad my wife threw up after about 15 minutes i complained then asked for a room in the tower and they told me it would cost me an additional 150 per night. They then gave me another gardenview room that was less stinky.we hardly spent any time in the room because of the stench. i would not stay at this hotel in a gardenview room.They call it the pink palace but my kids call the STINK Palace.

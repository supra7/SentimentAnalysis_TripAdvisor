I booked a room in this hotel before seeing the reviews in this site. After seeing them I cancelled, receiving a proper cancellation confirmation e-mail from the HBN booking service. That was more than 2 weeks before the day of arrival. Today, checking my bank details I realised that they still charged me the 70 pounds of the hotel room, without even staying there. I called them and they even said that it's my fault! Absolutely, the most unprofessional hotel ever. They are thieves! Do not make any reservation with them!

This is not a HOTEL. THis is a MOTEL. The Motel is off the Highway and the rooms are extremely loud. You can hear traffic all night. I had to sleep with the fan on to drown out the noise. The front desk clerk was extremely rude when I asked to exchange rooms because it was too loud he told me "that is your opinion" The bed very old and uncomfortable and I probably slept 3 hours due to tossing and turning. With a load of business meetings- I will probably never stay at a BW again.

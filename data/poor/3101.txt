After we checked into the front desk and got our luggage to go up to the room. My husband heard the staff snicker about how much luggage we had for 2 days. Not that is was their business, but the luggage was for a 10 day trip. 2 of which would be at that hotel. Which was cut down to 1 day because it was such an awful hotel. I wondered how the maid and grounds keeper knew how long we were staying anyway! If you go to this hotel, DO NOT reserve a regular room! I didn't realize the difference between a regular room and the junior suite. There is a HUGE difference, the regular room is so small that my husband hurt his back because he had to twist through the front door to get our suitcases in the room. Here was NO ROOM for our 4 SMALL pieces of luggage. We were in room 203 on the second floor. A large sized person might not make it though the door into the room! They had two beds, which looked smaller than full's, crammed into a very small space. The mattresses were set into a square pressed board, make shift frame. Which ALL of us kept hitting our toes and knees on, we ended up having to put our luggage around the corners to keep from hitting our legs, but we still kept hitting our toes. You had to squeeze past the bed to get out on the patio, the screen door may as well have not even been there, it was broken and very hard to open and close. There were only 3 towels and 1 washcloth, I had to go down to get my own towels. If you ask for towels to the pool, you have to sign a card and personally return them to the office! It didn't matter, the pool was freezing! I will say though, it is a great location, right on the beach, if you are going to stay here get a larger room!

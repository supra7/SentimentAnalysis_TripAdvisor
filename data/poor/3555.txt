No bathroom in rooms When I arrived I read in a paper that chek in was made in another hotel 2 bloks away. At chek in I was informed that rooms didn't have bathroom inside but only one bathroom for floor (always occupied). This is not written in expedia site. When I arrived in my room I found a lady eating curry chiken inside, she went away immediately leaving horrible smell for all the day. Finally I found another hotel and I went away. Very bad experience.

Extremely Disappointing Upon entering, the hotel lobby appeared charming, but after sitting there for a while, we began to notice that the furnishings were worn, the air was musty and the guest bathroom was downright dismal.The room we were given looked nothing like the one on the photo. Be aware that the level of dcor in the rooms range from over the top to absolutely stark depending on the room type/rate you select. The almost see through sheets, from being worn, along with holes in them, and a strange odor, did not cost extra.The hotel staff was unfriendly and had an ttitude? We switched hotels after the second night because someone was lurking in the hallway, knocking on the door of the vacant room adjacent to us, after two phone calls to the front desk, the problem still persisted. This led us to believe the safety and well-being of the hotel guests was of no concern to staff.We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

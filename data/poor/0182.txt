this was absolutely my worst hotel experience ever. i don't even know were to begin. the rooms were old and disgusting i felt like bugs were going to crawl out of the cracks in the walls. we were lucky enough to get the room next to the ancient elevator which sounded like a locomotive going all night long. when we called to ask if we could be moved as it was impossible to sleep with the noise the staff was very rude and would not move us. when it was time to check out i called to have our car brought around by the valet which cost $37 15 minutes before heading down to check out, we were told we only needed to call 5 minutes in advance. once we got down and waited outside for another 10 minutes my boyfriend decided to go in and check what was going on, they said the car is on the way. 5 minutes later still no car. we went back into check and discovered nobody every even went to get out car. finally the valet came out and couldn't even find where our car was parked. the entire experience was just awful.

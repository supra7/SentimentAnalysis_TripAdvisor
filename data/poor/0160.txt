I stayed at the Moore Hotel 10/12-10/18. NO HEAT!! Owner refused to turn heat on (radiator) but for one night,staff said it wasn't worth to turn on for a few guests.If you don't care on comfort stay here, rented a room with a bath. Not much of a room, bathroom had no place to hang anything, no soap dish in small shower,thin towels, bed sheets had holes in them. Constant draft from the window,not child safe. Smell of urine in hallway. Noisy street,ify area.It is close to the market. If you think a summer stay would be better- no a/c. One star hotel one a good day.

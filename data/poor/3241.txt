We made a reservation through Tripadvisor rather than direct with the hotel. It turned out that 1800Hotels.com was a fraud, charging our card, but not paying the hotel for our room. None of that is the Wynn's fault. However, how the hotel handled the situation was terrible. The Wynn showed that we had a room reserved, and asked us to wait until it was cleaned. One hour later they told us that the room was ready, but our reservation had been canceled. After several phone calls, we realized that we had been duped, and that we would need to pursue 1800Hotels on our own. But since we still needed a hotel room, and they had one clean and waiting for us, we expected that they would rent us the room directly for a similar price as our reservation. WRONG. The desk staff asked for twice the rate we had originally booked for and refused to have a manger discuss the issue with us. We left and had a perfectly wonderful weekend at Caesar's. Although we have stayed several times at the Wynn and enjoyed it, we will not be going back again.

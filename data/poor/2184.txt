A/C is "body heat activated" and weak. Nothing worse than coming back to a hot room in this Texas heat. Skid marks in the toilet, half empty water bottle in the bathroom, gnats flying around the room, no ironing board, ice machine on floor wasn't working. Requested another room. 2nd room same issue with the A/C, extremely weak and shut off if you left the room. Ice machine on floor of the second room also inoperative. My company's awards banquet was held at this hotel and after the banquet went back to a 90 degree room at 1am. Packed up and left with a full refund. I'm all for a "Green" hotel room but I place my comfort over that. Kill the A/C all you want but I want full control over it during my stay and I want it to work and work well.

Although your purpose for traveling to New York is not staying in a Hotel, you want to appreciate your entire vacation experience. We paid $324 for a two night stay and this is what we got--- There were several problems with the hotel including: 1. The hotel turns off the heat at a certain time in the night probably around 12pm to 1am, thats when they think no one will notice that its off. Then they turn it back on early in the morning. New York is pretty cold during the winter months and you really dont want to get sick! We figured this scheme out on the second night, when we tried to get help the first night, all the guy did was come up and play with the heating device and said wait 15 minutes. After we called the third time he told us that no one else was complaining. 2. The showerhead was not working, so we had to go down the hall to another bathroom to take a shower. 3. The phone was not working to dial out. 4. You have to pay for internet access. Holiday Inn right on 94th street was cheaper than this place. We regret booking at Newton.

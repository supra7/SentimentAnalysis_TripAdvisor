Hotel is a great deal- especially when you book far in advance. Unfortunately, don't expect your room to be there if you are coming in late at night. We arrived at 11:30pm and were told that they had given our 2 rooms away because they couldn't charge our card. 2 hours later and on the phone with credit card company who was telling us that we had been charged for the rooms that night, we had the night desk person offer us 2 rooms at 3 times the rate we booked. We had to walk around times square and find a small hotel for the night and had to come back the next day to deal with the manager. Not a good way to start your trip! Once the manager cleared everything up and apologized (we were still out an extra $300), things seemed to be looking up. On our 2nd night there, my friend caught one of the desk people going into our room to look for "tape"- we had not been told or called and so he went in and watched them while they moved a couple of things around and left. As much as it was a great deal initially, sometimes it's true that you get what you pay for.

Failed to meet expectations The Clift hotel failed to meet my expectations and is was a major dissappointment. It is definitely not a five star hotel. The general unwelcome feel one experiences upon entering the lobby is compounded by the arrogant pushy attitudes of the door staff, front desk staff, and especially the cranky concierge. They don't have a pool, there's a pungent smell on most of the floors, and you have to pay for using the internet. The hotel is dimly lighted so that visitors can't see the worn and stained carpet. The hotel becomes infested with nightclubbers at night with all these cheezy types acting like monkeys on the lobby furniture as well as keeping ourselves and the other guests annoyed with their techno music blasting from the spanish suite right next door. And then there's the hotel bar, the Redwood Room. I don't mind paying more for a fine modern bar experience but again the Clift has failed in this department. The bar is very attractive and stylish, blending the history of the old grande hotel with the modern elements in a silky smooth collage. That's where the positives end - great design, poor execution. On approaching the hostess stand guests are looked up and down before being escorted to an appropriate location. Interestingly, the more attractive the look, the more prominent the location will be. We were seated right at the bar. The sharp looking bartenders were standing around chatting and didn't notice our deep need for a drink for quite some time. On approach, I asked what their signature cocktail was. The bartender responded by asking what I usually drink (a Chopin Martini), walked away, made the drink, presented it, and said, that'll be $14. Then he asked my colleague what she wanted to drink. She opted for a bottle of becks. $8. That was our last visit to that bar.

We checked into a clean room but this was the last we saw of house keeping except when we had to borrow towels from her cart. Arrived back after a day of site seeing to find the room exactly as we left it, same damp towels, trash cans full and the sink had never drained from the morning toothbrush routine. I had called the drain issue to the attention of the desk clerk but somehow it "slipped thru the cracks" The maintenance man shows up a few minutes later and plunged the sink with a toilet plunger that he carried in and out of room wrapped in a foul smelling plastic bag that left our room smelling awful. At this point, I totally lost it and went to the desk and asked if they expected us to use this sink after a toilet plunger had been used on it? The desk manager was nice and assured me that my room and the sink would be serviced. We headed out to the water park where the kids had a blast, but due to the overwhelming smell of chlorine, my 13 yr old was having chest pain and my 11 year old coughing continuously after a short period. When we arrived back to the room, we found the same mess we had left. I threw all our dirty linens out the door, along with the trash and went to get my own fresh towels from the desk. This place looked great on the website but is definitely overpriced with just downright disgusting housekeeping.

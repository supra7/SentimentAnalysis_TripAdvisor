My sister-in-law and I went to visit my niece who attends San Diego State for a few days. On our first night we were talking on our balcony in a regular tone of voice. The phone rang and we were told that our voices were carrying and that we needed to go inside! The office staff had the screen door open 24/7 and were listening to everything (almost looking for something to happen) while at the same time we had a security guard starring up at us every night we were there. At one point a lady from the office came outside and screamed up, "If I hear one more peep out of one of those two rooms..." I wasn't sure if she was addressing us but we weren't doing anything. It seemed as though she was looking directly at us though. We were confused! No guests complained about us it was just the staff listening in and waiting for something to happen. The first morning we were there we went down to the lobby (if you can even call it that!) to get coffee and over heard the woman at the desk saying something about our room and how pissed we were, we were totally confused. When the lady had called the night before we were very apologetic and told her we didn't realize we were even being loud. We decided not to confront the staff while overhearing them talk about our room because we were already hip to their rude character!!! Furthermore, the cable TV was a joke, you couldn't watch anything as their satelite was all screwed up! The maid service was terrible! The coffee machine was broken for the last two mornings we were there. We would go into the lobby and say good morning and the woman they had in there in the mornings just glared at you and didn't even greet you!!! DON'T STAY HERE!!!

Spent two plus weeks traveling the west coast and staying in the best hotels, and was not disappointed in any of them until arriving at the Edgewater Hotel in Seattle. It's a wooden framed and floored hotel with paper thin walls and you can hear everything and everyone around, above, below and in between. Literally was kept awake all night with slamming doors, toilets flushing, phones ringing, people coughing, people walking in the room above, a metal pier outside the room with large metal drums banging against it with the waves, did not have enough hot water to half fill the claw footed tub, and to top it all off, at 6:00a.m. Sat. morning the wait staff began setting up a conference room directly across from our room for a morning breakfast. They banged the chairs, tables and dishes for an hour then the attendees arrived at 7:00 and proceeded to greet one another, talk on cell phones right outside our door. We complained, received a release from our reservation, and moved to another hotel. And imagine...all of this charm for a mere $500.00 per night plus $10.00 for internet connection and a whopping $26.50 for parking per night. What a deal! Wouldn't return to this hotel if given a freeby....and by the way...this is the first negative review or review of any kind I've ever written...that's how bad it was.

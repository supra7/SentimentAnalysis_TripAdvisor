I booked this W hotel on Lexington through a web service and paid $190 per night. When my daughter and I checked in in the morning, we were treated like second class citizens and the key was practically thrown at us while the full paying guests right next to us were treated like royalty. Our room was about half the size of a college dorm room and little more than a broom closet. We had to climb over the bed to get to the other side. You couldn't sit down on the toilet without hitting the overlapping vanity. We dreaded going back to our room every night. On the second night we had been out on the water all day and had booked a lovely dinner reservation. We went to get ready and my daughter started her shower with a trickle of water that stopped after 2 min. Absolutely no water. I called and they said they would send an engineer straight up. 50 min later still no one. I washed with several bottles of water!!!. When I complained I was told oh sorry, the hotel is old, and we did get it fixed after about 4 hours. I asked for compensation on my room rate and they said they could not do anything as the room was prepaid. They were going to comp us a free breakfast!! When I said we would be leaving too early for breakfast they offered to credit a star awards account a few points. I never use a star awards account!! The manager's were extremely unhelpful and made it very clear that they cared very little about us as we were obviously not full-paying guests-- all for the priviledge of paying $190 a night for the room!!! This was the most degrading insulting hotel experience I have ever had. I will never go to another W again. Not to be treated like this. This was clearly a room they would never ever give to a full paying guest and really made our whole two days in New York a miserable experience from the standpoint of comfort. When I book a 4-star hotel room and pay for it it is the least I expect. Not a one-star room for a 4-star price

If you don't want to have any problems related to your stay in Rome, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL. I have made sure of it personally. First, the day before my arrival I wrote a letter to the staff where I specified my flight's number and estimated time of the arrival at the hotel (about 20.30). Unfortunately, my wife and I received our luggage at the airport with considerable delay and came to the hotel at 20.55. We ringed the bell, but nobody answered us. There were no staff at the hotel! It was our first time in Rome, and we were forced to seek another hotel for one night (and to pay 80 euro for this). The next morning we came to La Casa, its owner was on her place, and she said to us that she had waited for us the night before till 21.00 (it was not true, because we came at 20.55!), and then... went home. Moreover, she forced us to pay the full sum (including the night already paid by us at another hotel!), repeating many time: "It's your problem, not mine!"; and saying that we must pay in any case, because we had already confirmed our reservation, and if not, she threatened us to call the police! Second, her welcoming was extremely poor,she behaved as if we were somehow obliged to her. Third, at the main page of the official site of La Casa it is said: "We offer a traditional Italian breakfast which consists of croissants, biscuits, various jams, butter, nutella, coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate and fruit juices". But during our stay (6 days) we were receiving for breakfast ONE croissant, ONE biscuit, ONE jam, ONE nutella, ONE tea or coffee for a person and NO BUTTER, HOT CHOCOLATE OR FRUIT JUICES AT ALL. Tea and coffee were almost cold, and we had the impression that they were diluted with warm tap water. Finally, the staff gave to us no information about the city's museums and events which is contrary to what is said at the site. There were also some other minor negative points related to this hotel. So, if I come to Rome next time, I will NEVER stay there.

I travel to New York fairly frequently for work, and The Time is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in at this price point. The floors and walls were filthy, the bathroom was grungy, the cabinetry was worn, the bed covering was stained, and even the TV had static-y reception. I was scheduled to stay at The Time for four nights. After the first night, I checked out, and told management that the rooms were filthy. They offered me a discount on my next visit, and I explained that there would never be a next visit. As I was checking out, another patron was doing the same, and had the same complaints that I did. The Time simply has not maintained their facility. After I checked out of The Time, I walked across the street to the new hotel The Pearl. Their rates were competitive with The Time and The Pearl was sparkling clean and very nice.

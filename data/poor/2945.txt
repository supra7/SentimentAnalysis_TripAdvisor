There are a couple good things about this hotel and I will mention them first. The staff were extremely friendly, the location is convenient, and the bar in the lobby is pretty cool. Aside from that, it is little better than a Best Western with decor that was trendy in the 80's. The first room I was given was supposedly a "Wow" room, but was so small that I had to turn sideways to get past the bed. I called the desk immediately and asked if they hadn't possibly put me in a lower class of room. They were apologetic, and moved me to a preferred room which was the size of a small-to-average normal room. However, the upholstered chair was dirty and stained, the rug looked dirty and worn, and the bathroom was so small that when I sat on the toilet the sink dug into my ribs! I ordered room service two nights and the burger was overcooked one night and my drink order was wrong BOTH nights. After that, I went out for food. The bathtub had hair in it - and it wasn't mine. It was extremely hot while I was there, but the ice machines on my floor AND the floor above mine AND the floor below mine were not working. A staff member in the hallway nicely offered to bring me a bucket of ice and when he did, there was dirt in the ice! I had a pair of pants laundered and the cost on the Laundry Form indicated that it would cost $15. Upon check out I noticed that they had charged me $112 for laundry. They removed the charge when I brought it to their attention. The whole hotel was badly in need of renovation, especially the rooms, and one of the staff said renovations will take place next year. Her exact words were: "and we REALLY need it!" I couldn't agree more.

Everything is good at the hotel except the location... We were there mid march .. The weather was raining and cloudy for over 10 days.. One needs to know that 10 miles away in lahaina .. Weather was perfect... Kapalua is at an elevation.. Causing it to be very windy and cloudy with rain... Lahaina is protected by mountains and much better weather... Nothing against the hotel.. But someone picked the wrong place to build it

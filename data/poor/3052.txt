This hotel is very racist and it really shows when it comes to service! We were always having to look for our server and she was very rude never smiled for that matter really never said anything. Took my kids to the bufffet and they were in a hurry to get us out of there very rude!! You would think for the money we spent here they could at least try being more polite!! Will not be staying here again!!

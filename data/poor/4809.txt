Beware this hotel The Mark Hopkins Intercontinental looks good and is conveniently located, but that's where its amenities end. First off, they practiced a bait-and-switch on us, promising us one rate, including free breakfast, and then claiming ignorance of the promise when we checked in. As it was late when we arrived, we decided not to go elsewhere. When we later attempted to correct their error, we were rudely dismissed. In addtion, upon check-out, we were informed that we'd purchased a bunch of pay-per-view movies and games when we never even turned the TV on during our stay. They implied that we were lying. If you want to stay in Nob Hill, go across the street to the Fairmont instead. The Mark Hopkins staff is rude, unresponsive, and dishonest. We will never stay there again.

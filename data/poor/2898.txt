This was my second trip to NYC and I knew hotel rooms were small, but Ws was ridiculous!! My husband and I almost did not fit in the room with our luggage. The only place where I could open my luggage was on the bed! And what about the bathroom? To use the sink I had to leave bathroom door openedPhone didnt work. Wi-fi connection (free of charge, but available only in the lobby) was incredibly slow. Will never stay there again.

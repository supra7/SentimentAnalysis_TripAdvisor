What a stay! When we arrived, we noticed there was construction going on and at check in we were informed that this resort had recently been sold to one of the large resorts for $30 million so they were clearing the area. As we drove over to where our room was there were signs posted around the hotel construction sites warning about asbestos dangers. We got into our room and decided to go out and when we returned later than night we switched on the light in the kitchen to have cockroaches scatter all over the counters and floor. We immediately called the front desk only to be told that nothing could be done about the problem until the morning when the manager returned. So we spent the night with the cockroaches. In the morning after showing in a tub that did not drain, we got back on the phone and tried to work things out, the manager and front desk basically told us, too bad. They refused a refund and at first even refused to move us to a different room, but we were eventually moved to another room without cockroaches. Because it was November it can be cold at night, and so we switched on the heater only to get cold air. We thought it would warm up, but it didnt and we had to sleep in the cold. In our new room we again showered in a tub that did not drain. If you want a nice stay in Las Vegas, dont stay here. The pictures are not a true representation, rooms have cockroaches, heaters dont work, tubs do not drain, and the hotel management and staff really do not care about their reputation or the guests because the hotel has been sold and will soon be gone.

If you have a chance or can afford another hotel i would strongly recommend as there are many other Hotels much better around and with the same or even better prices than Legacy.The location is convenient and close to the metro station, however probably this will be the only benefit.During my stay at Legacy everyday i had to wakeup like i slept inside the kitchen as the food smell was too strong and sometimes my room was smelling cigarette smoke coming from the air conditioning probably.The cleaning was not that good , sometimes the towels had an unbelievable hole in the middle , they rarely clean the furniture to remove the dust and even sometimes the cleaners didn't come, if you try to call the reception to ask what happened they alleged that so many rooms did the checkout and they had no time to clean the others.As another review already commented here they change the services at their convenience, instead of daily cleaning they changed to 3 times a week , remove and add tv channels as they wish.The basement parking looks like a storage room with so many old furnitures , fridge , wash machines , etc.It really doesn't looks like a hotel.If you have a choice go for another hotel as it's not worth for you money because they don't care for your wellness.

This was the nightmare from hell!! The walls are so thin could hardly sleep, the water would go really hot and burn you then go cold and freeze you to death, the bathroom was so small that you could not blow dry your hair with the door open, it was cold, no heat control, we asked for wash cloths and hand towels, the room was so small, good thing we liked each other, the staff was good nice people, save your comfort, dont stay here!!

I've booked this hotel through Booking.com and unfortunately I needed to cancel my trip to Dallas and cancelled the hotel before the deadline with no penalties. My surprise is that the hotel charged one night in my credit card twice and until now, one month later, did not refunded the amounts to my credit card. Be careful with this hotel, as they charge you amounts you do not owe and create several difficulties to refund you.

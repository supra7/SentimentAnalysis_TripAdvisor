Begining with Christine Klekovic, the manager of the Extended Stay Hotels, and infecting everyone she touches with her toxic personality and abrasive treatment of customers this place would be a decent option for a road warrior. Not nice for families and definately not a luxury resort to be sure, the rooms and accomodations are decent - if you get a non-smoking room when you ask for one. I have never been treated so rudey by the staff - who apparently are learning their "craft" from Christine... they are acusitory, resistant to accomodating or doing anything the least bit out of their way for a customer, such as honoring the request for a non-smoking room or honoring a price when a customer needs to stay an extra day. Instead I get a phone call asking if I am going to leave... Not "can we accomodate you for another evening?" no. It was; "Well, you gotta come down and pay first" said with an acusitory tone, like I was some kind of un-wanted interloper instead of a valued customer!!! Crimany!

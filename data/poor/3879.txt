We have stayed at alot of hotels and this by far is the absolute worse! First of all, the people running the Maui Lu were the rudest and non caring of any we came across on our visit there. They never smiled not one time or acted like they even cared we chose them out of all the other resorts in Maui. This was my first time to Hawaii and the rudeness will always be remembered. We had an ocean front delux room overlooking the small beach area. The view was great! The room was not. The carpet and chairs were all stained and looked nasty. The bathroom was very small and old looking. Our first night there someone sliced two holes in the canvas of our rented jeep in the parking lot right next to the room. We called the resort to report it and they acted like it was no big deal and told us to call the police to report it. We are just fortuate we didn't have anything in the jeep the vandals could steal. Wow....what hospitality! I have seen all the bad reviews...wish I had seen them before we went...and the place is still awful. I guess Aston doesn't care about the Maui Lu or the people running it. We would never stay there again and will definately not recommend it to anybody.

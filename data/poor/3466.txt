Well walked a mile from blue line, when should have taken red line subway. Rang for directions and they did not know the surrounding area of where I was currently located when I gave them my position via a store\business. Stairs, stairs stairs. Asked 4 times if wanted bags carried.....tip seekers First impression from room..small and HOT! Also smoke detector battery flat and beeping. They just took out battery and did not replace. Sheets looked dirty and underlay was stained. Bed rock hard. Asked for quiet room and with aircon and fan on to cool down...not quiet. Heating cannot be turned off! Lamp on side table has no powerpoint to turn on. WIFI as stated is only in the lobby, have to login everytime not auto :( What really poor is a Hostel is one QUIET block back and $150 a night less! Given a subway map on arrival and card for room. Hope your not a big person because you wont fit in bathroom. Laundry is around the corner...will update after a night.

Dirty rooms, horrible location, not what I was used to in Vegas. We have been to Vegas several times & had some reasonably priced, nice rooms. Stratosphere was comparable to motel 6. We decided to stay here because of the Top of the world restaurant which was AWESOME! Other than that would never stay here again. Stay at the other end of the strip!

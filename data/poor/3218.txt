Major price rip-off for EVERYTHING! Firstly... we stayed in a Panaromic View King Suite & there are not tea & coffee facilities and in fact NO accessible fridge facilities at all included in the room cost. Plus... we were in an adjoining-style room & could hear everything in the room next door. No privacy! In the room... the fridge has weights on everything & if you remove for more than 60 seconds you are automatically charged. There is no additional space in the fridge for anything else... So... there is a sign saying "if you would like a fridge, call Housekeeping" ... which we did... only to be told it would be an additional $25/day... what the??? Next, the Society restaurant... don't bother making a special request for anything... it won't happen. e.g. for breakfast we asked for our toast to be buttered... it wasn't & they served the toast with solid cold butter that was unspreadable. At lunch we asked for a burger cooked medium-to-well... they got it right one day & it was raw another. Oh... and don't even get me started with the disgusting cigarette & revolting cigar smell throughout the entire place. If you want luxury... Encore is NOT it.... I would describe Encore as a cesspit!

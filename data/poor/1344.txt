The hotel is terrible! We booked it for our wedding anniversary trip and it was so bad, that we left the hotel after the first night, although we were booked for four nights. The hotel is extremely dark, no light in the corridors, the rooms was tiny, that it was hard to move around. The bathroom is more of a joke than a real bathroom. Presumably, we were staying in a "superior room with see view".. We could see the sea - somewhere fay away. But much closer we could see the backyard with garbage, the wall of the next building and the window of the dorm next door - and we could even hear the people living in that place. Breakfast was ok, taken general quality of breakfast in the city, but the the breakfast room was a disaster - with holes and stains on the table cloths, a complete mess on the buffet and a waiter who did not even react to any requests. But the worst part of the hotel - reception staff. The lady who called herself "manager" was so rude, I could hardly believe my ears. A person like this should better work in the police station and not a hotel I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - not worth spending your money, especially of you come to Istanbul for a vacation and would like to have some proper service for your money

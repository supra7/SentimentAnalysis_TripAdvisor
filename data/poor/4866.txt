We booked this hotel for four nights at SGD 85/night, and well, you get what you pay for, and in Singapore this doesn't get you much at all. At least not when the hotel bookings are tight and there are no "deals" to be found. Its not in a nice neighborhood, not really close to much (although the metro stop is walking distance), and abuts a very noisy four-lane street. But the room... ugh! It reeked of clinging smoke, all of the furniture was falling apart and cheap and the bed was lumpy. But real the clincher was the cigarette burn holes in the bottom of the (plastic) tub/shower. I could imagine a family of five in the tiny room, with chain-smoking dad sleeping in the tub, abandoned cigarettes slowly burning down to the filters. We ate our first-night deposit and fled to a significantly more expensive place (220 SGD). Sometimes you just have to suck it up and pay the price. To be fair, if we absolutely had to stay on budget, this might have been the best we could find, a truly depressing thought.

Worst Place To Stay Ever!!!!!! My 6 year old daughter was bitten on the arm by the equivalent of a brown recluse spider when we stayed at this hotel. We were supposedly upgraded to a beachfront room because the dolphin lagoon rooms that we booked were not avaiable. Well, the beachfront room had a strong sewage smell coming from a drain pipe just outside the sliding door. And when we lifed the carpet under the beds, there were hardwood slats of wood barely covering the dirt and beachy ground. There obviously had been a leakage problem that the hotel covered up. The first night there, my daughter woke with a definite bite on her arm. The following day, the area blistered to cover her entire forearm. Then the blister broke and oozed for two entire days - she had to be closely monitored for an anaphylactic reaction as she had a cellulitis spreading up her arm (red line).. My husband and I are both physicians and we had never seen anything like it. We reported the incident to the hotel - who agreed to a comp night and then TOOK BACK the offer when we checked out!!!!!!! The management did absolutely nothing for us!!!! The sad thing is that they didn't even inquire into the health of our child during our dealings. What kind of 5 star resort is this??? DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! IT IS DIRTY, FILTHY, AND THE SERVICE IS ABOMINABLE!!!!!!

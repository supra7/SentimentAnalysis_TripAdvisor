The Aston Maui Lu was the dirtiest hotel I have ever visited. When I first arrived they put me in a room with dirty smelly carpet. When I complained they moved me to a room that didn't smell but was just as dirty. I took a towel to wipe down the bathroom floor just so I would feel comfortable taking a shower. The white towel was black from all of the dirt. I took the towel to the front desk and was promised by the desk clerk to have clean room upon my return. Not only was my room not cleaned but the maid didn't even fully make up the bed. I complained several times about the dirt but nothing changed. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

I travel to Vegas every two weeks and stay on Fremont quite often. The room was small and the TV outdated,especially compared to the 4 Queens just across the street. No inroom internet access and no room service made this feel like a 1950's trip. I caught a stomach virus and when requested late checkout I was told no twice. Finally a manager gave me 5pm,as my fever was over 100,but charged my 66$ for a few extra hours. If I had to stay here again, I would not go back to Vegas. It was that bad. The Manager at the front desk was far from professional,and should not be in her position. Stay elsewhere.

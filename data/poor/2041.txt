My wife and I spent the New Year weekend at the Copley Plaza. We arrived late on 12/29 and checked into room 218. Tired from the journey we showered and were ready to sleep, when my wife saw a rodent run from the wardrobe to the TV cabinet. At first I thought she was imagining things, but shortly after our little friend poked its head from behind the cabinet and did a number of mousy tricks. Horrified, my wife called the receptionist, who sent a member of staff to address the situation. The guy was lovely and his approach to mouse catching was rather comical. He was effectively trying to get the mouse out of its hiding place and into the corridor, in the process employing most of the reading material on the desk! Surely enough the mouse ran into the corridor  mission accomplished for the jolly chap from Copley Plaza, who proceeded to advise us to block the gap between the door and the floor with a towel to prevent mice from entering the room. At this point we realized that this had not been a unique incident for our new friend. My wife diligently followed his advice and had me look behind the furniture whenever we returned to the room. I never heard from Copley Plaza on the incident, not a word of apology or reassurance that hygiene was at the top of their minds. Maybe they are too busy maintaining the ornate decorum to address such minor details. It was a good thing that my wife and I had stayed in dives before while living in Asia, as we did not allow the hotel to spoil our enjoyment of beautiful Boston. We will go back to the city but not to the Copley Plaza!

We had taken a weekend trip over to Maui - we don't care for the island in general, but had business to attend to, and had found previous stays at other properties tolerable. For the record, we are Starwood Platinum members, and were treated very shabbily at this property (in contrast to the Royal Hawaiian on Oahu where they thank you for being a loyal customer): we were told that the "resort" properties are unable to guarantee late check-out for the Platinum members. We found the check-in staff to be snobby and all together unpleasant. We found the management team unresponsive and disinterested. The grounds are generic (for Hawaii), but pleasant. However, the nickle-dime routine gets very old. I would rather pay an extra $50 per night, and have everything included. I can safely say that should I need to return to Maui, I will not stay at the Westin.

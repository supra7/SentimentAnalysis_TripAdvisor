This is no 3.5 star hotel.... maybe 2? Upon entrance to the parking lot we were disappointed. It didn't get better. The elevator was glacial in movement and filled with service providers. So we thought we'd try the stairs. The stairs to nowhere. Got up to our room. The crack in the glass window is held together with masking tape. Checked out the gym. Upstairs from the pool... but couldn't access through the main door... had to go around. Not worth the visit. The hotel is bustling with wedding and first communion celebrations. Guess that's the niche. The money saved not worth the convenience to the airport.

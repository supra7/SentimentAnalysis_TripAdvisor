If you look at my other reviews, you will see that I'm very positive and highlight the positives of a hotel or motel. This is my first negative review, and I'm bummed about it, but feel that it's necessary. I arrived at the Fairmont in Chicago this last Wednesday night, very late. After getting to my room, I settled in and went to take a shower. Low and behold, the shower knob, no matter which way it was turned, did not produce any water. Now, I understand water issues and fix it issues, but I was disturbed to think that the cleaning staff had not alerted building management to this issue. Seems like it would be difficult to clean a shower if there was no water. Instead, they just set the bathroom like it was perfectly clean and ready to go. As I looked around the room more, there were stains on all of the furniture. It seriously looks like they got genuine "retro" furniture - maybe from an old frat house, I don't know. It was too gross to sit on. Before I had time to take photos, the staff brought me a key to a different room. While the new room was much bigger, at 5AM, after 3 hours of sleep since the shower debacle, I found out why no one was in that room. The elevators were literally located on the other side of the bed headboard. All I could hear were the elevators going up and down, which sounded more like a motorcross race. Ugh... Thanks for upgrade Fairmont! Unfortunately, due to travel, it looks as though I will be staying her more often... Grrr.... Now I know to ask for a working shower and a non-smoking room as far away from the elevators as possible! I would suggest that you do, too!

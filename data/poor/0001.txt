On a recent business trip to Seattle I encountered one of the worst "hotel" experiences. Not only did I get food poisoning from eating breakfast at the Sazerac restaurant (restaurant at Hotel Monaco) but I had to extend my stay an extra day (cause I was so sick) and the hotel didn't even comp the extra night ($140) or the cost to change my airfare. In addition, I had to take "personal time" from work.WHAT A WASTED 8 HOURS. THANKS!!! I had colleagues stay at the "W" (across the street from the Monaco). The "W" is much MUCH nicer and they didn't get food poisoning.

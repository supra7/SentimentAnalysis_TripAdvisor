Instant charge for room rate $200 per night (discounted for tradeshow rate) plus $150.00 incidental charge per day so extra $600.00 for stay. Room service was called twice to pick up food from dinner, it sat in my room until I put it outside where it sat until I left the next morning. The entire hall smelled like old food. They did not wipe down the counters in the bathrooms when cleaning and did not do a great job there. Hallways smelled like wet dog when you got off the elevator. Food in all restaurants mediocre except for Society which was good. Gambling tables are all more expensive than other hotels. Check out was horrible. Tried to call service and just kept getting disconnected. Guest book says you can use their healthclub if you purchase a spa treatment, not true, you must spend $75.00 worth on spa treatments to get the healthclub kicked in. Hotel managers are rude and pompass, don't care about guests at all. There are so many other great choices in Vegas than the Encore. Don't stay here.

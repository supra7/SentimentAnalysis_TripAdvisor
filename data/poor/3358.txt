The Hotel needs a make over. Renovations are needed ASAP. My Family Travel often and we were all very disappointed with the hotel. The carpets are Dirty and worn out the pull out sofa looked old. We did not sleep on the beds we used air mattresses. The Bathroom is Directly behind the door so you are locked in the bathroom if you have the room door open. There is no private area , No vanity or small area to change. I tired to switch rooms but was told all rooms are the same. I tried to switch hotels but there were no rooms available anywhere. The photos on the web site must have been taken over 20 years ago. The room and pool area appear bigger on line. The Tennis courts and shuffle board were ok. You need to sign up for these ammenities. Thank goodness for the pool bars two staff members they were helpful with our dining plans. We were basically Robbed For $269 Per night for an old, small, dated hotel room. We thought all holiday inns were kept up to a certain standard. We were so wrong to Assume. Definitely never returning to Ocean City. :p We were very happy to return to the Bronx., NY

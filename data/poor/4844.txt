This place is a mess. Check out the picture of the TV remote that I posted on Yelp. It is crusted with dirt and food....If they don't even bother to clean the obvious crust off of the remote, think about what else they don't clean properly. The heat did not work all night. They missed our wake up call almost making us late for our flight. I have been a Marriott Rewards member for years, I am appalled at this place. When I spoke with the front end supervisor about these issues, he seemed really uninterested and tried throwing 5000 points at me to make me go away. I gave him the remote and asked him if he saw a problem with it, his response, "ummm, what's wrong, oh, do you mean that it is a little dirty?" Bottom line, I stayed at this place 4 years ago and it was nice. Since then, it has slipped. It is close to the freeway, but quite a ways from anything else that you would want to do downtown. Don't stay here, find somewhere else.

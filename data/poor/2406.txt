My husband I had couples massage at the Spa. It was the worst experience. The spa itself was just okay. But the service was horrible. The therapists dropped rocks on the floor- which was annoying. The room was cold. They did not even know how to work the whirpool tub. It was not relaxing at all. For all the money we shelled out, it was such a disapointment. It's not worth it.

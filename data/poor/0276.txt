I purchased this room for me and my girlfriend to stay for one night. The price was very reasonable but i saw why. The walls were paper thin, parking costs money to park in their lot and most he time it was filled up, hallway noise mainly from 12am to 5am, check in was ok besides the fact they couldnt find my name in the system and had to search for it, i watched a guy get mugged by four people on the street, the window did not reach the topo of the window pain so there were two inches at the top where the cold air was coming in and the outside noise was crazy loud every car going by i could hear, the bathroom was tiny, beds were so so and the hallway stunk like pee! dont stay here im doing you a favor!

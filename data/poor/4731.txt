When we opened the door to our rooms, the smell hit us. Smelled like mold and mildew. Front desk did ask if they could spray the room. If I hadn't prepaid, I would have left right away (no refunds given if you prepay as the rate is cheaper). Toilet ran forever after flushing, the on/off buttons on the TV's in both rooms were broken, and the hot tub timer was also broken and would only stay on for five minutes no matter what time you set it to. I will never stay here again and will pick a different Hampton Inn on my next trip to Phoenix.

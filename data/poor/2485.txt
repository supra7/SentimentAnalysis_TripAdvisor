Spent two weeks in Hawaii - and the last 4 days were spent here. How disappointing - even the kids ranked it as their least favorite (ages 11 and 13). Crowded, crowded, crowded. Parking is very cramped and sparse. Lobby is filled with people - so is pool, beach and restaurants. Forget about getting a poolsdie lounge chair unless you throw your belongings on one early in the morning. Yes, they are still painting the front of the hotel. One couple I spoke with said they still had blue painters tape arount their sliders. Houskeeping never showed up one day. They finally cleaned our room when we left for dinner. Long line - with one font desk person checking in guests. Hawaiian hospitality is minimal - they are just too big and are in the business of shuttling thousands of people in and out every week - so one guest looks like the next. Very impersonal. Guest rooms are tired. Need sprucing up. VERY SMALL. Scheduled a pesticide sparying during my stay. I called guest services and told them to put it off. The only benefit fom staying here is now my kids also know never to go back. Basically, I felt like I was in Disneyworld.

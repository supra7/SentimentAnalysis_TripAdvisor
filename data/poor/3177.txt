Will not return We were given a room where the fan did not work in the bathroom. When we complained we were given another room where the fan did not work in the bathroom. Not my idea of good service.We were told that parking would be $45/night. What they charged us when we checked out was $65/night and I had to point out to them that they had double charged us on one night. Clearly nobody reviewed the bill. Furthermore, I was woken up early in the morning as my bill was slipped under the door. Something that I found be completely unacceptable.It is not a well run hotel, nor do they go out of their way to make one comfortable. They nickel dime you on every little charge. I don't mind paying for service or goods, but I do mind hidden charges and paying for services that I do not get. For instance the internet connection.The internet connection in the rooms was faulty and had a very slow data rate. I stayed in 2 rooms and they both had this problem. I was on a business trip and it was easier for me to go find a cafe and pay for an internet connection there. That stung as I like to work in my hotel room and I had already paid the clift for an internet connection. Also, on the morning I left, the Internet access was shut off hours before checkout time.Given the internet shutoff, the housekeeping coming by as I was in the shower, and the charge sheet unceremoniously shoved under the door in the early morning, I felt as though I was being shoved out the door. Not what one expects from a civilized hotel.I found the hotel to be cold and impersonal with poorly trained staff. No water or ice was available in the rooms. The rooms were tiny. The bar downstairs is full of 20 something heavy drinkers who tend to cluster outside the front door and smoke. It is not a pleasant atmosphere. There are many really nice hotels in San Francisco and in my opinion this one is second rate at best. I would not recommend it. There are better hotels right down the street that charge less.

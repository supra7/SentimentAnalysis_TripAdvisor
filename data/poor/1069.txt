As a Marriott Platinum member, I love Residence Inn. My business travels require that I stay in Residence Inns more than I do my own home most years. I normally have a very favorable experience. The Philadelphia Airport Residence Inn is the old style. The door to your room leads directly outside. The rooms are dirty and dusty. Needing paint and refurbishing is the least of the problem. The complete bedding, draperies, etc. need to be discarded. You can actually smell dirt and dust in those rooms. The staff is very nice and helpful. Marriott - Refurbish it or close it.

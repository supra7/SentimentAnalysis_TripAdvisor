I stayed at this hotel last week for a business trip. I woke up in the morning COVERED in over 100 bites. When I returned home, I went to my doctor who was able to confirm that they were indeed bed bug bites. Now, not only do I have to tend to my dozens of bites but I also so have to fear that I brought them with me to my apartment. If you MUST stay at this hotel, please ensure that you thoroughly check your room for bugs. I made a huge mistake staying here. You are better off at the Westin or Marriott down a couple of blocks!

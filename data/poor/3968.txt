This is 6th night... it's 2pm and our room is just started getting cleaned... it has dirty dishes, etc., etc., etc. Here is what I wrote on the very first day (please see below), didn't post it hoping for things to get better, but unfortunately they didn't. One more comment: food is really NOT good, not bad but not good at all... To the point of us, being on the all inclusive plan... we still opted to go to the Playa Del Carmen for two nights out of 7 just to get some variety. We leave this place tremendously unsatisfied. More sights to post :). Sadly this is our first night 6 more to go. Arrived here with a two year old, being given a crib thats big enough for a 10 month old max, after having to ask about 6 times, no kidding and being told we are checking no bigger crib provided. Child couldnt sleep all night, had to put her in bed with us. I am writing this on the next day at 2pm, and after having spoken with a concierge, now I am being told that they are waiting someone to check out. This is after again being told that they are checking but pressing with the issue. With or without our daughter in bed we couldnt sleep either, as the smoke alarm right above our bed, was emitting strobes similar to the disco light. Let the concierge Geovanni know about it in the morning, still nothing done. This hotel is proving to be a huge disappointment, will post more as days progress, but so far my only recommendation is to stay away. Just to underscore  we really wanted to like this place, and have stayed up and down the Riviera Maya  Ceiba Del Mar, Paraiso de La Bonita, Banyan Tree, Maroma Resort (no kids but still nice), and Gran Velas. None of these are infrastructure issues  just poor service  at the place where it should be top notch, the reception/concierge desk.

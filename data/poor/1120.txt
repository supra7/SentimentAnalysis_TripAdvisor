Hotel quality is very terrible. Last year turkish great hotel chain company "dedeman" release this hotel to the best western. Before releasing hotel had acceptable management even, over the expectations. After best western took control of management hotel staff did not change but their mentality changed. They are look like a summer intern and do not care about anything. Staff's skill terrible and they are rude. Tea and coffee smells chlorine from the water. I asked them to control their waters and tea smells chlorine. One staff answered me i dont know because i did not do tea. Also extra bed is about the 150 cm. Its like a comedy and the bed sizes looks like children's bed but its NOT !!! :O Never go there !!

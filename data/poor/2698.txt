The positive: if you're looking for a hotel in a convenient location, you can't beat this place -- it's within steps of the 1 and 9 subways, and if you're a downtown type, it's a great launching point. The room was clean, and, for a NYC hotel, the bathroom was enormous. The staff leaves newspapers at your door (USA Today and the New York Post). The rest: Just because a place is a budget hotel doesn't mean it has to be completely uncomfortable. The room smelled like paint (and it also smelled musty). The bed and pillows were terribly uncomfortable. The coffee and danish they serve each morning couldn't have been more unappealing. The hotel contracts its internet service, and for $9.95/day, I had the opportunity to have a non-functional internet connection (I was in a room that had a very poor wireless signal). For a $100 deposit I could have had a "booster" attached to my macbook. Fortunately, there was a Starbucks across the street, and I could easily and reliably check my email and the like there. On TV, while I don't go to NYC to watch television, I was still appalled by the poor reception and lack of cable choices. It's the worst of any hotel I've visited (budget or otherwise) in NYC. Concerning the front desk staff, while I don't care about their being my new best friends, this crew was downright surly. I had originally checked in for six nights; I left after two. I've stayed in some pretty lousy hotels in NYC, but this wins the prize for the worst. I would never stay here again.

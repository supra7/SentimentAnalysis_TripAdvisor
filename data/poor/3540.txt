The Hotel was NOT what I expected. As soon as we got there we had to climb 21 steps to get to the lobby. The desk clerk checked us in and gave us swipe cards for the room, which was 4 flights of stairs up. THERE WAS NOT AN ELEVATOR!!! When we got to the room some guy in the hallway working on something let us in with his key because that room did not use swip cards. The phone didn't work, The air conditioner didn't have knobs on it. The doorhandle was broke, the bathroom was extremely small. Instead of getting two full size beds they gave us a room with 1 full size bed and 1 set of bunkbeds. This was for 4 adults!!! My husband had to climb up & down 4 flights of stairs twice to complain. They finally gave us the room we saw on the website. It was a little nicer, but when we called room service to get wash clothes they didn't have any. The extra towels we asked for (because there were only 2 towels and 4 of us) were in the dryer. Our toilet clogged twice and we didn't have pillow cases for 2 or 3 of our pillows. The carpet in the old part of the hotel hallways was nasty!!! The employees were very kind and helpful, but I was very disappointed in this hotel and would NOT recommend it for anyone!!! I do NOT plan on using this hotel again!!!

We had booked to stay for several nights at the end of our holiday. Arriving to find most of reception being renovated, and far from the luxury room that we had booked, the linen was not clean, the bathroom was a mess, and there were stains on the ceiling - this was a room in need of a makeover. Breakfast was a small offering, served on plastic plates with stale rolls. Not a pleasure. The neighborhood is also suspect after dark - we did not venture out, but there didn't appear to be anything in the way of decent food in the area. We checked out after one night and moved downtown, pleased to have escaped. The only excuse to stay here is if you are visiting relatives studying at UW - apart from that forget it, you will not enjoy the experience

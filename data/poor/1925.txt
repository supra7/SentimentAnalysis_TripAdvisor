Do not stay at this hotel! We booked two rooms through Expedia and did not receive the rooms we requested. When we pushed for the double rooms we requested, we were informed that since we booked through Expedia there was no way they could guarantee our room request would be granted. This response was extremely frustrating, especially since we would not have booked this hotel if not for Expedia. It is infuriating that they reap the benefits of Expedia's booking system, but fail to hold up their end of the bargain. After some serious complaining, they moved us to king-sized rooms, versus the queens they wanted to give us. However, we received numerous disturbances from the hotel service staff regarding the room change. Additionally, the valet service could not get their act together - it took about 30 minutes to get our car.

Would not recommend as the chain of hotels does not have a set policy on cancellations. It varies with the hotel and reservations person. It was impossible to cancel the hotel when not able to travel. When you call hotel they transfer you to another group who handles reservations which is independent from Comfort Inn and Choice (Kapil Care Hotels???) who said absolutely no refund under any circumstance. We called Choice Hotels again for help as we were not able to travel. They (we spoke to two different people) said they called the hotel (or Kapil_ and had no success, then when questioned they said they have a list of hotels which have no refund ever policies (okay, so why not just state that and not pretend to call the hotel to help???). Choice would not let us know how to tell which Choice Hotels did not allow cancellations. They said that is a list only they have so only they know which hotels never give refunds. Nice policy. Note, the airline gave a voucher for future travel with no fee.

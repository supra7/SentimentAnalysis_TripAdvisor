The stay was a GREAT disappointment. On Saturday 31th December I stayed without electricity for 4 hrs and on Sunday (1st January!) again there were no electricity whereby in addition at 9:00 (NINE IN THE MORNING!) some construction works (heavy hammerings) lasted for 2 hours starting at aprox. 10:00 am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There were construction works on a 1st of january at 9:00 in the morning!!!! There were no single excuse message or similar form the hotel management, and when checking out, I had to face an extremely arrogant and unfriendly employee just saying that she doesn't care for the serious inconveniences that occurred. IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Unbelievable. I've never experience such a lack of interest and respect for a guest/client. ME? - never again!

Lovely hotel, but unfortunately they failed to inform me and the wife of the very annoying train that sounds its horn through the early hours. When I complained they tried to make the excuse that it effects all the strip hotels. NOPE don't think it does Mr Manager! Been going to Vegas for many years had no trouble with the others. So please don't make these poor excuses up. You may be sorry to hear about our stay and all the 100s of $$s we spent on sleepiness nights at the hotel, but I see no refund, no warning about placing the hotel on the side of the train crossing on your website. I have read the negative comments on here and the Managers replies. So no need to respond to this review, already read the standard comments your making with the others and the very weak excuses. You know if you actually held your hands up and said yes it was a mistake to build next to here because most out guest complain about the noise, I would have made the review more positive! Regards

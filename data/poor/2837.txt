My family and I stayed at the W Hotel at 541 Lexington Ave on January 01, 2011. It was the worst treatment I have ever gotten from any hotel I have stayed at. I have been to Italy and Isreal where I do not speak the language and have gotten better treatment. The font desk guy was very rude and throughout our stay he make it a point to let us know that we were not welcome as we book this hotel through priceline..mind you I payed two hundred dollar and change per night and it was not worth at all. Next time I will stay at the Four Season or The Mark where I know I will get a better treatment. We went to the font desk with a few questions and as soon as he saw us he would pick the phone up so he would not have to deal with us. I have taken the W hotel off my company list as an hotel to stay at and I have informed my friend and family never to stay at the W Hotel. People, I have never written a review before and my family and I travel at least three times per year, so please believe me when I say stay somewhere else. AB

Don't be fooled by the fake bunkbeds in the picture. My son chose to sleep on the floor instead of this excuse for a bed. You can actually feel the boards just by pressing the bed with ur hand. The doors and the beds squeak. There isn't a vent in the bathroom. We finally lowered the temp on the AC unit to 72 when it kicked in. The thermostat had to be off because we were melting. And as far as advertising that the kids can watch tv from their own bed is crazy. They don't realize the angle is off and it's not a clear picture from the bottom bunk. I'm not a picky person - but this was a lot of money to be such a false representation of what I'm experiencing. Paying for two rooms for two nights. Never again.

Disappointed in the way this hotel does business. We purchased the Makena Beach Resort Gold card for Hawaii residents which includes 2 free nights and a couple 80% off coupons, along with other benefits (for a considerable fee). However, it seems once the resort sold multiple packages to local residents citing the great benefits, the "new ownership" decided not to honor the certificates in the same manner they were sold (no weekends). They claim they have the right to modify "black out dates", but it feels like they took advantage of the local clientele and sold us something we couldn't use (generally people who live and work here cannot stay at a hotel during the week). The selling point was to be able to enjoy a "stay-cation" at home on a weekend. We have many friends and family who visit this island on a yearly basis, and you can be sure word will spread not to use your hotel. Thus, after staying at the hotel on one occasion (took weekday off of work for bday), one can clearly see why the hotel has had "ownership issues" and has to sell "questionable" certificates to get people to stay there ~ definitely not very clean and deteriorating (although the beds were comfortable). We will definitely recommend our friends and family stay at the other nicer, albeit a bit more expensive, hotels in the area.

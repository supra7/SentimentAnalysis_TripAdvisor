This hotel is not worth the price they charge. It's very old with very VERY tiny rooms, not very clean, and a not so friendly staff. They do their job and that's about it. Most of the front desk people are probably aspiring models/actors as they all had a dreamy vacant stare... The location is ok - it's about a 15 min walk to Times Square. There's a club in the hotel so be prepared for very loud and bustling evenings. The mini bar is motion sensitive so any movement will result in an automatic charge to your room even if you did not consume the snack. Overall the W is not worth the hype and not up to par to a 4 star hotel.

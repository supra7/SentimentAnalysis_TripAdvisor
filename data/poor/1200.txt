I woke up with bites on my body, we were puzzled with what they were and how they got there. We figured it out and they look just like the pics of bedbug bites! Even worse when I went through the bags we had on the floor I found them in our daughters diaper bag. I called the hotel and was told the didnt come from there, that they inspect it blah blah blah. We had to throw out the bags and diapers, I pray none made their way in our home. I am very angry and disappointed in the denial of them coming from the hotel. Funny I was placed on hold every time she needed to comment on what I said. Dont risk stayimg here. We come to Chicago often but will NEVER stay here again.

Contrary to popular belief, the Marrakech is definitely not a good deal. For nearly the same price (maybe about $20 more/night), I could've have stayed right in the middle of the Theatre District and had a much cleaner, bigger and all around better room. Housekeeping did a horrible job - never once vacuumed during our 10 day stay. They didn't give us soap and shampoo when we ran out. No face cloths, ice bucket, ice machine, vending machine, clock, radio, working phone, coffee pot. None of that. The continental breakfast is pay as you go. They neglected to tell us prior to our check in that there were no elevators. So we had to lug our 50 lb suitcases up 6 flights of stairs (3 floors, 8 flights including the stairs to get to the lobby). There are no closets/dressers in the room. Just a metal rack with 3 hangers and 3 shelves - one of which they use to keep your towels since there's no hooks to hang anything in the bathroom. The tub is half the size of a normal tub so unless your 6 years old, don't plan on taking a bath. You're luck if the toilet flushes properly twice a day, which probably has something to do with the water in the shower being scorchingly hot or ice cold at any given moment. It's definitely walking distance to Central Park if you don't mind walking through the projects - not a good idea after dark. You should take a cab or the subway to get to Times Square so that you're feet don't give out on you by the time you get there (about 60 blocks or so). It's obvious that the Marrakech is a past-hostile trying to become a hotel. However, they should make sure that everything is in order before they allow visitors to dish out the kind of money we did. ($269/$389/night) The pictures on their website are definitely deceiving - if you pay attention, they use the same ones of lobby and one obviously redecorated room in several layouts. Staff was also unsure of things like how to activate our room phone and my credit card authorization slip - not helpful at all.

This was our 3rd stay at the Encore over the last few years and sadly our last. What was once a clean, sleek room overlooking the strip is now tired and with major signs of neglect. Our bathroom had some kind of fecal material on the wall. When we brought this to the attention of the conceirge they assured us someone would be up to clean the room properly. Sadly in our 3 day stay this problem ( everytime you used the bathroom it was there stairing you in the face) was never addressed. So I guess Steve Wynn really doesn't give a poop. Ps the food by the pool is really terrible.

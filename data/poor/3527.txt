This was the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my life. It was early December and there was no heat in the room, the shower didn't work (it was either all cold or all hot), the window didn't close all the way making it less than 50 degrees in our room in the morning. And it was filthy. There is absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel. Ever.

Executive Hotel Pacific: Great location and very helpful staff, and the shower was good. That's the good news. However, the room was tiny, nowhere to put 2 suitcases other than on the small bit of floor space, where they were predictably kicked on the way to the bathroom, and involved a lot of unpleasant bending. The walls paper thin, so we heard everything that the noisy family next door got up to. Very very disappointing.

Having seen all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for the previous couple of months, we booked The Chancellor for four nights at the beginning of September. Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to our expectations, and was certainly not the same hotel that other reviewers had been praising. We were incredulous that when we arrived, the doorman stood and watched whilst we carried our luggage in without even opening the door for us. This attitude, combined with unfriendly staff on the front desk and a very tired and shabby looking bedroom, led to a disappointing stay at The Chancellor. We would not recommend staying at this hotel.

I am at a loss to understand the good reviews posted for this Hotel . The carpets in our room were filthy , the lighting abysmal. The breakfast range was poor ,whilst to be required to eat off paper plates. drink from cardboard cups whilst using plastic knives & forks in the dining room was the final straw We checked out after one night of what should have been a four night stay, and moved to another Hotel in the same area paying far less for ten times the quality.

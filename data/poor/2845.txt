When i came to check in there was a guest claiming for having been charged item at the mini bar he didnt got. I made a reservation for a king bed, i got a queen in a small room (all seem to be small). Noisy lobby. On the second day, the made up the room at 5, 30 pm and after four reclamations (they say: i am going to transfer your call to the manager, and then a voice mail box...)They said A cleaning maid is coming in ten minutes, after an hour waiting for her, i called back...apologies and please, wait for another ten minutes. Another hour later,...they arrive. In the meantime, several calls and several messages machines. Finally, they charged three items from the mini bar i hadnt touched. It seems they do that to everyone.... So,Never more.

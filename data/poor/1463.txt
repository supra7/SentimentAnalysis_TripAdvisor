Charged $30 per day for Internet. This is really outrageous for business travelers. After paying this fee, they wanted another $15 to simply print out a boarding pass. Nice gym but no towels. This hotel is in a good location at the airport, and you would expect to pay a monopoly premium, but this hotel is taking advantage of its customers. If you are a business traveler, look for someplace else, or be prepared to pay through the nose.

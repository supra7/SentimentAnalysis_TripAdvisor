The staff was very friendly and the lobby was nice. It was also great to have a coffee shop right downstairs. The room looked ok, but you can tell the building is VERY old and in need of some renovations. Me and my husband burned our hands a few times while washing in the bathroom. The hot water is scalding hot the second you turn it on, so be careful! The temperature of the shower also seemed to alternate without touching it. So I kept getting shots of cold water which wasnt so pleasant. The worst part was the bed. I always check the sheets before I get in a hotel bed. And the sheets were clean but there were a lot of bumps in it. So I pulled the fitted sheet back to see what was going on and I was mortified. There was a type of "mattress pad" that appeared it had not been washed in quite some time. It was complete with pubic hair. If it had not been for that I would have probably rated the hotel a 3.

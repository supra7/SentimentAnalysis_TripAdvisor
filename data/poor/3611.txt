At first glance this hotel seems to be a nice cozy french themed hotel but the walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything through the walls. The floors are creaky and you can hear people walking all night long. You can also hear the elevator go up and down and people walking up and down the stairs. You can even hear conversations through the walls. Do not stay here if you expect to get a decent night's sleep. I had a very busy day and was exhausted. Did not want to stay a second night but couldn't find availability at another hotel.

I wish I would have read these reviews before wasting my money. DIRTY ! When we pulled the couch out to prepare the bed for our kids to sleep in it, apparently it had not been changed. It was dirty , but we became disgusted when we noticed dirt chunks that appeared to be feces (YES POOP). We called the front desk and WE had to go down to get the new bedding. It was only about 10 and there was no one available to do that. The breakfast was one of the worst ever.First they opened late- only after we asked why it wasnt open and we waited about 30 minutes. I requested to order off menu rather than eat buffet and they really acted like they had no idea how to do that. In fact, they tried to talk me into the buffet. The buffet looked as if it had been in the trays a while. At check out the lady was unable to make any adjustments and gave me the managers phone number. I have made a dozen attempts to contact this man. One would think he would WANT to know if his facility was not operating effectively. HE obviously could care less, because he will not repond via email or anything. My last attempt to contact him I left another voicemail and stated I guess I would have to dispute charges with my ccard company. I will not recommend this to anyone.

If you want to stay in Kaanapali, this is not your hotel. Having made this reservation 6 months before check-in, my family arrived after a long trip from the mainland and were looking forward to Kaanapali beach before sundown. We were told that the hotel was over-booked and were sent off to another area 20 minutes away -- a tearful moment because the children's friends were staying within walking distance in Kaanapali and because the alternate hotel was of much lower quality with a small beach. They lured us in with the promise of beautiful Kaanapali beach and send us to one of their less desirable properties. The staff's responses indicated that this had happened before and that this was going to happen again.

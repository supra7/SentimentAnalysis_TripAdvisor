Let me say to start off the location is excellent right in the heart of all the action. Right next door to a great blues bar The hotel itself was terrible We had booked a queen room advised on our arrival that wasnt available so we got two doubles hotel is quite old and rundown Stayed 3 nights left with multiple bed bug bites a sore back from the crappy mattress but some good memories of chicago great restraunts nearby I would look for a better hotel and pay a bit more next trip

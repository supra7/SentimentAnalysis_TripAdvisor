Our room had a sewer gas leak. They had to know about it because that bathroom had a freshner in it. The toilet seal was broken. We checked in, then went right out. Came back to sleep around 9pm and had to leave the room at 3am. I had a migraine the smell was so bad. When customer service got there that morning they did move our room but wouldnt comp the horrible night before. Traveolociy "guarantee" was NO HELP. The holtel and travelocity never did comp the night. The hotel thought they did enough moving our room. There is also very limited and very tight parking. You do walk right out of a lower room to the ocean but so do the bugs.

We booked a one night stay at the Stratosphere through Jet Blue vacations for $70. We flew into LAS around 11 pm from Boston, so we were pretty tired and wanted to get settled in as soon as possible. The front desk staff is completely incompetent; we waited in line for about 30 minutes to check in and then the girl who checked us in was more concerned with properly loading paper into a printer than helping us. We had booked a two queen bed nonsmoking room and she told us we had a king bed nonsmoking which wouldn't work for us because we had our 2 children also. She told us all the other rooms were smoking and I told her that was unacceptable. She then checked us into a "handicapped accessible" room on the 9th floor; when we got to the room, it reeked of smoke. The hallways reeked of smoke also. I called the front desk three times to get a room change; was told we were in a nonsmoking room already, which was a lie. After another 40 minutes, we were given a nonsmoking room on a nonsmoking floor. We were also charged a $5 resort fee which we wouldn't use anyway because we were there for one night. Since it took so long to get a new room, they took off the resort fee (Ooooooo!!!). My husband was also ripped off $5 at the vending machine to get one bottle of water. My advice--we just wanted a decent bed to sleep in for one night; the staff is rude and could care less about about their customers; we felt completely ripped off. Don't go to the Stratosphere.

I have never posted a comment before, but after reading that other people felt the same way I wanted to say something. I have never been treated so badly by front desk staff in my life! They sneered at me, were condesending and snippy. Based on that alone, I don't think I would ever stay at this hotel again. The rooms were also very lackluster. Dark and overall unimpressive. The gym was fairly good, however. Definitely not worth the money.

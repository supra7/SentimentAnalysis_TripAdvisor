Just got home from our trip to Vegas. I know one thing, I will never stay at the Gold Spike again. It is true, the casino is very dark, dirty and smokey. The room wasn't clean and we saw cockroaches. The bed was very uncomfortable. We could feel all of the springs. The area surrounding the Gold Spike didn't seem safe at all. We saw a drug deal go down. The only reason we stayed at the Gold Spike was so we could see some shows on the strip and have dinner at a nice restaurant. Next visit we will stay at a much nicer hotel.

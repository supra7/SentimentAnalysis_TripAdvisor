So it was bad enough that they put us in a handicapped room that included a shower that was European style over a toliet and didn't have a bath tub, or anything and there was water all over the bathroom within seconds...OK fine...I didn't really care, i just wanted to shower and get to dinner...The location IS fantastic- but lots of hotels in Boston are because Boston isn't that big! WELL it says on the valet ticket for the car to allow 30 minutes - so the next morning I call for my car 30 minutes before I need it. they say its going to be 45. OK fine.. So I go down there and 45 minutes passes- NO CAR. I ask the valet service guy, he says that my car is very next and it will be out in five minutes. Five- 10 fifteen minutes later still no car. i ask the manager who tells me " i have like 50 cars I'm trying to get right now it's not my job to know when yours is coming" (it's now been almost an hour and 15 minutes that I've been waiting in the cold with an appointment to get to) i told him 1. it actually is his job because he is the manager of valet, he rolls his eyes on me and walks away (such great service) i told him i refused to pay for it...he took my name and room number and agreed to take it off the bill the next AM at check out GUESS WHAT WAS STILL ON MY BILL!!! they eventually removed it after I had to seriously argue for a significant time. they are really rude and unprofessional...there are better hotels for sure

New Orleans can be a poor travel value at convention time but this hotel sets a new low. You can end up in a room with no windows, dirty carpet, worn furnishings and refusal for check out beyond 1:00 all for the low, low price of $250 a night right here at the New Orleans Embassy Suites-Convention Center. I've never written a review before but have always appreciated those from my fellow travelers, so this is my chance to give back. Avoid this hotel!

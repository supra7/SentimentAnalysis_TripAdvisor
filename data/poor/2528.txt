Hated it nov 2004 I just got back from a weekend in Miami and stood in this hotel i was furious with the staff and the hotel . They were not very friendly i had a problem with the room it smelled like urine and there was spiders on the wall when i went to complain he basically said he can not promise there won't be spiders in any other room and that he will have housekeeping check on the smell but that there was nothing he can do after raising my voice he finally changed my room and that room was more dirty then the first one again i go back to the front desk he once again has an attitude with me and finally changes my room to a suite for $30 more a night ok a suite how bad can it be Well let me put it this way there was nothing Suite about it ... I was in shock but it was a little cleaner and basically we had no choice so we stood but Honestly do not stay here it is a dirty hotel ...I should have listen to past reviews and went some where else. The hotel National was right by there and we took a look inside and it was very clean and nice, stay there instead because you pay cheap here but remember you pay for what you get for....

The only way forward for this hotel is for a bull dozer to drive staight through it's grubby stable like lobby. It was quite simply the most flithy hotel I have ever stayed in. The curtains were supposed to be white but were black with cigarette smoke as was the carpet that looked like it was possible once pink! The hotel's restaurant was a curry/kebab house that stank out the whole hotel. The view from the bedroom window was totally unacceptable and so we kept the dirty curtains closed the whole holiday. The heating in the room is so old it's either absolutely baking hot or freezing cold. I honestly would've rather stayed on the street! We managed to check out early and stumble across possible one of the most decadent hotels of all time.... The famous Waldorf Astoria. Do yourselves a favour and book the Waldorf, triple the price but worth every penny.

We read the reviews prior to our stay, and were expecting a dated room...We were not expecting to have personal items taken from our room by housekeeping while we were in the club room enjoying cocktails at sunset. This property is closing down in July for renovations and all of the employees attitudes reflect their future loss/lapse of employment. The rooms are in need of updating, but as another review stated....the room was dirty, smelly, and one side of the king size bed was so badly broken down, my husband rolled out of bed several times in the night. A few employees were nice....but most seemed bitter because of their upcoming loss of employment. The pool is very plain..and the breakfast buffett is very limited compared to other resorts. .....and they automatically include gratuity for everything...not just room service or parties of 6-8 more....we were only a party of 2. I believe the employees automatically include gratuity because they know their attitudes are not worthy of tips .... Overall, it feels like a sinking ship....and the principal of missing property from our room caused us to check out early and move to another resort on the island. We were told by several employees who were aware that our personal property was missing from our room ...that a manager was going to be in contact with us.....But a manager never contacted us or even made an effort to express how unacceptable this was. We will be contacting corporate Ritz to report that something was taken from our room during the nightly turn down service......the property could care less. Go elsewhere.....might be nice after renovations..but we are very hesitant to go back. Kapalua is nice though, especially if you are a golfer....we played the Plantation course and were blown away....but skip the ritz.....stay at one of the Kapalua villas...or somewhere else on the island ...

I came to las Vegas for a wedding on January 27th 2011 and only used my debit card at this hotel for checking in after booking the rooms on the Internet. I flee back to Houston that Sunday evening and whenI woke up the next money. $500 has already left my account. Someone has being shopping around in Las Vegas. I called the hotel and they were very defensive to my surprise and did nothing to help. I even complained to their corporate office but nothing was done about it. The good thing was that my bank Chase refunded the funds. Just be careful using your card for transactions in Las Vegas but especially at this hotel.

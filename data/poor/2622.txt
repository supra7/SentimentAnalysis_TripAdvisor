This JW Marriott is an ideal New Orleans location, with a nice lobby and staff, but the rooms are really disappointing for a JW Marriott. You will hear the very loud elevators and the conversations/TV of your neighbors through the paper-thin walls. Small rooms with worn furnishings. I love the Marriott chain, but won't stay here again. And parking is $35 a night....

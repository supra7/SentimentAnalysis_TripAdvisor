Nov 10, 2008 New We prepaid one month ahead. With the promise of no line check it. We stood in line for 40 minutes. After we checked in we notice that the floor was soaked from the bathroom to the door. Also, there were no face cloths. I tried to call but no one answered at the desk. i went down and stood in the very long, slow line. When I finally reached the desk I asked about face cloths. The girl didn't know if we get face cloths! I should have know then to leave. An hour later we had face cloths. Now I needed the rug dried. This water from cleaning the floors is now on the rug being tracked all over the room. They made a lame attempt of a heater blower for 15 minutes. You'd think with all this hassell they'd give us a nice, clean, dry and stocked room..but no that didn't happen. The next day we put in a request for a wake up call. Needless to say, they did not call. Not once were we able to contact the front desk.When I got my credit card bill the hotel decided to take the charges out that I had prepaid two months prior. This caused all kind of confusion. The hotel offered us a refund for one night for all the trouble we had. But then they said they would sent us a free nights stay at any Hampton. Now they say that they will not be sending us anything because they credited my credit card in a timely manner. Huh? I called them several more times and sent emails and that is the answer I get. This place and management is a total joke. I have never been jerked around by a bunch on numb nuts. Save yourselves the trouble and stay at at better place.

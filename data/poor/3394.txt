Ick! I blame myself for this miserable stay at the downtown Marriott. I ALWAYS check TripAdvisor before booking a hotel. However, I was in a rush booking this stay that I booked the place without first checking the reviews. The one time I make this mistake and ... oh the punishment! This hotel property is gross - dated, faded, smells and is just plain ugly to look at. The carpet in the room was faded and dingy - I felt dirty walking in the room. Binds were dirty, walls have markings, furniture was scratched and from the 70s, and the hallways and rooms smell gross! What really irks me is the price they charge per night! Stay at the Omni a couple of blocks away - I stayed there last year (the place is gorgeous and CLEAN!) and they charge the same price. I love staying at Marriotts ... just not this one! Needs MAJOR renovation!

After 6 years of staying here annually with our 4 young children, we are done!!! Summary....GREAT Location and wonderful walking ammenities. If the weather is great, you can leave the car parked your entire stay. Right next to Whalers Village,ABC store and shops there is cheap shopping and nightly entertainment for free....BUT disgusting rooms, small, run down, and this year...vomit in the hallway that took several complaints for management to clean, paid for 2 adjoing rooms (on SPG points) and could barely fit the stroller in the entrance. THE POOL is so freakin cold the kids could barely stand it...... Going Back again in December and we will be staying somewhere else!

I originally reserved a room at Warwick Residence in the same area but was transferred to this hotel when I arrived London (the hotel I reserved said that they had some problems with the room). I had no idea about this hotel and accepted to check in there. The room and the furniture (bed, chairs) were old. The balcony looking to the garden was also dirty with the curtain nearly fell from the rail.The cleaner didn't clean the room or changed the towel everyday. The last day there was a drunk English teenager came to the dining room and bullied Asian customers while no staffs cared to stop him. I think it was run by the Chinese. The hotel should be inspected by the officials to improve the standard of living there. It's pity that tourists won't know only by looking from internet. It should be kicked out of business if they refuse to improve the condition. Don't go there.

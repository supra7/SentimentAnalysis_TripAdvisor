The hotel asks you to pay the full amount of your reservation at check-in and charges you for using basic things such as the safe box in the room. Not a good policy in my opinion. The hotel has a central location in Sydney, and this is the only positive aspect. My room was supposed to be a non-smoking one, but everything smelled strongly of smoke, and the windows could not be opened to let some fresh air in. The guy at the reception at nighttime had no clue about the internet rates, even though I asked some very simple questions to him: he seemed to have learned some technical words by heart, without really understanding what they meant. The morning receptionist (a girl) was much more friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I found a really big cockroach in the bathroom, and this encouraged me to check out of this place ASAP.

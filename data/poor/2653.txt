After a 12 hour road trip, my friends and i were ready to shower and hit the french quarter. the guest attendant who checked us in was rude to one in my party who simply asked for the restroom. after we were given the keys to our room...we all remarked at how everything looked just as it did on the website, the swimming pool, fountains & courtyard...until we reached our room. it was nothing like the picture, small, cramped, and we found cigarette butts in the fireplace, the bathroom floor & tub had hair in it and none of us wanted to guess what the black ring was in our toilet...so it wasn't clean either. after complaining to the gm Mr. Valentino, who told us they were booked for the weekend. we decided to get something to eat and weigh out our options. as we were leaving the hotel we passed by our room. or at least the one that made us book with this hotel. the door was open and had not been attended to by housekeeping. what really got us angry was that it was well after 5 by this point, which means that no one was checking into this room..and your hotel is completely booked???? we immediately requested to speak with Mr. Valentino, who stalled us for another 10 minutes. we explained our dissatisfaction and treatment since arrival and requested that our room be changed. it's right in the heart of the quarter, close walking distance to the french market, bourbon, and some of the best restaurants. but if you book here be prepared to put up a fuss if you want a room that looks anything like the one they advertised.

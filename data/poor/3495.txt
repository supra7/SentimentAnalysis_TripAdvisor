This place was horrible! They are invested with rats on the roof, in their alley way and I saw one inside the hotel too. The neighborhood is nice but this hotel doesn't care at all about the serious rat problem they have. I made a complaint and they ignored my request to talk to manager when I asked why do they leave there garbage kaying ont he ground without being in containers they just shrugged their shoulders. In this day and age and city this is disguisting and lazy. They have no respect for their guest or neighborhood. RATS EVERYWHERE GROSS!!!!

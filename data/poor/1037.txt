i am a really easy to please college student but this hotel was equivalent to a hostel. the house keeping called every morning at 6 am so they wouldn't have to do their job, keys for the room didn't work half the time, the the tv didn't work, the wireless connection was extremely slow, the idiot at the front desk wouldn't let me use the employe bathroom right behind her when the elevator was broken after my key didn't work. the only plus about this hotel was the parking discount across the street for $10 a day but i would strongly recommend anywhere else

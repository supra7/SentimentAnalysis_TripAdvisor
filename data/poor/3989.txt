We have booked a room via hotwire. Hotwire did not allow us to select whether we wanted 2 beds or 1. After we booked it, we called the hotel to change our reservation to 2 beds. They refused, saying that we did not book a room through them and that Hotwire needs to modify the reservation. We called hotwire and they were stunned at the response. They called the hotel and requested 2 beds. We arrived and the hotel said that they do not have a room with 2 beds available. We asked for a roll-out bed and they promised to deliver it to the room. We spent a day in the city, came back late only to find out that noone has delivered the bed. We asked for the bed again, the hotel staff promised to deliver it, we went out for dinner and came back to a room with no roll-out bed. We did not feel like arguing and I spent my night sleeping on the floor

Pretentious, pretentious, pretentious... Stayed here for a night with some friends for a wedding. The hotel staff was rude and acted like a bunch of premadonas. Everyone assoctated with this place thought their you know what didn't stink. I would highly reccommend a hotel called The Phoenix over this place. At least there you can get good service and a more confortable experience. Please take my advice... Stay away from THe Clift Hotel. Unless you are into travel nightmares.

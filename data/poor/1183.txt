Do not book at "The Hilton Hotel Miami Downtown" we had so much trouble with them its unreal. The service sucks we had nothing but problems Miami is a scary crappy place to be in, People are very rude, the taxi cabs tries to get more money out of you telling you that the meter says 17$ when it only says 10$ so you have to watch.

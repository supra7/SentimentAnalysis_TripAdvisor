On new year's eve we arrived in Turkey to stay at a pre booking at the Ocean's 7 . We were first taken around the corner to find that our room had been given to another who had turned up the day before, even after we had confirmed 3 times as they had said their database was not up to date. We were then moved back around the corner to the hotel behind the resteraunt where we were given 2 double rooms rather than the family room we had initially booked. Sounds good, but from my bed I could read the menu of the customers in the resteraunt and being new years eve it was not a pleasant place to be for the night, The light from the foyer shone through the glass door all night but the noise was keeping us awake any way so that was really insignificant. The kids had a room in the basement you wouldn't give to your pet. Permanantly running water in the bathroom, no electricity and a very strong smell of sewerage. We were unable to find other accom given the time of year. After 2 horrible sleepless nights our family room became available. This one I am pleased to say was quite comfortable, still looking onto the street but absolute luxury in comparison to the previous 2 night mess. We were offered a substantial reduction in our room rate given the conditions which turned out to be a whopping 5%. Fortunatly Turkey was such a wonderful place to visit we still had a marvelous time, however it would have been much better if it had not bee through blood shot eyes.

YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH SMALL ROOMS. When I say this is a TINY room, take it SERIOUSLY. I had to sit on the bed for my boyfriend to walk into the bathroom. And I concur with a previous reviewer, they treat Hotwire customers like garbage. The entire staff is trained to parrot the line, "We are a boutique hotel" - well I have traveled all over the world and stayed in hundreds of boutique hotels here and abroad and I'm telling you that the rooms are UNBEARABLY small - not to mention WITHOUT ANY DISCERNIBLE AMENITIES. A tiny ledge is mounted to the wall called a "desk" with a small chair. The "closet" was a 2 foot cut out in the wall with a curtain hanging in front of it. The bathroom consisted of a a tiny sink (NO COUNTER SPACE), a toilet, and a small standup shower. Believe me folks, an RV has more room than this. Also, they knew we were Hotwire customers and treated us as such. Our room looked out into an alley. They wouldn't even let us pay more money and upgrade. There must be some mistake because this IS NO 4 STAR HOTEL. It's barely a 2.

Stayed here based on the recommendation of the "Cheapo Vegas" people. What a mistake! The room was filthy: The toilet was not clean, the shower clogged and was dirty from previous guests. The bed sheets had not been washed and were dirty. The rude front desk staff said no other rooms were available. Never again! The cheap room rates are not worth it; next time I will spend more money and stay at cleaner hotel.

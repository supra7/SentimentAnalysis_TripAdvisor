I have done a lot of traveling over the years and this room was average at best. After we checked into my first room ( the Garage for Parking) this was exspensive. there is no "on site" parking for the Hotel. Just vallet or the parking garage next to the hotel. If you Vallet, tey park your car in the garage next door. They have contract with a local parking garage. over night stay is $27. and it's your only choice. The check-in process was easy. staff was friendly at first. once I asked about validatign tehe parking, the desk pretty much told me I was on my own and they don't validate. Ok enough about the parking.. The room rate was $159. like I said I have stayed in many hotels and I would have thought that for this price and being the "Hilton" the rooms would have been alot nicer wad a little bigger than a Motel 6 room. Cleanliness: The room was dated and the carpets could definately be replaced. the bathroom counters were granite!. Granite being porus does hold moisture and MOLD was growing.Definaely need to reseal the counter tops. Bed were 2 Queens. At least that what we were told. Smallest queen beds I have ever slept in. The room temp was stayed some where between vagas in August and death valley in June! could not get teh temp to come down. Hilto bay Front with a view!!!! yeah right a view of the Dole ship yard and the underside of the Coronado bridge! Everything in this place was OVER PRICED. $4.50 bottle of water $4 Coke. come on, I realize it's a hotel but really? This was for the Marine Corp Birthday Ball. after we taste tested and confirmed the food choice, they still messed this up. $58 for a meal which amounted to about 4oz a steak and 4oz chicken breast, Litterally 1 baby Carrot and 1 asparagus spear and 2 small pices of squash. Hilton Hotels received over $55K from us last night and I a pretty sure it will be the last they will ever receive from my unit.

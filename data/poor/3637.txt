Never stay at this hotel I am not the type of person to normally complain, but this was the most unpleasant hotel experience my family has ever had. Besides the fact that the website/literature is completely misleading (i.e., we had a broken tv with no remote, lamps with burnt out lightbulbs, no iron, no hairdryer, no coffee maker, etc.) the biggest liability is the man who runs the hotel. There is no TEAM of staff as the literature says, but just one unhappy, rude, bitter individual who should be in any profession besides customer service. I have seriously never encountered anyone as rude in years. The way he yelled at my family when we questioned some charges on the bill, telling us to get out of his hotel was truly unbelievable. Do yourself a favour, stay somewhere else.

Booked a room at hotel ME Barcelona expecting to have a relaxing holiday only to find service below the standards of a 1 star hotel. On the first night we were not allowed to sit and dine at the hotel's restaurant even though there were plenty of free tables because according to the Manager the waiters were busy. We were told to come back in 15 minutes only to hear the same answer and ended up having to leave and dine elsewhere. Second night the air conditioning doesn't work, after calling several times, someone came and said that it was fixed but the room is still 26 degrees and the air conditioning still doesn't work. Only solution offered was to move to another room for a couple of hours to sleep and that will be called once the problem is fixed...but it is 1:20 am!!! Avoid if possible!!

Checked in first room was filthy with used condoms in trash. Next room was ok. We had 2 queen beds. Woke up first morning with swollen eyes. definately allergy. Call to housekeeping to have bedding changed. next night son comes in sleeps in same bed. next morning swollen eyes and throat. This really sucks when your here to work the rodeo for 12 days. Next night husband cones in. Next morning guess what??? yep another case. go to dr to find out we have a staff infection. Will never stay here again

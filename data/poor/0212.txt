The hotel lobby is nice, but the rooms are small and dirty. I'm an Elite Member and booked a room using my rewards. We were put on the 14th floor with a view of a construction project across the street. The bathroom really needed tile work and a good cleanser. Bathroom products were not high end unless you think Suave is pricey. Some staff were completely clueless. My husband and I checked in around 4:00 and departed for dinner around 5:30. We returned around 7:30 and found a strange note and antique looking computer speakers on our bar (no there are no liqueurs or fridge). I read the note (not realizing the speakers were what they were) and thought someone from the staff brought us a sound machine to help us sleep (since the Courtyard where I stay often for business travel provides a sleep mask, sound machine, chocolates, and teddy bear all at no cost!), but I soon realized it was a note meant for someone else. I called the front desk to let them know the mistake and I had to explain a dozen different ways for the girl to understand what I was saying, although I highly doubt she had a clue after all since she sent two security guards to our room and they took the note and speakers from my husband as if they were going to detonate! Overall the place was a dump with unprofessional (and unintelligent) staff. If I would have paid for the room or I would have needed to stay longer than one night, I would have complained and found other accomodations.

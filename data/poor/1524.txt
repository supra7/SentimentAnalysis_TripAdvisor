I was looking forward to this vacation and all I can say is that I will never go back. First of all, the kitchen is a disaster is not fully equipped, the refrigerator was not working as well as the toaster and the pool was a disgrace it was so dirty that it was dirt floating around the pool. I will not recommend this resort to anyone, the only good thing about this place is that is close to the attractions but is not worth it in the long run. The New Yorker.

No way....not ever again! Upon booking this room at the request of our travel agent, we set off for our Hawaiian vacation. Upon arrival at the Ambassador we were immediately put off by the outdoor look of the hotel, but we figured it probably couldn't that bad inside, or could it? The lobby was completely blah and it looked nothing like the hotel's brochure had displayed it. Throughout our stay we were constantly bothered by the loud traffic and the people in the next room...obviosly the walls are quite thin if you can hear someone doing their personal business. Our room was skipped for cleaning more than once, so we had to make due with the only 2 bath towels in our room. Yes, we could have gone down to the lobby and asked for some more, but why would we want to risk another fire alarm going off while we're riding down the elevator? The pool looked nice...I guess we really didn't care to take a closer look. And so the story continues as non-working vending machines plagued us as we went from floor to floor. I can't believe Pleasant Holidays would contract with a hotel like this! We were so embarrassed to be staying at this hotel that we climbed off the Hilo Hattie shuttle at a completely different drop off location so that no one would know we were staying at such a hole!

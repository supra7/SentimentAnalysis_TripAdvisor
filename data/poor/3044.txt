This is my third consecutive year staying at this hotel for an area Girls Basketball Tournament. Thank god I won't have to attend next year, or anytime ever again. As part of the $52 million dollar renovation, units were built right up against the freeway. Why on earth they did this is beyond me. All other buildings look out over pools, the golf course, mountains, etc., but this building looks out at the freeway, and is so close that I can visually identify the type of cars driving by. AND, while sitting in the living room of my unit, with the blinds/door closed, I can tell the difference between a truck, motorcylce, car, etc. driving by, just by the sound which is ever so clear ALL NIGHT LONG. I cannot believe they have the audacity to place paying guests in these units. Of course, when I requested a room change, that was impossible because the "hotel is completely sold out due to the tournament." Which takes me back to my original point.......Why even build these units this close to the freeway in the first place? If you have to stay at the Arizona Grand Resort, don't let them place you all the way out in a "M" unit.......you will never, ever sleep.

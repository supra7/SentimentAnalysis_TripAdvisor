The first problem you will encounter is there is no elevator. This facility is three floors. Just imagine how angry you'll be when you have a stroller and 6 pieces of luggage you need to drag us 2-3 flights. I reserved a non-smoking room and received a disgusting smelling smoky room because I wanted the first floor. The pool is less than desirable and the gym had five ancient pieces of equipment that were all broke. The lobby had no newspapers or any reading material. Housekeeping only cleans M-F.

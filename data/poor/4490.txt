The thumping rap music accompanies far too many hours to appreciate this property in any way unless you are a fan of such perpetual pounding noise. Booking a Club Level ocean view room to enjoy the view and relax was impossible with the blaring sounds of the the pool below.. Enjoying a quite dinner outside at their Area 31 restaurant impossible!! The food is fabulous but the noise is unbearable. In all fairness it is a perfect spot for a certain age group ~ but not for a young at heart senior citizen looking for a nice relaxing week-end. We come to Miami several times a year and ths will never be on the list again! We love Kimpton properties but definitely Not This One !!! Staff in Club level. Exceptional but this cannot take away the anguish of having to stay in your room and still hear the pounding sounds of the horrid "music?" !!!

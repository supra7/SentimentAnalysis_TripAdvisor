Stay away of this hotel!! With the same price you could have hotel with better location, clean room and own bathroom. Our room was very small, awfully cold, dirty (and the cleaning lady did not clean it while on our stay) and the shared bathroom was awful. Our stay did feel like we would be in a motel. Also, this is not a three star hotel as it did say on Booking.com, this is fairly a 1 star hotel, or more like a hostel.

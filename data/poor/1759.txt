For starters, the staff didn't know how much the security deposit cost, we had to tell the guy. The room itself was dirty. We had no hot water all week. The bedroom door hit the bed as soon as you walked in. No space to put suitcases without having them in the way of walking. The "bolt" on the door itself was broken. Our lamp was broken. Definitely only a place to sleep in. I would say you could shower in it, but the chances of having hot water are slim so we went other places to shower. Oh, and the shower itself was very tiny.

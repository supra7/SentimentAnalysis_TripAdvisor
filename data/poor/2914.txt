This was my first stay at the W and unfortunately, it was a disappointing one. I expected a lot more considering they were part of the Sheraton chain and charging close to $400/night. I've stay at Le Meridien in Germany which is just as expensive but much nicer. To start, the rooms are incredible small. We stayed on the 4th floow (Bliss Spa floor) and the room was about 9 x 10. This was considered an upgrade from our original room. Now, I consider myself a small person at 54. This room was so small that with the queen size been, I bearly had enough room to squeeze across to the window side of the room. The restroom was even smaller. Only one person physically occupy it at a time. While we were there, we had to call maintenance because the shower head leaked. The building is showing sights of its age. On the plus side, the lobby was very nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The gym was modern and very well equipped. Locations great, right in midtown Manhattan. If I have a choice to stay on my next trip, the W New York would not be my top choice.

I attempted to make reservations over the phone with the gracious clerk, who took my information and said I would receive a reservation confirmation via email. After no confirmation came, I called back to learn the room was booked but another room was available which I, again, booked. When no confirmation came, I called back to hear that room was also booked. Which leads one to believe you could speak to the reservation clerk, request a room, receive assurances that the room was reserved, and arrive at the hotel only to find you are OUT OF LUCK!

The location is perfect . walking distance to almost anywhere in DT . Lobby is impresive and you can get free wifi in Lobby as well . There ar two towers in this hotel pike tower and union tower , one is renovated and the other is not . we stayed at the one that is not renovated , we booked the room through hotwire for a very good price as a 4 star , this tower, for sure, was not a 4 star more 3 ish ! the bath room is dated and small same as the room itself , dated carpet ,no in room safe , no closet ! just a drewer ( shelves without a door !) . the utslef room was spacious and the view was good . parking in the hotel is about 40$ or you can park 2 blocjs away for about $30.!

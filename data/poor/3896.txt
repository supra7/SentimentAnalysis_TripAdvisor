STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! Stayed at this place for a week and it's got the WORST SERVICE. Pool staff was unattentive and took their time to take care of guests. When asked for service, the response was rude & arrogant. I gave feedback to the front desk and the manager and it seemed like they didn't care to hear it. This place is not worth the price paid and should be rated 1 star for service & value. I would never stay at this place again and don't recommend it. There are many other & better places to stay at - like the Westin, which I highly recommend.

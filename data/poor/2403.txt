BE VERY CAREFUL, three different service incidents in 5 days, not the Ritz way, especially when the room rates have not come down accordingly. When I expressed the concerns one employee admitted that they were experiencing problems. Food (sandwiches) taking an hour in the pool for lunch, drinks did not come together but 30 minutes later, charges for in room not deducted after their own front desk employees confirmed verbally that they would credit and a couple more stories from us and other couples that attended with us On top they tried to charge a movie and another $80.00 item.. The management team here is clearly focused on achieving their revenue/bookings and cost targets while compromising the old Ritz way... On top they're also making their great staff look bad as they have to face the customers. Folks, I dont have time to post but had to do it for this stay and will get the word out as broad as I can, shame on the management staff at this hotel, Ritz corporate needs to review this one and I'll make sure a letter goes to them also.

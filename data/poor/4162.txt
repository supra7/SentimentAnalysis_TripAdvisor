This property does NOT have non-smoking rooms or non-smoking floors. This is not surprisingly not advertised anywhere in pre-purchase advertising and indeed only told to you if you ask. We had repeated trouble for the length of our stay with cigarette smoke entering the room, under the door, through the air conditioning. We even had the person in the room next to us smoking with her room door open (how lovely for her to clear the smoke from her own room) sending the smoke right into ours. When I asked about it management were pathetic seeming all at sea with the simplest request to move rooms. Eventually after tiring of their incompetence, I forfeited my pre-paid accommodation to stay at a better property. I strongly recommend against staying here. To be sure it is in a good location, just behind Orchard Road, but that does not make up for poor service. There are too many better alternatives within a stone's throw.

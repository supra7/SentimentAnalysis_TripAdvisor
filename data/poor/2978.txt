Being a frequent traveler I really don't expect much from hotels these days other than a bed for the chance of a good night's sleep so I can conduct business the next day. I am typing this frustrating review at midnight, after trying to sleep for 3 hours, due to the piano playing at the hotel's very own lobby bar. The front desk told me they MIGHT stop at 12:30. Two things I am sure about. 1). I will probably have a very difficult day tomorrow due to lack of sleep. 2) The hotel is violating the law, specifically Orlando City ordinance 42.04, which states "It shall be unlawful to play any radio, phonograph or any musical instrument or operate a sound-amplifying device within the City in such a manner or with such volume, especially during the hours between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., as to annoy or disturb the quiet, comfort or repose of persons in any dwelling, hotel or other type of residence, except as more specifically set forth herein.". The Orlando Police website suggested calling 911 to complain. If this keeps on I just might. In my years of travel I've never had a hotel that's so inconsiderate with noise. 4 stars? Seriously? You guys fail at the basic requirement for a hotel - give the guests an environment for a good night's sleep.

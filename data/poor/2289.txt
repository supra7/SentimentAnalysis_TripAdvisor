First and foremost - Be sure to ask about the POOL. The lovely pool pictured in the ad.. is under construction.. So if you want to go swimming.. you are out of luck. Second - 1 block off the strip. 1 block in Las Vegas is 1/2 mile long. So, you would have to walk 1/4 mile to Flamingo road, then 1/2 mile to Las Vegas Blvd. just to get to Ballys. So, that too is worthless information. Our shower was DIRTY. Yuk. The room was never made up while we were out. And! Housekeeping took our towels and never gave us any back (we got some from the front desk) NO Free breakfast like at MOST Super 8's (It does say that in their ad.so not a detraction) This is where the flight crew for SW airlines stay.. And, we felt like MOST of the staff had their own agenda, of which work was not a part. TWO redeeming factors. 1- If you walk up and down the strip all day (Plan on walking 5 miles a day if you are going to see anything) the Mattress will seem comfortable. 2. The coffee machine in the lobby (which also gives Hot Chocolate) is pretty good. Also, If you want to LAUGH look at the posted rate on the door card. $400.00 a night.

When we entered our room one part of heavy curtain was was not fully connected to curtain rail and the other half was in the drawer! Told person at reception could they fix it,also hair dryer not working, and the lift have a mind of itsown, nothing was done,staff were not friendly, we were not happy with service. What is good about this Hotel is the location.

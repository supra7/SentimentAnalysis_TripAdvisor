The person checking us in was nice, BUT THE ROOM HAD COCKROACHES!!!!! and it smelled musty. We did not stay. We check out immediately. The internet pictures are very misleading because the pictures look really nice, but as soon as you pull up to the building, you can see it does not look as nice as the internet pictures.

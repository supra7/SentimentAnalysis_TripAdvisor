This place is awful. My father was in the ICU at HUP so we stayed here for convenience (2 min walk to hospital across sky bridge). If we hadn't been in a life or death situation, there is no way we would have stayed. I realize that you're not going to get a 4 star hotel for $150 a night but I've stayed in cheap motels that were a lot nicer. The staff was rude and unhelpful, the ceiling in the bathroom was caving in, wallpaper was peeling, sheets were worn and stained, and they only bothered to replace or towels and make our beds 3 times in our 8 night stay. Most of the people staying here are in crisis mode and it is sad that they are being taken advantage of by this hotel.

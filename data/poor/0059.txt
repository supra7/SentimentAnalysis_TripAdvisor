This hotel is realli aweful, is the worse one i had choose from. i stay here just because at that time all hotels are full. therefore i stayed one night at there. Its horrible. u cannot image the carpet is green colour and kinda bug bites. and the ceiling is broken, also, the TV is kinda 1950's one, they should UPGRADE a new one okay? i haven't seen this kinda of OLD TV, and only can watch one or two channels and the colour from that TV is worse. The telephone is realli old. The elevator is worse than ever. and the light whether outside and inside all deem, not dark...realli terrify me to stay at there, its kinda hunting house. the service is not quite good also. do you need to choose cheap hotel, nice and clean one, u should choose 6 Ave Inn, that quite good i stay there for two nights be4 this hotel seattle. realli a nightmare for me. DONT CHOOSE THIS ONE, THE PICTURE IS FAKE...HORRIBLE.

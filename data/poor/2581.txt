I choose the Roosevelt to host 150 of our friends and family for our destination wedding in New Orleans. We had a room block for 9 months prior to the wedding and our guests all made their reservations about 6 months in advance. We had a huge brunch planned on Sunday in the Blue Room and had given this hotel plenty of business. When my guests began to arrive on Thursday afternoon, the hotel did not have rooms ready for most of my guests and asked them to wait in the lobby until rooms became available. Several of them had traveled from other countries with small children, including infants. Six hours later, the hotel started telling people that they ran out of rooms that night and would be bumping people to the Hilton Riverwalk, which is a MUCH lower quality hotel. At this point, I felt it necessary to intervene and asked to speak to a manager and was told there was none on duty. When I asked the "person in charge" why our guests were being bumped when we had a room block and reservations for months, he had no answer. When I asked why they couldn't be moved to a hotel that was at least as nice as the Roosevelt, I was told that there were no rooms in the city at the nicer hotels. I then requested that he call again IN FRONT OF ME a nice hotel - the Windsor Court and ask for availability. Of course, there WERE rooms available and he had LIED. Unfortunately, about 50 of my guests missed the first night's festivities because of the extremely poor treatment that the Roosevelt bestowed upon us and they managed to REALLY UPSET a pretty laid back bride and groom on the eve of their wedding weekend. I would caution anyone in a similar situation to trust the Roosevelt with such an important event. Also, it should be noted that I have never written a bad review.

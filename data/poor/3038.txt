Holy cow! Today is my second to last day and I can't wait to leave! The waiters Interrupt conversations to clear your plate WHILE YOU ARE STILL EATING! They even reach across you and have no manners! Unreal honestly! The pool 'lifeguards' don't follow the same rules for all the kids.. If your kids are young, lifeguards will pick on them! We even spoke to the GM and he say he would 'do something' to make things right! No response! He didnt care! He cares more about the people here for business meetings than families! So, if you don't mind paying a lot for out dated rooms, buffets that are NOT buffets but self-serve , (one main dish, one side dish, one dessert) and staff that's not trained, young and rude, then you will feel right at home! I'm going BACK TO SQUAW Peak Hilton down the road or the Westin!! Never again! Now I'm heading outside the grounds for a decent meal, good service, A BAR OF SOAP (not a mini circle) and shampoo that's not 1oz for the family!!

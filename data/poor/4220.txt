Stayed for two weeks on business. GREAT location - close to Wan Chai Ferry to Kowloon, close to the MTR. Hopewell Centre (at the end of Luard Rd) a 10 min walk away. Lots of stores, including a TASTE grocery store where you can pick-up snacks, etc... Room quality varies GREATLY. Try and get a lower floor (14-21) as these have been renovated. Older rooms are VERY dingy, run-down, and quite depressing. Hallway carpets threadbare, smelly. Smoking floors: 11, 21, 37. All other floors non-smoking, but this is not really enforced. First room they gave me (older room) smelled like a smokers' convention had just left. Harbor View rooms worth every penny but be prepared for street and construction noise. The hotel faces a busy artery that leads to the midtown tunnel. There is also a bus hub right across the street. Earplugs a must for sleeping. Garden view rooms quieter with nice views of the pool. Pluses: GREAT exercise / workout facilities, fantastic pool (50m heated outdoor, shared with Hyatt). New room decor & layout, room service (cheap, fast, and efficient), hotel lobby & lounge, hotel restaurant (GREAT breakfast buffet). Minuses: front desk staff - friendly, but barely literate in english. Well-meaning, but essentially clued-out. If you have any issues, immediately ask for a manager (not really a manager, but someone who actually understands english). No concierge so you're on your own for any trips. **Construction** The Convention Centre next door is undergoing a major expansion. Expect construction to last until at least May. Drilling noises 7 days/week from 8am until 6pm (10pm on weekends). Older rooms (higher floors) dingy, smelly, run-down.

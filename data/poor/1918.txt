The hotel being in the middle of Boston and near the parks is probably the best thing I can say. The room was small, the bed was way to small, my husband slept on the floor the first night, and let's not even talk about the bathroom. You had to close the door to get to the sink and the toliet was right against the tub. And while taking a shower you had to stand sideways. And the day we were leaving the fire alarm went off, I think I was the only one in my nightgown, where was everyone else. It was very unorganized.

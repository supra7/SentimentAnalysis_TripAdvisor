Horrible service. Broken bathrooms. I had to fight to get a room change and then by the time I got back from my appt. after telling them I wouldn't be back until late, they gave the room away! Bums outside the hotel. Hookers. I could continue but my experience was terrible. Save your money, don't stay there.

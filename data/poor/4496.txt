I was going to book a room at this hotel. But since the front desk staff member by the name of Denis kept hanging up the phone on me because I requested to speak to his manager, I will not be wasting my time or money there. I lodged a complaint with Hilton Honors, let's see how long it will take for them to respond!!!

We were excited to have secured a good rate ($200) for a night here. We were told when we got there that there was no room available for an early check-in, so we had to use the "health club" bathrooms to change into clothes for a wedding. But we were told that all was ready for our check-in; the front desk staff even showed us a packet of our registration materials all ready to go. So imagine our surprise when we returned after the wedding and were told that the hotel was full and they were sending us to another hotel. That hotel was decent but certainly not the quality we expected. Perhaps I'm suspicious, but it seems clear that we were shuffled off because we had a lower rate agreement than someone else. From what we did see of the hotel, it was fairly dingy. I wonder if this is something hotels make a practice of when they find that they can do better than an agreed-upon rate.

We rented 3 rooms and paid $200+ per night for each room. All three rooms were infested with bed bugs. When we complained and asked for another room, the manager first of all refused to accept that that there were bed bugs but conveniently told us that he would give us a discount. He could not move us to another hotel because the hotel was full. We could go to another hotel because everything was super-expensive. In the end the manager gave us a $100 discount on our entire bill which was around $1200. The cleaning was very friendly and asked us why is there blood on the bed sheets (We killed some bed bugs who were sucking our blood). Then she told us "Now I realise why I see drops of bloods on the bed sheets all the time while cleaning." No ironing machines, Water supply was cut off at night, parking was a problem, good location (right at the beach), a mile or two from the boardwalk Do not even go here if this is your last choice

This was the worse hotel I have ever stayed in, and prompted me not only to check out early, but also to write my first hotel review. For $80 a night, I stayed in a room that: - had warm, but not hot water, so I could never take shower without getting cold, and I had to wait about 2-3 minutes before any warm water came out of the faucet in the first place. - was "non-smoking" but directly across the hall from the smoking rooms, so that the smell travelled into my room at 6 am when my neighbors decided to light up. - was darkly lit, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent and had stains bed cover - was cleaned by very polite housekeepers, but a remarkably rude and unfriendly staff. Today, I checked out of the hotel and for $20 less a night am staying in a friendly, clean chain with warm water, a sauna, and a room that reminds me that my Travelodge experience was rare and not to be tolerated.

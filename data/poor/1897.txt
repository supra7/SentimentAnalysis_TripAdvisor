You would think for a hotel of this stature and reputation it would not treat guests like dirt. After holding a company event at the hotel facility for five days I have come to realize that the Park Plaza should not be put on as high a pedestal as one thinks. Management and staff was rude and un-helpful and when something went wrong an apology was never given. When guests complained about having no AC, green water, leaks and more in their hotel rooms nothing was done. The only thing this hotel has going for it is its location and historic value, other than that I would highly recommended to NEVER stay at this hotel. You could probably receive better service at the Holiday Inn.

I recently paid $500 for a room at the W Hotel on Lexington Ave. The lobby is classic W. I fully expected a matchbox sized room but did not anticipate chipping paint, no bathtubs but showers with plastic curtains, heating system dating back several decades, electronics such as phones from the1980s and a sofa chair that was brown and tattered from overuse. The only response to my complaint was that the hotel had not been renovated--no kidding! A 3 star hotel posing and priced like a 5 star. Avoid it.

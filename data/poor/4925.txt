~~Our family of 4 wrapped up our vacation in Vegas at Summer Bay. We are RCI time share owners, but did NOT make this reservation through our timeshare company. We only needed a few nights, so we went on-line and used "Book-it". ~~While all the units have the same floor plan, there are two vastly DIFFERENT levels of accomodation at Summer Bay. If you rent online (ie: Expedia, Orbitz, Book-It, etc.) - expect an older, dated unit. If you are okay with a trip back to the 80's and a hodge podge of well worn furnishings & decorating styles, their rental units will meet your needs. They have @ 150 rental units. (There are over 500 units on this property) ~~Don't be fooled by the lovely photos the resort posts on-line! When we asked the front desk, they explained that they have TIME-SHARE units and RENTAL units. They explained that on-line booking sites do not guarantee what the rooms will look like. The only way to get one of those updated timeshare units is to pay $50 more per night. ~~ One of the biggest drawbacks was the constant hum of the outdoor air conditioning units. Since the property was initially condos/apartments, each unit has a separate air conditioner. From our unit, with all the AC always running, there was never really any sense of quiet. Made me wish I was in a high rise to avoid the noise! ~~ While not far from "the strip" - we were advised by the staff not to walk from the resort to the strip at night. Seems an area they call the "desert" (currently undeveloped land between the resort & the strip) is known for homeless folks sleeping there at night. ~~ The fitness center was quite small - eary in the morning folks lined up for machines. There were no free weights. ~~AGAIN----- BEWARE of the two different worlds of Summer Bay. If you are a time share trade-in, seems you are okay. If you rent using on-line search engines, lower your expectations. It probably will NOT look like the pictures on the website!

I booked this room through Priceline which I have used successfully in the past. I will never stay at the Felix Hotel again and I will never use Priceline again for fear of booking a hotel as bad as the Felix. The rooms are so small that within minutes of walking into the room I got a headache, my heart started racing, and I felt dizzy. I am not claustrophobic but this room is just uncomfortably small. We were given a room with what the hotel calls a queen size bed. When we questioned the staff about the size of the bed they admitted that it is a "European" queen. The bed that they call a queen is smaller than a full size bed. There is no tub just a shower. I am not sure how they can rate this a 4 star hotel. We are going to find somewhere else to stay for the night. What a waste!

we went to the resort for a friends birthday. we went with a group of 12 in four different rooms. hotel check in is at 4 and we didnt get our rooms till nearly 6pm. ten minutes after we got our rooms 8 police officers showed up telling us to vacate the premises. they could not tell us what the problem was other than we had to leave the premises. management would not speak to us. they told us no alcoholic beverages were not allowed on the premises unless purchased through the resort. no security warning was ever issued. hotel management would not issue a refund leaving us to dispute claims with credit card companies because we were not given goods or services we thought we were paying for. we were treated unfairly. we were embarressed over the situation and we dont feel anyone should have to go through the heartache we went through. stay at the orange tree. they have an awesome guest service department

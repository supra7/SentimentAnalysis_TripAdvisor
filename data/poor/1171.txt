1) When I first arrived at the hotel there were two prostitutes trying to pick up guys in the lobby. These two girls looked so young and desperate. I almost felt sorry for them. They truly needed help. This was the first time I was so close to human trafficking. After I checked-in I made several phones calls to management before security chased them out. 2) My room had two adjacent doors that anyone could have pried open with a butter knife. I felt very unsafe. 3) I called management and requested to NOT BE DISTURBED during my 2 day stay. I had the "Do not disturb sign on my door". I was taking an afternoon nap at 3pm. While I was sleeping I heard someone knock on the door. Before I could get out of bed a maid walked in. She didn't have a cart or anything. I suspect she was entering my room to steal. She was in the room for several minutes before I kicked her out. My biggest fears while staying at Hilton was: 1) Someone walking into the room while I am sleeping 2) Getting robbed The next day when I went to the store I noticed one of my credit cards was missing. I eft my credit card on the dresser and the maid must have grabbed it before I kicked her out. I will never stay at Hilton in downtown Hilton again! NO FREE INTERNET IN ROOM!

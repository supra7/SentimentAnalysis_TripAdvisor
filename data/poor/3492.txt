This hotel was so bad that thinking of it makes me ill. I stayed for 7 nights. Firstly there is no lift which is just ridiculous as the hotel itself is UPSTAIRS. So you have to drag your suit cases up the stairs to even get into the place, and then probarly another 5-6 flights beyond that to get to your room. D'ont be fooled by the pictures used to advertise this hotel on websites - notice the dim lighting??Theres a reason for that. The room was OK in terms of size but the first thing I noticed was filthy towels in the bathroom. The whole place was very grotty and the worst thing about staying there was that I did not feel safe. Anyone could have pushed that door in at any time. The stairs are also tiny and narrow - don't underestimate the importance of no lift, I did and it was a disaster. Completley not suitable for children. The staff at the front desk were also unwelcoming and ungrateful on our departure. STAY AWAY!!!

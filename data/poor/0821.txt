I flew into Rome for further travel to Puglia so we stayed for the weekend. The room was good sized but the bathroom was a shoe box; im not exaggerating!! It was also quite hot that day and the air conditioning is controlled by the front desk. We asked if they could turn on the air for the night and they said they had no way of controlling the air because the temperatures in April can change from one moment to the next. So we had to sleep with 'clothing optional' as to not have a heat stroke! And I am from Miami!!! Also a double is 2 singles pushed together. Dont try to cuddle or you will fall through the middle. I would not stay here more than a night. It is not conveniently located unless you have a GPS and a car. The area is somewhat seedy. They charge you for parking-which is on their premises. Overall I would say overrated.

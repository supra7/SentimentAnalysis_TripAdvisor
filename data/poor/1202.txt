I don't no where the four stars come from. This is the 4th time I've stayed in Rome and this hotel is very disappointing. The room did not have enough space for two open suitcases at the same time, the shelve at the bathroom was falling down, the toilet was running with water, the shower was running over with water, so the floor got all wet. Outside the window gests from the nabour-restaurent stood and smoked and worst of all was the bed, which was in such a bad condition, that it felt like falling to pieces whenever we moved an arm. Don't go there - especially not if you are just a little bit claustrophobic.

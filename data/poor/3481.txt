Dark, musty, no lifts, towels are yellow/gray with holes, staff couldn't be bothered..., far too expensive for what it is - a budget motel!!!; we booked via newyorkhotels.com and paid USD280!!!. Definitely the worst hotel I stayed in NY. We only had to stay because of an error in booking (be very careful when using newyorkhotels.com booking system!! - in addition, the facts are not as represented on their website e.g. Marakech rooms don't offer free wireless as claimed!!!).

When we, as newcomers to Seattle, finally found the Seattle Pacific hotel, we were relieved only to walk into the lobby of the hotel to find the hotel owner arguing with someone who we presume was a customer. My parents booked a room for themselves, and one for me. I am blind and was traveling with my well-behaved guide dog. Because my guide dog is not a pet, and is actually an aid needed to help me with my disability, hotels may not charge an extra pet fee because guide dogs are permitted anywhere the public is welcome. and at no extra charge. In my 23 years of traveling with a guide dog, no hotel has ever given me such a bad time. The Seattle Pacific hotel is a most cold, inhospitable and unfriendly hotel and I do not recommend it to anyone!!!! When I explained to the owner that the law prohibits a hotel from charging this fee, the owner told me that I was unaware of the laws in Washington and that I could not stay at his hotel if I was unwilling to pay the fee. Then, he told me that he had no reservation for me and no rooms available. He was rude and it was a blatant case of discrimination. Why would anyone want to stay at a hotel that puts absolutely no effort into hospitality? Needless to say, we left, and found other accommodations. (Unfortunately, my parents were charged for both rooms, but they are working with VISA to be sure that the charges will not be paid to the Seattle Pacific hotel, especially under these circumstances). FYI: WE ended up staying at the Travelodge, where we were treated with respect and courtesy. It was worth it even though we paid more for our rooms. The seattle Pacific hotel gets my award for the Worst hotel ever! Even if he had been nicer, there was tremendous city noise in this area, it was difficult to find and I hope that this man gets a taste of his own medicine someday so he can learn what it feels like to be treated so shabbily.

I had no hot water, the t.v. was broken, it smelled, we could hear the people next door (thin walls), it was sketchy at night, the exercise equipment was also broken, and worst of all the staff was so rude. This hotel charged me for a night's stay that i wasn't there for, and then couldn't reverse the charges and gave me some weird line about not believing me. The manager, Angela Hentz, said i was mean. I had to dispute it through my credit card company. DO NOT STAY HERE!

I booked this trip for my honeymoon and realize that I made a terrible mistake. The service is horrible. I am met with an attitude and laziness everywhere I go. On top of that, the server delivered jam to my table for breakfast. Thank you for all of the ants that were included with the jam. That was appetizing. We tipped our housekeeper as we always do, only to find that the three dishes in the sink aren't done so we now have ants crawling everywhere. She doesn't even replace the wash cloths in the same place she put them the day before. It will be a nice little scavenger hunt finding the wash rags. The food itself is terrible. I ordered scrambled eggs and got a yolky sloppy mess. I am continually met with an attitude by almost everyone I deal with. Meanwhile, anyone with dark skin is met with a smile and welcome. This place is racist. Absolutely racist.

Frightening and loud profane argument next room. Police moving someone out in next building. Worse yet, I was stupid enough to give my Email address with a promise from them that it was for Motel 6 only. I had 97 SPAMs in next 24 hours and it continues to this day. Sure a lot of high heels marching up and down the upper deck and doors being open and closed all night. Guess that's just Vegas. I don't think so. If you have any respect for your family, don't stay here.

I had stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Phoenix, and was somewhat disappointed by the dated decor. Hence, on my following visit to Phoenix, I decided to stay at the Arizona Biltmore. The property is pristine and tranquil, but the service cannot compare to that of Ritz Carlton by any means. My disappointment started at the front desk. A girl named Alexa assisted me. She appeared discontent and obnoxious. She didn't even bother to greet me even after I had greeted her. Moreover, she took an attitude with me. I called the manager from my room and commented on how the hotel of such caliber shouldn't have employees such as Alexa- especially at the front desk. The manager attempted to avert my attention by asking me about the room, but her response overall, was unsatisfactory. I thought that surely my encounter at the front desk was an anomaly, but realized later that the unacceptable to mediocre service dominated the hotel. The bartender at the swim-up bar located by the slides is probably the only one who should be working there.

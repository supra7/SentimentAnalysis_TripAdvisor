This is the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in. The lobby smells like smoke and must. The rooms themselves were fine. The housekeeping staff does a good job, and the rooms are spacious. However, the air conditioner didn't work well. The room was constantly moist and stuffy. We went to a a couple bars in the hotel on our first night, and they were dirty and gross. The people who stay @ this hotel are gross. Mostly gold chain wearing people and old broke down gamblers. The bartenders are friendly, however. The location is awful. Irbid @ the far end of the strip in the ghetto. I get uncomfortable walking around the area, and it cost a lot to get cabs everywhere. Any money we saved on the room was spent on cabs. Don't wate your time and vacation at this place.

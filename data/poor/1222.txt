We paid in full and booked this hotel 3 months in advance. Our travel agent called and requested an early check in as we were travelling from Australia with a baby, this was promised to us. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greated by the hotel manager, hello people, lovely start!! After much saga and being promised a room the hotel manager told us we would need to wait until 3pm for a room, whilst in front of us he checked others without children into rooms. When we questioned why he would not give us a room he then started screaming are you calling me a liar that I have a room, then told us we were not welcome to stay at the hotel and he was too busy to give us a letter outlining we would be given a full refund. Stay next door at the Hollywood Heights they were brilliant and similar pricing!! The Hollywood Heights ended up calling the police for us as we had paid over $1000 for our stay and had nothing to say we would be refunded. The Police arrived and said to the manager not this again, obviously this is not the first time. The Police then spoke to the manager and came back and spoke to us, he said the manager thought we looked like party goers, very funny as we were travelling as a family with a 3yo, 15 yo and my mother 63yo. The police made them deliver a letter of refund to our new hotel. Don't risk not being welcome and book somewhere else. We did not get the refund for over 2 weeks, (Loads of hassles and phone calls) lucky we had enough money to pay for another hotel.

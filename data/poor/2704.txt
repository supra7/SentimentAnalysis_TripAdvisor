I booked my reservation through the hotel chains website. This hotel has a 24 hr cancellation policy which I fully understand. Until my flight was cancelled due to the weather in NY on the day of my arrival. I immediately called the hotel to notify them of this dilemma and asked if I'd still be charged. I was told yes, so I asked to speak to the manager. I believe ethically this is wrong, considering I don't have control over the weather. I had to leave her a voicemail and after 24 hrs and no response I tried to contact her again. This time I was successful, only to hear her say in an extremely rude attitude that she would not make any exceptions, and that I would still be charged. Which I was. She then proceeded to tell me that after looking at my previous stays with the Applecore chain, that "I didn't look so much like a valued customer to her".

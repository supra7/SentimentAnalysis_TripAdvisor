Our hotel in Paris was great but the Rome hotel,the Santa Prassede-Depandance, was a nightmare. It was located in a dirty ally with human feces on the ground, graffiti everywhere and our room was not in the hotel showed in the picture but across the street where they rent apartments, we wouldn't go out at night time. We had no telephone or air conditioner in our room as stated in the hotel information and they refused to let us use our calling card from the lobby phone. I explained that our calling card would not work on the payphone for some reason and our daughter was sick back home and we didn't have a phone in our room, but they did not care. Because our daughter was sick we had to use our Visa at the payphone and I just got my bill and it cost us $85.00 for 2 one minute calls. All but one of the night staff was very rude. It was so hot we asked if we could borrow their fan and one staff member told us to go buy one. This entire experience upset me because I actually upgraded the hotel from the original package, I cant imagine what we would have had if I didn't.

The Harbor Freeway goes right by this hotel - and if you have an odd-numbered room you will hear it, all night. For some unknown reason, the hotel is not soundproofed properly. If you need to stay here, ask for an even-numbered room away from the Freeway. Otherwise, the hotel is clean and the staff seemed efficient. I ate elsewhere, so cannot comment on the food etc. There were some panhandlers in surrounding streets, but also plenty of cops on bikes and in cars. The convention center is a fairly long walk, but straight down the street.

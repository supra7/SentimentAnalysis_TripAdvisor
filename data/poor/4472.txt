I'm not much of a writer so I'll just list my reasons for rating this Motel 6 Tropicana as the worst in the United States... 1. Newly renovated rooms look great but I've slept on softer floors than the mattresses that are in those rooms honestly, NO JOKE ! 2. We get there with reservation in hand and all of a sudden there's a mistake on Motel 6's end and we had to pay $60+ dollars more because of some explanation that only a motel 6 employee would understand, I've made over 50+ reservations in other Motel 6's and NEVER had an issue with my reservation price i get to this motel 6 and i have a prob. 3. I honestly don't like people in my room when im not there, for the first three days i would call front desk and say "i would not like room service for my entire stay please do not disturb me". What do i get ? room service everyday ! Lack of communication with thier staff point blank, i especially like being woken up every day in the morning with a woman asking me do i want room service to sign the maids log at 8am. 4. First thing i see when i go into the room on my 1st day is a huge roach dead on the floor !? 5. Small 24 hour store has had so many thefts that when you walk in they literally follow you around the store as if your going to steal something ! 6. Area that this Motel 6 is in is a Dump and the lot next to it is abandoned and filed with porn advertisement and a million broken bottles. 7. Walls are paper thin and i mean just normal talking levels are too loud as you can tell everything that is being said in the next room. 8. GRAND FINALE.... I'm taking a shower and my wife gets a call from front desk that the water is leaking into the room downstairs below me and i need to stop taking a shower and get put another room immediately. Then they say in the morning is fine as long as we don't shower anymore, well next morning i call to switch rooms and they say "we don't know what your talking about" ! LMAO These were my experiences, take them as you will.

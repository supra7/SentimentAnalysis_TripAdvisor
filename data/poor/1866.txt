This place was a letdown in many ways. Our first room was awful, very small and it smelled like something was dead in the closet. And I'm not exaggerting. I'm in the military used to some bad smells, but this was intolerable. At least they switched our room, but we still were not impressed. The bathroom was tiny and you could hear the pipes running all night, which made for horrible sleep. For the price, I would not stay there.

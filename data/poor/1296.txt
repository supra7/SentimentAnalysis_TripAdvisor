Unfortunately I read the reviews AFTER I stayed at this Super 8. We took a young man who has cancer down to see a ballgame and the sights. Unfortunately, the sights ended up at the motel. The other reviews are right...powdered sugar hard donut for continental breakfast, nasty pool, scary little elevators, etc. The mattress straightened my back out though...permanently. The door had to be opened by force. The desk mgr. had a spotlight out shining it on rooms, yelling for some people to get back inside. It was awful all the way around. The address is deceiving as well. I would recommend this hotel to someone near frostbite, and that's about it.

We would highly recomend staying at another hotel. The photos online are deceptive as the rooms look nice. Don't be fooled, the rooms are dirty and dated. From the pubic hair on lamp, hair on the pillow, a broken window, sticky marks, bits of food on the phone, dirty dishes in the cupboard, no water pressure, stained carpets, lumpy and staind pilows, to the foul smell, cold 'hot tub' and raised parking rates. Our stay was unpleasant and uncomfertable. Unfortunatly there were no rooms available at another hotel or we would have left. Don't waste your points/money here.

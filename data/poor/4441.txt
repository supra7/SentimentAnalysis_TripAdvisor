My husband and I traveled to Las Vegas for our wedding. We stayed at the stratosphere because it seemed very economical and close to the chapel we were getting married at. We had a large group go down with us to Vegas, we had about 10 hotel rooms all together. My brothers and my in laws were both placed in rooms where the toilets did not flush and the sinks backed up. When my mother in law went to switch rooms they told her she would have to pay an extra $15 a day because they were moving her to a room with a view! We at Luckys cafe and my husband had a big chunk of a broken dish in his food. And the icing on top of the cake - after we were out partying for a night, we come home and crawl into our freshly made bed and fall asleep. We wake up in the morning to find - OLD RED NASTY stains all over our sheets and blanket! Neither one of us were bleeding! We asked for all of bedding to redone, it took hours for them to come and change the sheets. When we came back to our hotel room that night we pulled all of the covers off to inspect and what do you know??? Red stains still all over our blanket. Not once was anything done to make us feel like our stay was apperciated. As much money as we dumped into this hotel and casino, not once did we have a hotel manager apologize. The only pleasant experience we had was our lunch at the top of the world resteraunt. I would never stay there again, it is worth the money to stay somewhere else. DO NOT be fooled by the low prices. You really do get what you pay for.

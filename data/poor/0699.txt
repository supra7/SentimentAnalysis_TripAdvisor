My husband and I stayed at this hotel on 10/1, and based on the property, hoped to stay an additional night. However, based on the room we received (with a horrible view overlooking the property's roof) and cold attitudes of the staff we decided to cut our losses and leave after just one night. My suggestion to you is that on days that your hotel is not booked (which it wasn't on the weekend we were there) offer your guests the best possible view rooms so that they will WANT to stay at your hotel again. At least the view would have made up for the obvious coldness of the hotel decor and disinterest of your personnel. We stay in San Diego maybe 10 weekends a year and we will not select this hotel again. With so many OTHER beautiful hotels in the area - why on earth stay here?

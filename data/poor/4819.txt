No Golden Gate view here. Top of the Mark is small the people are rude. We were promised a view of the golden gate bridge on the club level. This was supposed to be one of the only nice hotels with this view. The hotel was below average. The small club at the top was a small, unremarkable and it's doorman is rude. We got a very obstructed view of the bridge. You could see 5% of it. If you think the Mark Hopkins can add romance to your visit to San Fran, first see if you can get a room in Alcatraz. We checked out early and went elsewhere and were much better off...

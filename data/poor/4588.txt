Save your money! This is the smallest hotel room I have eve stayed in! It is extremely tiny by NYC standards! Queen size bed with 12 inch tables on each side - that's it! Bathroom sink is so shallow a man's hands cannot fit under the facet! No clost - a very short rod with a curtain. Very noisy! No restaurants except McDonalds or Subway in immediate area. Room Service has only 4 breakfast and 5 lunch selections! One of my worst hotel experiences ever! Staff portrays it as "boutique Silver LEED hotel". What an excuse! You can have it!

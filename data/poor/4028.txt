Facts: - booked 2 rooms for a June stay through Expedia - i had to cancel one room, so i called the Fairmont. the reservation associate said that both rooms were cancelled. i said that was impossible and decided to call back the next day to get someone else on the line. - called the next day, and i got the same response from someone else - i called expedia. expedia put me on hold for 15 minutes while they talked to the Fairmont. when the agent got back on the line, i was told that the two rooms were moved to the Intercontinental due to overbooking at the Fairmont. the Fairmont did not have a new confirmation number, the rate, or the room type that we would have at the new hotel - it took me 2 days to get someone from group sales at the Intercontinental to make the edits to my reservation (because these rooms were marked a "special case," i had to speak to someone in sales) If i did not call to make the change to the reservation, i would never have known about the move. my colleague and i would have gotten to the front desk to check in at 11pm and i can almost guarantee the person at the front desk would tell us that we did not have a reservation for the stay and would not have any idea about the "room move" to the intercontinental. i basically travel for a living. i have never seen such reckless unprofessionalism from a branded hotel like the Fairmont. fair to say that they have lost my business.

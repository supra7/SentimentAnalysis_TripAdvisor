For my 30th birthday me and my girlfriend decide to stay at this hotel on Daytona Beach. HUGE MISTAKE! First let me say the lobby smells bad theres only one elevator which is always packed to the max. So we get to are room and the first thing we notice how dirty and nasty the carpet and floors are and how the carpet is peeling up in certain areas and damage to walls and flooring. 2 am my girlfriend wakes me up and points to a roach on the ceiling above the bed so I kill it and then a larger roach crawls up the wall followed by a smaller one, kill them show them to front desk, she doesn't offer an apology or a room change. SIMPLY PUT WORST HOTEL STAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am currently staying at the hotel and truly regret having chosen this hotel. On all other trips to NYC we have stayed at Le Parker Meridien which is so much better than the W! Our experience at the W has been terrible! I had heard so many good things about the W hotels and really wanted to try one but after this experience will think twice! The check in staff were very brusque and not at all friendly; the room was tiny and very dark so we had to upgrade ourselves to a 'suite' which was more like a normal room size. The hotel had no bathrobes so I called to check if there should be one in the room and was informed that there should be and one would be sent right up; I had to make a further THREE calls before it was finally sent up, almost an hour and a half later! We had breakfast here only one morning and the quality of the food was very poor, not to be repeated. On a side note, our breakfast was still outside our room at 10 pm that evening despite having called room service to say we had finished! Overall, very disappointing, the only positive being the location!

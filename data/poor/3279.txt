We had expected that for $400+ a night we would have been met with friendly service and a nicely kept room at the very least. The rooms were nice except for the fact that when we returned from sight seeing at 6pm none of our party's three rooms had been cleaned! Our phone didn't work, and room service took over an hour to get a turkey wrap (that tasted terrible)! Do not go to this hotel if service is your thing! We were treated with extreme disrespect by the two employees we encountered at the front desk! WHAT A TERRIBLE FIRST IMPRESSION!!! I WOULD NEVER GO BACK!

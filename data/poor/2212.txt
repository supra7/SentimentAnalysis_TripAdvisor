We checked in to The Daytona Hilton with expectations of high class resort-BIG MISTAKE. When you check in here the lobby is beautiful, unlike the treatment you recieve by the hotel desk clerk. We had a horrible check in, even though we had print outs of our reservations and I had personally called a week before to make sure the confirmations were correct. It took us half the day to straighten out our rooms. They charged credit cards incorrectly and seperated us all on different floors where we could not even get to each other because you are only authorized to use your floor. When you have senior citizen parents with heart conditions and cancer, You can not reach them in an emergency. The rooms are about on the level of a 2 star hotel so don't expect too much when you see your room. The so called air conditioning would cool to about 80. Would not stay there again.

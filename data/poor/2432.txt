I just returned from a week atThe Whaler on Kaanapali Beach on Maui and what a disappointment. Check- in was a nightmare, Rod, the clerk was rude, hostile, and refused to book us into the room we had held a reservation for for nearly 3 months . Rod insisted we could not have made the reservation , even though I had a confirmation number and we were listed in his computer as arriving that day. After much hasseling, Rod finally gave us a room after we agreed to an "upgrade". First he wanted $150. a night but when I fussed and flatly refused somehow he immediately dropped the price to $ 25. a night The room did have an ocean view, but was dirty, worn, frayed, and badly in need of an face lift..The toilet roon was was very dirty and had not been painted or updated in 15 years +++ The kitchen area had ants on the counter top every day. "When we initially arrived in the room following the disasterous check in, there were no towels or linen in the room. I returned to the desk to ask that some be brought to us and Rod asked me if I had pulled the bed cover back to see if we had any sheets on our ''upgraded" bed. I was shocked. Rod really gave our trip a negative starthe was just mean and hostile. but we made the most of it and Hawaii just can't be beat. The beaches are great. I would never tell anyone to go toThe Whaler unless they are ready to be gouged and ripped off which I think is clearly a way of business there. Too bad, as it is in such a great spot, service was non existant. If you go there be sure and check your room before you accept any ''upgrades

Seven of us arrived at the Blake for a three day stay. Even though we confirmed reservations three days prior to our stay when we arrived they would not give us rooms. They indicated that they overbooked by thirty people! The hotel they wanted to send us to was next to a landfill! They claimed it was only 20min from downtown Chicago.. maybe 20 min without traffic considerations! The hotel manager would not come out of the office to talk to us.. and did not return any calls by our travel agent. We were promised rooms two days later and again they didn't have any. While waiting they told us that everyone else who was to come in that day was also going to be refused a room... Ten minutes later a man came in and they registered him. When I questioned it, they told me it was difficult to explain.. I've traveled in my job for 20 years.. I've never been so inconvenience before.

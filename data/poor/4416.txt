First, I had booked a room a couple of months ago. I called a few weeks in advance to confirm a non-smoking, King sized bed. Seems like an easy request for a hotel with over 2,400 rooms! Not the case when I checked in, apparently my room had been taken and all I was offered was a room with 2 double beds. When I had explained this was supposed to be a very important trip, my husband and I were there celebrating our 5 yr wedding anniversary. She seemed like she didn't care. She advised me to call the next day to see if they had a room with a king sized bed available. No offer to upgrade, no free dinner, no show tickets, nothing! (FYI: Having grown up in Vegas, I know that they can offer all those things and more!) After hours of driving, this would've made the mistake easier to deal with. Anyways, this isn't the end of this, the next day when I called to switch to our original king sized bed room, they sent us to a room with a terrible smell of cigarettes. When I called down to the front desk to tell them I needed a Nonsmoking room, due to my husbands medical condition, "Tiffany" said she was busy and would call me back to the room phone in a 'few minutes'. When 30 MINUTES passed, I was done waiting and decided to call myself, she happened to answer, when I reminded her I was waiting for a return call, she said "Oh, I forgot", Then she said they would switch me to another room (Yes, THREE rooms now, neither upgraded or still, no comps or anything). I could not believe how HORRIBLE we were treated during our special trip. I talked to the front desk manager when we checked out and told her the experience, she offered a discounted room-rate, but at this point, it was not enough. She said I will be contacted about what happened with my stay, we will see how that goes. Do not stay here if you need a special request!! They do not care about you, just taking your money!

I have stayed at Harrah's three times for work. Each time has been equally disappointing. The casino is one of the worst (if not the worst) in terms of the smoky air. The rooms are very dirty. The lights literally flicker when you turn them on (like a cheap motel in a movie); the curtains in my room had holes in the blackout so light filtered in every morning. There is a consensus from my coworkers that we should try to ensure we never stay in Harrah's again. It is one of the worst hotels I have ever visited.

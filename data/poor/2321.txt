Just all around bad :( Engineering couldn't get our TV to work w/ a remote, loud, unkempt, etc. . . it's basically a MOTEL w/ a waterpark. There were piles of soiled towels everywhere outside, bathroom by pool had wallpaper peeling off, etc. . . I could literally go on and on. Service was horrible, even management agreed to let us out of reservations that were supposed to be non-refundable thankfully. One woman at the desk acknowledged that they had way over sold. WTHeck!?! Willing to sacrifice service for squeezing a few more folks in . . . shame on you!

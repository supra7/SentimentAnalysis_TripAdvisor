The hotel markets itself as an antique classic that has been restored to a "Hollywood" style glamor. NO WAY. I was thrilled to stay in an old-fashioned reconditioned hotel, but was uncomfortably surprised by just how "old" this place really is. Evidently, Hotel San Carlos has undergone some renovations in the recent past - but I can't for the life of me figure out what it involved (carpeting?). There are some charming features to be sure (the lobby looks like its glory days have long past, but if you squint hard enough you just might get a feel for the hotel's past). Otherwise, the hotel's rooms (bed, linen, bathroom, TV) all feel more like a MO-tel than a boutique hotel. And frankly, for this price I bet I can find a motel that has newer sheets and pillows. Oh, and I almost forgot - the shower's water pressure was equivalent to holding a small bottle of water and gently pouring it onto your head. No pressure at all. I do NOT recommend this hotel.

We booked on Priceline based on the number of stars and area. The lobby is very impressive but the rooms are extremely tiny and dingy. The air conditioner did not work in the room and there was only one double bed (there was my husband, myself and small child) the room was so tiny there was no room for a rollout. The room smelled bad and was very old and dirty, nothing like the photos from the website. It reminded me of a nursing home. Needless to say we checked out 20 min later after booking at Hilton for $30 cheaper a night!

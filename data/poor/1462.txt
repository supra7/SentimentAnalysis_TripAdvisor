Firstly, no complaints with the room - as a RA Platinum, was upgraded to a suite. Booked on Reward Points, very nice upgrade, no amenity gift or bottled water (as per the little note with my key) but wasn't bothered. Its interesting that one single human interraction can ruin your entire affinity to the brand. I had a 2-hr conf call and simply dialled the local Singapore number. I didnt bother to use the 1800 number in Singapore because the cost of local telephony is so cheap - its practically free. Even at the airport, they allow you to make free calls to mobiles and local numbers. When I came to check out, was presented with a $24 bill (which they tell me was discounted by 50%) for my 2-hr local call. It wasnt the money that was the issue. It was the dogmatic, condescending attitude of the Guest Relations Manager, who refused to budge and insisted that they charge me. This year I will spend over 70+ nights in IHG properties. If they want to lose me over a $24 local phone charge then so be it - and as I repeated, it wasnt the money, it was the pathetic level of patronising customer service I have ever seen in all my travel years.

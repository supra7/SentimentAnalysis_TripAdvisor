I just spent an entire week at the Eliot in Boston. Our son was attending a clinic at Berklee School of Music. The hotel was fair...bathroom was really small, older rooms but decent. The maid service could have done a lot better job.. My problem was that when we checked in (which was at about midnight after traveling for 12 hours) I wasn't sure what the rate for the room was supposed to be as my wife had made the reservation. So the next morning I noticed the rate was not correct so I checked on line and then went down to the desk. After discussing it with the desk person, at first he wasn't going to honor the rate. I told him it is advertised and that was supposed to be the rate we got. He finally agreed as he couldn't really take any other position. So, when I checked out I noticed that they had adjusted the rate for day 2 through 6. So I asked why the first night wasn't corrected and they said that I hadn't said anything till the next morning so they WOULD NOT correct it. I spent over $4000 that week at the Eliot, and it was really more principle then money. To top it off, and now that Im a little pissed, I look the bill over carefully and noticed they had charged me twice for room serivice one day. I pointed it out and he said "when you get home you can call out accounting department"...I said, well, how about fixing it now...he just looked at me but wouldn't correct it. I would be very careful staying here!

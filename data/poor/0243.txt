This is not a very nice place to stay. The hotel is old. The rooms were clean but are very small. The floors are made of wood and creak something awful. The closet was tiny. The bathroom was clean and had been renovated recently but again, very small. We managed to get a room for $69 but I would not pay that again. The most I would pay would be $45 and only if I was packing light and only sleeping there.

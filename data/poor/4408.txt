This was the 4th time we stayed at the Stratosphere and it sure will be our last,each time we visit it gets worse. This time our room (3-16-21) smelled like sewer water, or human waste, we soon found out why, the bath tub would hardly drain and when it did it would back up into the sink. And we were suppose to brush our teeth in this smell. We complained to the front desk as soon as we smelled our room,even went down to the front desk and nothing was ever done. We should have asked for a refund right then and there, but we were stupid and stayed, they could have at least offered us a different room. Also that Friday night and Saturday night October 10th and 11th, we were scared for our safety as their were some shady looking Gangbangers hanging around the casino and we don't mean a few we mean a couple hundred at least. We went to our stinky room and stayed in both nights, so two nights of our vacation were ruined. We wrote the Stratosphere Management a letter and they did offer us a free room UPGRADE on our next visit. How Generous,after our vacation was ruined. We don't recommend this hotel.

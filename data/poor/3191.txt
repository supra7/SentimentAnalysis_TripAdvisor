Too trendy pour moi We stayed for two nights at either end of our honeymoon to Hawaii in October. The Clift is definitely for the young trend setter who wants to be seen staying at the trendy hotels. The entrance is difficult to locate as there is no name to indicate that its the Clift from the front. On entrance to the reception is very modern and dark, which initially I liked but trying to check in in this light is a bit difficult. I felt you needed a torch to find your way around in the lobby area. The staff were very friendly and were extremely helpful.The rooms are ultra modern again and furniture is sparse. Rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. Sitting on the loo you had the toilet roll up on top of you!! Again, disappointed that no tea/coffee facilities in the room, plus our safe didn't work either. Mini bar extremely expensive and they even charged for the little sewing kits that hotels normally provide.Walls are thin so if you got noisy neighbours, your in trouble. On our second night, our room was a connecting room and luckily our neighbours didn't stay up too late but when they were having breakfast the next day you could practically hear them chewing. Definitely not my cup of tea but if I was a younger hip person, would probably love it!

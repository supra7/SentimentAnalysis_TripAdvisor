I don't understand how a hotel plans to make a good impression on its clientele if when you arrive they tell you - "Sorry, we overbooked so we will need to send you to another hotel." May I also say that I booked the room at normal price - $350/night - and this fact still didn't guarantee me a room. Very poor planning by a, supposedly, 4-5 star hotel. Then they think I will simply forget about the problem and come back the next day when they have room available. Sorry guys, you just lost my business forever. Good luck to you.

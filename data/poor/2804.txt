Trendy hotel, too bad i could not sleep in the bar! The room on the 3rd floor was small (which was fine) but beside an airconditionor on the roof which was so loud. Phoned to move room they said i could not. The light switch going into room was broken and walls had what looked like skid marks or crayon on them. Very disapointing and the fact that the front desk was so unaccomodating means never ever stay there again.

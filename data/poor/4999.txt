My boyfriend and I booked this hotel at the very last minute. A part from the good location (if you travel from/to London Heathrow only), I would suggest nobody to book this hotel and this hotel chain in general. We stayed there 2 nights. No room for suitcases. No room for walking in the room. No room for your toothbrush either. We did a lot of shooping and were forced to place all the bags over the bed. The first day we got up, had a shower and then left the room to visit London. When we came back at night we found out that the room had not been cleaned so we had to pay extra money to get a cleal towel and there was water everywhere. Not comfortable at all. No value for money. Never again.

I had the unfortunate luck to have a room at Harrahs facing the pool. The extraordinary noise that blarred from the pool area went until 3am one night and 4 am another night. At no time during check in did anyone inform me that I wouldn't get any sleep in a room facing the pool Be sure to ask about this if you go there. I expected some level of music, but also expected it would stop by 10am. Really ruined the stay for me and would never stay there again. No wireless access and not even the ability to check in for your flight online without paying a fee.

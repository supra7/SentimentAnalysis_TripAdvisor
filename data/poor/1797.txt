I felt that the Manager as well as the man that sat at the front desk (devon Washington) were extremely disrepectful and ignorant. As soon as I walked in I was threatened if we made noise and he had to come up to the room it would be ugly. Being that Ocean CIty is a PARTY town we went out and came back a little late. We werent being loud at all he called our room and said that we were walking around too much??? My boyfriend is 6ft 6 and weighs 250 there is no way he can walked lightly. He came to our door the second time and screamed and cursed at us telling us we needed to go to bed like we were little kids and then told us were are getting our stuff and leaving in the morning. The way he spoke to us females was unbelievable. That morning they were at out door at 8 am banging on the door like cops and told us we had one hr to get out (which i dont think legally ya can do) So we got our things and went to Bonita Beach hotel which was fantastic!!!! If you are looking for a nice place to stay and want to be treated like a human being and with respect, I would definitely tell you to go elsewhere. AWFUL MOTEL.....not even worth the cheap rate.....

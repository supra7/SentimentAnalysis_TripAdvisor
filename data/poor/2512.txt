Big Expensive mistake DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.First, we feel we were robbed by a man with a keyboard instead of a gun.Secondly, it is shabby at any price.Being robbed was partially our fault. A friend recommended the hotel as a good location and it is. When I looked at trip adviser I saw prices from around $150 - not bad for South Beach. My wife made the reservation on their web site for two nights in Feb.,07. The confirming email said: Total (before tax) 310.00. So far so good. She did the checking in and they did not discuss price because she had reserved online. We ended up with a Superior room with an Ocean View. That is a joke, you can see the ocean with binoculars through a crack between the buildings. (This was not an Ocean front room with a nice balcony but a room at the street end of the building with a window that stuck out from the building and you could see the Ocean. They also charge 25.00 for parking and the tax (which is high in Florida) was $40.30. Also there is a $1.00 charge for the room safe. for a total of $378.05 per night. When we went to check out, our bill was $765.10 for TWO NIGHTS not a week. My wife did not print the confirmation, so we could not argue and just paid the bill.Second, our room was old, shabby, and noisy as many of the reviews state. Perhaps there are better rooms, but ours certainly was not one of them. The carpet was worn and dirty. The tile in the bathroom was moldy and dirty. The plumbing did not work well. The water was only luke warm. The window was so dirty, you had to stoop and look around to find a semi-transparent place to enjoy the ocean view. The walls are paper thin and you can hear every noise in the hall. The doors are so bad, everyone has to jank on them to open them and then slam them to close them. With paper thin walls, this is just delightful to hear all day and night. We also had a room near the elevator and this just added to the din. It was an absolute disgrace for $378 a night even for South Beach.

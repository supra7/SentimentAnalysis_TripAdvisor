Came to town to celebrate my 30th birthday. Checked in, was told one of my two rooms was not available. First room we entered was dirty, had not been service by housekeeping. Second room we tried had water leaking from the ceiling. The elevator was broke, and one of my guests just had knee replacement surgery. We finally got some half/decent rooms. Rooms were super hot! tv's didn't work. towels were dingy. burn holes in blankets and around window sills. I felt like i walked into a nightmare, a boarding house, one step up from a hostel! THe desk clerk was a joke. (I happen to work for a choice hotel as a desk clerk) Rude, miserable, unprofessional. I wanted a solution, not to listen to this girl complain.

Tripadvisor reviews may sometimes lead you to mistakes commonly made by travelers who organize their trips in a hurry - or in extremely good fait,or in the easiest way. That's the case, in my opinion, of the so may good reviews on this hotel you may find here. New York is a wonderful city, but many attractions/hotels/restaurants are overrated, such as the Comfort Inn Midtown. In the case of this hotel, I don't know what pleases people so much. It's a basic, tight, claustrophobic lodging, with nice (not more than that) staff (even if you consider you're in NYC). Breakfast is ridiculously simple, in a (again) tight, claustrophobic room. The good thing is the location, if you want to be near Times Square. If not, just pass. The price is too expensive, even for NYC patterns, mainly if you consider other options in town. Although it was not my hotel experience, I wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend to my friends.

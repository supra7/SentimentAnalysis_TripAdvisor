Cancelled 20 days in advance... THANK GOODNESS!!!!! They kept 2 rooms and 2 nights= costly... Non refundable!! I drove just to see if reviews were true. YEUUUPPP!! Don't waste your money. I hope they used the donation wisely, as that is the only $ they will ever recive. Didnt even want to enter..so I DIDN'T LEAVE THE CAR. The view of it and the reviews here we enough. So, I didn't brave to enter. Even my kids said NO WE BETTER NOT BE SLEEPING HERE!!! I don't think there would be enough soap and water to feel clean after. Save your $. Gross sorry

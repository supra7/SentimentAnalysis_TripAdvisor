If you stay here, DO NOT let the doorman check out for you. I had prepaid for the room in full, and was going to front desk to hand in the keys and check out, and the "helpful" doorman said, 'Oh, are you prepaid? Just give me the key card.' I did this, and rather surprisingly he almost escorted me out of the hotel. Anyway, I had a plane to catch, so did not want to argue and it was only when I got home that I thought I should at least get a copy of the bill, but when I contacted the hotel, they had charged me the full amount again! No apology, and they did not even bother denying what they had done. The whole thing had been set up, and they try to scam as many customers as they can with this trick. Forget that this is an old, smelly hotel - just don't stay here unless you want to pay double.

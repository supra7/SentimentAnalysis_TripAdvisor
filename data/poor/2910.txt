The worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Booked four nights, stayed only for one. I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's and they did not cost $512 per night. Upon arrival, we were not asked if we needed help with our bags, instead they were taken out of the taxi and brought into the lobby and the attendant stood there waiting for the tip. The lobby was noisy and dark. Paid extra for the "mega room" which was certainly not large, but I would not have minded small if it was clean and in good working order. Here are the things wrong with the room: *Carpet was filthy and stained *Safe was completely broken and unusable *Bathroom outlet did not work at all (neither plug) *Dust ruffle on bed was torn and hanging on floor *Roman shade on window was torn *Chair frayed on both arms *Desk covered with drink rings *No lightbulb in lamp (called front desk for lightbulb, they said they would send one, never came) *Grate on air conditioning vent sticking up in dangerous condition *No thermostat control, air conditioning was on or off, no other choice *The room was very dark (probably to hide its deplorable condition) The room was disgusting and the staff arrogant. Could not bear to stay there for four nights. On the first night, after dinner, around midnight, we walked around the corner to 50th Street and saw the San Carlos Hotel sign which I remembered getting good reviews on Trip Advisor, walked in and booked a room for our remaining three nights. W Hotel staff did not seem surprised when we returned that night and said we would be checking out in the morning. San Carlos Hotel was wonderful and saved our trip - see separate review on that one.

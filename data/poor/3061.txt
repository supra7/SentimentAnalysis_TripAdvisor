1st the waterpark was closed even though the website said it was open, the #1 reason we went. It was 103 degrees and it was closed? 2nd after swimming at the small pool that was open, while in the process of changing an employee walked into our room to fill the mini-bar even though we had the "do not disturb" sign on. We told him to leave. 3rd after our second swim and placing the "do not distrub" sign on the door, my husbands wallet had a $100 bill stolen out of his wallet. We were 2 flights of stairs down and they had the nerve to do it while we were walking down the stairs, as that was the only time our room wasn't in site. We knew it was missing as I had just placed all the dollars in his wallet. 4th the bill was slide under the door and reflected a price $50 more than the agreed upon price from cheaprooms.com, plus we were charged the resort fee, when the waterpark wasn't even open. Um...yeah...wanting a getaway honeymoon and traveling from Alaska? Don't go here. Parks limited hours, no privacy, robbed, and then they tried to rob me again with the bill. No thanks.

Living near Chicago, we decided to stay overnight in the city for New Years Eve. I received an email about specials at the Fairmont for $149 which prompted me to stay there. Thinking the Fairmont is usually a good option, we opted for it. The best part of our experience were the valets. They were awesome - extremely friendly. The worst part of our stay were the REALLY drunk guests and the elevator that shook and stopped for a full 5 minutes. It was really frightening. Also, a big minus - there weren't any Water Vending machines and no $5 water bottle option in the room. Which prompted me to go down to the bar of the restaurant, Aria, to buy a bottle of water. After the server returned with a 15 oz bottle of water, she promptly told me it was $15 - that is $1 per ounce. I walked out. I don't think I will be staying at the Fairmont Chicago again.

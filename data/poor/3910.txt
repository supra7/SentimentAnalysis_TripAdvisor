On the very first night of my stay at this hotel I managed to find a cockroach in one of my drawers, 2 of my room keys did not work and that the room was either too hot or too cold even after much adjusting to the thermostat. Not only is it expensive to stay at this hotel, the food menu is unimpressive and almost disappointing for such a huge hotel such as this, its overly expensive and unless you have money burning a hole into your pocket you should choose somewhere else to stay. It is cockroach infested, they will fly onto your table while your eating and those pretty tiki torches as nice as they are to the scenery you can unfortunately smell the gas they use to keep them burning wherever you sit. As well with the menu, its ridiculously expensive and the food is mediocre. The only good thing this resort/hotel has going for them is very possibly their pools which at least one is closed down at a time because of cleaning and most people opt to play at the beach. Not that it matters where you go to swim because when you come back the horrible staff will make sure that your needs come last, the front service desk was reluctant to help with my room key issue. This hotel/resort may be rated 5 stars but the service certainly isn't.

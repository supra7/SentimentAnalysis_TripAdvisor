Beds had no comforter or heavy blanket, just sheets and thin, twin size throw. This is winter in Chicago, 20 degrees outside. The heat would not work correctly in room. The sensor is located 3 inches below the only (yes I said only) out vent in room. So when the heat kicks on, the sensor thinks the room is 80 degrees (that is what I set the heat at just to 65 in room) and the heater shuts off after 1 minute, followed by 1 minute of cool fan. The bathroom has no heat or air vent at all, so freezing in there, as it did have a window. Oh, the windows are very leaky in both rooms I had, cold air just blowing in. No blackout curtains. Who doesn't have either thick curtains or blackout? The noise is either loud street noise or loud elevator. Very very very tiny room. Cheap towels. The only plus stuff, good location. Free breakfast, nice tv. The rate was good, but I will never come back, as the point of a hotel is to sleep. Between the loud noise and the cold, I did not get much.

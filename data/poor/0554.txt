Hated the red lion at Boeing Field We stayed at the Red Lion Boeing Field for 3 nights. Good thing we stayed busy and didn't have to spend a whole lot of time at the Hotel. The rooms were worn, the grounds were not taken care of (although they were remodeling the restaurant-who knows how that will turn out). The ice machine did not produce more than a couple of cubes of ice the whole time we were there.The room was hot. The tub was slow to drain. The pool area was overgrown. The cable was out half the time. Provided Decaf coffee only and continental breakfast was very bleak. There was litter in the parking lot.Its too bad this place isn't better taken care of, it could really be a nice place. Sits right on the river and is a great central location between Downtown Seattle and Tacoma without all the hustle bustle. Would not stay again under the current management!

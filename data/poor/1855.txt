I had the "pleasure" of staying here for a conference and was extremely disappointed. The hotel had a nice feel to it once I arrived but that quickly disappeared after I was locked in my bathroom for about an hour. After trying to break down the door screaming for help and making as much noise as humanly possible finally someone heard me and came to my rescue, upon which a security guard stopped by to give a half -- apology and to admit that "this happens more than I'd think." How, in the sake of hospitality, can a hotel accept this standard of locking guests in their own bathrooms and thinking this is somewhat acceptable? Answer: It isn't! Even if they offered to comp my room (which they didn't) or provide some free amenities for my somewhat traumatizing stay at their hotel (which they didn't), this still wouldn't be acceptable. Had they offered me a free stay in the future at their hotel (which they didn't), I would not accept. I will never return to this hotel. Oh and one more thing- not only do you have to pay for internet ($12 a day), but it is WIRED. And the connection sucked! Welcome to the 21st century Boston Park Plaza, time for an upgrade.

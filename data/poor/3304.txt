Well to start we were to have a non-smoking room but it was far from that even with them vouching that it was a non-smoking it still stunk of smoke pretty bad. Shower water you had to run at least 45 minutes just to get water warm enough to get into. Told the front desk about it and she said that was strange because that only happens on the second level. Phone in room did not work so they replaced it with one with dial tone but it would not ring in room. No I would not reccomend this place unless you were homeless and it would be a small step up from that.

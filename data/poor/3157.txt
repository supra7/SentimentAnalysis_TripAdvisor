Not Impressed At All Beside the kinda cool lobby, this hotel was pretty bad. The rooms were tiny, old looking and worst of all the walls were VERY THIN. You could hear every door in the hallway open and close and could hear everything going on in the room next door. Absolutely nothing about this hotel was comfortable. Would never stay here again.

Very disappointed with the room quality given the expectations they build with the W chain of hotels. Noisy heating that wouldn't shut off so the room was very uncomfortable. Supplimental fees on room service were unwarranted. Decor was sterile. Bed skirts were ripped. Tables had crumbs on them and the floor needed a vaccuum. Needless to say I doubt I will stay at any W hotel in the future unless someone can convince me otherwise.

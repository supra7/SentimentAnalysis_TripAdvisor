My son got a sunburn (after 4 hours) and the staff freaked out and called the cops on me. I was threatened with eviction, harassed, told i would be charge with child neglect. I used to recommend this place, but now never again. The restaurants are too expensive. There are better places to go than this. Thanks Arizona Not so Grand my vacation was destroyed, because of the staff's unprofessional handling of the situation.

We were put in a dirty room facing the parking lot. The windows were so dirty we could not see out of them. The beds were HORRIBLE. My one son slept on the pull out couch, it was so uncomfortable and made so much noise when he turned it kept us up all night. My other son slept on a cot that was as hard as a rock. The pool was so crowded thre was no place to sit. We had to pay $10.00 for a chair just to sit on the beach. We were not allowed to bring cocktails on the beach. The only bar by the pool is very uninviting. The place does not have a good feeling at all. We took our 2 teenage boys, not a great place for them, nothing to do. We travel quit a bit and we would never return here. It's funny that the resort wanted us to purchase a unit yet they stuck us in a studio facing a parking lot, bad sell job. I read all the reviews and did a lot of research, I can't figure out why this place gets such great reviews.

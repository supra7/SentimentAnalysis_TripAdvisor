My wife and I stayed after our cruise at this hotel. Way out of the way but this is not the bad review. I fell out of the bathtub/shower because of several reasons, no anti-slip in tub, door does not shut safely, and the safety handle was already broken when I tried to stop my fall. The safety handle was only pushed in. But the topper is , I SUBMITTED an accident report on the morning of accident 09/26/2011. After many e mails from me to them, I have not received any e mail, letters, or a phone call. Have not received sorry, are you alright, nothing from them. In my opion unsafe and definately DO NOT care about Americans or this is just the way business is done by HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS BARCELONA, SPAIN

I booked my stay over a month in advance. We were traveling with my 15 year old son and our 17 year old exchange student, a girl. It was imperative that we have separate beds for the kids. I indicated this when I made the reservation. When we arrived to check in we were told they could not meet this request unless we booked an additional room (which we were not prepared to do). We then cancelled our reservation and were told that we would not be charged as they could not meet our needs. Wrong!! They charged our credit card anyway. I am still disputing the charges. Do not do business here.

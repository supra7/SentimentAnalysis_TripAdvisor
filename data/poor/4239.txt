First I got to Vegas really early, when I made the reservation I was advised that I should check to see if the room was ready and if it was they would check me in no problem. LIE Yes indeed they will check you in but if it is before noon they will charge you 25.00. I happen to work in the resort industry(this is NOT a resort) and I know it costs nothing to check people in early as the room is setting there empty anyway!!! Second, I paid for an upgraded (15.00 a night) view of the strip, what I got a view of the roof and duct work with several yellow lights shining in my window all night long. But, the thing that happened to make me write this review happened about 5 minutes ago ( I am stuck here until Saturday thrill thrill) I forgot my toothpaste, you can get a single use tube of toothpaste at a motel 6 or what ever they are called. Here not so much 4.00 for a single use tube of toothpaste that is not acceptable. Talk about highway robbery!!! Spend the extra money and stay someplace else, this place doesn't know the meaning of customer service it only knows the all mighty dollar. I didn't choose to stay here I am in town for a conference. Believe me the meeting planner will be hearing from me TONIGHT!!!!

Horrible service 1) no one EVER offered to help carry my bags to my room - the valet put them on a cart and just rolled it into the lobby (happend with 2 other people I went with too). And I had a lot to carry as I was there for a convention. 2) room service = lukewarm food 3) Valet lost my keys 4) upon checkout I told them the issues I encountered - the "supervisor" didn't even say sorry or thank you as I left. AWFUL

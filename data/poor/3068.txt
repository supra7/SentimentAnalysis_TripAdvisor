It's a hotel in a parking lot, no security, and one miserable assistant manager! I believe she was French or something, but even with speech barriers you can still use positive body language. It was like I was bothering her when I needed something and then wanted me to "give them a ten" on a servey. On a scale from one being the best and ten beoing the worst, then yes you get a ten. What appeared to be the owner or Hotel Manager was more interested in having his breakfast then standing at the desk asking people how their stay was. Not impressed at all.

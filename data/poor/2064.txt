This hotel has paper thin walls and you can hear evrything in the rooms next door and in the halls. I have stayed at 1 star motells that are more private. Also i called the hotel direct for reservations, and then they transfered me to the central call center. i knew where the hotel was because of the Weber Grill in the lobby. The reservation center said that they had several downtown lockations and could not be sure that the one that they were reserving for me was the one that I had asked for with out an adress.

We were stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. I really think Ascott should take the Citadines name off of this hotel until they get it in shape. The bathroom is very small. The furniture was old. The room does not provide compliment water like other Citadines hotel in Bangkok. It was no more than a flop house. Disgraceful that such a high end company would lend their name to such a dump. The worse case is they did not makeup the room until 7:00pm after several attempt to ask the house keeper or front desk. They said will do but never did until you asked for several times. Also the internet did not work after several attempt to call front desk to fix it. They said that they will do but never until you keep asking. This is not a hotel--it is an old guest house that has not been refurbished. It was dirty and smelled like a sewer. The walls had not been painted in years. It was just terrible.

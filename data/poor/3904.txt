This is not a hotel for honeymooner! This is not a hotel that values its customers nor does it have adequate facilities to accommodate its guest. My husband and I went here on our honey and were sorely disappointed to find out that this is a family resort. The hotel website advertises and their employees confirmed that there is one portion of the pool that is designated for children. When we arrived there were children though out the entire pool; the staff told us they do not enforce that rule. The atmosphere of the Sheraton is not conducive to a romantic getaway. The service we received during our stay was consistently subpar. We felt as though we were in inconveniences to the staff rather than the reason that they were there. The hotel is run inefficiently which led to lines everywhere we went. We ate at two of the hotel restaurants and both meals were less then delicious. However we had breakfast there every morning as part of our package and the pastries where amazing. During every breakfast though there was an infestation of birds flying around us and landing on unattended plates. The first day we went down to the pool there was no seating available. When we asked the staff about it we were told we would have to get up early in the morning to reserve seats at the pool. So for the rest of our honeymoon I got up at 6:30 to put towels on beach chairs so I would have a place to sit latter in the day. If you so decide to stay here and you would like to utilize one of the two pool side cabaas call months in advance to reserve it.

well, i still have my laptop. i received a discount for booking without booking dot com.and for writing a nice review. this is it. the room were very small for 38 euros. very noisy child ran and screamed all night long. the food was typical turkish food. the wifi was off and on so my long files did not get downloaded. in turkey you pay less they screw you more. the maid was lazy and did not clean my room every other day. and then never cleaned anything. merely towels... 38 euros is the cheapest around. and this room. well i would rather have a tent.. so when you come to stay. watch your stuff. and you you will get a cheap room for a cheap price and thank the lord you didnt pay more.. i am merely waiting for friend 6 days. screaming child is not optional.complaing and chaNging rooms is futile. they do not care as they already have your money. and soon you will be gone and another fool will come..

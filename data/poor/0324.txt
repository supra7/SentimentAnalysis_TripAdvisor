This is an overpriced, beyond its prime, rip-off hotel. It has the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in. The only desk in the room was a glass table at the foot of the bed. They put you in the rooms facing the street about 50 yards from the train tracks and the trains run all night. When I asked to be moved they said it would be a $50 upcharge for the "non-train" side. $30/night parking with valet only (parking lot is right in front) so you are stuck with tipping the valets every time you need your car. The carpet is old and musty and even stained in the hallways. The front desk personnel could care less if you are happy or not. I made my reservation the night before and they demanded to photocopy my drivers license in case my credit card was no good or if I "trashed the room"! The room was so hot (February) I had to open the window (street noise) to cool it off. You could not adjust the temperature down. The gas fireplace produces heat even when not in use. I asked to have it turned off and they said they would have to relight the pilot if they did.

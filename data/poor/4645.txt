I stayed in this hotel earlier this week. After I got home I realized i had bites all over me. I went to the doctor, and he told me that I had bed bug bites all over me. I politely called the hotel to make them aware of this so no further guest would get bitten. They replied by telling me I was an idiot and they're not responsible, and i should just keep my mouth shut.

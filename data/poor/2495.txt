We were among a dozen of other tourists, holding a confirmation (all booked thru different third parties) for April 30 - May 1, 2011 (during the Memphis Festival). At the check-in counter the hotel informed us as well as the a.m. other guests that they were overbooked and therefore could not give us rooms. Apparently, the hotel had not received the third party reservations for that date. We could understand it if it were one single provider as transmission problems can occur, but all parties booked thru different providers like Orbitz, hotels. com, priceline etc. Our conclusion is that the hotel gave away the rooms to walk-ins at the double rate due to the Festival and rejected all 'low-revenue bookings'. In addition, hotel staff was extremely arrogant. We arrived in the evening, exhausted and looking forward to a good night sleep, traveling with a toddler and a senior citizen. We were left on our own; the hotel provided no support in finding an alternative. All hotels were fully booked that weekend and we had to drive one hour to Jackson, where we were lucky to get the 2 last rooms in a room, arriving at 2 a.m.. It's good we had a car. There were other 'stranded' tourists without a car who spent US$ 30 for a cab just to get to the airport hotel as there was allegedly no shuttle bus to this 'airport' hotel.

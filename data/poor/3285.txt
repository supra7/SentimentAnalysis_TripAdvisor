My husband and I live in the Seattle area and we thought it would be fun to spend a night on the town and not have to drive home afterwards. We chose the Alexis because of its reputation-good enough for the Sultan of Brunei-and because of its proximity to Pike Place Market. We found our room to be large but rather empty and stark. Being somewhat cavernous, we found, as we were trying to go to sleep, that every noise from the hallway echoed loudly in the room. We heard constant noise from the elevator traffic just outside our door as well as every knock on every door . We thought that by 2 a.m. the noise from the street below and the hotel guests would subside but we were wrong. The Alexis seems to be quite the "Party Hotel" on Saturday night. Finally, at 3 a.m. we gave up all hope of getting any sleep when the man in the room next to ours got into a fight with his partner. We called the Front Desk and informed them that we were checking out and going home so that we might still get a few hours of sleep. We were appreciative that we were not charged for our stay, however, we were mostly disappointed that no one from the hotel management staff followed up with us the next day or EVER. After serveral weeks, I logged on to my "Kimpton In Touch" loyalty program and sent an email to their corporate office explaining our poor experience. Would you belive that we still haven't gotten a response! Kimpton "Cares" - what a joke. We will probably continue to boycott all Kimpton hotels for the rest of our lives!

The Arizona Biltmore was extremely disappointing. The rooms were old, probably last upgraded in the 1980s. The furniture was broken, and didn't look very different from a low-end motel. Second gripe was on the billing -- they charged me for valet parking ($24 per day) when I self parked ($8) with a mile long walk, charged me for minibar expenses which I never used, charged me fictitious expenses at the gift shop. After I called and got the charges revoked, they charged me $10 for delivering the revised bill. Go figure !!!! The hotel conceirge packed us off to a restaurant which was closed, so we had to return to the hotel for food. The menu listed the pasta as angel hair with fresh roma tomatoes, parsley, olive oil and garlic. It was the worst thing on earth -- boiled pasta with some sun dried tomatoes thrown in. The burger we ordered came without fries & without ketchup. Absolute yuk for $60. Never understood the exorbitant fees they tagged on for everything. All in all, the romantic weekend with 2 breakfasts & 1 lunch cost $1000. I would say it was worth a third of that. Yeah, the hotel grounds are pretty, but just about everything else sucked. Honestly, if I could give this place 0 stars I would.

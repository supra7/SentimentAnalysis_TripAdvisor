This place was a total dump. Considering what we paid, approx AUD250 per night and stayed 5 nights, it was very very disappointing. The elevator was from the middle ages which took about ten minutes to call up and it always went back up to the top floor even if you pushed the "down" button and the light said it was going down. The aircon unit was noisy as hell so didn't get any sleep as we had to have it on due to the warm weather. One night, we were out all day and night and came back to the room not made up. No fresh towels, nothing. The room was ridiculously small. So small, we couldn't open the closet door fully because the bedside table was in the way. And there wasn't enough room for two pieces of luggage. That's how small it was. It felt like Harry Potter's room under the stairs. The porter and concierge were helpful enough but this place is beyond redemption. Also, it had a stale, funky, musky smell that made you nauseous evertime you walked in. Overall, just not worth the money. Find somewhere else.

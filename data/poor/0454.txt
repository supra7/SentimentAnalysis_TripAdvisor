So I read all the reviews on this website and felt a little nervous about booking a room at the Seattle Pacific Hotel, but the price for the location was unbeatable, and I thought "it can't really be that shady, how they would still be in business"? Well, I was wrong. I went ahead and booked a room through a travel website that explicitly stated there would be no charges before check-in. A week later I'm looking at my credit card activity online, and sure enough, the hotel already billed me the cost of my stay. I called the hotel, politely asking whether they had possibly made a mistake and billed me in advance. The gentleman on the other line raised his voice at me, saying they never charge people in advance, it's the travel website's fault, I need to contact them. I replied that my credit card activity clearly stated that the charge came from the Seattle Pacific Hotel, that there was no way the hotel website could bill me in the hotel's name, and whether he could please check on this. He responded even more rudely that he already told me they never bill anyone before check-in, he would charge my credit card when I arrived regardless, and that he couldn't help me. Not knowing what else to do, and not wanting to pay twice, I contacted the helpdesk of the travel website to clear it up. A week later, finally, the money has been credited back to my account, and I've booked a room somewhere else. If you're like me and think bad things tend to happen to other peple rather than yourself, think again before you book a room at this hotel -- or they might just scam you out of your money. I can't believe people like this stay in business!

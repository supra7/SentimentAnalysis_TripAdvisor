Avoid the Clift Hotel The Clift Hotel is the worst place I have stayed in San Francisco. - Arrive after 8pm and stand in line to get questioned by the doorman/bouncer. The trendy restaurant and bar flow over to the Hotel Lobby so I understand why; but not cool after finishing a day of meetings. Do not stay here unless you are here to party and do not feel can make it across the street to any of the nearby hotels.- Washroom was super small. The toilet is up against the mirror and drains do not work well.- Want to watch a little TV before bed? Bring your binoculars for the in-room 19inch tube tv!Fancy soap, nice sheets, paper thin walls; so do expect to hear what you neighbors are up to.

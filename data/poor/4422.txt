We were given an "upgrade", for an extra $50 bucks a night, what a joke. The bed was horrible. You could feel the metal in the bed, Motel 6 has better beds than the Stratosphere. Everytime the air kicked on there was a big boom in the system. Not a problem unless you are trying to sleep. We were given a disabled room, even though we aren't, every time we showered the floor flooded, the water was only warm twice during a two week stay. It took forever to check in and check out. The hotel staff as a whole could care less. One night there was a huge pile of dog poop in the elevator, we told someone, they acted misput that we told them. Our daughter could not get in the hot tub even though we were with her. Hotel guests can only go up in the tower for free between the hours of 10 am to 2 pm, any other time it is $7. What a joke! The comps program is a joke! The Stratosphere is at the very end of the strip, I would rather stay off strip than stay there again. As a whole I was disappointed. I will never stay there again nor recommend it to anyone.

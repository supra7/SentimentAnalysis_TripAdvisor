My family of 5 stayed at this motel as we had an early morning flight out of SeaTac. We discovered that this is an old run down motel with no elevators, decor from the 70's, the smell of stale tobacco everywhere and by far the loudest air conditioning unit I have ever come across. On check in and check out I was made to wait while the lone staff member tried to work out the person in front's problems. Pay the extra $15-$30 dollars and stay elsewhere.

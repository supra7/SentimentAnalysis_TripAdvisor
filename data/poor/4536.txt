For being such a "High Class" place, we experienced very sloppy service. When we arrived we noticed that are sheets had stains on them. We requested the linens be changed. When we came back from dinner around 9pm they still had not changed the linens. Also, for more than 24hrs there was a dirty room service cart outside our room along with dirty towels in the hall a few rooms down. I would not stay at this hotel again.

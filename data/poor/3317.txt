When you check the hotel's website, it seems ok. If you stay for a night you will just want to sue them... The stuff doesn't even speak English. Tiny, awful, dirty rooms. No wi-fi in room although they said it was provided. Old torn apart towels. I wasn't brave enough to try their hamam. If this is a 4 star hotel, I'm Marilynn Monroe...

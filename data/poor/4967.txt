I really hate to bash a small business, but, these 2 hotels are so poorly run, I can't believe that you can't find better for your money in Istanbul. Really pretty much **everything** was wrong with these hotels. The water, electricity went on and off. My room wasn't clean. The elevator's floors didn't map to the hotel floors. There was no room service at all while I was there. It really was a depressing place. They also wanted to put me on the 6th floor which had no elevator to it and felt like a fire trap. While I was in the lobby, people kept coming downstairs to the front desk with complaint after complaint. Stay away from the Hatay (and Antioch!!!) unless you are looking for something that is funky and more like a youth hostel (nothing against youth hostels but I'm just past the age of roughing it to that extent).

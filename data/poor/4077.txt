I found a bargain deal on this hotel on Expedia (?) and from the reviews I had read on here (Tripadvisor) I wasnt expecting very much for my money. The free wireless and my own bathroom where the main reasons I had booked here. My room was large, as was the bathroom. On the ninth floor of the building. Yes, the furnishings were bland and dated, but that was okay with me. What really bugged me though was the noise; the constant noise. On the first night I just assumed that it was the wind and that I heard it more because I was on the top floor  and thought nothing more of it. I am a light sleeper at the best of times and usually sleep wearing earplugs. I had to keep the earplugs in whenever I was in my room and not watching television. The noise drove me insane. I dont know what it was  probably an old fashioned antiquated ventilation system. The noise really threatened to ruin my time there. On another note, the maid took off with one of my tshirts and some of my underwear  and didnt return them. Would I stay here again? Perhaps but only for less than 50 a night.

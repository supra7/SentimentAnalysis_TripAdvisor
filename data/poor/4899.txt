The reason we picked this hotel was the indoor waterpark and the kids were so excited about the bunkbeds, big mistake!!!! The waterpark was not what we expected and the rooms certainly weren't either. Nothing was as it was described on their website and the rooms were way too expensive for what we got. The bunkbeds were awful!!! Kids deserve to be comfortable too, the beds were as hard as a rock! My daughter got up during the night and tried sleeping in the floor. Finally, around 12:00 I went down to the front desk and got another room so we could all sleep comfortably. As soon as we got up, we demanded cancelation on our rooms and we went to another hotel and was able to get a good nights sleep. Please, don't waste your money, if you want an indoor waterpark, go to Grand country inn. It might not have the fanciest rooms, but the waterpark is much nicer and the rooms are comfortable and clean.

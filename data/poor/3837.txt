Oh god where do i start, the cockroaches, extreamly dirty carpets, dirty pool, or other condemned building on property. This resort it for the cheap travellers that dont want to spend the extra money for a decent place. We booked for 2 nights while waiting for another resort. We didnt even stay the 2nd night because it was so discusting. Im not a picky person while travelling but this place is extreme. While talking with few locals i was told that the owners plans are to let the resort get into such a decreped state to justify tearing the resort down. Looks like they are 2/3 there.

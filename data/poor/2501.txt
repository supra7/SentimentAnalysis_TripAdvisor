I had to stay at this hotel a couple days ago. I didn't use any of the services really, so I can't tell you about them. The only things I used where the TV, and ate breakfast there. The breakfast was fine, but the TV stations didn't come in very well, most of them were fuzzy. Really I don't care much about that, the thing that sucked were all the planes. I understand that it is an airport hotel, but it is located next to the runway. What this means is that about 10:30 PM all the planes start landing for FedEx, this goes on for about an hour or an hour and a half, constantly. Then it stops. At about three in the morning the planes start taking off. This lasted until I had to get up at 4:20 AM. It starts by kind of sounding like someone is using a vacuum in the room next to you, and then ends with a big roar, and your bed shaking. There would be a new plane at least every five minutes to make sure that you don't get any sleep. If your plan is to get some sleep while at the hotel, this is not the one for you. The rest of the hotel seemed fine, but when I go to a hotel, I want to be able to sleep, if I can't do that, it has failed me.

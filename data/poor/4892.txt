I stayed here one night with my two children during Spring Break. We arrived at check in time (4:00) to utter chaos! After waiting 30 minutes in the crowded lobby we were told that they didn't have clean rooms available. We waited four hours to get into a room. The hotel staff didn't offer any sort of comp for our wait and seemed to blame us for the issue. The rooms are outdated, the bed linens smelled like grease - they must have been washed with linens from the restaurant, and the bathtub wasn't clean. The water park is nice, but we have stayed at Grand Country is the past and there aren't many differences between the two. I would recommend buying a day pass for the water park and staying at a better hotel.

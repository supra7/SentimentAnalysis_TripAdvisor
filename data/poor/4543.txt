Room wasn't clean when we arrived. The ice bucket had smelly stale water in it from previous tenant. Poor job on housekeeping. The couch had stains on it. The room was not very comfortable, it was just tolerable. Tried to get the A/C going with no luck. The room was outdated and overrated. We ordered room service, think dessert would be quality... we were wrong...Horrible Bland food and you can only get ICE from the Room Service department. Called front desk, no answer. Customer service did not exist. We have decided never EVER to stay here again. Worst Hotel I've been to in a long time. I tried to sort out all the problems with the front desk the next morning, asked for Manager...was told there was not manager on grounds and I would get a personal phone call from them. Well its been a week and no phone call.

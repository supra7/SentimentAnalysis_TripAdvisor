I hated this hotel. It's located on the shadier part of Geary Street. The room was very worn and smelled. I was on the 4th floor and about 5 feet from my window was a parking lot and outside my door was the business center. The walls are terribly thin! I couldn't sleep there... either I heard people outside my room and it sounded like they were in my room or the cars in the parking lot were moving around. I don't know, I'm usually an easy going person, sleeps everywhere and never has an issue... but I was truly unhappy at the hotel Diva.

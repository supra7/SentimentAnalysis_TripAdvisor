I booked this place throw the tripadvisor venere.com, received the booking confirmation to e-mail. 3 months before i went to Hong Kong. The day i went to Hong Kong, first need to look this place almost 30 minutes, was so hard to find and when i arrived, they said: "we are full and your booking does not account here, you can't get the room". Since it was saturday evening and i was alone with big baggage, looking for other places was very tiresome, because all places were full, finally i found one place, but need to pay 5 times more for night. This place is very unreliable, never can't sure if your booking will work.

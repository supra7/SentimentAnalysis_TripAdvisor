My fianc and I are extremely disappointed in this hotel. First of all, we went the same weekend as a Dallas Cowboy football game and were surprised that it was not staffed properly for that weekend. There was a very long wait to check-in to our room, and the front desk was very crowded and disorganized. The bar was a crazy mess, completely disorganized and dysfunctional there was a 20 minute wait for drink, we did take into mind that it was a game weekend but still no excuse. Second, when we called the hotel several weeks prior to check-in, the hotel staff told us that they had a free shuttle to and from Texas Stadium (which is one of the reason why we booked). When we got to the hotel they alerted us that it would be $12 per person for the shuttle to and from the stadium (cheaper to take a cab). To top it off, there was construction going on at the hotel and we woke up in the morning to the sounds of hammering and drills. With no warning!! And most importantly, on the day that we left the hotel, we had the hotel bell desk hold our luggage so that we could get some breakfast before heading to the airport. When we got back to the hotel to get our luggage, the staff had sent our luggage with someone else to the airport. Talk about a shocker, I got so nervous thinking we would never see our suitcase with the contents again. However, they retuned the luggage after about 30 minutes. But with no remorse, not even a simply sorry, our mistake! The shuttle driver that drove us to the airport was more apologetic then the manager who told us about our missing luggage. Too bad, the hotel itself was nice enough for us to stay again but this experience and the hotel staff and the way they function completely ruined it for us.

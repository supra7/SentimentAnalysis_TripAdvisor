At $293 a night this is one of the worst hotels I have experienced. I booked a non-smoking, quiet room in July, but upon arrival in November was sent to a smoking room. When I complained, I was given a room overlooking a busy city street. My third move got me into the room I had requested. Unfortunately, access to the room was from a blockhouse in the parking garage, not from the main lobby. Things were no better as the week wore on: elevators were extremely slow, no thermastat in room so a forced hot air system either broiled you to death or forced you to turn it off and freeze to death, sheets were as scratchy as sandpaper, and drains were sluggish. While security in the hotel was good, our cab was once smacked by a beer bottle as we drove south to the McCormack Convention Center. This certainly wan't the hotel's fault, but it certainly contributed to our overall dissatisfaction. This hotel should be downgraded to a Motel 6 grade facility and re-priced accordingly.

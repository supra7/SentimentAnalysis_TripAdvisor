Stayed here and want to save you the trouble of a terrible stay. Once they screwed up our reservation, they choose to save face and blame us for the mistake. As a result, I had to sleep on the floor. Stay away from this place. There is no customer service. Unless you get lucky, you will hate your stay here. I won't even get into the uncleanliness and discusting bathrooms.

I know how quick people are to blame lost items on sticky fingered maids, but when it comes my personal items I am like a hawk. I left a diamond ring on the counter when I went for a swim, came back and was surprised to find the room (somewhat) clean, and my ring nowhere to be found. Needless to say I was treated like chicken little when I tried to get it back, and now I'm sure it's gone for good. I'd hate to point fingers, but the sheraton has had many incidents of theft and now I see why. Wifi was $12.00, valet parking was $21, self parking was $7 and by the end of the trip I spent more money on my hotel than on my vacation! They will nickel and dime you from the start, so be prepared! The elevators were clogged all day with teenagers here for a convention and when I did manage to cram myself into the screeching box of death they made me nauseous and dizzy for hours, I eventually gave up and ended up taking 14 flights of stairs to and from my room just to avoid the chaos of the kids and the macabre amusement park ride that was the elevator system. All in all it wasn't worth the money, I'm missing a diamond ring, and my thighs are burning. Pick a better hotel! DO NOT RECOMMEND!

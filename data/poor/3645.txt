The Russian-looking checkin staff was absolutely rude and unfriendly upon our checkin. She charged my girl friend's credit card 250usd for car park when we do NOT even had one without informing us!!! A day later we got to know through the SMS alert from the bank. We spoke to the so called front office manager but he did not show any sense of empathy nor did he apologize for the inconvenience they put us through.

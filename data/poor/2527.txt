Marseilles Hotel -- awful! Whatever you do, DO NOT go to the Marseilles Hotel on Collins  17th street! My wife  I went to the South Beach hotel on November 17, 2004  the place was awful! The bed was horrible, the staff very unfriendly, and the pool was also dirty. It looked nothing like the pictures on the hotel's website.  But the worst thing occurred on our 2nd day at the hotel. At 6:30am, there was drilling on the roof of the hotel. Yes, DRILLING! The manager said the construction crew had to do emergency repair work. I understand these things happen. But we had no warning whatsoever from management. We asked the hotel if they could stop the drilling until later in the morning  whether the work would be completed that day. No assurances. We really felt that management didn't care. In fact the manager, through intermediaries, said we were free to leave. We were disgusted. So we packed up  left that morning. Luckily we found a charming  QUIET hotel on 12th  Collins called the Hotel Impala. We had a lovely time there.

yuck I came to Hawaii with a Girl Scout trip and we stayed one night at this hotel. The rooms are very small, smell wierd, and were dirty. Our toilet didn't even work. After over 20 hours of traveling with the time change, the last thing we wanted to deal with, was bugs in our room, and toilets that didn't work. The next morning we went to the Pacific Beach Hotel which was a few blocks down.I HIGHLY reccomend that hotel, we had no problems at all and the staff was very friendly

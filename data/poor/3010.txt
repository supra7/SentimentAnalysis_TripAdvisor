Never again will I fall sucker to the words "Boutique," "Classic" or "Historic." These are synonyms for decrepit and cramped. Yes, this hotel is 70 years old. It looks it. The decor hasn't changed a bit. I was never informed on Expedia that the restaurant would be out of commission during my stay or that the rooms are centrally heated and that there are NO temperature controls and the windows do NOT open. I was given a voucher for a restaurant two blocks away (the kitchen serves the hotel). I showed up for an early breakfast, but was told the restaurant wouldn't open until 7AM. When I returned to the lobby and explained I was hoping to get some breakfast, a local character in t-shirt, sock, sandals and a cigar stub offered to walk me to his favorite place. The next night I was awaked at midnight by incredibly loud music (I was on the third floor). I went downstairs to complain; the on-duty manager suggested I move to another floor. When I asked him why he wouldn't simply tell the live band in the hotel bar to stop playing, he shrugged his shoulders. And when I asked if there had been any other complaints, he said "Not since 11PM." The decor of the room is pathetic. No chair, other than a typical uncomfortable desk chair. One wastebasket (in the bathroom). Tiny, old-fixtured bathroom. Uncomfortable pillows. Thin towels. Now I understand why, when I registered, I was asked to check a box which stated that leaving a day early would cost me $50!

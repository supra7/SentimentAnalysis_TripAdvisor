I stayed in September 2011 for 4 nights.The hotel is not in the centre of the city and a 20 minute walk from the wrong metro station, a 10 minute walk from the right one and a couple of tram stops away from the train station - which is probably ok if you're not single and you got a bit of a hefty suitcase to carry because you're on an 11 day Berlin-Paris trip. This hotel believes in the concept of 'you don't ask - you don't get'. Which is ok, but when you ask for a tray with tea / coffee and a kettle, it would be great if the dirty cups were taken out of the room during service the next morning. It's one of those weird hotels where the 3rd floor is on the 3rd floor of the lift and then you have to walk down a flight of narrow stairs - remember the don't ask don't get thing? - well, there are no offers to help you carry your bag to your room, either. I am not a princess (although I am partial to being a drama queen from time to time) and I do like a firm bed - I actually left the hotel with a backache, and I wrote a letter to the Manager while I was there - I asked and I didn't get, so I guess it makes no difference either way. Service with a smile, even just a little one? No. Nope - not going back.

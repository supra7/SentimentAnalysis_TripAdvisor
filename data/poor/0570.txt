Never again I switched room within 5 minutes of walking in due to continuous running toilet. There's no key to the safe in the second room and I requested one immediately, and again the following day. Nothing ever came during my 5 days there. Reason: maintenance team wasn't available. Crackers and gums on carpet. There was 1 afternoon when we returned after being gone for the morning and found no linens, no towels in the room (door was locked and no cleaning crew in sight). My friend got locked out of her room one nite because her key failed to work and the hotel couldn't get it opened either. She and her husband got another room for the nite (no pyjamas, no toiletries). At least 3 parties complained about their bills while I waited in line to complain.Printer/copier in business center didn't work. Food was bad.Don't stay there!

We were in hotel hell. Checked in on Thursday night and checked out Friday morning. We had prepaid for an entire week, non-refundable, and just checked it off to experience.We didn't even take our clothes off at bedtime. Your feet would stick to the carpet from filth, running streams of rust down the walls. Had no water for 2 hours. It smelled terrible. It was the kind of place people would rent by the "hour". Decent? Not in this liftime. Beds looked like and felt like they had come out of some charity organization. Outside is deceiving, their website is deceiving. DON"T BELIEVE IT. Garden view was a dirt field with a walkway through it. Looked like cattle had been graving in it.

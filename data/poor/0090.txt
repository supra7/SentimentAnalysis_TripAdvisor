After making reservations I had to cancel due to change of trip plans. I called the property, cancelled and they said that would be fine. One month later my credit card has a bill for onenight's stay. After calling them back and telling them of their error, they refused to credit may card. Total refusal to cooperate even though it was their error. Steve in Charlottesville, VA

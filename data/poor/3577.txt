Doesn't worth the price at all!!! I stayed three nights at the Kabuki Hotel. The room is not what you would expect for a 270$ / night. The windows were old and didn't close properly so the room was noisy. The balcony was shared with all the floor and even they have a sticky on the window saying that was safe to left the window open.The first day they began to clean the room but forgot to finish it. They left the wet and dirty towels over the bed, and did'nt clean the room. I also asked a hight floor with views three months before my arrival (to avoid street noises) and all I've got was a second floor room.I payed a supplement to have citi views and therefore I was expecting a nice room in the tower but all i've got was the second floor with views to a secondary street.I found a lot of Motels, even in in San Francisco, with better rooms, better services and for less than a 1/3 of the price.

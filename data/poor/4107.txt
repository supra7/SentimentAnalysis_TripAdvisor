Starting with a front desk clerk named Alyce who has not been taught how to deal with an irate guest and chooses to give you the "talk to the hand" sign when she herself is not happy AND will correct you when you mispronounce her name .. to rooms that had no functioning heaters, life endangering situations (lightbulbs hanging from lamps by wires), mold in showers, peeling wall paper .. to staff deciding to do a "deep clean" of a room mid-stay (completely turning the room upside down without security overseeing personal items) .. to checking out with Barbara taking 30 minutes AND forcing you to take cash when, in fact, you weren't entitled to it (of course, they charge you for it later). HORRIBLE!!!! The ONLY bright spot is Night Manager, Carlos Gonzalez Jr. He went over and above in an attempt to rectify the situations my guest and I encountered. He was also the ONLY one to be appropriately embarrassed by conditions! (My photos of rooms 1202 and 1203.)

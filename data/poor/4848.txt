Old hotel, superficial remodeling of public areas that are dark and uncomfortable, small room, less than 200 sqft, tiny bathroom with original 1930's fixtures, no counter space, toilet tank cover cracked and patched, cracked paint on original doors, dim bedside lamps, wobbly elevators. Alltogether a bad experience, certainly not worth the price.

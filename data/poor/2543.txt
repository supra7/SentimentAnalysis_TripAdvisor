We visited the spa for a quick trip while we were in California and stayed here unfortunately!! The accommodations were margionally passable but the staff was very unpleasant and rude. When we expressed our concerns, Doug the manager, was mildly concerned and was more interested in how busy he was to help. We will not be back !!

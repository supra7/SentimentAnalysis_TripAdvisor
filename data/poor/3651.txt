Management is horrible I just came back from a week long stay at this hotel. First thing we noticed when we checked in to the room was a letter from the management stating that there were renovations going on and that although they are sorry for the inconvenience, they are important. UH, hello! You mean more important than your paying guests? And no where does the website mention this. You would think that a so-called 5 star hotel would have enough decency to tell their guests BEFORE they make reservations that they are still under renovations. And during my week stay, no matter where you went, beach or poolside or even my room, you could hear the contstruction. And don;t bother complaining to management because they will offer no solutions. The time I called I was told it would continue until 5pm. This was happening rioght above my room. And the manager (Paul) just said that it would be pointless to move because they move alot around the hotel. Say what? You mean you can runa hotel but you can't manage your renovations? Completely [--] clueless management. Yeah the beach is pretty there. The staff is nice. The rooms are renovated. BUT, internet is 15 bucks per day. Room service is 15 bucks for deliver plus 17% gratuity. Other than Plumeria buffet, the food stinks. And you are about 20-30 mins from Waikiki or shoudl I say civilization. In my opinion they are a bunch of theives for not advising guests before they reserve or arrive that they are under construction.Go stay at the Halekulani imo. At least they warn you before you reserve and it's one hell of a classy place right smack in Waikiki.

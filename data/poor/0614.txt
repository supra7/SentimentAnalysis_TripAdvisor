The location is great, it is quiet and the staff were very nice, but the room was extremely disappointing from the spiders (I think, they were small and located on wall behind mattress), the stains and poorly patched holes in the wall by the beds, the chipped paint on all door frames, the stained carpet, and the dirt in the crevice behind the bathroom door. We spent 20 minutes discussing whether we were going to stay and ONLY the fact that it was 11:30pm when we arrived swayed us. Even my laid back daughter who never complains about anything sat and looked around asking if it was a "safe" room to stay in and it seemed like it had not been cleaned in a while. We could not believe the "quality" for the high price we paid.

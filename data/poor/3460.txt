Casaboring/ dirty We stayed at the Casablanca for a week, during which we were married. From our experience, that's all we can give. We were in contact with the manager for a long time, who assured us that they would help arrange transport from JFK to the hotel, it didn't happen, despite a call before we left home. Never mind, but it was our wedding/honeymoon. I think that's just wrong. Any apology? No. Anyway, its easy enough to get a cab. We arrive at the Casablancla and are warmly met. The staff are great, when you are there. We were shown to our room. It was big enough, but nothing like what you'd expect from a suite in NYC, at $ 400/night. A light didn't work, but that was sorted eventually. It definitely wasn't immaculately clean, that's a fact! It also was VERY noisy! There is major building going on just across the street, and that was loud, as was the constant traffic noise.The hotel gave us the perfect venue to be married, and we were, and that, and the friendly staff, for us, is its only redeeming feature. And for that, we are grateful, but we paid for that, remember. On our wedding day, at least three people, two from Europe and one from USA, tried to buy champagne to send to us, only to be told there's already a few bottles on order. Did we see any of them? No, we didn't. Overall, the Casablanca was full of, if you excuse me, of elderly peole, happy to be around Times Sq.The 'free' food, you get also elswhere for cheaper.The Casablanca, massively overpriced, and over-rated.

Beware of Room 007 ~ they make it sound special ~ but it really is a glorified "Closet" right outside the lower level entrance to the elevator ( i mean- right on the otherside of our door) the was no privacy , the bed was a foam futon - barley big enough for one person to sleep in let alone two. Right upon check-in I asked for another room & that request was swiftly denied ( they said the hotel was full- but there were people checking out) The bathroom was cut -up into funny angles (as part of the closet behind the receptionists desk) the following morning (after getting a terrible nights sleep) i asked for a different room & was denied any type of new accommodation. I informed the desk I was checking out. Then they offered a new room- after we wait 1 more night- I refused ; & they then waived our wifi-minibar fees & gave us no receipt for check out. we called expedia immeadiately - we could not get through to the manager- they would not answer the call from the states, after 10 days, i got through finaly, expedia told us the manager was unwilling to waive the hotel charges for the two days we did not stay there!! we got burned for $450.00 I may not use expedia again ~ and I recommend no one trust the hotel ai du principi hotel in venice, it.

This is an extremely expensive hotel with poor service and tiny rooms. The staff is completely disinterested. There was one overwhelmed person at the concierge desk. If you call the concierge desk you get voice mail.No offer to call you back. Problems with internet access? You call for help and get an 800 number somewhere else.The rooms were tiny with disgusting bathrooms. I am shocked that people would pay this amount of money to stay at this hotel. Fortunately we had a wonderful weekend in NY and only in the hotel for a short time.

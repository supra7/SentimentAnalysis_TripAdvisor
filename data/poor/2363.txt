We planned our wedding at Makena Point, which is managed by the resort. We did not stay at the resort, so I can't offer any opinions on the actual hotel. However, planning our wedding was an absolute nightmare. Leo, our wedding planner, had no idea what she was doing. We showed up for our rehearsal and she acted like she didn't know why we were there (her greeting was "can I help you?") and then disappeared to take a phone call! We couldn't get price quote from her until the week before we left for Hawaii (after asking for months), and she "lost" or didn't receive 5 of my voice mails and emails. We had originally planned to have our reception at the resort as well, but ended up cancelling it one week before the wedding (when we finally got the price estimate). Overall a stressful and frustrating experience.

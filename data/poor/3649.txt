Experience : stay was just ok. Did not provide the comfort and good feeling a business traveller seeks. The room is small, lack of fresh air / ventilation. The lift waiting time is huge - i stayed on 31st floor and took considerable time to go up/down. Surprised that 2 lifts are believed to suffice the volume of traffic in normal times. Breakfast was of low quality. The orange juice was not availble on many days; the options of items are limited by any standard; and you are expected to eat in themocol plates with plastic cutlery ! a big turnoff. Never have i eaten this way in any hotel i have traveled to around the world. Staff was ok including the manager - but not hospitable or friendly enough to resolve the missing document issue at the time of check out. Wouldn't stay again there.

Where do I begin....ok upon arrival at the W new york on lexington ave. i pulled up in front of the hotel got out my car and let the valet guy know we were checking in, he the took my keys and my wife and i proceeded into the hotel. after checking in i realize that i forgot a bag in my car so i ran outside to see if my car was still there ....it wasnt . so i ask the valet guy how can i get my bag out of my car he said "oh thats no problem" he walks me to the corner and points to a parking lot a block and ahalf away. if your from ny you know how long ny city blocks are. so i walk to the parking lot only to be told that my car was in a diffrent lot two blocks away. i get to that lot and my car is not there..the attendant at this lot was very nice and told me exactly where my car was. so i finally got my bag at the third parking lot. upon returning the valet guy looked at me and turned his head as if he never saw me in his life..only reason i didnt say anything is because i had a dinner reservation and was in a rush. when i got to my room "the spectacular room" i was in shock at how small it was. the room was very poorly light and stuffy. early the next mourning at about 5:30 am a mouse runs in the room my wife jumps on the bed and so did i. i get on the phone and let the front desk know whats going on they said there sending someone right up five minuetes later a hotel staff comes to the room with fresh towels. i said there a mouse in the room we dont need towels. the hotel staff the gets on her radio and lets the know again tha there is a mouse in the room. she walks out and NOBODY SHOWED UP. to make a long story short we packed our things and checked out. what supprised me during check out is that the hotel manager did not looked surprised at all. it must happen pretty often. i will never stay at another W hotel again. they have a lot of nerve charging over $400 per night. what a valentines day!?!?!?

This hotel is not at all as it appears from their website. They claim to have a lot of things that real hotels have like iron board, hairdryer, breakfast and internet. We had none of these. The room was old and worn out. The towels and sheets had spots on them. The bath had a severe fungus attack, which triggered my asthma. The balcony door was coming apart, and could hartly be poened. When asking about the complementary internet, since my laptop didn't pick up any network, I was told that since Hollywood is in a valley, the internet sometimes does not work, and that he thought that my laptop was the problem. Next morning the wi-fi was running but I had to pay additional $10 to get online. Not unusual but you should not advertise complementary internet. The complementary continental breakfast, was the biggest joke. They offered free coffee and tea, and a small pastry in a plastic bag. Nothing continental about that. The really nice looking garden (from the website pictures) and the pool area had empty beer bottles scattered around. The pool was filled with debris, and the parking garage was filled with garbage too. It put a dark shade on our visit to LA, and we couln't wait to get out of there. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

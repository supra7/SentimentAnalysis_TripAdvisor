The 'Beach View' rooms are not beach View. The Management is friendly but does absolutely nothing about addressing issues. They have a check in scam - most flights arrive in the mornign, and although they have many vacant rooms, they insist that you wait by the pool and possibly have lunch to pass the time. The restaurant is very sub standard. The rooms are smelly. The furniture is clean but 60's inspired (and I use the term inspired loosly). The Pool tiles were cracked. The only plus was the beach staff who were very polite and helpful. I would not return and do not recommend this overated, overpriced, poorly run excuse for a hotel.

I was booked in this hotel because of my conference, it was hellish from the very start as you come to the entrance you will immediately experience a vail of dread as you view the dirty and cheap fixtures outside that look like they have never been cleaned. As you enter the hotel you will experience the longest check in time in the history of man as 2 check in people attempt to check a line 20 waiting guest. Then you walk past a sea of smoke to your elevator bank if you requested a non smoking rm forget about it by the time you leave this hotel everything you own will smell like a camel cigarette. The rooms define the word shabby. If you are hoping to go the gyn be aware they charge $50 to use the gym all in the experience sucked

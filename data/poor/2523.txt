Overpriced, smelly, noisy and rude My boyfriend and I stayed over the memorial day weekend - as such this hotel was extremely overpriced. The hotel stunk, the food was terrible, the people there were extremely rude. There were people let into the hotel who didn't have a room who ran up and down the hallways the whole night, yelling and screaming. We called reception to advise them of the situation, but nothing was done about it. It was a terrible experience - the worst place I've stayed at to date - even backpacking hostels are better! Trust me - do NOT come here.

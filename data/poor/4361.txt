The hotel was musty smelling and so was our room.They need to remodel the rooms and the entire hotel. This hotel was offered as a SouthWestTravel Package. I believe someone in the marketing area needs to spend a night at these hotels before they offer them in these packages. This package was not cheap. The rooms were old and run down.

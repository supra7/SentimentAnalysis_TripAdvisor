We attended a family wedding at the Grand Wailea recently and it was an incredible disappointment! Weeks would go by without a return phone call from our wedding coordinator. Our emails were ignored. NO customer service at all. When we requested that Gail, the Director of Weddings contact us, we were told she was off island and could not be reached. No one, including Mr. Bailey, the Resort Manager, ever returned our phone calls. Debbie, the "Senior Catering Manager" coordinated the wedding day and reception. She was disorganized and emotionally stressed from day one. After the ceremony, the guests were invited to the cocktail hour for appetizers and drinks. The beautiful Boterro Bar was empty! The coordinator completely forgot to set up the cocktail reception! No dcor, no staff to attend to the guests for over an hour! If you are planning a special event or a once in a lifetime wedding, go to the Four Seasons or another 5 star resort in Wailea.

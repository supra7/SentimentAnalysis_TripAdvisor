You are greeted with a 1 hour wait in the check in line. I had to stand in it twice. We were on a romantic getaway and had booked a room with a king bed. When I finally make it through the line I find out they don't have any more kings, so they put us in a 2 queen room. This was about 5pm. I of course objected, but they assured me they would put us in a king room as soon as 1 became available, for sure by noon tomorrow. I went down and stood in the line again at noon and guess what, no kings, but 1 will surely be available by three. Then it was 6, then it was 9. They never called like they said they would, and they actually expected me to sit around the room and wait for them to call. Unbelievable. The rooms were small and plain. Halls were dirty. Parking garage was scary. We checked out the next morning and got a beautiful room at the Paris for $20 more than the rate at the Scabosphere., I was given a fantastic room and checked in in 2 minutes. I had prepaid through Expedia. The Scabosphere wouldn't refund what we had paid for the 3rd night that we had already checked out. They said it was up to Expedia to do that. I called Expedia when I got back home, and they said they have to ask the hotel if they will refund the unused night. I'm still waiting for a refund that will never come. Expedia never called back either. No more Expedia travel/hotel packages for us. We saved our romantic getaway by ditching the Scabosphere and going to the Paris for a fabulous last day. .

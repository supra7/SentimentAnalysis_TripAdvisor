Unfortunately our stay was not what we expected. We checked into our room to see our ocean view room that overlooked the highway. So we woke up every morning to the sounds of the highway. We also woke to the sounds of the cleaning carts above our heads, therefore we were up and out every morning by 8:00A.M.. My first shower was taken with tiny ants crawling around the tub area. After a few days they seemed to disappear. Cleanliness around the hotel was not that impressive. Trash barrels needed to be emptied and room service trays needed to be removed. For our entire stay we did not have a deadbolt on our door because it was broken much like our balcony door, It seemed like the furniture in the room had been updated but the remainder of the hotel was not. The pool area has been updated but it was always overcrowded. The non-smoking policy did not seem to be enforced by the pool area. Cigarette butts and empty plastic cups seemed like a regular occurnce during our stay. I have stayed at many other Hyatts including the Hyatt in Kauai which was absolutely beautiful. I just couldn't believe the difference between the two hotels. I would definately go back to the Hyatt in Kauai but never again to the Hyatt in Maui.

I made reservation online (Expedia). Actually I was attracked by VERY LOW RATES, and good reviews ( I think staff is writing reviews by thenselves), I reached at hotel by 2:45 pm, and ask Demetri (Manager) for check in. He replied that check in time is 3 pm, before 3, I have to pay for 1 extra night (REALLY?????), He took my Credit Card and charged me $33.89 for NOTHING :( Later I asked to have Micro wave and fridge in the room, and Manager told me that In order to get Micro wave and Fridge I have to pay $15 extra for each night. My family was very upset and they were mad at me, because I was the one who had chosen the RED ROOF KISSIMMEE for our family vocation. I requested if they can cancel my reservation (because I cannot pay more), they informed me that even if I cancel my reservation, they wont refund me anything. it was non refundable reservation made by Expedia. Later I contacted Expedia, but they told me that Expedia reservations are refundable. ( Shame on you Mr Manager) I stayed there for a week and paid $135 more then the amount I paid online ( EXPEDIA) to make reservation. Please be very careful, they are just attracting people with discounted rates, in fact they are charging about $50m - $60 a night for the 1 star hotel. you may contact me anytime via email adkison24943@aol.com.

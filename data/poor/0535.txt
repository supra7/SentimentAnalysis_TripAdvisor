First of all I paid to park my car on their lot for two weeks think that this would be a safe and secure choice. I was very wrong. I get back and find my front bumper scratched. I made numerous complaints, just to get the run around from the staff (who can barely speak English). The manager is never in, they will not give the name, and dont know when they will be in. I am also told that I must have done it prior to parking on their lot and that their staff could not have done it, even though they constantly move the cars around at the back of their lot. The room was a mess with pubic hair sprinkled throughout. There was a little in the tub, some on the counter, and even one on the TV remote. I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I didn't like,

I found this hotel to be a sad little place. The staff were very kind and really tried to please us. That was essentially the only positive spot we found here. The place was absolutely filthy. Apart from the front lobby, it looked like nobody had vacuumed since the place was first built. The elevators have a nauseating scent too. In the club room, which is a nice idea, there are dead flies along the windowsills. Another story - the rooms. The first room we were put in had some sort of insect infestation. Absolutely disgusting. When we requested that they switch our room, they did enthusiastically. There were no obvious bug infestations in the new room, but it was still dirty. The bedding was also filthy. Bleach would be my strongest suggestion. Overall, it was dirty and cleanliness is my biggest criteria for a hotel room. The service was kind though, and the location was nice. It was in a central downtown area so it was close to a couple restaurants and pretty buildings. I just wish it was better taken care of. It has a lot of potential with the interior look, which is a refurbished heritage building. It just needs some TLC. Right now though, I would never stay there again and certainly would not recommend it to anyone.

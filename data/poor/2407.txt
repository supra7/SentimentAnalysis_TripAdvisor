We had a house in Maui at the time, so we only booked an evening at this hotel when my sister's wedding reception was held there. They spent over $60K for the festivities at this hotel, and since I was the matron of honor, the rest of the girls at of the bridal party and I wanted to do a little dance presentation, shall we say, the Hukilau Song for the newlyweds. We wanted to do something goofy! Anyway, I asked the Ritz's Wedding Coordinator (hired solely to make this event a success) for song lyrics, as well as to give us instructions on how to do the hula hand gestures. The flake just handed me a lyric sheet (1-1/2 hours after my request) and told me she didn't know how to do the hula hand gesture thing. To native Hawaiians btw, this is like grade school stuff. She was a local, and certainly the Ritz had hula programs even. Couldn't she even make an effort? As for the hotel, no big deal. Boring and stuffy as usual.

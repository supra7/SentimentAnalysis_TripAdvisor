Upon arrival we were disappointed to learn that the credit card/debit we booked the hotel with over online 2-3 months before the trip was not acceptable when we arrived. We were told that we had to have a card that would authorize our entire stay and that it would charge it but it would hold that amount. That though a wrench in our entire 6 day stay as some were waiting on paychecks to hit so the cash they had was accounted for as there were no plans to pay upfront. We have seen hotels advise online must pay in advance. However, this hotel did not advise that at all. Please include your experience with pay good or bad for all to know.

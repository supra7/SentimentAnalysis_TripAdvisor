I stayed at the Media Rotana for 8 nights and it was one of the worst hotel experiences I ever had (and I travel a lot). The hotel itself is fine, but the service was horrible and the location leaves much to be desired. Previously arranged and written agreements were completely ignored and disregarded by the hotel. Every time I had a question or needed to make arrangements, the response from the hotel was 'We will get back to you'. However, during the 8 nights I was there, not once did they ever get back to me. Every time I asked for a taxi, I had justify why I did not want the hotel car service instead. It's fine they ask, but not accepting a no, is completely unacceptable. I could go on... for 8 days lots of things went wrong every single day. All things that on it's own could be ignored, but when it is all day, every day for 8 days, it's not OK anymore. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and will never stay there again.

We stayed at the Stratosphere last week for 4 nights. The checkin was very fast and service good. That's where the good experience stopped. The room is just okay (and we stayed in an upgraded room). After the second day I noticed a couple of bumps on me but didn't think too much about it. By the last day I noticed and felt these horrible, itchy bumps all over my arms, hands, back and even on my head! I've traveled and stayed at all different levels of hotels, but NEVER have I gotten bed bugs before! I may have saved a penny or two, but it wasn't worth it. I'll never stay at Stratosphere again!

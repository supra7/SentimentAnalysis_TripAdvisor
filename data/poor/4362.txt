At check in I was notified that my 2 bed rooms had been downgraded to a one bed room with a mini fridge at an extra cost per night. I was told this was all the hotel had available, should not have been because this room was booked well in advance! Room was on non smoking floor, could smell smoke all night long, maybe from other rooms on same floor. Room was old looking needed major updating. Casino was ok, Buffet was horrible and high priced. Service was terrible. Roxy's diner was a nice place to eat. Tower restaurant had a nice atmosphere but our server was to busy flirting and we were not impressed. We had our car broken into the second night we were there and had to spend most of the next day getting a window replaced. This was in the self parking area of the Stratosphere. I was told by our glass serviceman that they get around three to four calls a month at that location. Amazing that there are no security cameras. I noticed locals and really seedy people walking across from some apartment buildings across the street right into the employee parking garage the leads to the self parking and security never stopped them and told them to go around to the front entrance. I cannot stress more that you stay at a hotel further up on the strip. I would say from the Encore and Wynn towers on up. Stay away from the area around Circus Circus, the Riviera and Stratosphere. PAY ATTENTION! I would not recommend this hotel to ANYONE.

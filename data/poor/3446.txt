Big Disappointment! Big Disappointment!If you want to sleep, then fine other hotel. We spent three nights at the Omni Berkshire Place last week. Here are the comments: 1. The Price: We have paid a holiday premier, $619 per night for a double-room, which is fine, but not with a ten-inch hole [--].2. Room Condition: The room needs a serious facelift. Stain, pill-off wall paper all over the places. 3. Bathroom: It is small marble bath with a thick layer of dust over the lamp. That may be the reason they keep the bathroom very dark.4. Public Space: Lobby is old and dirty, nothing but chairs cover by layers of grease. We didn event want to look at it. Corridor is ok, but again is old. 5. Service: General is ok. If they can make our room services correct which are wrong twice out of our three orders. Service people in the lobby are in a snobby side. 6. The Location: It is a good midtown location. The trade off is the noise from streets which ran all night. If you do not want to wake up at 3:30AM by the garbage truck, other location would be an ideal. 7. Insulation: There is NO insulation at all. We can hear the guest conversation from the next door with our TV on. I have spent in hotel intensely, but never have any experience close to this one. This stay by far is the worst hotel experience I ever have. The interesting thing is that I did not real get angry. Simply, with the price gorging, my expectation has been set very low, but the Omni Berkshire can even go lower then that. It is unbelievable.

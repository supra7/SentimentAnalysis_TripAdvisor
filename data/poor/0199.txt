We booked our room after reading a review that said this hotel was "European" style. Having spent considerable time in Europe, we were very disappointed in the size of the room--very small; the esthetics--dreary, old, depressing, and noisy; and the price, which we felt was really ridiculous for this room. We had just come from Little America in Salt Lake City, which could account for our disappointment. The only positives I can find are the location--great--and the desk staff--very helpful. It seems that the hotel's location gives them the "right" to offer a very substandard experience. After reading the reviews since we stayed there, it doesn't sound like any changes for the better have been made.

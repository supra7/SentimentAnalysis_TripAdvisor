During our recent stay at the Eliot we specified a non-smoking room, which was provided, except that the air vent in the bathroom literally poured fresh cigarette smoke either from another part of the hotel or outside directly into our bathroom. Because we got in late and were tired we shut the door to the bathroom and went to sleep. When we woke up and brought the problem to the attention of the front desk (who visited the room to confirm the problem), they promised to provide us with another bathroom to shower and get ready for the rest of our trip in. They were unable to do this before we left, and said that because we booked through hotels.com they could not do anything else for us. All in all, for the price and four star rating, I was very unsatisfied with this hotel and their service/smoke problem. On the plus side, the location on Commonwealth Ave and near Newberry street and Fenway is excellent.

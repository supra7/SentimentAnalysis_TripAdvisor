Reservations were made and confirmed by Parrot Key Resort one month in advance of our trip. After friends traveled to our home near Orlando from Virginia, we headed for Key West for a long weekend of visiting with our friends we hadn't seen in 2 years. We reserved a three bedroom garden cottage so that the 6 of us could be together, have a kitchen, living area, etc. in order to spend some time catching up after 2 long years. When we arrived, we were told that our reservation was lost. After asking to speak to the manager several times we were told that he/she was unavailable. They then directed us to Casa Marina where we were put in 3 different rooms in different buildings approximately 1 block from where we had to park our vehicle. These accomodations did not facilitate the weekend we had planned. We were also told by the desk clerk at the Casa Marina that Parrot Key overbooked that Friday & Saturday by several rooms.

We stayed at the Stratosphere in 2007 & had a great time, so thought we'd go back. When we got there & saw our room (which was fairly dingy), we decided we wanted to upgrade to a room w/ a fridge, a view & a safe. They assured us that the suite had these amenities, so we upgraded. When we went to check into the new suite, we specifically asked, "does this room have a safe?" They assured us that it did. Sure enough, when we got to the room (which was a smoking room though we requested non-smoking) there was no safe. When we called them, they stated they could bring a safe up, but could not give us a timeframe. When we decied to check out and stay somewhere else, they didn't even seem to care that we were unhappy. They did not even apologize for lying to us.

Now granted, the rates are cheap, but this place was incredibly dirty, smelly and unkempt. There were spiderwebs everywhere outside of the rooms. The room smelled like it had been recently flooded. The shower was grimy and looked similar to the pool, which, as you can see in the photo was disgusting. The TV didn't work. The bed was uncomfortable. We woke up to some woman screaming outside our door, "I hate this bleepin' hotel!" There was a toilet seat laying on an awning outside our room. Behind the motel is a little garden patch(???). It is in a mostly abandoned industrial area and offers a view of a long abandonded railroad station. The photos tell a lot of the story.

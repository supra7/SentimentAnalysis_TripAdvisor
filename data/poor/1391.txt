Hotel 81 was horrible to the extent that you couldn't help but laugh. As you step out of the elevator you have the sudden feeling of being stuck inside of Wonderland with Alice. The poorly decorated tiled hallways did little to hide the fact that the floor was slanted and upon entering the room you felt like you had suddenly grown to four times your size. Yes it was that little. The rooms are tiny and offer very little. Sure there is a TV and DVD player but apart from that the decor is very below standard. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a giant leather bound book, it was that uncomfortable and slippery. We even had to make our own bed as the sheets had not been placed on the bed properly. They didn't even fit on the bed. The bathroom was the worst. The shower consisted of a shower head protruding from the wall in such a fashion that you could actually sit on the toilet and shower at the same time, actually a part of me is still convinced that that is what was intended. Water ended up everywhere, soaking the entire bathroom. Even the windows were covered in a strange green sheet and they couldn't be opened at all. Letting sunlight in the room gave the effect of being in the Emerald City in the Land of Oz. Very strange hotel. Would not recommend for anyone wanting a good night's sleep.

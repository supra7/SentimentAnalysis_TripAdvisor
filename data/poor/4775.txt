I would have to agree that the pictures and desciption on the web are very misleading. Not at all what we were expecting. Our room was so small that you could barely walk around the double bed, and we couldnt even open the wardrobe door fully as the bed was in the way and there was no room for our stuff. The place is quite old and run down but also not clean, the bathrooms are pretty poor. The location is good, near the subway, quiet area and a few nice places to eat. Only stay in the cheap rooms if your spending all your time out and only sleeping there as we did, couldnt have put up with it otherwise. I dont have a problem with getting what you pay for but I do take issue with the way the rooms were misrepresented.

The first impression of the hotel wasn't bad, only the district seemed quite different as well as the couple of guests, who (I believe) came to Amsterdam seeking for things they can't enjoy in their countries. We had booked 3 nights in this hotel, which looked quite nice on the photos published on Booking.com. The room was nice, just repaired with new furniture and two large windows, only the curtains were dirty and there were a strange smell. The first evening I saw an insect on my bed, but I just threw it out. In the morning the same kind of insect was on the wall, so my husband threw it out as well, but at that moment I thought it could be a bedbug. There was a free internet connection at the hotel, so we connected to Google Images and found that the insects of our room were bedbugs. We found the third one on the wall and took a photo of it (attached). Then we told to the receptionist, who laughed at our complain till we showed her the photo. At once she became serious and offered us another room that we refused since the bedbugs live in plagues. The receptionist was very kind to us and finally found another accommodation for the same rate within the same chain: Best Western Blue Tower Hotel. This hotel was quite nice, located in a better district, etc.

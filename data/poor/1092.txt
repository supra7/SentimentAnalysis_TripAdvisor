Prior to sending my daughter from Alaska back to college in Philadelphia after spring break I learned that her dorm would not be open until noon 3/21 and she would be arriving in Philadelphia just after midnight 3/21 so I booked a room for her at Fairfield Inn Marriott in Philadelphia. She had a layover on the way to Philadelphia in Chicago where it was snowing so her flight was delayed 2 hrs which would put her into Philadelphia at 2am. I called Fairfield Inn to inform them she would be arriving late and the girl that answered the phone asked her age. When I told her she was nieteen she said she couldn't stay. She said the minimum age was 21. I explained to her no one mentioned that when I booked the reservation and I even mentioned her age at that time. I aksed her to speak to a supervisor and she said there were none there at that hour of night and I have to contact the Marriott offic e which of course no one would be there either at midnight on a Sat night. She said there was nothing she could do and that my daughter could not stay there. After almost pleading with her I explaned she will be landing in Philadelphia at 2am and have no where to go. She put me on hold for awhile and finally agreed to take her. My daughter arrived at 2am and tried to use the courtesy phone for the shuttle and it was not working. After traveling 17 hours she was exhausted and had to call the hotel 3 times and wait for an hour and fifteen minutes on the curb for the shuttle. She finally was taken to the hotel at 3:30 am.

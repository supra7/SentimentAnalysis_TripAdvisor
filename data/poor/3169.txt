Did not like the Clift Awful hotel and the amenities are horrible. The rooms are small and poorly equiped. Orange lucite nite stands with no place to put away your clothes. TV 's are from the dark ages and only a few channels. It was a hotel that one should stay away from. The only good thing is the location is on Geary Street close to everything. But other than that don't bother as there are other hotels in the area that are the same price as it is not a cheap hotel.

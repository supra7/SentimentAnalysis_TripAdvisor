disgusted booked this hotel for myself my husband  friends of ours celebrating there silver wedding anniversary . After ten fantastic days on a carribean cruise what a disappointment this hotel was . Our deluxe ocean view room had nothing deluxe about it .The toilet was leaking so the room smelt of urine, the hotel is completley run down its tatty, dark  dinghy and nothing at all like the pictures on the web page. Judging by the state of the door the room had been broken into at some time and didnt lock properley. When we told the manager we wasnt happy  felt mislead by the pictures on the net we were told the ritz carlton is up the road but we didnt have to go that far to find a fantastic hotel the doubletree surfcomber is right next door to what i renamed norman bates hotel from the film phsyco. Our stay in miami was brilliant thanks to jude  all the staff at the surfcomber hotel . Dont go to the marseilles hotel its horrible  they shouldnt be allowed to advertise it the way they do , trading standards or the like need to see this place we had to pay for a night there even though we checked out 10 minutes after we arrived.

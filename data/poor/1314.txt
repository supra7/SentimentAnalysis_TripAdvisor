I've just returned from visiting this hotel and am genuinely astounded at it's rating as #4 in Paris. I have been a regular user of TripAdvisor for 5 years and it has rarely let me down but on this occasion it most certainly has. The location is terrible. To give you an idea, it's 20 by cab to the centre of Paris (yes, you can use the Metro but this gives you an idea of how far it is from the centre and if you have lots of luggage you probably won't fancy using the metro which is another 5 min walk from the hotel). It's also situated on a busy street and is very noisy at night time. Our room ("Desire") was tiny and the bath towels were the size of hand towels. Finally, when we checked in we specifically asked (as we always do) if Breakfast was included in our rate and we were told it was. We had breakfast (which was very basic (cereals and bread) and when we came to check out they had added 10pp to our bill for breakfast. We explained we specifically asked if it was included and the guy just said he must have mis-understood our question but we'd still have to pay. We ended up paying 135 per night which isn't exactly cheap and given the location of the hotel and the size of the room it did not represent good value for money.

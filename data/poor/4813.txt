Top of the Mark lacks class We considered staying here and went to the lounge Top of the Mark to have a drink and think about it. I didn't mind paying $10 for a glass of champagne but thought it was cheap that the hotel would not serve a peanut or a pretzel! Instead they wanted me to order off the menu where things ranged in price from $5-$20. In all honesty I would have ordered something from the menu(and another drink) if I hadn't found it so tacky that they couldn't even serve something with a drink. Needless to say I refused to stay there and promplty went across the street to the Fairmont!

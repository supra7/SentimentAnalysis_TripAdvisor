We chose L'Hermitage for one night in September 2011 to be close to the Queen Elizabeth Theatre to see the Royal Canadian Ballet. Street in front was under construction and we could not drive to the door of the hotel and the bell staff had to unload our suitcases in the middle of the street, we had to walk through construction and rain to the front door, (we did not have unbrellas and the bell staff did not provide them) and when we walked out the door to go to the ballet, it was a noisy filthy wet construction site. Construction was not their fault, but there was no acknowledgement on anyone's part that this was awful for guests. Hotel dreadfully short staffed with almost no help anywhere. The concierce recommended a restaurant for lunch which turned out to be a 45-minute walk, was a tourist trap with huge busloads of tourists, and mediocre and expensive food.. The waiter asked us who recommended the restaurant, we told him, and he grinned. I suspect the concierge gets some kind of a kick-back. The hotel bar was closed the whole time we were there. The front desk sent us to their breakfast/lounge area on the 5th floor to wait because our room was not ready when we arrived and said they would send coffee up. The area was dark, no lights but the gas fireplace, no staff, no food, no coffee. Very grim. Our room was large, but had old and stained upholstery on the furniture and worn towels. There are better hotels in downtown Vancouver. Skip this one.

Yuck! I've been disappointed before, but never enough to leave and risk sleeping in my car (which would be an upgrade from their construction zone). We traded our first room for one that might be cleaner. It was even worse! There was debris in the halls from remodeling (which was badly needed) and overall unsafe, scary conditions. This hotel should be shut down until the work is finished. I thought Red Lion had higher standards.

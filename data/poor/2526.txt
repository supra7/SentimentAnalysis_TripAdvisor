Awful!! I stayed there Nov 14 - 18. The hotel is in terrible condition. It is filthy and run down. The first room we were given smelled so bad of mold and mildew, we asked to be changed. The hotel agreed, but only if we paid a $20/night upgrade fee. I agreed. The next room had a bathroom so small that we could not open the toilet seat lid more than 45 degrees. The next day, we asked for another room. This room had an air conditioning vent that was full-on all the time, blasting cold air 24 hours a day. There was no way to control it; when we complained, the maintenance guy tried to close off the vent with masking tape. Obviously that did not work. It was like trying to sleep in a freezing cold air tunnel. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it was almost impossible to control the temperature. The toilet seat was ancient, full of scrapes and dents. The tiles were cracked and dirty. There was no pool bar or poolside snack bar. The pool was filthy. When I ordered a drink at the lobby bar, the bartender used generic label tequilla and bottled mix; he charged $11.60 for the drink, a complete rip off. I would never stay in this hotel again, especially for $150/night. In contrast, we looked at the South Seas hotel next door which had rooms available for less money. It was clean, smelled great, had a lovely pool area and full service for drinks and food at the bar.The Hotel Marseilles is nothing at all like what is advertised on the web site. It is awful. I don't take a vacation to deal with this kind of crummy property. Don't stay here under any circumstances.

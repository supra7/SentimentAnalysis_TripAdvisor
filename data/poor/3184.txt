If you like over priced rooms and snobby people the CLift is your hotel I had the honor of being in San Francisco and after sifting through innumerable hotel reviews decided to go for cool contemporary. I should have known better. I have stayed @ Schrager hotels in London, Miami and New York.I had forgotten exactly how clichd, tired, UN-service oriented and rude these hotels are. When we checked in we asked if we could get a room for our daughter who was driving in from Stanford. Even though the internet show plenty of rooms available that afternoon we were rudely informed there were no rooms. Not a chance. The front desk staff was uniformly obnoxiously. I constantly had the feeling I was interrupting a private conversation. Do they take a class on how to be that bored with the guests?The room was supposed to be a King Suite?It was just an oversized room for an oversized price.The entire atmosphere was so bad, even though we had reservations for 4 days; we packed up in the morning and moved to the Omni for the remainder of the trip where we were actually greeted with smiles and good mornings!!!! EVERY time we entered the lobby!!! What a refreshing idea. By the 2nd day the staff greeted us by name as well. The crowning insult? When we checked out of the Clift the person behind the desk was so disinterested she couldn't be bothered to even ask why were leaving so soon when we had 3 more days on our reservation.There are so many great hotel choices in San Francisco don't waste your time or money at this hotel that is so 20th century.

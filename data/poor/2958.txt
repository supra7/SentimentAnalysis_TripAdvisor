Stayed at the W hotel at the end of October 2005. The hotel in summary is trying to be hip, but the execution isn't up to it. The ground floor is stylish in a loud night-club sort of way. But when you get above the ground floor the implementation all goes to pot. The lift to the first six floors is dazzlingly bright, but opens onto corridors practically unlit - just the occasional pool of light. You could imagine that the design looked good on paper, but in practice it just looks gloomy, even not very clean. In the rooms the lighting is also dim, except for the two lights that hang over the bed on chains instead of bedside lights - both have to be on or off together and don't make reading in bed much fun. The bathroom was fine - it only had a shower, but it was good and used the space better than a tub. And the noise of the traffic. Don't be on a lower floor facing Lexington Avenue (I was on the 6th floor) - the cabs blow their horns all day and night - to the point where sleeping is more like just being in a hallucinogenic trance, if you're lucky.

We made a reservation for a special occasion through the hotels website. We paid a lot extra for a room with a view of Quincy Market. Really, this was the only reason we staid at this hotel instead of the many nicer ones in Boston for that price. When we showed up, they didnt have our reservation in their system which we had made through their own site. We had to pay for internet use in their lobby to print out a copy of the reservation. After waiting in a long line again, we showed them that we had a reservation for that night and gave them the reference number. They said their system didnt have it and that sometimes their own webpage doesnt talk to the same reservation system that they use. Of course, they didnt have the room with a view of Faneuil Hall that we reserved available and put us in a really poor room at the other end of the hotel. We told them that the only reason we were staying there was to have the room with the view. After complaining, the lady at the desk said that she wouldnt charge us the rate for the room we reserved but would give us the rate for the cheaper room they put us in. You would think that would go without saying. Finally she agreed to give us a free breakfast pass. The room was nothing special. We had to take an elevator and then wander through a long hallway to another small elevator to get there. There was no view. There were extremely loud noises coming from the rooms around us. I believe there was some post wedding partying going on until 2 or 3. The breakfast showed up two hours earlier than we had scheduled it so I had a bite or two and went back to bed. If we were staying there on business, it would be okay. But if you are counting on it for a special occasion or nice vacation, you really cant rely on them.

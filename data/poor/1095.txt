Where do I begin? I walked past my room because the number was missing. I had to ask housekeeping where my room was. I entered and thought the room was a smoking room because it stunk so bad of cigarette smoke and musk. I think they turned a smoking room into a non-smoking room. I bought a can of Febreeze but that did no justice. The dial on the shower was misleading and I had to turn it to "C" for hot and "H" for cold. The TV channel selection was horrible unless you watch 5 versions of ESPN. The air conditioner barely worked and I sweated through the night no matter how low or high I went with the air conditioner settings. The bed was so hard. My back ached the entire stay. I did not sleep under the sheets or covers, I requested an additional blanket to cover me while I laid on top of the covers. The light fixture was hanging off the wall. I had a real, real noisy neighbor. Her 18 month old cried every morning from 7-9am. They gave me a $15 discount but I will NEVER go back even with a coupon! Customer service sucks!

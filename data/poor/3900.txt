We recently stayed a the Sheraton Maui and we were charged twice for our stay, once on March 1st and again on March 2nd.I have provided proof of this to the sheraton showing they have been paid twice on my credit card statement and they are refusing to help and blaming amex AND TELLING ME TO TAKE IT UP WITH THEM WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. the staff at the resort are not friendly and paled in comparison to the fabulouse service we had at sheraton moana waikiki. Very disappointing.

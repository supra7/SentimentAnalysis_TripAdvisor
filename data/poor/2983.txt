Stayed here for 1 week there were renovations going on and air hammers went at it all day long every day. They never gave any indication that this was going on when we reserved, or we would have went some place else. All I got from them was "we're sorry" that sure is an underestatement to say the least. I can't think of anyone that is a sorrier excuse for a host. I guess for their apology and $1.00 I could have gotten a cup of coffee from McDonalds. If your planning on coming here I suggest you beat your head against a wall till you think clearer. What a hell hole

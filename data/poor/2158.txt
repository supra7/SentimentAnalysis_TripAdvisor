First the positive...the Palmer House Hilton is well-located in the loop and has a truly spectacular and grandiose lobby. Now the bad part ...everything else. The rooms are miniscule and the staff is extremely rude. And the elevators never work. At one point, I waited 18 MINUTES for an elevator before I decided to just walk the 20 flights of stairs to my room. The high-speed internet also did not work and the staff was unresponsive to fixing it. They were having "technical difficulties" with it for the entire three days of my stay (but yet still charged me an extra $9.95 a day for attempting to get on the net) I ended up having to go to kinkos to get on the internet. An absolutely horific stay that really dampened by view of the Hilton brand. I stayed here because I was attending a conference at this hotel, but in hindsight I would've stayed at another nearby hotel and just walked to the conference at the Palmer House each morning. AVOID THIS HOTEL BY ALL MEANS!

Since we have been pleased with the one bedroom suites at the Beekman, we booked a studio queen suite on the website for a one night stay. We were dismayed to find a very small double bed in a room that was too small to hold a queen sized bed. The room would have been adequate for one person, but was too small for two -- small enough so that it was difficult to get into the bed. When we complained, we were told that queen suites may have either a double or queen bed, but this is not clear from the website. The room was significantly overpriced for what it was.

I believed the positive reviews here and booked the place for four nights. We high-tailed it out of there after an hour. We booked the "junior suite" because it promised oceanfront views for those rooms. We checked in, went up the room and found a view of the swimming pool and the mechanical stuff on the hotel's roof. If we looked off to the right (along an open, shared balcony), we could see the ocean. Definitely not what we expected. We might have stayed nonetheless, but then we looked at the filthy kitchen area and walked into the bathroom, which smelled strongly of urine. We're not snooty and don't demand lavish accommodations, but this was really awful. One staff person at the desk gave my husband a hard time when we tried to check out after this quick look around, but the man we thought was the manager allowed us to flee. I highly recommend the lovely Best Western directly across the street, which had clean rooms, professional service and private balconies with direct ocean views for only a few dollars more each night.

I went to a time share presentation & was pressured into buying one, which I did NOT want to. According to the contract you have 5 days to cancell. I went back to them on the 5th day & said I was cancelling the contract. I had a paper written out with my name, contract number, and a letter explaining I was cancelling according to the contract on the 5th day. The contract also said I would get my money back (they took my credit card number & took almost $2,000.00 for the down payment) within 15 days. I did this all on 6/11/2010 & still have NEVER received my money back. I sent many emails and was ignored. I finally talked to a women in Texas who said they had agreed to everything & I would be getting my refund. That was in August. Now it is October 12th & I still have not received the refund of my money. I have again sent many emails and I get no returns from anyone. THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF!!!!! AND THEY ARE DISHONEST. I have the paper signed by someone very high up who agreed to the cancellation on 6/11, but still nothing. i suggest everyon BOYCOTT this resort!!!!!!!!!!

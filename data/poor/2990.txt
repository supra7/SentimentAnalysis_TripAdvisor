seriously, we have stayed at several hotels in Florida over the years and I have never seen a cockroach. We saw several "Palmetto bugs" here. They were in the bathroom and kitchen, even in light fixtures. The breakfast was mediocre and the "reception" three nights a week with free beer and wine was not much to make up for the rest. The woman who runs the "reception" would not let us use large glasses for anything including the soft drinks and said there was no more red wine. The snacks were not even worth eating. The walls are thin and it sounds like someone is using your bathroom or jumping on the floor over your head. There were small items under the beds that were left there by previous guests. We waited over an hour and a half for pool towels after asking. It is a good thing that they have a renovation scheduled, but they really have to do something about the roach problem and stop making excuses. They did not come in on my clothing!

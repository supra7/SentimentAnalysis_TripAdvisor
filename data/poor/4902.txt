We are currently staying at this "resort". We are highly disappointed with this establishment. The rooms were discounted for a class my husband is attending here. There was no mention of several things that would not be available due to the discount. When we arrived we were told we would not be allowed to swim unless we paid another $30 per day. The refridgerator is also an extra $10 a night! The room is dirty! We had no liner in the ice bucket, but plenty of hair. Every corner is dirty and the coffee maker actually has dust on it. Housekeeping barged in the room while my daughter was taking her afternoon nap! She said, "You are down to check out today." We are not scheduled to check out until Tuesday. 35 minutes after that another staff member came beating on the door about the broken coffee maker, again waking my daughter. The coffee maker works, there is actually a short in the outlet so it has to be wiggled to get it to work. There is no DO NOT DISTURB SIGN, so I could not place one on the door. I would get a better nights sleep on the sidewalk. Internet does not work! AWFUL PLACE!!

We went there only because we had a coupon for a free buffet and it wasn't even worth the "free." Worst food ever. I tried a couple of things and then filled up on salad. Hubby had a piece of prime rib that was inedible and so was his banana cream pie. If I could give it a "zero" I would. Don't waste your time.

My friends and I wanted to enjoy a New Years Eve at the W Hotel lounge and so we booked a couple of their "Cool Corner" suites and invited folks to come join us. From the moment of check-in I was greeted with rudeness by the hotel staff there, which is completely uncharacteristic of Starwood hotels. In particular, the "Guest Service Manager" Brian B. was about as friendly as your average Kinko's worker (that's not that friendly, btw). I have always liked the bar at the W Hotel and I guess have been fortunate to have not interacted much with the hotel staff up until now. I'll be putting friends and business colleagues up at the Four Seasons or Hotel 1000 from now on.

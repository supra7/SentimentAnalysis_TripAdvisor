Upon check in to our single queen NS room, we were told there would be no housekeeping during our 4-night pre-paid stay, but we could have more towels if need be. When we entered our room the conditions were substandard: the bathroom floor and tub had hair on them, there was a towel on the back of the door, the trash cans weren't emptied and food was left in the refrigerator and drawers. We called the front desk and was told that housekeeping cleaned the room and that management checked it and signed off on it. After much discusion, the front desk clerk agreed to come empty the trash and said we'd have to wait for housekeeping the next day. After two days, housekeeping never arrived and we fought to get out of our stay because of the conditions and lack of cooperation. Also, if you run out of toilet paper, you have to walk to the front desk to get more... they won't bring it to you. I've stayed at other Extended Stays as have my friends, but this was horrible.

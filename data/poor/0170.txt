First of all, the room was so small. I expected it to be cozy, and properly equipped, but it was neither. There was no table to eat at.. just a desk. In-room meals had to be eaten on the bed, or over one's lap. The staff graciously upgraded my family to a "King-Size Suite" which just consisted of a larger bed.. (which in turn made the room even smaller). The Bedding was stained, the staff didn't clean the room until I personally requested it.. TERRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I opted for valet service, and for the extra charge, I think it would have been better to have just self-parked. Why in the world would a guest at a hotel have to pay to park there?! The staff did NOT help us with our bags, even though we obviously had our hands full, there was no ramp so all luggage had to be transported manually. The elevator took at least 5 minutes to get to the floor, and its button didn't work half the time. The doors on the elevator nearly crushed me, as they do not have safety sensors.

Id been placed here by work, the lads that were here before me told.me it was a dump!!! And boy was they right.. the staff were friendly enough but had no idea about how to run a hotel.. then i got given my room!! Which had clearly only just been emptied! The beds were still warm and un-made. the walls have spit on! If i had not had work i would of jist travelled home...AVOID AT ALL COSTS

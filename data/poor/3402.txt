The art and science of hostelry is centuries old. This hotel missed all the main advancements. It's too bad, for the location and the size of the rooms are very nice. But here are a few of the things this hotel DOES NOT have or is a problem: 1. Ice and Ice buckets--none in sight. 2. An Alarm clock--This is the first hotel I have been in without a clock radio. 3. Pens and Memo pads. 4. A flatscreen TV. It had a 19 inch tube TV. (with Bad cable picture) 5. A shower an adult can fit in....there's was 24" x 24" 6. Mircowave cord could not reach a socket...we had to put it on the floor! 7. Shower head at neck level--try to wash your hair in a 4" sq ahower! 8. As cheap of furniture as possible.....tops lifting due to a coke bottles sweating. 9. Rusted out shower door hinges. 10. Wobbly, misfit shower water valves and handles. 11. Rusted out shower drain. 12. Standard toilet...not elongated like most hotel toilets. Brand new btw, and an elongated would have plenty of room, but there were too cheap to spend another 30 dollars. 13. Smallest bar (?) of soap from China that I have ever seen. No lotions, mouth wash, etc 14. 8" thick mattress. (most are 12,14, or 16") 15. No desk, no chairs...only two Kitchen chairs (sans kitchen). 16. Outlets without covers. 17. The hallway to the room was dim, dank and dark. Picture a 30's NYC tenement. 18. Very thin towels. 19. No FREE internet. 20. Water in pool unheated and unusable. 21. No place in bath to place cosmetics. No shelves. Everything had to be placed in a medicine cabinet (retail value $22.00) 22. Disk clerk on phone with BF for extended periods of time. This place has NO decor, and is so dirty as to wonder why they clean at all. When we booked, at had been 5 years since I last stayed here, and I thought they may have made some improvements. No dice. Stay at your your own risk! You have been warned.

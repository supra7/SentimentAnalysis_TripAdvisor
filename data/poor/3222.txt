Although this is a beautiful property, the staff is horrible - everyone from servers, front desk, concierge are very rude and offensive. They act like you are annoying them with every request. And yes, this is a "club" atmosphere - there were prostitutes everywhere in outrageous outfits. The "clientele" also were dressed like hookers in bikinis and high heels. NOT a place to relax. Horrible. DO NOT STAY HERE.

My wife has a timeshare we used here. The reviews on TA seemed positive, so we were in for quite a shock. We were given a room on the second floor that was similar to many of the pictures online, minus the bathroom. There were towels in the hallway from the time we check in until we checked out. The room stunk..we had to turn up the A/C to make it even bareable. The whole place seemed dirty. There was a security gaurd checking all the closets that didn't make us feel very safe. The consiegre lady was very helpful booking the tours. The topper was the shower design. It was open and faced the toilet. When I turned on the shower and it sprayed all over the toilet and soaked the toilet paper. Even though our stay was included in the timeshare, we checked out and headed to a hotel in the French Quarter. I would not recommend this place, and despite the street car, I would recommend staying in the Frech Quarter because you can just walk everywhere.

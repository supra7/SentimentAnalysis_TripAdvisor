The room was so small that we had to get dressed on the bed. Rooms are tacky and smell like citrus windex. Seems like there's a history of double-booking rooms. Location is cool, and there is a small pool...slightly larger than the rooms. Same price as the swanky French Quarter rooms, so you're probably better off booking out there. Walls are thin, bring earplugs if you wanna sleep!

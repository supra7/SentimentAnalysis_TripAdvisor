Worst Hotel On The Entire Island!!!!! Like Sleeping In A Dumpster!!!! I would rate this hotel less than terrible, but the site wont let me. SAVE YOUR MONEY...LOOK ELSEWHERE...DONT BOTHER WITH THIS HOTEL...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!First, I park my rental in the hotel parking garage, i walk through the entrance and smell this horrid sewer smell...I AM NOT JOKING! I check-in and am informed i must pay $15 PER DAY, to park my car in the hotel parking garage...ABSOLUTELY ABSURD!!! I get to my closet sized room, and try to check my e-mail..(the hotel advertises free high speed internet on the web)....I cant connect to the web...i go back down to the lobby in an elevator that sounds and rides like it is going to collapse at any given moment...and ask how to get on the net....they inform me i must pay to use one of the 4 computers they have in the lobby...at $6 PER HOUR!! At this point another guest comes out of the elevator and informs the clerk that her room had not been cleaned that day and they were out of toiletries and towels...they clerk had none to give....I was extremely tempted at this point to ask for my money back and find another hotel... I should have...my room got cleaned 1 time in 4 nights!!!MY MISTAKE...I REALLY AND TRULY SHOULD HAVE!!! This was my first trip to Hawaii, and this hotel ruined my entire stay!!! THIS HOTEL IS UNFIT FOR A DISEASED HOOKER!!!!!

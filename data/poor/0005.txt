So, I booked a hotel room at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle, Washington. I got there with my 2 boys around 8:30 at night...they offer a "late" checkin, so I thought we were okay getting there at that time, since I had to work that day and then drive the 2.5 hours down there from Vancouver, BC. We arrived, checked in, went up to our room, and there was ONE bed. My 2 sons are BOTH over 6 feet tall, and there was NO way, I was going to sleep on the couch, or make one of them sleep on the couch, since I reserved a room that would sleep all of us. When I went downstairs to inform them, and ask for a different room, they let me know that if I booked through a 3rd party (Hotwire) then they only had to give me what was left, and not what I requested. Oh REEEEEEAAAALLLLLY?!?! So, I ended up having to pay $40/night for a room UPGRADE, because apparently THAT room (with 2 beds) wasn't "AVAILABLE". WTF. Nighttime front desk service was dismal. Daytime service, was lovely. Oh...and...be prepared to spend $30 on hotel parking, PER NIGHT. Public lots only charge $10 overnight, and $12 daytime....so somehow, the hotels (who are taking all your money in the first place) can't give guests a rate break, but instead, charge even MORE. Bad. Bad. Bad.

We had booked on the internet, we confirmed by phone that everything was ok, and when we arrived OUR ROOM HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SOMEONE ELSE!!. We were then sent to some dorms not far away, where we could barely sleep because of the cold. Not easy neither to have a shower in a bathroom that smelt like sewer. The next day we finally got our room. Not enough towels, ONLY COLD WATER in the shower, a lot of noise from the street, no curtains to stop the light coming from outdoors in the morning... and a staff not helpful at all. Everything seemed too hard and difficult for them, so we had to almost scream to make them open an empty room to get towels for us. Not a single smile, not a friendly place at all. Please, dont come here if you want to enjoy your holidays in NY.

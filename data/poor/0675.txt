I was at this hotel at the end of August, with a tour group, and was shocked to find that with temperatures of 35C, there was neither air conditioner or fan in the rooms. Hotel is right next to the railway station, and one can hear all the loudspeaker information from the station. Rooms were adequate, but one of the front desk managers was very rude and surly. Also a fair walk from Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. Luckily I was only there for two nights, and moved to a much nicer and cheaper hotel in Sultanahmet.

We went on a trip to NY, thinking that we booked a hip hotel. When we arrived the room we got first was so small, that one of us had to stay on the bed if the other one went to the bathroom. Aside from the room needing renovation, it was not overly clean. The next day we were moved to a bigger room, but that room was really dirty with stains everywhere. The whole house smells like old carpet and whatever you do, go somewhere else.

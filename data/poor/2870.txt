Booked the W on PriceLine...so I didn't know the name of the hotel until I had already paid. Expected much more than we experienced unfortunately. My 20 year old daughter and I were there for 4 days to celebrate the year end of university. The trip was great but the hotel was disappointing. The room was extremely small, unbelievably dark (including the tiny washroom) and the front desk staff were uninviting. The use of the internet in the Business Center was incredibly expensive (most hotels we stay in this service is free). We were charged for an $80 room service meal that we did not order (or receive). It was a hassel trying to have it removed from our bill. I would never go back to this hotel.

Stayed here in august 2004 while touring west coast. Nice location. Was listed as a motel in the lonely planet guide, had been "upgraded" to hotel standards when we booked it - NOT! On arrival the staff were very laid back - so laid back the receptionist was having a cigarette outside! We were told our room had a sea view, however I think the customers at the World Famous restaurant had a better view of us. The room itself was fine, the bedlinen was v nice. there was no a/c just a fan. I had to ask for a hairdryer at reception as there was none in the room. I was asked to bring it back in case other guests needed to use it! We stayed during peak season and at $175 per night we found it to be seriously overpriced - I'd still class it as motel standard accommodation. A "hotel" only in name.

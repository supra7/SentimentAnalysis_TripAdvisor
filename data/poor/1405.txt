The service was horrible -- possibly the worst in a hotel I've ever experienced -- particularly by the folks who worked at the desk. To wit, I asked for a cab in 30 minutes and the guy working the desk told me to call back in 15 minutes to ask. And there was no one at the desk (i.e. not busy). My room had only tepid water. There was a ice machine at the other side of the wall that had the beds, so there was a constant hum and vibration. They advertise free coffee, but it ends at 730 am!! Crazy.

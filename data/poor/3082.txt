We were extremely disappointed in the hotel. The employees were very nice but beyond that we could not wait to leave. The carpet was dirty and the bed was very incomfortable. When we initially entered the room it was stuffy and smelly! Our "partial view" did in fact have an ocean view but it was directly over the street and parking lot. There were car all night and all morning who were coming and going with music blasting and car alarms sounding. This noise was finally drowned out once the bars closed at 2am and the drunk students proceeded to light fireworks, scream and party within an earshot of our room. It was the least peaceful place ever and by far the least romantic! We paid about 30% less than the quoted rate and were angry about paying that amoun for the expierence we had. I can't imagine how livid people are that pay full price! Definately NOT worth the money!

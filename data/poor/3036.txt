Although the resort itself is beautiful, there were a couple things that really ruined the experience. The biggest thing that everyone going here should be aware of is that if you are not in line at least one hour before the waterpark opens, you are not getting a chair at all until around 3:30. The park opens at 10:00 and by 10:15 there is not a single chair available. People begin lining up at 8:30 am. After 10:15 you will have to find a patch of grass and even concrete in the corner to set up camp for the day. Also, they search your bag everytime you enter the park. You are not allowed to bring ANY outside food or drink in. I was forced to throw away my water that was 2/3 gone. After being searched several times at the airport on the way there (normal procedure) it was offensive to have to then get searched daily at my "relaxing" resort. Then there were SEVERAL little things that just added up eventually. For example, had to call everyday for coffee in my room, one day my room wasn't cleaned at all and when I called at 3:00 to inquire I was treated like I was asking for a million dollars. Finally, the staff, including management, never wanted to hear about any complaints. Just an overall feeling that they really did not care one way or another. We have stayed at several resorts and this one was definately a disappointment. There are way too many beautiful resorts in the Phoenix area to waste your money on this one.

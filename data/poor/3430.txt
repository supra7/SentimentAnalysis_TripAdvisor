If you don't want to come home with bed bug souvenirs, then avoid the Beekman like the plague. We travelled with our 6 year old for 3 days. She was in a roll away bed. The room looked shabby with limp, curtains, peeling wallpaper and mold in the shower. I wouldn't have minded if not for the fact that during the second night I was eaten alive by bedbugs. Didn't know why I was itchy the next day until I saw raised bumps on my arms and thought it was a skin irritation. In the morning I had killed a 1cm bug on the wall going under a picture frame on the wall. I thought it might be a cockroach, but was surprised to see how much blood came out of it. I later discovered that it was my blood! I then noticed billboards all over New York stating that bed bugs were rampant in the hotels. Here it is 3 days after our return and I have counted about 100 bites! They had been feasting on me! My daughter on the roll away bed was thankfully only bitten in two places and my husband on 3 places. I had the misfortune to be on the wrong side of the bed. So...even though New York was fantastic, I would never ever go back to the Beekman after suffering the itchiness and raised welts all over my body.

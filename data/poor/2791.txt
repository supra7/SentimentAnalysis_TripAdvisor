I was there on business for three nights, and thought I must've been on Candid Camera! Forget about the fact that the rooms are tiny (even for Times Square), have no dressers, no counter in the bathroom and you don't even have room to turn around in the shower... I'VE NEVER STAYED AT A PLACE WITH MORE PATHETIC SERVICE., and lack of caring about their customers. In one room, I had two lights, a TV, a minibar and a most importantly, a thermostat that didn't work. Didn't really care about the lights and the minibar...and it took all day, but they finally fixed the TV. Despite repeated promises, though...could never fix the thermostat and get it below 78-degrees in my room. Even speaking to "the boss" was a complete waste of time. I spoke to the General Manager (Christopher Mallon) who told me that he would make sure the room is fixed immedaitely, told me I would get one of my nights complimentary, told me I would be invited back, etc. He never made good on any of his promises to rectify the situation...and since I left, has never returned a phone call of an e-mail. Needless to say, in 3-days, the room was never fixed, I couldn't switch into another room...and certainly never got the credit that I was promised. Even room service was horrible. It took three calls and 45-minutes to get a bucket of ice, and ordered dinner one night that was cold by the time it got to my room. It was really like a bad joke. There are some great hotels in Times Square. This place isn't one of them...and obviously they don't care about taking care of their customers, either. Simply put...I feel like I was blatantly screwed...then lied to by the General Manager. I hope this review will prevent somebody else from having the same experience I did.

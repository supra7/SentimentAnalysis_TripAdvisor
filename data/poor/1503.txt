After a long American Airlines flight from Indianapolis to Dallas (emergency landing in Little Rock, followed by 4 hours on the ground and finally taking off and again having to land in Shrevesport La for about another one hour delay) we of course missed our connection in Dallas and waited in line for 45 minutes to get our hotel voucher for a hotelat about 11:00 pm We got the Days Inn. The hotel was in terrible shape. The corridors were dirty and cluttered , the elevator smelled so bad that it made me sick, so we used the dirty unmaintained stairs instead. The carpet in the room was dirty, bathtub was dirty, etc. etc.. Worst place I have ever stayed and I have stayed in a lot of 3rd world countries. Do not stay here and shame on American AIrlines for giving customers vouchers to stay at such dumps.

I will never stay at this place again. I've stayed at Motel 6 before... and it was hands-down better than this place. They lead you to believe, via their web site, that it has a B&B atmosphere... NOT!! It's more like a Hostel. The room was VERY small, run down; the furniture was the same. The shower had holes in its walls... very gross. No air conditioner, elevator and the continental breakfast was very sparse. And to top it off, the service was less to be desired. The girl at the desk was outside with her 'friend' when we arrived and rushed in to check us in... all the while, her 'friend' was standing behind me waiting, like I was the one imposing!!

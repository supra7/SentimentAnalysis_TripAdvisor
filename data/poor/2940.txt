I was recommended this hotel by my travel agent, who seemed to think that the chic flashy lobby and bar was what we wanted. How wrong. On arrival we were escorted to our room by Dennis who had better things to do , than help us with our bags . He opened the door , no words exchanged and that was it. No tip for him. We arrived at midnight and the hotel was not expecting us, we ended up in a room that had 2 airconditioning units outside, that were louder than the plane, that we had spent 15 hours getting to New York on. Ironically enough having the airconditioners outside didnt actually mean that the air conditioning would be working in our room. The room was small stuffy, dirty. The bathroom was small, dirty and mouldy. What a pity they decided to put all the money into the lobby and bar and forget about everything level 3 upwards. We changed rooms because of the noise, Room 323 should be avoided and turned into a cleaning cupboard, which sadly would not get much use at the W. Fridge was dirty and we were also charged for drinks that we never consumed. Seems to be a trick of theirs. Didn't eat at the hotel as they had taken enough of my money in ripping me off with the room rate. Staff rude, and surly. A very disappointing start to our holiday, our travel agent at House of Travel has been told & we certainly won't be using the W or our travel agent again.

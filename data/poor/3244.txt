Ive been to 10 hotels in vegas and never been treated like this. The staff constantly screwed up and was unapologetic for it. The AC in the rooms cannot cool the room to anything below 74 degrees ( according to the maintenence guy, this was a design flaw) The place is WAY too expensive for the quality of service . Very beautiful but i'll never go back.

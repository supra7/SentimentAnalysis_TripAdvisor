If your coming to Hawaii skip this property. As you no doubt have read from others, this property is no where near the water. You can't hear the sounds of the waves. They have Ocean Front Suites and all other rooms are at best partial ocean view. If you enjoy the sound of traffic, airplanes, and kids playing sitting on your Lanai, this is your hotel. Think Vegas if you could open the windows. If you're expecting an outstanding room, you will be disappointed. At best 2 steps above Best Western. All and all I would skip the north west side of Maui. Maui in general makes me feel like West LA came over here and dumped. The feel and vibe is not relaxing. The Fairmont Kea Lani is a much better choice if your set on coming to Maui.

They were happy to take my $6000 deposit for a 3 BR penthouse when they knew there ws no chance in delivering on the reservation. Thanks to reviews and comments in here I did not accept their offer to stay at one of their other properties. They wanted me to stay in 2 regular rooms and couldn't even guarantee they would be together and I'm traveling with my 3 toddlers!! I was able to find a another great spot at a great last minute deal - thankfully I don't have to eat six plane tix. So let's make Karisma think twice about poor customer service. Simply do not stay at their resorts. There are plenty other great resorts and locations in the world happy to take your hard earned money and treat you well. They've proven they do not care about their clients so why should we care about their business!

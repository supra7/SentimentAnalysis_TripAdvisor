On Saturday July 14 my husband and I stayed in room C1818. We were extremely disappointed and displeased to find the room was very worn out. The carpet was tattered and unraveled. There was a 2" hole in the bathroom door, and the exit door has holes from where the security latch appeared to have been pulled out of the door & door jam. The price we paid was ridiculous for such a shabby, shoddy accommodation. We checked in about 2:00PM and rushed off to our sons wedding. When we finally got in the room for the first time at 11:00PM where we found the toilet was plugged. The maintenance man was prompt, but the situation and our stay was very unpleasant. Please advise me on how to email the photos I took of the carpet and the holes in the doors you can see for yourself. Its unfortunate that the inferior, poor, substandard room marred the memory of such a happy wedding day. I will be sure to tell everyone I know about our bad experience at Harrahs.

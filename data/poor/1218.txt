We had a terrible experience at this hotel. It does not look at all like the pics on the website! And yes, it is extremely loud because of proximity to bridge traffic. While the hotel does appear clean, I got a RASH from lying in the bed for 10 minutes. When we went to the desk, and asked if they might recommend another hotel in the area, the night shift clerk said that he couldn't say or he would be "helping the competition." He was on his ipod, claiming there was "nothing he could do." We were told that if we wanted to find another hotel we would have to PAY THREE DOLLARS TO USE THE COMPUTER IN THE HALL!! I have stayed in many hotels in my life and have never encountered anyone as rude and inhumane. When a representative from hotels.com called hotel 91 on our behalf (it was 1am and I had hives and no internet), he then reported to me that the hotel clerk had been rude to HIM and told him nasty things about ME! Please don't stay there.

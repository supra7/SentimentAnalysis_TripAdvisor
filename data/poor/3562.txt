How can this be a 4 star hotel? Firstly, they got our room mixed up with someone else's. Secondly, the bathroom was filthy! HAIRS on the bathroom floor and in the bathtub! You would have to be blind not to see them. It was absolutely disgusting. Service was not much better either. UGH! What a poor excuse for a 4 star hotel. The hallway was also really dark and dingy! Just don't waste your money here. We had no choice but to stay here.... unfortunately.

I stayed at this hotel after seeing their rooms advertised for 32 a night. But, if you pay by credit card they place a 4% handling charge on top of this. The first room that I was given was a real pig sty. The television was on a table next to the wash basin and I assumed that to wash you had to lean past this and try not to splash water on the television itself. The shower was operated by two taps, no mixer and the toilet was leaking all over the floor so I asked for another room. The door would not lock and this room was on the ground floor. They gave me a room with four beds in it and I thought okay but that night there was a fight in the adjoining bedroom that involved a lot of shouting and screaming and the following morning I checked out. I did not even bother to ask for a refund of the nights that I was not planning to stay, I was just glad to get out of the place.

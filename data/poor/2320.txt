I booked the luau for my extended family (6 people total) through the hotel directly. On the day of the luau it started raining, but no one called so we headed over to the resort. As we valet the car, one of the bell men said the luau had been cancelled. No one had called us. When we went inside, the concierge had no information about our reservation. I started wondering if I had booked at a diiferent resort. I left the family, went back to find my smart phone and sure enough, I had booked at the Grand Wailea. I went back to the concierge and they informed me they outsource the luau. So now its 6:30 PM on a Friday night and I've got a four year old to feed. Good luck trying to get a reservation somewhere nice. The concierge said she would try and "squeeze me in" at the hotel's restaurant. There was no squeezing to be had, lots of empty tables, overpriced, and not original in any way shape or form. They offered the same macadamia nut encrusted fish that the local fast food places offered as well. I learned a painful lesson!

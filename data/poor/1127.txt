The service at this hotel was absolutely horrendous !! Besides for the extremely rude and unaccommodating staff ; the hotel was full of little spiders and insects. The pool was closed yet this was not mentioned when we called to book our rooms. I highly recommend finding a different hotel. This hotel looks "good" from the outside but quite shabby from the inside.

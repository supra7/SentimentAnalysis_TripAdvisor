*bathroom was dirty upon arrival * the resort fee covers a bunch of stuff that OTHER places have at no charge like um, the coffee maker and printing of boarding passes. * spa facial burnt my face! * they offer to upgrade your dirty room for a fee! * pool only capacity for 100 and it's on top of the parking garage...sucked.

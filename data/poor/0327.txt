My date an I had one drink at the bar, and were clearly not inebriated. However, the waitress Trisha refused to serve my date and I. My date asked to speak with the manager, who said she saw my date walking and believed she was overly intoxicated. The truth of the matter is my date had a prosthetic leg, and walked with a limp naturally. My date was horribly embarrassed by the manager and waitress in front of a large group of people. Clearly, people with disabilities are not welcome at the Edgewater. Or maybe it was because my date happened to be of a different race than everybody else. Either way the Edgewater is a discriminatory establishment, stuck in the 1950's.

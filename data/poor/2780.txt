Good location for theater, central to subways, restaurants and entertainment. Many problems with rooms. First room was on a low floor, noisy day and night, with a broken bathroom window which allowed easy access into the unit from the roof next door. Second room was on a higher floor, with an A/C that rattled like a freight train. Third room was quiet and sufficient, although the rug and sofa were stained, and the plumbing did not work well. Staff is nice and very friendly, but slow to respond to requests (such as requests for ice and plumbing repair). There's business center and the concierge was unable to access airline websites to print boarding passes, so bring a laptop or be prepared to go to the cyber cafe down the street for any online needs.

We stayed here for a wedding that was held at this hotel. The rooms were small and disgusting. My kids did not want to use the toilet or take a shower because of the less than clean cramped bathroom. The service was also horrible. Our room was not cleaned the day after we checked in. We called the front desk at 5:30pm to ask that the room be cleaned. They seemed very annoyed at our request, but eventually came. The only good part was the banquet hall which was very nice. We will never stay here again!!!

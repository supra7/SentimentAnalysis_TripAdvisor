We just returned from a weekend getaway to New Orleans. We chose the Dauphine Orleans Hotel. We had stayed there before Hurricane Katrina in a beautiful, newly decorated new room. After being told there would be no refunds...We arrived to a lobby with ceiling tiles falling down, extension cords for box fans wired through the air conditioner vents, dirty room with blotched ceilings that were poorly patched, dirty floor in bathroom, ice bucket not emptied, coffee not supplied and poor air conditioning. Upon speaking with other guests, we found a couple that had changed rooms twice in one stay due to faulty air conditioning. I understand what New Orleans went through for the hurricane, however, if a hotel is not prepared to open completely renovated they should not open at all. This gives a poor idea of progress being made in New Orleans, which is not fair because many establishments have been successful. We will return to our beloved New Orleans, but not the Dauphine Orleans.

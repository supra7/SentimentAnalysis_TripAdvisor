Our Dinning Experience We come to Hawaii once or twice a year and spend a minimum of three weeks. We visited the Royal Hawaiian for lunch last week. It was a very bad experience. We were there on Sunday so we chose not to have the Sunday Brunch and opted out for the bar. The tables were set with a table cloth and usual amenities. We sat down and waited for service. Tables on both sides of us were served. We were ignored. Somone came by and removed everything off the table except the table cloth and left. Still no one came by to say anything. We wondered if we were in the wrong place so we tried to capture the attention of a wait staff person. No luck. Finally feeling extremely uncomfortable my husband, not to be ignored, stopped a person waiting on the table next to us and asked if we were in the wrong place for the bar. They said no. WE asked if we could order. The Wait person said, I'm really busy at the moment...We were going to leave and they took our order. More or less off the cuff if you get my meaning. We felt like unwelcome visitors. I would not choose to stay in this hotel.

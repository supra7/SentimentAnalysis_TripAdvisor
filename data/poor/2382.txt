We stayed at the Maui Prince for the final 3 days of our vacation. Upon arriving, we found that we could not have the room we had reserved because we had 3 children. The front desk clerk offered us an upgrade for an extra $100 for a one bedroom suite, adding that it was normally a $700 a night room. When we were able to check-in, I had to go back to the front desk twice because the key cards they gave us didn't work. The view from our room which was supposed to be an ocean view, was the parking lot out of the main room and onto trees and grass clippings from the bedroom. Our room was dirty, the sticky spots on the floor never did get wiped up even though I moved the furniture so that it was apparent to housekeeping staff. The room was dated and the lighting almost non-existent. Staff at the restaurants were rude. It almost seemed as if we were interupting them just to get seated. We attended the Sunday Brunch which, for some reason, is voted one of the best on Maui. They seated us just about as far away as possible from the buffet even though we had three children that would be carrying plates of food back to the table. When I paid our cheque, the waitress did not bring back the change, she didn't even look at us again when she went past. The pool area is dirty and the lunch we had there was a completely ridiculous price. The hallways are filthy. I noticed staff sweeping one morning but not mopping. We walked over the same spots(looked like squashed berries and old gum)every day. In the shop in the lobby both times we shopped there, we had to hear all about the scheduling problems the staff were experiencing as the clerk there didn't bother to put down the phone to serve us. We wouldn't make a return trip to this resort.

We stayed here for 2 weeks to settle into singapore upon arriving for the first time in the country to start new employment. Location is a good 30-45 mins from town by bus on a good day. Checking in was difficult as communication proved tricky to understand. The person who checked us in turned out to be an unhelpful obnoxious character. The door lock to our room appeared to be from the dark ages and barely worth the name as lock. The travel of the locking bolt into the catch was about 5mm and appeared to be able to be broken open by a sneeze. They tried in vain to remedy this with my assistance taking bits off other doors. No other suitable rooms were available except for dark windowless boxes. Cleaning staff did very little cleaning of our rooms. Bed sheets not changed for days. Bathroom dank and wet whenever we showered resulting in water all over the floor. Breakfast was appaling. Fish fingers, chicken nuggets, rice, samosas, cocktail sausages, over boiled eggs, mash of goo resembling noodles. Simply horrible. We resorted to having only toast and some passable juice. We made our own coffee. When it rained water covered the floor of the upper level titled corridor. It was like walking on ice at times. Our advice. Choose somewhere else if you can.

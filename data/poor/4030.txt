Redecorated rooms with cheap furniture (a 3-legged coffee table that fell over when you brushed up against it), no water pressure in the shower, polyester pillows that were so old & flat they were unusable (we're allergic to feather), overcharges on the bill ($138 for breakfast at the hotel restaurant, which we never visited)... The crowning blow was a buffet breakfast for 20 set up in the room next door on two consecutive mornings (at 7:00am!), which made sleeping in impossible. When we complained we were told "that they weren't doing it tomorrow".

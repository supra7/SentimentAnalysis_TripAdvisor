Decided to try Place d'Armes. Negatives: Room had no window. Very dark. Small room. Dirty bedsheet. Bathroom had some mold. Saggy bed. Floor felt icky. A bit on the dirty side. Positives: Great location. Fairly cheap. Nice enough staff. Overall: Be sure you get a room with a window. Otherwise you will be in a very dark room.

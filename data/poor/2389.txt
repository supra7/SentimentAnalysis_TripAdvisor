If you've ever wondered what it would have been like to stay in a Soviet-era hotel, the Maui Prince is your answer. This austere, aging, behemoth lacks personality and the service is third-rate if not horrible. A slight rain makes the tiled exterior floors a hazard to walk on, especially for seniors. The beach is not great by South Maui standards and for the kind of money you pay at the Maui Prince, you would be far better off staying up the road at Waliea at one of the many first-class resorts there. The extra charges on many things came as a complete shock. The hotel is bad need of a reno, so look around before you get trapped at this place. It's seen better days.

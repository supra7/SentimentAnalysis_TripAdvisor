It was our second stay at the Pioneer Inn and will definitely be our last. We stayed in room 36 which is a corner room with a wrap around lanai. Since we had stayed here before in a different room, we thought we knew what to expect, but when we walked into the room the smell was nearly unbearable. It smelled as if the room was filled with old gym shoes. Every time we came back to our room we opened both lanai doors to try and air out the room. What we didn't realize was the room was infested with bed bugs. My wife got the worst of it with over a hundred little bites on her arms and legs. We also had a couple bug come back in our luggage and we are cleaning and bagging everything to try and stop the infestation from following us home. We obviously no longer recommend staying at this hotel. It has turned into a nightmare for us.

Horrible Hotel My friends and I recently returned from what was supposed to be a terrific weekend during October 6-9, 2006 at this hotel. Let me begin by stating that this is a poorly ran hotel. We were staying in a suite which had no air conditioning and a dirty bathroom. However, that was nothing in comparison to what we went through the next day. We had no running water. We complained and the Manager and Staff dismissed our complaints. We were hot and unable to take showers we were stuck in our rooms for over 8 hours because we were unable to take a shower. When the water finally started running it was black and filled with bacteria according to the maintence department. So we had to wait an additional three hours for it to clean up. The next day there was no running water at all and we demanded to speak to the General Manager who refused to speak to us. We were then forced to walk on South beach with our luggage and without taking showers or brushing our teeth, and using the bathroom to their other property at Dorchester Suites. When we got there we were given a substandard room with no air-conditioning and no shower head. We were forced to shower in the fitness room. Several hours later we were transferred to a suite in which the toilet overflowed. Once maintenance arrived and fixed it we asked for Housekeeping and they never showed up. We were forced to clean the bathroom ourselves and remove the water and mildew in the bathrooms. We have since filed several complaints against this hotel. I just hope to save others from this hotel and I would strongly advise take your business elsewhere. I have stayed at several hotels and never have I expierenced the disrepect and embarrasment that I have faced while staying here.

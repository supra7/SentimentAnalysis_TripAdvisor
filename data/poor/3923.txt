We stayed here for our honeymoon during July. It seems that we experienced the same poor service and amenities that others are reporting. The employees and management are a joke. The internet in the rooms does NOT work and they would not admit it. Instead we moved our room 3 (THREE) times to try another internet connection only to find out it wouldn't work anywhere in the hotel. The rooms in Building 6 (Luxury Oceanfront) are filthy and disgusting for over $400 a night. Our A/C broke down and a maintenance person spent 3 hours trying to fix it from 9pm until after midnight...only to say it was over his head. Then the front desk could not move us because they had no other rooms. (A/C's were broken all over the place). We had to try to sleep in the 90+ degree room for close to $500 that night. All that management offered was a free breakfast (wow $40). Needless to say, this property RUINED our honeymoon on Maui...I would select the Hyatt or another hotel on Kannapali before even thinking about this property!!! BUYER BEWARE...

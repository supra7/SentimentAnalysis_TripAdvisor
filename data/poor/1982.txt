One morning we saw a continental breakfast (which seems to be common at most places we've stayed the last few years) set up in the common area where they send you to get internet connectivity. We saw several other guests grab a bite and continue on their way, so figured we had time for a bagel. Numerous hotel staff passed by and said nothing. Finally one little guy came up to us yelling "This is set up for a meeting group, we don't want to see you here! GO! Put down the rest of the bagel and LEAVE!" We had seen no group, only other hotel guests, and were so embarrassed, and asked if we could just pay for the bagels as it was a misunderstanding, and he just kept yelling "you go!" At first we were just embarrassed by the misunderstanding, but after seeing how believably rude the employee was, we got angrier and angrier. They should have put up a sign or somehow indicated it was for a specific group, since many hotel guests were making the same mistake, but only we we were yelled at "you need to leave!" over and over. It was humiliating, and all over a stupid bagel.

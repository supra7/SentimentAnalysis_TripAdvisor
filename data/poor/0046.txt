Downtown was pretty full for Penny Arcade Expo, so we spent three nights here. Every facet of our experience was so comically bad I was waiting for the cameras. The bathroon vanity was falling apart. The bathroom crown moulding WAS mold. There was no water pressure in the morning! I mean, how is that possible? I kept my socks on whenever I was on the carpet. The "restaurant" in the basement took almost an hour to serve scrambled eggs and pancakes to us in an empty room. Why go on? If you can't find a room downtown for your trip, convention, what have you, you're better off staying at the airport or uptown and catching an express bus (or soon the Link light rail).

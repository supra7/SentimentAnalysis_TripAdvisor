I stayed at this hotel in June of 2008. While I was there, for one night, I didn't notice any problems. But when I got back to my apartment in DC, I woke up the next day with a horrible rash all over my legs. I went to see a doctor a few days later who diagnosed the rash as bed bug bites, which are becoming a big problem in NYC. She advised me to wash everything I had brought in hot water and throw my luggage out. I did all of that and had a bed bug outbreak two months later! Now they are living in my apartment and I have to have an exterminator come. Please do NOT stay at this hotel, you don't want to go through this nightmare!

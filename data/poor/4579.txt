We went to Chicago to celebrate my grandaughter's 18th birthday. We had booked two rooms on Priceline. There was 5 of us and we knew we would need 2 rooms. We got there an the rooms only had one queen bed per room. We asked for a rollaway and they don't have any, they did say we could have extra bedding and someone could sleep on the floor. We went up and checked the rooms out. They were so small, you barely had room for the luggage let alone some one on the floor. So we had to get a 3rd room. These rooms are unbelievably small!! Roomservice was just as bad. One morning I ordered large coffee with 2 cups. No problem, I then requested extra cream, I never got it. The next morning I placed the same order but extra cream when I placed the order. Coffee was not a large but a small and no extra cream. We also called roomservice for wine glasses, they brought us tumblers. There were no wine glasses in the hotel, they were all dirty! Then the next night we asked for champagne flutes. We got the champagne flutes but they were dirty! Lipstick marks on the rims. We didn't get clean washcloths for the second day we were there. I don't mind using my towel again, but no way should anyone have to use their washcloths more than once! The staff wasn't helpful at all. When they asked us how our stay was and we told them, the front desk clerk just looked at us and said well I guess we won't see you ladies again! What happened to customer service? We are regular visitors to Chicago and never have we had such bad service!

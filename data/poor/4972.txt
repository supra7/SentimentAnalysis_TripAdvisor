I recently stayed here for one night. The front desk staff was friendly. However, as far as house cleaning, if I were the manger I would hire new staffing. Our house keeper did not clean out the rusty fridge. There were several take out containers from the previous tenant. All our towels were stained (a little bleach goes a long way...or buy new towels), and our bathtub had hair in it which definitely showed it hadn't been cleaned. I was so disgusted by the fridge. Since when is rust on all the shelves inside the fridge and old food from whoever stayed there a sanity thing? I brought food to put in the fridge and was so surprised to see the condition of it. A mini fridge is not that expensive to replace nor would new shelving be. I wish I had brought my own towels to this place because every towel I picked up had brown large stains or weird green stains. They looked very dirty. On top of that, Tammy the house keeper left a tip envelope with her name on it. A little suggestion to "Tammy," if you want tips, do your job properly. I relied on reviews and saw a printed trip adviser top rating flyer framed at the front desk. I feel misled! I honestly want compensated after staying here!! I paid for a nice vacation but instead it made me wish I packed cleaning supplies and towels from my own home to do someone elses job. People can get sick this way!!!

I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, it did not meet the star quality rating. Pre paid for 2 rooms, asked that they be adjacent,or in close proximity with one rollaway for our child. No problem the front desk said around 2pm per phone conversation. When we arrived we were told no roll away, they were given out to those that had already checked in and paid. We pre paid, I said to the desk clerk, and even called ahead. You pre paid with Priceline he said in a demeaning manor.( As if I financially raped the hotel by paying 140 per room per night). My son slept on the floor, they did offer a suite after a visible complaint at the front desk by by husband , but not on the same floor as my mother and small children, forget it we said. We left our mother and 2 small children in the room the next morning to do an am dive at the harbor. We found out there is no morning room service, they went without breakfast. At appproximately 0615 we left the hotel to travel a short distance to the harbour to dive. We were met by road blocks every block. It took us 65 minutes to get to the harbour and then the dive charter had to drive his boat to meet us as there was a marathon going on. Do ya think the front desk could have given us a heads up as to the coming event the next morning, when we checked in? The staff at the Blake could careless about their guests.

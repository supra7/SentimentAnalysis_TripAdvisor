Rude staff! They booked our reservations and later we showed up with our handicap son to find out they overbooked their hotel winch left us no rooms whatsoever. The staff was rude and unsympathetic they were at fault yet didn't even help my family find another hotel! Who books reservations and overbooks their hotels? I will never recommend this embassy suites the staff was rude and inconsiderate. Please beware of reservations booking at this hotel!

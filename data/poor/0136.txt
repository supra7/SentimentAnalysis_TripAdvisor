While staying at this hotel, I had approximately 35 percocet stolen from my medicine bag. Since many people stay here to be with loved ones during recovery from surgery, I imagine the housekeeping staff are quite aware that narcotics can be in the rooms. In addition, the employee had to look through my bags to find the pills. If I had more time, I would have reported this to the hotel and filed a police report. However, I expected this would be a giant waste of time which I was short of. When I got home, I emailed the hotel and have yet to receive a response. If you must stay here or at the Baroness, I urge all to leave nothing of value in your rooms. Also, the associated parking (down a very steep hill and a block away) was extremely expensive.

The hotel is very well located, with very attractive modern "minimalist" facilities. But going beyond the superficial, the rooms are completely impractical. One needs a new dictionary to understand the hotel's descriptions: cozy means tiny; double bed means full bed (where no two adults can sleep comfortably); an "eggplant canopy", means ceiling on top of the bed is painted purple; "whatever/whenever service", means youre in luck if anyone answers the phone when you need something... The room has tons of useless cutsey gadgets all over the place (little kaleidoscope, plastic thingy that says "relax", weird lamps, throw pillows, etc.), which make the room even more impractical, as you barely have room to put the things you do need. Oh, no coffee pot: little sign says you can find coffee downstairs (when open, at fancy hotel price), or ask for a coffee pot (which will never come). The staff is very friendly and smiles all the time, and knows how to oh and ah and make you feel better when you ask for something... But there is nothing else they can do to help. It is one of the few hotels that still includes a full minibar that will automatically charge your account for anything you touch; it also has, in lieu of a bedstand, lots of "goodies" that also will be charged to your account if you touch them or if you try to find a place to put your glasses, phone or watch for the night. Be sure to double check your bill when leaving, because there will surely be minibar charges.

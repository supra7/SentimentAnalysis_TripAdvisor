We booked this hotel after reading the high rankings and positive feedback from this website. We were very disappointed when we arrived and throughout the stay. The rooms were unbelievably small -- smaller than any hotel I've stayed at (and I've been to NYC!). The rooms were also dirty, dingy and in bad condition (we had two separate rooms). Avoid this hotel!

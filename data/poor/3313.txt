I have traveled the world and stayed in some remote small hotels that looked crummy. In all my travel years (30) I have never experienced bed bugs. I have now though after staying at this hotel for 1 night. I was so covered in bed bugs the next day you would not believe it. My flight was early morning and when I left the hotel I noticed that my back was itching allot. But I had to catch my flight so I just did not pay much attention. However when I finally boarded the flight the itching became worse. I went to the restroom and pulled up my shirt to look at why I was itching. To my horror I was covered in bites all over my back,stomach, legs. Lots of 3 bites in a row which is how the bed bugs bite. Awful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.!!!!!!!!!!

We just spent nine nights at the Hyatt and it was a tremendous disappointment. The beach is truly awful .. the water is full of large rocks which scrape and bruise and the surf itself is muddy and brown. Neither we, nor our children, wanted to go in the water and we ended up renting chairs at other hotels. (Further up the beach, near the Westin or Sheraton, the beach is excellent.) The hotel itself was very poorly run. Keys didn't work, wrong things were delivered to our room, the bathtub was dirty (and one quarter full of some other guest's last bath) service was shoddy and lines at the front desk endless. The hotel apologized so many times that we ended up with three gift baskets -- nice, but a well run hotel would have been far more appreciated, especially at the price. There are several better hotels on Kannapali, stay away from this one!

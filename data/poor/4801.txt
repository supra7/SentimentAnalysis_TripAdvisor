WE arrived in a hurry to get to an event. I pulled back the bedspread and there was BLACK HAIR on the sheets.later I found some more hair on the living room table. Chris, the staff member, offered to move us to a 2brd if we paid more??? It wasn't our fault their cleaning help screwed up..why should we pay more?????? Finally he offered clean sheets. He tried to hand them to us to put on but we shook our head and he put them on. Alex later fixed the remote so I guess some of them can get it right.. Not a good place for light sleepers..Wedding next door was noisy on Friday unitl 2am..SAturday they were all tired so they quit at 11pm. Bathrooms redone, new beds are needed..Staff cleaned our breakfast dishes but had a big sign for "tips please"..Need better training and management..Good location..GREAT VIEWS..

We`ve stayed in this Hotel for two nights without sleep. OK the rooms are clean but very small. The mattresses are covered with a plastic film, thats hygienic but not comfortable to sleep. Now I know what the plastic-film is for. If you want to sleep in this hotel you need ear plugs, because of the noises from the other rooms. Many couples book this "Hotel" for just 2 hours to have fun. This fun ist very loud and the couples have an all-night party.

No clim, half of hotel features missing, bad food, power outages, Be prepare for 3 stars vacation. From the hotel feature, half is missing. We got there and they could not find our reservation. they took 2 hours to get a room for us. They came about 340 times for the air conditioning which is still not working. Test it! put the temperature at 25....no difference.....we where at 26c, all week.....very hard to get us Vodka or Grand Marnier....service is crap and hotel is crap overall!!!!! sometimes they will deliver drinks to your room, sometimes they will tell you its not inclusive....pool cold and no Bali bed on the beach....the elegancer club is bullcrap.....go to bahia principe, excellence, paradisius or bavaro princess....those are way better......

This was supposed to be one of the highlights of a 3 week US trip, but was the worst hotel we stayed in by a long way. Good location, very grand public rooms, but our room was way past its best. Chipped glass on bedside table, dirty chair fabric, bent metal trim on coffee table, frayed carpet edges, tangled nests of cables, pillows far too soft. Bathroom looked about 30 years old, no shine left on the tub, chipped and badly repaired tiles, soap trays which only tipped soap into bath, shower temperature difficult to regulate (be very, very careful!), hot water through cold tap on basin, squeaky door hinges. Housekeeping was pretty poor also, dust on every surface, obviously not vacuumed properly, finger marks on glass, and an inconsistent supply of towels, shower gel, tea, coffee, etc. And it is very annoying when asking for additional supplies at the front desk to be treated with disdain by some staff. But the killer service problem came when raising these isssues with the front desk manager, Mr Christopher --, on our last day. He seemed to think it was just funny, would not stop grinning at me whilst I complained. He did waive the charge for one buffet breakfast, but made no further attempt at compensation. Apparently as I had booked via Expedia, it was nothing to do with him. I was told to "talk to Expedia". Not what I call 5 star service.

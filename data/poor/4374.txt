cant comment about the hotel itself, as i didnt stay there, but there is a stall that sells remote control cars/helicopters etc there. avoid. they initially sold me a small r/c helicopter.when that stopped working after 5 minutes, i took it back. they said it was broken,they have had problems with this model (yet continue to sell them). after what seemed like chat -asking me where i was from, how long i was in vegas-i was leaving that day, they persuaded me to pay extra to get the next model up. arrived back in england, helicopter worked,again, for 5 minutes, now doesnt do anything.the stall is called stratosphere toys. avoid these conmen.

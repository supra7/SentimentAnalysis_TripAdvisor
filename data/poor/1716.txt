Just finished a conference at this hotel. In perfect health when I left home, within 12 hours of being at this hotel came down with a variety of cold/low grade flu symptoms. In the evenings we would leave the hotel for dinner, every time shortly after leaving felt much better, woke the next morning with symptoms returned. Just got home and feeling back to normal, no symptoms. I travel a fair amount for business and stay in a variety of hotels and this is the first time I have ever experienced something like this although had something similar 15 years ago over a period of a couple of years in an office where I worked. Could have been just bad timing with a cold but I will never stay in this hotel again and would suggest to anyone with a sensitivity to closed atmosphere buildings (there is no way to get fresh air to your room, windows are sealed) that they stay somewhere else. Side note, the showers here are not good, almost everything else in the hotel is reasonable, but for a deluxe hotel the showers are weak, more of a weak drizzle than a rainfall, no power behind it and so high it is a pain to try and readjust spray style or direction.

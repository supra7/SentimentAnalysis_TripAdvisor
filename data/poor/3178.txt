ZERO CLASS - Front Desk agents Booked my stay at Clift via word of mouth of a co-worker. Was expecting something great - stylish and unique. What I got was the COMPLETE opposite. 1. The DoorMen were HORRID. They cared more about talking amongst themselves and I even had to open MY OWN DOOR while they completely disregaurded me. 2.Once I walked in to the dimley lit lobby (more like pitch black, although I will give it credit for creativity) I was appalled to have to wait for the Front Desk Clerk to even acknowledge me! And it was not bc there were other guests or even phone call duties. They were talking amongst themselves and laughing. I could not believe it and even expressed my disapoinment with my arrival. the clerk Terra i think just shrugged her shoulders and proceded with Check In. (Terrible service ) Could have at least apologized and made certain it was not a lasting impression.3.The rooms were EXTREMELY small and have NO dressers! I felt like i was back at my University Dorm Room! Please CLIFT get with the times! The Good: Redwood Room is alot of fun. But you are better off staying at ANOTHER hotel (with some CLASS) and just visiting the Redwood Room for a night.Overall my grief is not about the style of the hotel. I understand the Clift is not for everyone by way of their unique approach to what a hotel is...Its just I think they confuse what they should be doing with being CARLESS and treating the guests like they would their neighbor down the street. They have NO idea what class is! I blame the management for hiring these DUMB kids who have probably NEVER worked at a hotel before and dont get trained in how to (again) behave with class....MESSAGE TO ALL: DONT STAY AT CLIFT

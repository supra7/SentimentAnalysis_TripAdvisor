Online booking for this property CLEARLY indicated availability and allowed me to reserve an oceanfront, non-smoking room for 2 nights in the hotel. Just to be safe, I called reservations to verify before I completed the final step. I spoke to Debbie (with an attitude) who told me that although there technically was availability, it wouldn't be in the same room and I would have to check out at 10 and check back in at 3! She further informed me that if I had booked it online I would have had no choice but to take it because it was passed the cancellation period! This is so outrageous it's almost funny. Who knows what else they're not disclosing... "Well we don't actually have any beds in the room, but it's past the cancellation period so you'll just have to sleep on the floor."

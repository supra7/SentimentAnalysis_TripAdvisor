Fooled Do not be fooled by the pictures of this hotel on line or the 2 star rating that price line has it listed for. It is also listed in the Cathedral Hill district, which is not true. This hotel is a complete dump and is in the worst part of San Francisco according to our taxi driver. We booked it for three nights and just stayed one night and that is only because we arrived into town so late. There are homeless people everwhere because there is a homeless shelter right beside the hotel, in addtion there are hookers and drug dealers. So I guess if you are looking for this type of entertainment then it may suite you, but for a family and average person I wouldn't recommend it. There was actually a shooting right outside of the hotel the second day we were in San Francisco. My husband went to go get our bags to change them to the new hotel and there were police everywhere and he was told two guys were shot and one was killed. I will give it to them that they keep it clean and the continental breakfast area is decorated nicely. I'm not sure how they got the pictures of the rooms to look so nice online because it does not look at all like that when you walk in. So from a very unpleased customer I advise you to stay clear of this hotel and if you already have reservations just cancel them now and find a new hotel. Trust me it is worth the time and money!

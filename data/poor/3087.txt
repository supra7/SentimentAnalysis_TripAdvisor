Families beware! Family suites that cost 485$ + tax per night are sold ocean view. There are four family suites: two are 1/4 ocean view and 3/4 beach bathrooms view or tall building view. "Private patio" actually seats you in the street with beach bums and parked cars. I was so excited about this hotel I booked 6 nights, money wasn't a problem. When I saw the accommodation I asked for alternative that was unfortunately unavailable. I left the same night and the front desk didnt seem to care less. I had to pay the cancellation fee of one night but my family including small children wasn't allowed to stay although it was 11 pm. So, don't go there unless you are sure to have a real view of the ocean, you don't have kids, and you don't happen to talk to the right person at the front desk.

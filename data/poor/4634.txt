HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT BOOK!! I had a reservation for a Friday night and unfortunately roads were closed because of extreme weather conditions. This hotel REFUSED to refund or change my date. To top it off they were extremely rude! The price may look appealing, but they are only out to get your money! I called to speak with them about the situation and they CANCELED my reservation (while charging me full price) to place others in my reservation. Very hard people to work with.

The room that was given to us had a strong chemical smell, which my wife thought was of roach-killer spray. I was not sure. Then on the second day of our stay in the morning I spotted a small cockroach on the fridge. There were also a few ants here and there. We let these pass. But that night, just as I was about to go to sleep, I turned back my comforter and there was a large cockroach right on my pillow! That was the last straw! I called the main-desk. The guy manning it (it was close to 10:30 p.m.) was nice enough to offer us another room. But he would not guarantee that it would be bug-free! We moved nevertheless. The night passed without any further event. While checking out next morning, when I mentioned the events of night-before, they did give us some money back. But, as a result of our experience, we are now seriously considering buying a timeshare which are usually maintained much better!

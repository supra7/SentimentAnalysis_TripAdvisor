Visited Chicago with my wife. When making the reservation, we also ordered a limousine transfer to the hotel from the airport. The guy they sent to the airport for "meet and greet" service did not even bother to respond to a "good afternoon" and a smile - absolutely nothing, not even a nod. Just a blank - and very cold - stare. Upon check-in, they told us that their Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant would be open and they even prentended to make a reservation for us. However, just as we were getting ready for the dinner, they phoned our room and told that this was not true, and that we would have to be content with their casual "bistro". In that bistro, things got even worse: they tried to sit us not in the dining room but in a dark bar area with no table clothes at all, or waiters for that matter, etc., and next to a very loud bunch of guys apparently for a night of hearty binge drinking, and only upon request were we moved to a proper dining area(vwhere service was rather erratic). The housekeeping was dismal or, rather, non-existent - no turndown in the second evening of our stay. We were left with dirty towels on bathroom floors and used wine glasses on tables. When leaving the hotel for airport, the doorman was completely unaware of our airport limousine transfer although it was ordered through the concierge, the porter could not first find our luggage etc., and only with some difficulty and a long wait were we able to get the staff to find our luggage and get it into the trunk. All in all, the staff of this particular establishent was very unfriendly and incompetent and made us feel very unwelcome. (And we tipped everyone well until we saw that it was no good). NEVER AGAIN!!!

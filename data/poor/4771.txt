Worst travel experience of my life. Totally unhelpful staff. All had hand out. No parking unless valet service used. Public parking 1/2 mile from lodge. Could not get to room from parking area (security fence in the way - walking around would be 2+ miles) Repacked car - demanded refund and left. Overpriced, with rude unhelpful staff.

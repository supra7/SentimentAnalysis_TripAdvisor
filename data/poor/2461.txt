This hotel was awful! The rooms were dirty and outdated, the service was bad and the breakfast buffet was toooooooooooo crowded. Also, if you dont mind paying $55.00 per day for a lounge char and some shade then go ahead, otherwise you will be sitting on the ground in the sun! Best bet, stay at the Hyatt up the way, it is MUCH better!

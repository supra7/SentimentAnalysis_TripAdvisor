We paid a very high premium at the Sheraton Maui to stay in a deluxe ocean front room. We did so hoping for some privacy away from the madding crowds on the beach and pool area. The room itself was fine - reasonably quiet, great view. The amenities were just OK, but do not expect 5-star hotel amenities in Hawaii. What bothered us was the employees. This was absolutely the worst vacation experience we have ever had and that was purely the fault of the hotel staff. Every time we turned around we were being sold something without asking - time shares, sunglasses, excursions. After paying $450 per night for the room, we did not expect the timeshare sales office to call our room to schedule a "preview" under the guise of winning an award. After being scolded for asking to check in at 11:30 a.m. and being told firmly (not asked, told) that we would have to wait 3 1/2 hours to check in, we were phoned on the morning of our departure to see when we would be leaving because they needed the room for other guests. The staff on the whole were not at all pleasant to interact with - we felt as if we were bothering them, like we had to beg for their help. Do the staff think its guests are fools? There is nothing about this property that would make me ever want to stay here again. The staff are unremarkable and their attitude made our entire trip much less romantic and special by making it a week-long sales presentation. Who wants to go to the beach at the hotel when you have to dodge 5 rude salespeople to get there? It felt like sprinting through a used car lot. I will say it again - this was not the fault of the property - it was purely the fault of its employees, all of whom need an attitude adjustment.

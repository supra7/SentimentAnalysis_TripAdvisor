I had to stay at this hotel because all the others nearby were fully booked. The Continental advertises cheap rooms in the London Evening Standard, but when I rang up the cheap rooms were not available and the man who answered the phone at the hotel was rude to me and said they were fully booked. I then called in at the hotel, where I was offered a cheaper room - but still not as cheap as their adverts. The room itself was dreadful. The radiator didn't work so I could not regulate the temperature. The tiny television only had one channel. There were no towels in the bathroom, which was cramped and filthy. The hotel is very noisy and seems to be right next to a main train line as trains were thundering past all the time. Avoid this place at all costs. I told the man that was rude to me on the phone that I would be writing a review and he said go and do it. I sincerely hope he is reading this.

We were robbed! Hated this hotel. The rooms were small and reminded us of our college dorms but worse! We returned from having spent a lovely day on the windward side of the island only to find my suitcase stolen from our hotel room. Management didn't do anything about it. I did not get reinbursed for the stolen items. We asked the manager to call the police and all the police officer did was write out a report. Every souvenir for relatives and friends along with ten rolls of film was in the suitcase that was stolen from the room. There was no sign of forced entry so whoever broke into the room must have had a key. Which lead us to believe it was a staff member. We spoke to a local who works at Macy's at the mall and he confirmed Continental Surf has had problems with theft. Tourists are better off staying at The Breakers where prices are reasonable and the staff friendly.

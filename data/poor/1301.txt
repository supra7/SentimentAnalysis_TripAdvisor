We checked in late, 10 pm, and noticed a peculiar odor in the hallways. Upon reaching the room, we found a live roach in the bathtub. We would have left, but my husband was totally exhausted from 12 hrs of driving. Our friends did warn us to avoid staying in Memphis but.... We had to sleep breathing in the extermination spray fumes. Upon checkout, I complained to the desk clerk and he said he'd pass it onto maintenance. I guess this Fairfield is owned by Showcase - not Marriott management. If so, Marriott should remove their association with this site.

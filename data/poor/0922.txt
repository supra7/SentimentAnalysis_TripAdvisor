Hi We just came back from our vacation in Las Vegas. we booked a 5 star hotel for 2 nights but this is defiantly NOT a 5 star hotel. We found out that this hotel is not rated yet because it was open only 5 month ago and only after 1 year it can be rated. It started with the fact that non of the rooms have 2 beds only one king + sofa bed. When we open the sofa-bed, we found a very very thin and soft mattress with lots of coils sticking out of it in a way that you absolutely cant sleep on it. We asked for another mattress like the one they have on the main bed (which was also too soft ) but they said they can't give us a mattress like that, only another one like the one we have on the sofa bed. I have to say that the staff that we spoke with were not kind at all the only things that they came up with were that they can give us another room but we need to pay for it or that they can help us find another hotel which I explain to them more then 10 times that we already paid for this hotel through Priceline, but they kept suggesting this stupid idea over and over again. Other then that I can just say that the Jacuzzi in the bathroom was really nice until we operate it and found out that it was filthy, lots of dirt came out of the pipes  it was really disgusting. The pool was just a regular rectangular pool with no trees or anything special like you would expect from any hotel in Las Vegas and particular from a 5 star hotel. The location of the hotel wasn't ON the strip. It was on the side street  we had a long walk until we got to the strip. - THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL!!!! if you want 5 star hotel you better go to Palazzo or Wynn - both are absolutly a different ligue. really really nice and exclusive, wors every penny. save your money and don't go to this hotel

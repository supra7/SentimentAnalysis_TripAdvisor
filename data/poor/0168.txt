2 of our staff members were scheduled to stay at this hotel July 19th for a business meeting in downtown Seattle. A credit card authorization form was required. It was completed and included copies of the front and back of the corporate credit card. It was faxed as directed back to the hotel and we recieved a confirmation from our fax service that the transmission was successful ( 2 faxes so that both sides of the credit card read clearly). On the 18th of July we had not heard from the hotel and a number of calls were made to the hotel from the staff members themselves, and from the corporate office. No one ever called us back. We were told by the front desk that they did not have reservations and no rooms were available. They transferred our calls to another department that only had voice mail (that had a message stating that they would be out of the office June 17th through the 20th - a month old). Many messages were left, and we still haven't heard from anyone. This is just poor business. These staff members had a reservation, made in good faith, and guaranteed that the corporate card would pick up their charges. When that was provided, no call or email (which was not on ANY paperwork) have followed. We are disappointed and will not use this hotel again. Key Property Services, Inc. Vancouver, WA

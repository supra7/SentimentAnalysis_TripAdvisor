We have stayed at the Hilton four times over the last six months, but my kids have been dying to stay at the Commander since it's on the boardwalk. We got our chance this week. We were at the Hilton for three nights, and when we checked out, our van broke down (naturally, right!?). The Hilton welcomed us back, but the kids said it's the perfect time to try something different...the Commander. After the reviews, I thought it looked interesting myself. The front desk was less than sympathetic to our situation, and would not even upgrade us at 6pm even though they had many, many rooms available. We chose an oceanview suite (the layout was nicer than oceanfront, and the view was good). We were there about two hours when we couldn't take it anymore. The TV didn't work, the sofa was such a yucky plastic thing, the dishes were dirty, the heat barely worked, the beds and headboards were rickety, and the halls were very dark and kinda creepy. I was traveling with the kids alone while my hubby had to work. We are not hotel snobs, but when an 8 and 10 year old boy actually notices these things, it's pretty bad. My 10 year old actually got creeped out and started to cry! The pool was cold, and they didn't provide towels. The soap and shampoo "dispensers" were at least a foot over my younger sons' head! I will say that they were generous to let us check out without penalty when we weren't happy. Guess what...we went right back to the Hilton! They were so concerned about what we went through that day, they gave us an upgraded suite and charged us less than our initial 3 days because they knew we had a tough day. Bare in mind this rate was only $20 more than the Commander, and it was like going from driving a Pinto (remember them?) to a Mercedes. We all agreed....it's the Hilton or we don't go to OC at all!

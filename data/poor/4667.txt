Looks nice on the surface but Friday and Saturday nights are frat parties taking over the entire first floor until 2am. If you're on the second floor, particularly the room right above the bar, forget about sleeping! And we were paying $235 per night! Plenty of other hotels in the area. The family got us this place for their wedding; little did we know.

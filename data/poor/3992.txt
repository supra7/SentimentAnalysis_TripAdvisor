What would otherwise have been a good stay turned into a nightmare when I realized that $400 worth of shopping was stolen from my valet parked car. I was encouraged to leave my car in valet parking by the door man who said paying $40 per night was worth it because of the safety factor. I parked it with them over 2 nights $80). After we checked out and loaded up our car we drove off not even thinking to check through our stuff in the car. Only when we arrived at the next destination a couple hours away did we realize that the bags had been pinched. I was apalled that even after alerting the hotel they provided no apology and totally feeble compensation. They did not even offer to take off the cost of the parking. Their solution was to fob me off to the valet company and leave them to solve it..... I was shocked at the Bostonian's unprofessionalism and careless manner dealing with this. Thumbs down! You would never find this at a true world class hotel.

Ew. Yuck. This would be a Zero Star Review if we had the option! We were recommended the Clift by a friend who lives in SF and were excited when we saw the trendy photos on the web. We had friendly service when we checked in ... and then it all went downhill. The bathroom was smaller than most public restroom stalls and the shower did some weird scalding/freezing thing. There was no air vent in the bathroom so all of the mirrors and the window in the room fogged up with condensation and made the room feel wet and smell moldy. We tried to open the window (with help from the maintenance guy) and it actually came off the wall! We had to shut it and lock it just to keep it in place. There were stains in the carpet and weirdly, the cd on the nightstand was WET (yuck!) when we picked it up to check it out.I've read the reviews and the tvs ARE tiny, but hey, we were in SF for vacation and the last thing we wanted to do was watch tv. The breaking point for me was the staff. Service apparently is not a word they are familiar with. From the snobby and rude reception (and can we say SLOW?) to the incredibly pretentious servers in the Redwood Room, I found it hard to believe that we were at a 4 star hotel.

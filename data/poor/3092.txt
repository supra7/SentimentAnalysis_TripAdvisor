I spent my Memorial Weekend with my family in San Diego and stayed at Somerset Hotel. The total experience was terrible. I booked for a 2 double beds suite but was given a single king size bedroom. I was not notified of the change at the time of check-in. When I questioned the front desk clerk, I was told that's all they have left and the 2 double beds are not available. I had 4 adults and 2 children sleeping in a SINGLE room. I expressed to the clerk of how unhappy I am with the situation, he told me that I was lucky to even get a room. For compensation, we were given 2 very uncomfortable roll-away beds to sleep in. The room was smelly and difficult to settle in. I asked to speak to the manager but there were no manager or supervisor around to address my concerns. No one called back either. I had to directly go to the front desk and look for the manager myself. Parking was also horrible, the space are tiny that is if you could find a space. I had to park 2 blocks away and walked back to the hotel. If you hope to get a good night sleep, don't count on getting any restful night there. The hotel is located next to a medical building, so siren of ambulances were heard throughout the nights. Do yourself a favor and DON'T book your reservation here. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

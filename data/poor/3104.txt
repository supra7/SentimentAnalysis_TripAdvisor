You can come up with fancy names like boutique hotel, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well then it's a duck. The Surfer Hotel is a 4 storey MOTEL. It's priced as a Hotel and that means you'll be overcharged for basic amenities of a MOTEL. The arrogance of the general manager who insincerely pretended that my disappointment really mattered was very Motel 6. Each room overlooks the ugly rooftop of the restaurant below ironically named "World's Best". The paint coming off the shower walls was an extra delight. If you are a student and you just want to be on the beach go for it. If you are past your College-"let's see how much beer we can drink" -years, and you're looking for a well run hotel where people "wake-up" not "come-to" from a night of shooters and drinking out of funnels and test tubes, stay elsewhere. I wish I would have spent more time visiting the other hotels on the boardwalk before booking. Try the Catamaran across the street, The Oceanside down the road or the Pacific Terrace.

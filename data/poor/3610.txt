I called and booked the reservation directly as part of a group with PG&E. When I arrived they had me down as a "no show" on the wrong date, and had no other rooms available. My confirmation number was worthless, even though I figured out what happened - I booked on the 17th of Auguest for the 19th of Sept - they put down the 17th of Sept. They told me I could either wait 3 hours and see if there was a cancellation or they would call next door . Ultimately they did make an attempt to help me find another hotel - at over 2 times the Griffon's cost, but when I went back to check on cancellations the man wouldn't even slow down and look at us directly - apparently couldn't be bothered. Said I should have gotten an email confirmation - which I didn't - I checked. Try being in downtown San Francisco, with a Microsoft conference in town and no hotel! I learned a lesson about boutique hotels on this trip - keep with the ones who might possibly have a back up plan , or an alternative property., or a reciprocity arrangement. Our group contact was not surprised I had no email confirmation - that is the norm. I was surprised at the attitude of the gentleman at the desk.

Arrived at hotel to be advised the hotel was overbooked and we could be "upgraded" to the two bed suite on the the 25th floor. We were given no incentive for this forced room combination with the front desk dismissing or request for breakfast or even a free roundf of drinks in the bar.. Luckily we were two couples who were content in sharing a two bed suite.. it was late we were tired and didn't have much of a choice... I use the term "suite" loosely here it was in fact a tired , old , run down , sparcely furnished room with stained carpets - that could really do with a makeover and deep clean. On checkout the front desk attempted to chrage us more than the agreed rate stating higher taxes and the wrong rate etc.. When I advised we had paid for and settled on check-in with cash she advise th,at she would charge or credit card anyway, having discussed my point in detail she looked again and advised she had made a mistake , no apology given , customer is always right !?!? not in the beekman tower.. Hotels these days are too happy to charge now and ask later treating customers uninfomed sheep, this is very frustrating for regular travellers ..

Extremely Rude!!!! Beware! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in Novemeber. The experience was horrible! I am not a hard person to please and do not like to complain about petty things. However, I want to WARN YOU that this hotel has extremely rude front desk help and it is junky and I would not recommend staying there. The rooms are small and the hotel has a terrible smell! We were charged for the mini bar which we did not use and when I called to be reimbursed...they kept transferring me to voice mails. I never heard back so I finally e-mailed the sales dept. It took a month to finally get reimbursed! Please save yourselves the headache and find a different hotel!

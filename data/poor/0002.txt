Arrived, but room not ready at time should be. Had to wait hours for it after cross-country flight. Internet didn't work well. Tub in bathroom had dirt ring around it, uncleaned. Waited over an hour for dinner order, never got it. The bedding was full of dust mites, to which I am very allergic. Shortly before midnight, took bags and left to go a block to the Fairmont, which was excellent.

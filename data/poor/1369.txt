worst experience ever so far we arrived november 24 2008 the resort is not even close to be finished at least 3 or 4 months. no spa, half the restaurants are not open they do not even have enough employees to staff all the restaurants. We went to the italian restaurant and the waiter told they only have 4 menus so we had to wait 15 minutes to get a menu, everyone has been at least once to a new room since a/c not working, roof leaks, bathroom overflow, no tv, on and on. The employees will tell you anything to get you out of the office then you can never find them again. there is no room service yet, no spa, no working jaccuzi's. Do yourself a favor and do NOT come here till at least marchor april of next year.

My husband and I booked a room at the Magnolia Hotel in Downtown Dallas for one night with the intention of having a night of relaxation and peace and quiet away from the kids. When we got to our room which was right next to the elevator, you could actually hear the elevators moving up and down the shaft over the television. We waited for about an hour to see if it would get better and the noise only got worse. We decided to switch rooms and the front desk said they made a mistake and put us in the "ROAR" room. So we moved down to the 7th floor and stayed in a room right above the Iron Cactus restaurant. It was like New Orleans style partying outside until 2am when the bars finally closed! Apparently all the sound travels up when you are between the large skyscrapers and so we got ZERO sleep. Then about 3am some guy had some kind of drug induced fit out on the sidewalk below the hotel and we had to listen to him screaming, thrashing around, and fighting off demons for 30 minutes. This was the most entertaining part of our stay. No cops ever showed up. We finally drifted off to sleep around 4am and when we woke up at 9am, we quickly packed our things and got the HELL OUT OF THERE! I would have gotten more rest and relaxation at home with my screaming 2 yr old.

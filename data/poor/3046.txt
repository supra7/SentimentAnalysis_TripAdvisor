The Arizona Grand plays movies at night by the pool, AT MAXIMUM VOLUME!! When we called to ask them to turn the sound down, they acknowledged that we weren't the only ones inconvenienced but claimed they didn't know how to get in touch with the people at the pool. When we spoke with the manager Adrian, he did turn the volume down SLIGHTLY, and then would not accept our call to turn it down more. We were told that the volume was at the "acceptable decible level for noise"!! When the movie ended at 10:00 we finally had peace, but we were all tired and cranky the next day over the hassle. We received a small credit for the disruption, but it was clear that management did not care that some of their guests could not sleep through the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack playing in their room!

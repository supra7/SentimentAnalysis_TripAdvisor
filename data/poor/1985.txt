We arrived early on a Saturday afternoon. The front desk said there weren't any available rooms so we'd have to wait for one to be made up. I was fine with that because we were early. An hour or so later they checked us into a room on the 3rd floor. The room was fine--it was a suite, but both rooms were rather small and the living area is dark because the only window opens up into the hallway. I could live with the small size, but around 8 or 9 pm our walls started shaking. After a little investigatioh, I discovered the cause--the jazz club was directly below our room. Having two small kids, I was worried they would be woken up. So, I went to front desk and told them the problem. They said , yes the jazz club is right below and that is the problem. No apology. I asked them what they could do about it, because we weren't staying in that room. They got us another room on a higher floor, which solved the jazz club noise. Just our luck, our new neighbors was a family with ~8 people staying in the suite. They kept us up half the night. Can't blame the hotel too much for this, though I'm guessing 8 people is more than the room is supposed to hold. When I asked for another room the next day, they weren't particularly apologetic. Overall, I was disappointed with the attitude at the front desk. They were friendly, but not not particularly compassionate and didn't go out of their way to make our stay nicer than it could have been. The hotel is fine, but I would never stay here on a Saturday night unless I were sure that I had a room on a top floor. The atrium set up allows all the noise from the club to filter up to higher floors and the staff was not particularly helpful in finding us more appropriate accomodations.

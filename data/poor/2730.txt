Hair all over the bathroom floor. Stayed three nights and it was never vacuumed or scrubbed - the hair remained along with tiny dead bugs caught up in the corners. Walls in bathroom were stained. Clerk arguing with couple over whether or not they should pay for a movie they claimed they did not watch. Wore flip flops into the shower to avoid barefeet anywhere in the room. Handle broken off dresser drawer. Lighting in sink area so dingy it was worthless. Never again.

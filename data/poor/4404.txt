I have stayed at cheap hotels, expensive hotels, and middle of the road, places in Vegas and this is the WORST hotel I have ever seen. Here is the deal; the hotel is really far from anything else which is not a big issue by itself. The big issue is that the service is terrible, resturants are BAD and they are hardly open, casio is REALLY smokey, "resort" fee is insane for what you get, the hotel is DIRTY. The same wrapper was in the elevator for 3 days! Staff is rude. Getting a drink is almost impossible. A non-smoking room smells like smoke. The worst part is the noise! Across the street is a roller coaster that runs all day and it rattles the room every 15 minutes. It's like a 747 is landing on top of the hotel. All I can say is BAD, BAD, BAD. Do NOT STAY AT THIS DUMP. You would be much better off at Monte Carlo if you want a mid-price room. Cheap rooms are much better at Imperial Palace.

We contacted Grand Wailea while we were visiting Hawaii about a possible event and we were not treated well by the staff and not given any information. Then, we were contacted by a member of their management and told to give them a second chance. We did give them a second chance and the results were the same. Grand Wailea does not care about customer service. They do not follow through with promises and they do not treat their customers the way a high end resort should.

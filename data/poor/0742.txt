It's like they had it waving in a banner from the front of the hotel. The hotel is in poor repair. There is paint and plaster falling from the ceiling at the check in desk. There is mold and falling plaster in the corner of my room. I'm tempted to pull down the decorative shower curtain before I use it tomorrow it's that gross. There have got to be other hotels out there that will do better for the money. I'm stuck here for a convention, so it doesn't do me much harm. I'd be ticked if I'd paid for this myself.

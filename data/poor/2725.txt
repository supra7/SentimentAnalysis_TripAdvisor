I have traveled in third-world countries and this hotel is by far the most dirty, disgusting place I have ever stayed. The person who booked the room got an earful when I returned from the trip. The reviews that say the carpets haven't been cleaned since the 1960's are on-the-money. The carpets were filthy, there were electrical wires just sticking out of the wall, substantial amounts of paint chipped and/or peeling off the walls, dead bugs on the floor. The springs in the mattress were jabbing into my back all night long. As soon as I walked into the room my business collegue telephoned desperate for us to find another hotel right then...at midnight! Unfortunately, it was one of those weeks when everything in NY was booked and we were stuck. I have heard that some of the rooms have been refurbished, but I would not risk getting stuck in a room that has not been.

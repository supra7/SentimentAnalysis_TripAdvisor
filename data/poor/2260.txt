Maybe this was cool back in the day but not anymore! The rooms are falling apart. I saw an elderly man get beat up literally outside of the main entrance. I am not that picky of a person but safety is everything to me and I appreciate clean rooms which you will not find here! This is a seedy hotel in the questionable part of Las Vegas.

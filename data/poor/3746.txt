Terrible I booked this hotel against the advice of my travel agent, trying to save money for our honeymoon. What a mistake. Not sure where to start so I'll start at the beginning. After spending 20+ hours traveling to Hawaii we finally got to our hotel. We got to our room and even though I booked a king bed we were stuck with two twin beds. Secondly we were right next to the elevator (DING all night long); third the A/C unit was extremely noisy AND had a bucket underneath it on the balcony to catch all the water dripping from it. I called the front desk to complain and was told that's the only room available and the beds are not guaranteed. Not the grand honeymoon we were expecting. We stayed one night there and luckily our travel agent booked us into the Ohana east for only $10 more a night. What a difference. The ambassador is at least a 30 minute walk to the international market place and everything else worth seeing. For the money you can do much better.

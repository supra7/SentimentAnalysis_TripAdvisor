We arrived to the hotel at 9.30pm and were greeted by the unprofessional manager who was in the middle of still taking her coat off at the start of the shift (she was supposed to start at 9pm!) The first thing she did was ask us if we wanted to pay 1.50 to buy some stale cake or some sweets for children in need & looked pretty miffed when I politely declined... We were given our key for a room on the ground floor but had to go back to reception 3 times as the key didn't work. Eventually the so called manager came along to open it & we found it was a tiny double room. We said that we had booked a twin room & she said that that was the room we had been given and she couldn't do anything about it- I hadn't travelled to London to sepnd 2 nights in the same bed as my mum! Eventually after persistance she miraculously found a twin room for us- this was in the dungeons on the ground floor & was terrible. The bathroom was so smelly, beds were tiny (I didn't move all night as I thought I would fall out) heating didn't work & there were plastic drinking cups upside down on the toilet cistern - nice! I don't like having to complain but when you're paying 75 quid a night for a room it's just not good enough. My complaining fell on deaf ears though. The reception staff couldn't have been more rude or unprofessional about the whole thing. We were moved the next day 4 rooms along to right beside the bar which is open till 5am!! Another sleepless night. The hotel is in an excellent location for the underground and is a short walk from Kings Cross station, but other than that has nothing going for it.

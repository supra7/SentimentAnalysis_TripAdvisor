Our experience (my and I) was so terrible that I had to share it with everyone. We just returned home from our trip three days ago. We were set up by some bootleg travel agency(World Wide Travel Center) with this hotel. We entered a casino with smoke so thick that your hand could cut right through it not to mention that it even seeped up into the spaces where they called rooms. It was small, filthy, smelly, and had clogged drains, which no one came to fix after we requested this. I had to hold on to my husband for the prostitutes/cracheads looked as if they were ready to attack at any minute. We too inquired about the free breakfast, but it didn't matter cause we made up our minds not to eat here. Boy were we lucky! The old guy at the desk shirt was dirty and he had apersonality to match. I read the reviews before going, but I did not think it was possible for it to be this bad. Unfortunately when we returned in late that night we were greeted by buddies(big[--] crickets &roaches) that were waiting for us on the wall. This was when my husband could take more and checked us out and found another hotel who prices also were not bad but was clean, fun, and we had a wonderful stay(Golden Gate on Freemont Street).I'm glad someone finally posted pictures of what the dump really looks like. Why is there even a pool rating, cause they don't have one? People when the shuttle bus driver is feeling nervous about dropping you off here something is wrong. I dont understand how anyone on a budget or not could take this risk.

I know travelodge is a budget hotel but this place took the Mick, from arrival the staff were ignorant and rude they were not polite at check in when we tried to get to our room using the lift we were forced to wait as they were using the only working lift as a service lift bearing in mind we had our two young children with us after a long journey i just wanted to get to our room unfortunately once we reached our room that was the last place we wanted to be. The children's beds were not made up we were short one set of bedding which we asked a maid for who just grunted at us. I then stood in a wet patch in our room which I placed a towel on which subsequently turned brown. The carpet felt dirty there were stains around the floor we all had to keep our shoes on the entire stay. The plastic cups left out in the bathroom for us to use which were not sealed looked like they had been used they were dirty I then went to reception to complain when the receptionist finally turned up at the desk I informed her of the problem with the cups she barked at me to go downstairs and get my own from he bar and turned her back and walked away The list could go on broken bed, broken lights, flat pillows, noise I have trid to complain to travelodge several times via e mail and would love to speak to someone direct but they don't even have a customer services telephone number I'm not one to normally complain but I wouldn't like anyone else to have the same experience my family did. Stay in the premier inn at euston thats where we moved to and it was excellent in every way

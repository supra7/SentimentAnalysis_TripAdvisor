Loved hotel/staff/location.... BUT would NOT stay again and NEVER recommend due to "OWNERS" unfair 24hr No Show /Cancellation policy with "NO EXCEPTIONS". So if you have a medical emergency, death, weather problems, etc. you will be charged a fee regardless...basically no reason is good enough. I was charged $307.56 and i know the hotel was not even at Full capacity. I was suppose to stay 12/27 till 12/31 but due to NYC freak snowstorm airports were closed so i was detoured unable to get into NYC to check into hotel till 12/28. I even called twice on 12/27 to update hotel about my status but to them it was already past 24hr notice so it didnt matter and i was still charged. It is so disappointing that this hotel would make money that way off their customers.

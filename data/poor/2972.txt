We booked this place on the way down via the travel cupon book, and should have known better. The outside is horrific purple, which would probably appeal to children. The inside is another story. The rate quoated on the phone call 2 hours prior to our arrival was quite different than what we were charged. They were very accomodating about refunding us the difference. As in prior descriptions, the rooms are standard, small etc. The beds were so bad that one night, I slept on the floor. We asked for an extra pillow on the first night, and never saw it. The toilet and tub were clean, but the base of the tiolet, outside of the tub and inside of the bathroom door were covered in what appeared to be vomit from a previous guest. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they cleaned it up some what. The room smelled like wintergreen, the face of the A/C fell off the first night and was never changed, and the ice bag was never never replaced. Large patched areas on the walls, just makes the place look like a dump. Breakfast was standard fare, but served on a small card table with no place to eat. The rooms were not clean enough to eat in, so we ate in the parking lot. This is a below budget hotel. You can do better for the money.

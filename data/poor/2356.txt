My husband and I took our second trip to Maui June 28th through July 5th 2004. On our first trip, we stayed on the West side, and thought it would be great to see a different part of the island. We checked into the Grand Wailea on the evening of June 28th and were greeted with an overwhelming stench of mold and mildew, and a wet rug and bugs crawling on the floor. It was late, so we went to sleep dispite the smell. When we woke up in the morning, we were able to see clearly how run down and old this room was. I had terrible tightness in my chest as a result of a mold allergy. We called down stairs, and were offered a different room - upstairs one floor in a smoking room!! As though that would help with my discomfort. We decided to check out, and went to the Ritz Calton, Kapalua - where the room was fabulous and fresh for 150$ less per night and had a wonderful, healthy, remainder of our trip. I believe the price of these rooms at the Grand Wailea are an outrage.. I do not recommend this hotel AT ALL. They are relying on reputation, but do not nearly offer the luxury they promise.

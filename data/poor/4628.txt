The staff was absolutely horrible and unfriendly. The valet service blew two of my friends tires and refused to pay for it. The valet service also broke my blinker off of my steering column. The air conditioning only worked half of the time. The elevator was broken. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!! DO NOT STAY HERE.

Room had an awful musty smell as did most of the hallways. Fitness room is a joke - equipment is all in disrepair, temp set at 76 and tv is missing. Entire hotel feels damp, horrible humidity problem. AC in main lobby, hallways and elevators was broken when we checked in. I stay in hotels almost every week. This is one was by far one of the worst in ten years.

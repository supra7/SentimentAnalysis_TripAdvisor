This hotel is straight out of the 70's. Rooms are dusty, decor is old, yet prices remain high. As a frequent business traveler who stays in many hotels, this hotel was unimpressive. Worse is the service provided to platinum/status members of their frequent stay program. I asked for one hour extension on check-out on a Friday and was told to call back the next day. In fact, they told me to assume that I couldn't. Definitely do NOT stay here. Do yourself a favor and stay at a Starwood property--the W, the Westin, etc. They are a brand/chain who know how to treat customers.

To all and anyone who is planning a potential stay at the Epic hotel. Take my advice, DO NOT DO IT!!!! But, if you would like to have the absolute worst hotel experience possible, be my guest. First and worst on my list is the room service! A bib salad with romaine lettuce. When I called informing them that it wasn't butter lettuce, a very casual " sorry we should probably change the menu" reply. Secondly, black burnt grilled cheese sandwiches, a rare ordered steak frites comes back well done like a hockey puck, and no frites, but roasted potatoes. Morning coffee order never arrived. Restaurant waitstaff constantly engaging in nonsense chat with me during my meal. Whoever is running this show needs to go back to management school. To top it all off with the cleaning vacuuming outside my room door at two in the morning waking me up from a dead sleep. When I asked him to stop, he didn't understand english and kept on vacuuming until forced to call the concierge.

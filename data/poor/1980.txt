we stayed in a so-called "executive suite" an upgrade of 14 dollars a night for my daughter's graduation. we had a terrible experience. the air conditioning functions with a sensor so that it only works if it senses movement; it was 95 degrees while we were there. not only was the room broiling when we came back to it each afternoon, but the sensor in our suite, bedroom and front room, didn't sense motion while we were sleeping (big surprise) so it just turned off. We roasted -room was in high 80s both nights. Only way to get it to turn on was to get out of bed and wave hand in front of the sensor. even then ac only stayed on for about 30 minutes and then shut off again. when we complained the second night they sent an "engineer" who had no idea of what he was doing, kept talking about the sensor and saying it was fine, and then left leaving us to roast through yet another night. to add insult to injury the hotel charges $25 a night for parking and there is no place else to park nearby. Also on a busy corner with no nearby places to eat. Room was dated and shabby despite the so-called "upgrade". Save your money and go someplace else.

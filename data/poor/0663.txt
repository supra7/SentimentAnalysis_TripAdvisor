Very unfriendly receptionist who would bang the front desk counter with his fist any time we would ask him a question. Dirty carpets in the room, no blanket on the bed just a sheet (in frigid december), uncomfortable mattress, sink cracked in the bathroom and the list goes on and on. I cannot understand how this hotel can be a 4 stars. A huge disappointment.

We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite. Most of it was old and dirty. They say that it comes with full kitchen, in your dreams. Basics were missing: no plates, no cups. Air conditioning in the master bedroom did not work. Full bathroom's door lock did not work, with tree different families in the same suite. Second bathroom was only 1/2 bath. Towels were old, dirty and very rough, like a sand paper. Pool was dirty. And our car was hit by the gate while entering the parking area. And when all this was addressed with the hotel manager, she did nothing.

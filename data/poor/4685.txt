if you are over 25 do not stay here. It's a nightclub and walking past 'door staff' security guards did not feel pleasant at night. noise from on site night club vibrated through my pillow. staff were not helpful at all apart from the daytime doorman. Felt like a travel lodge with posher furniture. Stayed in better 3 stars.

and trust me- I travel for work a lot! I read another review about this hotel that basically had the same experirence, but to sum it up we also were evicted by the sercurity guard. They said we had 5 people staying in our room (there were 4 of us) and a friend of mine that came down just for the day to visit. They told us unless you are staying at the hotel you are not allowed on the property (they accused us of trespassing) also, they informed us that you are not allowed to have guests in your hotel rooms that are not staying there. We were evicted after we had been out, so they were waiting at our room for when we came back to the room. So they put 4 girls out on the street at 3 in the morning. The stafff was incredible rude and stood there while we had to try to pack everything and leave. The guard even kicked the door open at one point while we were trying to get changed and told us to change in the bathroom. I wish there was something else I could do to get the word out about this hotel and make sure no one every stays there again. Trust me if you are looking for a budget hotel there are plenty of other ones in OCMD to choose from....... STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!

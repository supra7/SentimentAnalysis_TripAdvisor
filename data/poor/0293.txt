Key points are below:  When I booked the hotel (months ago and upon recommendation from a loyal hotel customer), I requested a early check-in on 9/3 because I knew we would need to get in early (climbed Rainier and was heading to Seattle early on Saturday)  When I called on Saturday morning to confirm the early check-in, there was no record of my request but I was told we could likely get in between 1-2  We arrived at 1:30 and the room was not available  we went to get lunch and was told that we would receive a call as soon as the room was ready  We never received a call and when we arrived at 7 pm that night, the luggage had not been taken to the room  After waiting for the luggage to make its way to the room, my friend went to start getting ready and found someone elses luggage in our room (our luggage had been taken to the wrong room and we had someone elses stuff in ours)  We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our luggage and we were late to plans because of it  When I talked to Carmen, the Manager on duty, and expressed my concerns  she was nice and understanding and committed to giving us a free nights stay AND breakfast for the four adults staying in the room every morning of our stay  Sunday morning, when we sat down at the restaurant next door to enjoy our breakfast, we were told she had not honored her agreement  I talked to Isaac and he said he would only give TWO of the four breakfast for one morning (totally different from what Carmen committed to)  Isaac was unprofessional and did not appear to care that we had already wasted time and energy on a stay that was terrible I could go on and on about Carmen and Isaac and their treatment of customers, but overall, wanted to share this feedback and make you aware of how unpleasant an experience it was when we were all trying to enjoy our Rainier celebration in Seattle. It is very unfortunate.

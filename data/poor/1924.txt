Checking in was just the the start of my problems on this business trip. Slow and inefficient, the staff was unable to recommend any place for a meal, even with so many restaurants. around. We found one on our own in the rain. Each time a question was asked, we were met with shrugs and blank looks. Room was advertised with a refridge... NOT THERE. Internet NOT THERE. Although after tinkering for about an hour, a phone call to the front desk revealed that some rooms had internet disabled and it would talk a few days to fix. Then, while in my nightclothes a knock at the door. The genius at the desk decided that they should change my room so I could have internet, without asking me if I wanted to do so.. I informed the bell man at my door that I was not prepared to move. So he had to go get me new key as the desk had canceled the ones I had. After receiving my new key. I bed down for the evening only to be disturbed by housekeeping. They were insistent that I had checked out and wanted me to vacate the room. I sent them away with a not so nice tone and a phone call to the desk was made. This is just one fun thing... so many others. Screw ups on the room service menu, really BAD service at the steak house. Burned carpets, small dingy rooms...it goes on. But the worst was the bathrooms. I'm all for old world charm, but I need some space. I'm not too big, six foot.. not at all overweight. MAN IT"S TIGHT IN THERE! Without getting too descript... there's hardly a place to sit down. Believe me as funny as it may sound..I'M NOT KIDDING HERE. It's downright claustrophobic. You can't do what you came there to do. All in all.. I won't be back. The help could care less and the hotel is nothing special. I'd stay at a Holiday Inn Express before I'd go back. It isn't the money.. the job pays for that... but I wasn't comfortable, the services I needed weren't available and the people just don't care.

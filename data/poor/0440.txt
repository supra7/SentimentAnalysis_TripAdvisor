The hotel was awful. The first room they gave me had its only entrance on the parking lot directly and when I asked to move due to safety (i'm a single female) the hotel manager told me "it's completely safe we have all of our breakins on surveillance video" not exactly the response i was looking for. My second room was filthy. i pulled down the bedsheets to find someone elses hair on the pillow, wrinkles and stains. i slept on the chair. THe shower and bathroom were even worse. the spout was duct taped to the wall. oh don't waste your money...it's cheap but not worth it...there were a ton of better hotels nearby that you don't have to pay in full at check in!!!

Lead by Bubby [-], a rude and grossly incompetent manager, the Place D'Armes hotel will not only destroy your property but they will vandalize it when you confront them about it. My car was wrecked by the hotels parking attendants. When I approached the attendant most likely responsible as well as Bubby, I not only was rudely patronized but my car fell victim to vandalism. They threw rusty metal on the rear window and dumped a full ashtray in my car. It is now three weeks later and the issues have yet to be addressed by management, despite my relentless efforts. Avoid a potential encounter with these inhospitable people and book your stay elsewhere.

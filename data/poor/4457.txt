What a deceptive photo.This was recommended to me by a vegas hotels dot com website and all I can say is what a rip off! It is indeed like walking in to a human ash tray and homeless shelter.I never felt safe and worried about my belongings when I left the hotel. Outside I was constantly accosted by the down and out,many of whom I saw walking around inside the casino. It is obviously the local hang out,and I saw many times where people where checking in and paying cash for the room.That's always a bad sign. I would never stay there again,it soured me on Vegas.

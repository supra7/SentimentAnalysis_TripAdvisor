My wife and I stayed here and it was the most overpriced under performing hotel I have had the misfortune of visiting. Check in time was 3:00 but they could not manage to have a room for us before 6:00. We were supposed to have a king bed, however, they "ran out" so we were given a queen room. The air-conditioning did not work. The room was so small the TV was literally in the closet.....literally located in the closet!! There was no chair except for the uncomfortable desk chair at the small desk. The room did not have a coffee maker. The way this hotel presents itself is a complete misrepresentation of what it is.

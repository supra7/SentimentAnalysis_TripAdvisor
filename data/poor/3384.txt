Yikes! This place needs work. I booked an efficiency for a 3-night stay but got bumped to a smaller room. After a vague excuse and no apology, the concierge said that "overbooking" was a standard practice for most hotels. I was refunded only 10% of my deposit and told to contact a manager on my own dime. How rude! My kids and I were cramped in some tiny square room with 1 bed that had moldy ceilings and smelled like vegetable beef soup. The mildew in the bathroom was the worst. Yuck!

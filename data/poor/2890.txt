I have just stayed in the W hotel on Lexington for 4 days and can honestly say it was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Their motto is 'whatever you want, whenever' but this is laughable. On arrival we had to lug our own suitcases from the taxi up to the hotel room (bellboys were there but didn't assist us). We then had to ask to be moved rooms as had booked a 'spectacular suite' which turned out to be a small room with a small double bed - too small for two friends too share. We were moved from the 15th floor down to the third - same size room but with two singles. We couldn't open the windows at night to get fresh air due to the street noise and the air con was really noisy. Also, the lock on our door was broken so the keys wouldn't work. This meant that every time we wanted to get into our room we had to stand around and wait for security to come and help us. Three times we were told that the door had been fixed and each time it wasn't. We asked for compensation for this (had paid about 150 per room per night up front before arrival) and were offered a measly 50 to spend only in the bar of the hotel. And they even forgot to take this off our final room bill when we checked out! In general the hotel staff were rude and completely unhelpful. There were a few exceptions - such as the concierge and the doorman of the 'Whiskey room' bar but everyone else we came across treated us terribly (including the girl behind the bar who ignored us for 10 minutes when we were trying to get a drink and then snapped at us that it was last orders and the two women on reception when we checked out who right in front of us talked about us to each other in Spanish). It was almost like a scene from Faulty Towers! This is a prime example of style over substance - a place that looks great but fails to deliver. I will never stay in another W hotel again.

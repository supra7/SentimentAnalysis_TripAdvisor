Stayed at the Gold Spike for the weekend Friday-Sunday worst hotel experience of my life. The room was a dump very old, dirty ,tv didn't work leak in the tub and and it just looked run down and smelled horrible. They shouldn't rent these rooms for ANY price they couldn't pay ME to stay in them again. Save your money and book a hotel at a decent place in a nicer area.

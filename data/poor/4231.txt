We stayed at Harrah's this past Thanksgiving weekend from Wednesday to Sunday. The entire hotel was not very clean and smelled of smoke even in our rooms, which was on the 10th floor and was suppose to be nonsmoking. I know most casinos in Vegas smell of smoke, but this was beyond awful. When we returned home, I even had to wash my clean clothes because they all smelled of smoke. I would never waste my money to stay here again. It is a good location, but my best advice is to stay across the street at the Mirage for 20 more a night.

Luckily we only booked for three nights but even so it was not a good experience. The first room we checked into reeked of marijuana. When we informed the reception we were met by a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders and were told "ahh it happens", but no apology. We were "upgraded" to the top of the hotel but the problems did not stop there. The fire alarms were being tested for our whole stay and reading others reviews this seems to have been an ongoing problem. The majority of the walls were stripped bare in the hallway with plaster board lying around on the floor. The buffet was well stocked and the lady on the cashier counter was very polite however the rudeness of the waiting staff left a foul taste in our mouths. When asking politely for a drink, extra cutlery they were rude. I understand that hotels find it difficult to deal with the ever present prostitutes hanging around waiting for clients however I was shocked at the obviousness of the ladies working in the casino. As a female, sometimes alone playing in the casino I was made to feel very uncomfortable by the men and also the prostitutes. The pool area is large and had enough sun lougers for all guests and the pool bar staff are very friendly. Although some staff did make us feel welcome the others and other fatctors has left us never wanting to visit the Stratosphere again.

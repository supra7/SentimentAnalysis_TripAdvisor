From check in to checkout, this place was a nightmare. They insisted on taking $450 out of y debit account even though the 3 nights were all paid in advance. Then, they refused to allow access to the minibar or to the telephone and a trip to the spa was an extra $45 charge - NONE of this communicated prior to the booking. I paid more than $500 for a single on a Thursday night and was given a room overlooking the air conditioning system. I experienced the front desk staff as rude and demeaning. None of these policies are listed on their website. This hotel has a 5 star rating but I've been treated better at the Motel 6. Stay away, stay away, stay away!.

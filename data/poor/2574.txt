In response to some of the reviews I've seen, just a heads up - my husband and I had our wallets stolen, in the middle of the night, by the staff, WHILE WE WERE IN BED ASLEEP. The hotel manager nor the cops believed us - they made it sound like we just got loaded on Bourbon St. and lost them - but I'll never forget that woman's face that sauntered in and lifted our wallets casually off of the night stands - and I'll never stay there again. Ever.

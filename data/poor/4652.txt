The hotel is beautiful and we got a coupon at the visitors center that gave us free parking. Unfortunately, we did not sleep this night because we were hot in the room. The AC for the hotel controlled all the rooms. There was a light switch on the wall that did not help at all. If you are hot natured, don't stay there. Also, our remote control for the TV was not working. We requested someone to come fix it and nobody came. Also, we tried to sleep until check out but the maids were extremely noisy. So, we got up and checked out.

This has to be the worst experience I have had in a very long time. The front desk staff was rude and disrepectful. We had to wait over three hours for our room to be readied and then had to move our own bags. this is definitely NOT a five star resort. and NOT the place to stay in Phoenix!!!!!!!!!!!!

We got our stuff stolen from the hotel room (exp. laptop, iPads, smartphones, papers). Nobody cares. Their staff confirmed with us and police that the door lock was broken initially but later they decided to "forget about it" and said that the door was working properly. Their risk manager R.T. Germain ignored our phone calls and email for about a week (10-12 phone calls, about 6 answering machine messages and NO REPLY)! I just suppose he supported the thieves. Their so-called 3rd party administrators (CCMSI Las Vegas) wasted about a month trying to get any info from the hotel and finally decided that "Door was ok" and as far as we haven't used their tiny safe (no room for laptop in their safe for sure) and door was ok hotel is right and we should get the [--] out of there. It seems they haven't contacted neither Hotel Security officer who signed up our report neither police who saw the broken door lock. Stay away from the hotel who support thieves and doesn't care about visitors.

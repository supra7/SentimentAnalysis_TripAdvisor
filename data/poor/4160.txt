Stayed in a single bed room, #1000. Cold, no heat in hotel, noisy from neighbors and elevator, tilting floors, view of a wall. Maybe there are better rooms in this place but I simply went to another hotel since the heat was off throughout. Beware the hot water when taking a shower if your neighbor flushes their toilet. OUCH! Best thing about this hotel is the location. Not worth spending any waking moments in the room. If I had to stay here again, I would ask for a south facing room away from the elevator and up enough stories to see over the adjacent structure. Street side (east) is close to the elevators.

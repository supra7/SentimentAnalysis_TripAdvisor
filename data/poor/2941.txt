I was booked into this hotel by Corporate Affaris. It was competely a horrible experience. The lobby is very close to the club/bar. Very loud. The hotel tries so hard to be "hip" that it parodies itself. Techno music plays at all hours in the very small elevators (that rarely work). The room for $479 was very small with a really tiny bathroom. The bathroom actually had a whole in the wall . I could not get into the room with the entry card . I had to call Security who also struggled to open the door. It is an old run-down hotel with minimum updates that tries to market itself as a hip "in spot". I have no doubt it is a fad that will fail soon. There is nothing gracious about this place. Loud, tasteless and self-promoting from a bunch of wannabees. The bed, however, was comfortable. Avoid this hotel.

I was not pleased with this hotel in comparison to the other Hiltons and Hamptons I have stayed in. This was the worst experience thus far. The room was dusty and the heating and cooling system was out dated. The television in the room - the picture kept going out. The rate for the room was promised at $110 per night and I was actually charged $160. The attendant stated upon check in that since I was using a bank card it would charge an extra $50 to the room rate to be refunded within 5 - 7 days. This did not happen. We spent over $100 on room service and it took over an hour to be delivered. Not happy at all!

is a good description of my room. Their were two chairs with upholstry in the room and both were so stained and filthy looking I wouldn't sit on them. It appeared as if the entire hotel could use a good cleaning. I have to say the staff was pleasant and helpful. The hotel is close to free downtown public transportation but it doesn't outweigh it's faults. I would not stay here again even if I got a great bargain. If your on a budget, don't sweat it. Stay out at SEATAC(by the airport) or Tukwila for half the price and take the METRO bus in. Don't rent a car, parking is super expensive and the city bus is has a large free ride area and the bus will get you closer than you could possibly park.

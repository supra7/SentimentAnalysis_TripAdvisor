We were placed in a room directly behind ice machine and vendin g machines, We didn't sleep all night. requested a 2nd room and this was as horrible! Rooms dark,few lamps, no hair conditioner and bug bites on my ankles on morning. Beds hard, pillows flat, breakfast choice was 2 stale pastries to choose from. very expensesive. $200.00/night! Would never recommend!

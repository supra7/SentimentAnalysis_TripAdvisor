I made reservations at this hotel based on their website. The pictures are really deceiving, and do not at all reflect the real condition of the hotel. Sure wish I would have checked around! The first room we were given was not was we had reserved. The second one wasn't either and was infested with monstrous cockraoch looking bugs. Just one word for this one: Eeeeeeew!

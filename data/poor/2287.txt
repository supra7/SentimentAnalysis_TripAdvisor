The old saying you get wot you pay for , Super 8 suits people on a budget and being my 2nd trip in 4 week to vegas did the job for me .Pool closes no carpet on floors smeel in rooms good shower beds disgusting and the location is about 1/2 mile to bellagio on the strip.Use flamingo road and join strip at ballys dont try to get to mgm at night from koval lane NOW heres the problem The staff rude , down rite ignorant , we walked into recepition 1 nite and they were in the middle blocking the area off we stumbled across the floor quickly as not to get trapped and wot a mouthful from the young girl on reception , we decided to say sorry and headed off to our room before we got there security was waiting and asked us to vacate the hotel for intimadating the receptionist wot happened next was frightning the security guys decided to flex his muscles and was prepared to have an actual punch up luckly we talked our way out of it and used the side entrance at ellis island casino for the next few nights . seriously i wouldnt stay here again i travel to vegas for boxing and will not set foot back inside this (wot did someone call it ) a little gem your having a laugh .

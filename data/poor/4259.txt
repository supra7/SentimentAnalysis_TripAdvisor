I stayed here Monday through to Sunday, for a variety of business sessions. Check-in was a pain, a 45 minute queue to check-in is unacceptable in any hotel, especially after a 10+hours flight, lots of desks empty but only 4 staff on, one of whom left half way through. I eventually got checked-in by someone who obviously didn't want to be there & was borderline surly & no apology. The room in the Mardi Gras tower is quite scruffy & in desperate need of redecorating. No tea making facilities only a coffee percolator which you cannot make tea with. Starbucks has long queues most of the time & becomes expensive at $3.19 per cup of tea. Queues for breakfast are also massive & again unhappy, miserable staff. The pool is closed, I never worked out why, other hotel pools were open! Check out is a miserable 11:00 which they would only grudingly extend until is 12. Check out was a lenghty process again taking 35 minutes, with only 30% of the desks occupied. I did at least get an apology for the delay this time though. I know you can Express check out but over the years I've had enough wrong bills to know that correcting them after the event is a lengthy process. For $61 a night it is accommodation but grim & basic. The queues for food in there & the enforced check out time meant I left for the airport very early & preferred to eat at Burger King.

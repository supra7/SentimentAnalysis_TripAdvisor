The photos on the website looked good, but in person, please!! The building we stayed in was between two other buildings that the resort did not own. They were boarded up abandoned buildings sharing a common drive with some welfare type apartments behind it. They were covered with graffiti and plastic sheets for windows. These buildings appeared on the resort map as open space until you drove to the area and saw them in person. When we asked if the area was safe to walk to and from our room we were told security would escort us if we wanted it. The rooms were old and outdated, the bed was uncomfortable. The only good thing was the closeness to the strip and other casinos. When we asked the desk person about the abandoned buildings they told us that they(the buildings) were bought up by MGM who just bought the Imperial Palace next door and were trying to buy up all the surrounding properties. Maybe they were trying to devalue the resort to get a total property take over. The sales staff told us the buildings were owned by the resort and have not been renovated yet. Didn't know who to believe there. No one even tried to sell us any time there. Thank goodness. I guess if you stayed in the main building it would be like a hotel room. Luckily our rental car was not vandalized or stolen.

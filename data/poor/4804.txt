Dont stay: BEDBUGS!! I stayed here for 4 days for a work function. I was bitten by bedbugs and even worse, I ended up bringing some back to my apartment! I called and called and no one ever got back to me to offer an apology or say that they had taken care of the problem. Bedbugs are horrible and if you don't want any I suggest booking a different hotel!

It is 1:30 am, Monday, and we haven't been able to sleep yet in our room at the Wynn. We are on the 38th floor facing the golf course, & the loud music & the pounding bass from the GROUND floor is vibrating the plate glass window, the walls, & every cell in my body. When we called down to the desk to complain, we were told it was their nightclub, & Will I Am was performing. The show will be over at 4 am. Evidently that explanation was supposed to make everything alright. When we weren't impressed & asked for another room, she said there weren't any vacant rooms, but they would give us a $150 credit on our tab. Also she promised to ask the club to turn down the volume. They didn't. After reading the other numerous complaints dating back to 2008, I think the staff is toying with me. This is nothing new to them. We are booked for two more nights, but we are checking out tomorrow. $150 just isn't enough compensation for 3 sleepless nights.

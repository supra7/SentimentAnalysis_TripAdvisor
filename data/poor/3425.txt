I was visiting New York for the first time. Me and my boyfriend decided to stay at the Beekman Hotel for our first night. When I got there, the hotel seemed nice and the staff was very helpful. But when we got to our room, what a disappointment! It just seemed old and dirty. The bathroom was not nice and when I took a 5 minute shower, water just flooded all over the bathroom. The bed was also very uncomfortable and it got very cold during the night.(even though we tried to adjust it). I did not get much sleep. Before we arrived I had sent them an email, but never got an answer. Poor service. Also. I brought my ipod with me. I took it out of my purse the night we got to the hotel, when we were going out to dinner. The morning after, when I was packing, I could not find my ipod anywhere. I contacted the hotel several times but never got any answers. I am extremely unhappy with my stay at the hotel and my ipod was probably stolen. The rest of my trip was spent at the Manhattan Hilton hotel, which was so much better in every apsect. And I got it for the same price. Seriously, spend your money on another hotel.

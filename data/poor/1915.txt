Having planned on seeing Boston for my 50th Birthday I chose the Park Plaza, staying in The Towers section for the extra service. There was no extra service; the daily breakfast was either out (no food) upon arrival to the concierge room, or they were cleaning early, stating the time for breakfast during the week ended earlier than the weekend. That was not found anywhere in the literature when booking. With the time difference it meant you had to eat VERY early or not at all. Having paid extra to be pampered this was definitely not the hotel to stay for pampering. The concierge was to have put an itinerary together for me, and I never heard from him again. Needless to say the concierge was not typically present, and when they were at the desk they ignored you unless you engaged in conversation; see previous sentence regarding end result on request. The pictures of the rooms you see online are not what you get. The rooms are old, and very small. A queen size bed, desk and dresser took up the whole room wih just a small walk-way around them. While this hotel is convenient to the park, there are other hotels more convenient to activities in Boston, and probably more prone to customer satisfaction. Dissatisfied and defninitely do not recommend. In addition, my brother-in-law's mom died and we requested to leave early through Hotel.com, but I was told Park Plaza would not allow a refund for the one day early departure. Never mind Hotel.com advertises changes are accomodated. Very misleading as far as I'm concerened.

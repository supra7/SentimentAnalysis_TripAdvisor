we had 2 couples and children we also met up with other friends and family first when we went to check in i noticed on our paper work it said you could not have any company in your room and when we went to go up to go get some rest myself and my friend went up first with the children our other halves tryed to come in 20 mins later and the gentalmen told them it was to many people in the room but we had already told the ladie that checked us in how many of us it was but my opinion is it was because they were black and we were white because we all had been in and out that hotel all day with no problems then when we went to pull the sheets back there were dirty underware sticking out between the boxspring and mattress not to mention the bathroom sink was being held up with a 2x4 this was my first ever ocean visit it turn out not so well because of this hotel

I have stayed at Hyatt hotels in almost every major city. I work for the 4th largest engineering and construction company in North America... and I travel for work. We have corporate accounts with Hyatt, Westin and a few others... The Hyatt Regency Maui was one of the worst experiences of my life. It's so bad.. that I will never stay at one again. Here it is.... About 3 weeks ago I made reservations for 10 nights. Partial ocean view room with a King Size bed. We arrived at about 11 pm from our flight, and here is what we got. 1. They changed our reservations to two double beds, and claimed that my wife and I booked two double beds instead of a king size. At first I was slightly annoyed, as they tried to pin the blame on me.... but at the same time there was another couple beside us that was facing the same issue. EVEN... if it was my fault (which I highly doubt that I would book to double beds with my wife)... they forgot the single golden rule (customer is always right)... they should have humored me... try to make it a little better. But they did nothing... they just blamed us... and the other married couple beside us. 2. Once when they stated that the hotel was fully booked and they could accomodate a us with a king size bed... I left the situation alone until the concierge hands me this piece of paper with my room key that explained that they were doing construction everyday from 9am to 4pm. It made sense now what they changed our king size room... they were probably fixing most of the place for the busy December season. I am so mad at the fact that they did NOT tell me about the construction while I was making my reservation... or email me this update anytime prior to showing up. REDICULOUS. I checked out the very next morning as the sounds of saws and jack hammers was not what I was expecting from a $330 / night room... plus.. the main lobby area was covered in scaffolding... oh, and also, the valet was at the back corner of the hotel. It took us about 10 minutes to walk to our room. So in the end... I checked into the Westin down the street, and here is what the Hyatt missed out on... $330 / night @ 10 nights = $3300 Beach cabana @ $55/day = $550 Breakfast @ $45 / day = $450 Drinks by the beach $50 / day = $500 Valet @ $20 / day = $200 Grand total for just this one trip = $5000 (approx.) That's nothing in the grand scheme of things..... but I will never go to a hyatt (or andaz hollywood) ever again. I fly approximately 58 flights a year.. Whoever is reading this at Hyatt... you lost a customer. Permanently. PS. The younger lady that was working at approximately 11pm on Monday, October 17th at the makeshift concierge / express check in desk needs a lesson in customer service. She was a major reason for my leaving.

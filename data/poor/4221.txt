Hi we stayed here on the 28th Jan for 2 nights on our way to Sydney. We arrived at the hotel complete with our luggage after a long flight from Heathrow. We made our way to the check-in area and we welcomed by a smart young lady who was apparently a trainee, However, she did have a member of staff with her watching her every move. My travelling party consisted of me and my same sex partner. We were asked whether we wanted two singles or a double bed, I asked for a double bed and were asked a further 3 times what type of bed we wanted. We could not believe what we were hearing. A service industry and they hadnt come across gay people before, for gods sake, there was various airlines staying in the hotel we werent the only gay people they had come across. We found this very embarassing at check in with the whole of the staff looking at us as though we were monsters with 2 heads. We did speak to the manager on the way out with no joy. Other than that the hotel was clean, they had complete floor renovations going on during the day. We did find it hard to relax in the hotel in the day if you popped back to the hotel for and hours sleep. My final word is be aware of the evening buffet we asked for the menu at breakfast for the evening meal which they showed us but when it came to the evening we were pushed into the buffet evening meal.

Just to be clear - I did not stay at this hotel. I tried to stay at this hotel and while booking with Travelocity, I was assured rooms were available for my dates. I went through the multiple steps (including giving my credit card # twice) to book the room. The last step said "ERROR - no rooms avialble". OK, fair enough, Travelocity isn't the hotel. Let's call the hotel directly. Two phone calls - no one picks up either time and a machine answers saying they will call the customer back - no return phone call. Forget it. Plenty of other places to stay in SF!

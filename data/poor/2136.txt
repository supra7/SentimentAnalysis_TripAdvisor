My husband stayed at this property for a business meeting. During his 3 day stay, his leather bag full of business items was stolen from his conference room. After being told by security and the facilities director that the problem would be looked into, no resolution was provided. My husband then escalated the quest for his bag to the General Manager. After many phone calls and checking back, the bag was not found. In the end no answers were given. A co-worker had boots stolen from her hotel room the same weekend, and the thief was caught ON CAMERA! The hotel did pay for the boots, but I don't know if the thief was fired. After experiencing not one but TWO incidents of stolen personal items, I would strongly caution anyone from staying at this property.

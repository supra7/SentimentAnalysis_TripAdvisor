We booked this hotel for 2 nights and left after the first only because it was pre-paid and we could not find another hotel. The room smelled like a gym locker. The bathroom looked 'reasonably' clean, but the tub needed replacing.... When I stepped into the tub the floor of the tub felt 'sloshy' and it had several cracks. As your moved around in the tub it felt like there was water beneath it and it was sloshing around. I think there was water under there - old, rotten, diseased bath water. The bath drain would not stay in open position so that made it worse. The bad thing is that we could of booked another 5 star hotel for about $5 dollars more over by the space needle, but we were not familiar with that area. I would check the room pryor to signing any papers and I would not pre-pay for rooms in this hotel.

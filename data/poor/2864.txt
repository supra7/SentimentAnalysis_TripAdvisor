Room okay, mattress not great. Elevator ridiculously black so you can't see to insert your room card to operate the damn elevator. V. expensive for what the hotel offers. Staff trying desperately to be cool but come across as charmless, unhelpful and NY rude. Would I stay there again? N.O. not at their prices.

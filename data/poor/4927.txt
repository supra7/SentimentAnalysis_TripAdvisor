I signed to buy a membership in January 2011. They promised heaven and stars. When I called to make reservations and use my membership, "You need to pay extra 600.00 dollars for that weekend. The week you have is in other month. So, after paying 5,5400.00 for initial payment and monthly payments of 525.00 I couldn't even book a room. What is this???? MISLEADING INFO SO YOU CAN BUY AND LATER YOU CANNOT FIND A SOUL TO COMPLAIN.... I really hope that someone can do something about all of us who believed in their words!!!!

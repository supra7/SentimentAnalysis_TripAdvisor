I am a Westin gold member. This is by far the least nice Westin I have ever stayed in....and the most expensive. It is an old, ill kept, unclean hotel inside the rooms with none of the quality of typical Westins. I could not be more disappointed. The pools and beach are nice for your kids --but so are the pools and beaches at other hotels with better prices or better values. This feels like a tourist rip-off. Don't waste your money or points here!!

We bought a package stay and they debited our charge card 3 weeks before we arrived. That was okay, but when we arrived at 5:30, they didn't have a room for us! It took 1/2 hour to get it straightened out. They offered to buy us something in the cafe while we waited. Once we got our room, we started to go leave the cafe, and we were chased down by an employee and they shouted at us in the foyer that we needed to sign for the food. We had to explain the whole situation to them and finally convinced them to talk to the manager. They didn't have any vending machines for soda, and didn't go out of their way to try to help find one. Most of the employees I dealt with were not very accomodating or friendly. There was lots of car noise in the room, and when the wine train went by, they woke us up with their constant blowing of their horn.

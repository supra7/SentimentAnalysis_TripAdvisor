My husband and I as well as our 12 week old twin sons stayed at the Best Western Avalon in New Orleans from October 17, 2008-October 19, 2008 and it was a horrible experience. We had stayed at this hotel numerous times prior to Hurricane Katrina and the hotel was nice and clean. However, the hotel has supposedly been recently renovated since the storm, but it has NOT. The hotel from the second floor up has a very bad musty odor in the hallways and in the guest rooms. The carpet in the rooms are dirty and have not been replaced and do not look like they have been cleaned, the light fixtures and lamps have rust on them, the sheets are dingy and the towels are thin and rough. The air conditioner doesn't get real cold and the unit has an odor that comes out when it first comes on. Do not waste your money on this hotel because it could be hazadous to your health and indeed harzadous to your wallet.

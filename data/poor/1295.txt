First there were no hairdryers or mini fridges in the rooms. (Both were listed in the decription of the hotel.) When I went to ask for a hairdryer, they gave me one with a broken plug-in which I didn't notice was broken until I got back up to my room. They did give me another one, but the other guests that were traveling with us needed one too and they were told I had the last one. The hot/cold nozzle on the shower didn't work so you had to "search for warm" or either have just Hot or Cold water. Only one towel was returned so I had to share a towel with my spouse. The ceilings were coming down as well as the baseboards. There was no shuttle either as was advertized in the description. We had to call taxi's. I would NOT recommend this hotel at all.

Walked in, no reservations on a Wed night. We were not planning to spend the night in Boston but were exhausted at 10pm after a long day of sightseeing and decided to get a room. We were a bit bedraggled from a long day of touring in 95* heat. We had no luggage and were carrying a bottle of wine not finished from dinner. We probably looked a little scary & rough but were politely escorted to the side door in an alley because of lobby construction. We were turned down immediately upon asking if a room was available. We were told they are busier on a weeknight than on the week-ends (huh?). The front desk clerk began listing hotels that had availability along with the prices of the rooms. When we said price was not an issue, he continued to quote prices. We politely thanked him and left, vowing to never try this hotel or any Millenium properties again. Checked their website the next day - rooms were available.

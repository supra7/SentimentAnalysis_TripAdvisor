From Westin Collection department (my first letter of such in my life) with an Intrawest letterhead saying I left my room without paying... the resort fee of 23 odd dollars. I know we could have a long talk about those fee but is it not worse to collect people 9 months after because of a mistake from the hotel. I would not dare to ask for points after that period of time and especially for such a trivial amount. Watch yall, you gonna get the nasty letter soon because it seem to have been a widespread mistake as the letter was not even personalised. Called Corporate Service at Starwood, which I encourage you to do as it automatically require formal complaint response from the hotel GM. If they are flodded with complaints, maybe they will understand that were more business oriented and that the man-hour invested will offset the money collected. I feel like the hotel must feel when a guest leave with the towels: its cheap especially when your staying in a 4 star.

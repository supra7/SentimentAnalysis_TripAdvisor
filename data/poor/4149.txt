I booked my room online. Two double beds. When I got there, the room had ONE bed. When I went down to the front desk the girl behind the counter very extremely rude and said that it was what I asked for! I finally got thru to them that I wanted another room. I was travelling with my teenage son. No way were we going to share a bed, and besides, it wasn't what I paid for. After acting like she was doing me the biggest favor in the world, we got another room. There were two beds, but the bathroom was dirty and the carpet unvacuumed. The a/c didn't work right and parts of the tv/cable package didn't work right. Complaints were dealt with an "Oh well." attitude. I filled out their in room questionaire describing how unhappy I was. It was ignored.

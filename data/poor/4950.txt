In over 15 years of RCI exchanges, this is by far the most unimpressive, low-rent crack-house apartment complex we have ever stayed in! (No offense to any crack addicts reading this.) The place has zero charm. Our second-story one bedroom unit was reached via a outside stairwell. The ancient airconditioners stick out in front of every unit. And when you wanted to cool off, geez were they ever loud! However, you need to keep your bedroom door open to catch the breeze from the one a.c. machine given to each condo apartment. How can they get away with this? Simple: they intend to rip the whole thing down to the ground next year as they have been bought out and will demolish the place to make way for a new glitzy Vegas hotel complex. So why should they care? They don't. (But you might....)

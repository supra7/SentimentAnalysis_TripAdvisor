I stayed at the Magnolia two years ago and wasn't very impressed by the service, but this trip was forced to stay there due to no vacancies in the other convention hotels. The room was dirty especially the bathroom. The valet takes an hour to get your car. They have a "cookie hour" but ran out of cookies after ten minutes and didn't get any more. The Starbucks on site wasn't open at the time they state on the door. Overall, a terrible experience. I went home to find that I was charged $2.70 for laundry starch; when I called to say that I had no laundry done while there, I had to deal with a surly employee and am still waiting for my refund. I'll never stay there again.

things have changed at Harrah's. The staff is not as friendly as in years past. the food is just ok at best. The range restuarnt is not good as in the past stays. The gaming tables have increased the min. bets. The slots are tighter than a riverboat casino. All in all ovoid Harrah's. Try another casino.

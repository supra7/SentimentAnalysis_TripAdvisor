I went on holiday to the USA over the last 2 weeks, staying at 3 seperate hotels, and can honestly say this is the worst. It is one of the worst I have stayed in anywhere. The room was small and ill-appointed, with no bath tub, and a coffee maker which did not work. My husband is handicapped, and was offered a wheelchair on the first night, but this was taken away from us after that. It was also very difficult for him to get into the bar, but that did not matter so much as it seemed to close at approximately 10pm. The final straw was when I found a cockroach in the room - this must be one of the dirtiest places in the USA!

Spend your money somewhere else After returning from vacation, I wanted to warn future travelers to stay away from the Queen Anne. The room contained a outlet without a cover, a tissue holder holding on by one screw, and a shower which came completely apart during a shower. When we tried to check if the repair was completed to the shower or another room was needed, we were informed they were sold out and nothing could be done if the shower was still broken. I would have rather spent a little bit more and got a better hotel. I will not return to the Queen Anne.

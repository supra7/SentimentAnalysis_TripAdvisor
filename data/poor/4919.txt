Worst Vacation of my life! Beyond the worst vacation of my life! If you want to go to this hotel I reccomend you learn spanish, bring your own food and booze (it was so watered down there\'s no point to even drinking it) and a face mask as the fumes from the ridiculous amount of trolly's, motor bikes, and garbage trucks are enough to kill the healthest lungs. You better be a smoker because no-smoking does not exist, and don\'t expect clean towles, or sheets. If you have young femals traveling with you, keep your eyes on them as the many of the men working there are very rude and inappropriate. I will not be back!

I needed to be in singapore for meetings I had to attend and the company booked a room for me in ascott raffles as they said it's new better try them. Everything will be shouldered by the company but while checking in the staff ruth told me the company is not paying for it and I have to pay in advance! that [--] me off (add that to a very long flight) i told them to contact the booker but since it's at 1900H then they are going to do that the next day BUT I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TIME BEING,FOR THE WHOLE STAY! i wanted to walk out but was to tired to do so so did not argue anymore. hate the staff. Stayed for more than a week there but [--] I hate the service. The staff are im sorry but stupid cannot get what im trying to say. The name is marie? I only wanted the internet to be fixed but it took a long time for them to do that as in 5 hours! i needed to send some reports to my boss back in UK for a presentation a few hours before! Meetings after meetings naturally I get tired. guess what? i can't even have a nice sleep as I can hear the cars and buses from the street. I guess their windows aren't sound proof! few hours before checking out I told them to prepare the bill as I will be in a tight schedule before my flight. when i came to the reception they have not prepared my bill! and charged me for breakfasts that should be included with my room rate! when i told the staff about the breakfast, she even argued with me! so i asked for the manager, guess what no manager came! the supervisor corrected my bill but took so long add that to the fact that i will be late for my flight. it was a horrible experience in the ascott. i wont even talk to them or listen to them anymore for all the trouble they caused me. WORST HOTEL EVER BEEN TO.

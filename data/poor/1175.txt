I checked into the Downtown Hilton Miami on February 15, 2011 around 7:45 p.m., got in bed around 10:30 p.m. and found a pair of dirty socks still in the bed. I had to call for management twice and after the second try, some one from housekeeping came up, but spoke no English and did not understand what I need. I tried to explain to her that I wanted bed strip down and room throughly clean. After that fail attempt, I call for management again to send someone to room who can understand/speak English. This time the housekeeping supervisor came up. The night manager on duty gave me free breakfast during the length of my stay, but it was clearly obvious, I was lying in an unclean bed. The next day, I ask for the manager's name and phone number. I proceeded to call Benny -- and left several messages and as to date, I have not received a call back. That night should have been given to me free..... in addition to the free breakfast.

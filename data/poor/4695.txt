We spent only one night December 24, 2011. The first impression at the reception was not bad. But after opening the door of the room almost threw up from the terrible stench of mold. Most of the ceiling was covered with mildew and stains. Bathroom dirty and disgusting, mold everywhere. Old, yellowed towels. almost all carpet in the room was damp and sticky (I suspect that the reason for this is that stench in the room). Generally, all the equipment room was very old and damaged. But that's not all. We thought: ok, this is only one night, it is already late, somehow hold out. We decided to sit in the Jacuzzi on the outside. when he approached, I felt a strong smell of chlorine, but I thought ok, used it to disinfect. I managed to withstand just a few minutes, I started to bake my eyes and skin. When I went out with whirlpool saw with horror that MY BATHING SUIT DISCOLORED DUE TO MASSIVE DOSES OF BLEACH IN THE WATER!!!!!!!. simply could not believe it. I went immediately to the front desk and showed what happened. I was so angry that I told the manager to call immediately, but it just was not him. Receptionist (Amid?, Sorry, I do not remember the name) called to him and started talking in a foreign language. When I asked to speak in English because I want to know the content of the conversation, rolled his eyes and looked at me like an idiot. This place is terrible, dirt, grime and dirt again. STAY AWAY, IT'S A WORST HOTEL EVER

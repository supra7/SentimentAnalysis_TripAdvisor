The Point, what a disappointment! For the first time the reviews on trip advisor were nothing that I was expecting. I will never stay there! Good location and good room size, thats it! I stayed there for 10 days (prepaid) and they only cleaned the room once, what a dirty place to stay! They forgot to replace the room towels at least 3 times! Maids came in to clean and they cleaned my daughters perfume. I talked to the housekeep manager, Adriana dos Santos, and she did nothing!!! She just said that the hotel had no responsibility! Do we need to keep kids perfumes in a safe? It really ruined my stay in Florida. I definitely do not recommend this hotel to anyone!

We were aware of the lobby & pool renovations but not told that there were rooms also being remodeled. That noise was the worst. Our ocean view room was of the trees and hotel next door that was being remodeled. Front desk said Ocean View and partial ocean view are the same. Our couch was found after dumpster diving--ripped with stuffing coming out. $12 a day to park--at the risk of your life! You are given a notice to beware of falling cement and slippery puddles when parking in the garage. Difficult to get parking amid the trucks and materials, let alone trying to get out if you got blocked in. You have access to the pool next door, but if you want a lounge chair for the beach its $10 a day. We're made to feel like we are the inconvenience and mgmt doesn't care about the complaints or try to make your stay more comfortable. Even if the renovations come out spectacular, its for that reason that I would never stay there again.

Sorry not even reasonable for the price. Some homeless people in the region had more comfortable accomodations. July 4 weekend it was 109/night, we were desperate because most places sold out. Window was busted up and didn't close, fine for the temprature, realy bad for the nose, exhaust of cars out front and the constant fear of gun point robbery. The front desk staff and manager was AWFUL. Lied to us about rooms on phone, watched him lie to potential customers coming in. Def. crack deals and hooker situations going on in one of the corner rooms. It was just so horrible. Don't do it.

We stayed here over New Years Eve 2004-2005 and beyond. Their Website totally exaggarates the ambiance. You will be disappointed. Our furniture was broken, plumbing bad, and lights out.Though the hotel is NOT well maintained, damp, and claustrophobic: this does not begin to compare to the rudeness, condescending manner, and just plain lack of helpfulness from the front desk staff we encountered. Whether day or night, the person(s) at the front desk wanted nothing to do with you. The housekeeping and security staff were just the opposite however (kind and caring); perhaps they should switch roles ! One of our party took seriously ill during our stay (later requiring hospitalization). When asked for help in placing a phone call, even reheating some food for this person, we were rudely dismissed and ignored with a scowl. Upon checking out, we witnessed a phone conversation whereupon the desk clerk yelled at the caller, told them it was "not his job" and hung up ! This is not the Hospitality industry I expected in New Orleans ! I will be writing a letter to the Hotels owners though I am not sure if it will make it past the front desk staff. Overall, a terrible stay here at the Chateau...though New Orleans, the City, is incredible ! Avoid the Chateau !

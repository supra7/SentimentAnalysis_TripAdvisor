My friends and I planned a girls vacation and were so excited. Our first impression of the room was that it felt a little old but we had an ocean view and a balcony so we were happy. That night as two of our friends fell asleep in their beds, the roaches started to come out. For hours we scanned the walls and smashed/caught them and put them into a ziplock bag to show the manager. We killed a total of 15 roaches before we switched hotels at 4am. We moved across the parking lot to the Best Western (cheaper, cleaner, friendlier staff--still with an ocean view!) The security guard at the Best Western actually helped us move all of our stuff across and up into our new, clean room. At the Surfer, we were in room 301 right above their restaurant which made us wonder what we really had for lunch that day! The desk clerk never apologized or offered to move us into a new room. Don't stay at this hotel!! I haven't read anything else on here about roaches (I checked these reviews before we even went) but where there's 15 in one room there's bound to be more! You've been warned!

We stayed here on March 17, 2012 for my birthday. When we arrived to check in everything was great included the front desk staff yet when we were shown our room, we were terribly disappointed! We reserved a suite but that is not what we got. We then called back down to speak to a manager but after waiting in our room for over 30 minutes, we decided to go down and just check out. Once we got down stairs and spoke to someone we were told to wait a few minutes more because the manager wanted to speak to us.... Well, another 15 and we are still ready to leave the hotel but just as we get up to leave, the manager finally decided to make an appearance. We were told they made a mistake and were sorry for the wrong room so then gave us the right one. Our luggage was then brought up to our new room, which was okay, but not worth the price. We had a nice time that day at the pool but need better service down there because there are not enough chairs and when we did get a place we were stuck with our empty drink glasses and food trays for the rest of the day. Anyways, later that night around 11 pm, we returned back to the room from Howl at the Moon with some friends, who were also staying at the hotel. From then on we had 3 different meets with the "Security Officer" who kept saying we were being too "loud"! I called down to the desk to speak with a manager but of course no one was available, about 10 minutes later we got a call back from one but did nothing to recitify the situation. Once again I informed then we will be more than happy to check out and never come back because I didnt know it was against the rules to have people in our sitting room that late at night just talking. There was no music on, no tv, and no loud noises, so I'm really unsure where this loud noise from our room was coming from. I will never stay here again and will make sure everyone we know never stays there as well, as we expected far better from such a well known hotel!!

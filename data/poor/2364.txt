The manager was great and moved us to another room and said he would take that room "out of service" but the next room was not much better. This place is so run down. It's just awful. All we kept hearing about is how they were going to remodel but that doesn't help us now. We were suppose to stay 4 nights but left after one night and stayed at the Fairmont which is more expensive but so worth the difference. At the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, the staff, the location, the view... all nice... but the hotel? It's just yuck!

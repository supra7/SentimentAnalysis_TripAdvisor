A/C-heat does not work, however Staff did supply a tiny "space heater" 9-8-11' Toilet flushes slowly and 9-10-11, upon flushing, it EXPELLED the entire bowl of human (my) waste onto the bathroom floor. - Staff (M) offered me a "free breakfast" when I reported the disgusting situation and threaten to have Security remove me from the Hotel when I declined the breakfast offer and pressed the Desk Manager for the Hotel Manager's name and telephone contact information. The Manager's name was given as Rob --, but he couldn't be contacted on a weekend. I had obviously pre-paid or Security might have been needed. I WOULD NOT GO NEAR THIS HOTEL AGAIN EVEN IF SOMEONE HAD ME AT GUN POINT !!! (One of the two "Desk Managers (C. S.) did agree to and accompanied me at my request to the room to witness the disgusting mess in person)

I was very unhappy with this Travelodge. It was semi-clean and very beat up. Broken toilet, broken facet, baseboards and bottom of doors chipped and just beat the heck up.Pillows were flat - only two on the double bed provided. The blanket was dirty, had someone else's hair on it.The porch was dirty and the plastic chair on the porch was broken.This was a 1960's hotel that has not been remodeled. The carpet seemed to be semi-new, but everything else, furniture, beds seemed to be very old and worn and beat up.I'd never go back. The only reason to stay there is that it's a Quick Shuttle stop.

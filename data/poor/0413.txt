We were the only guests at this poorly maintained motor inn marketed as a hotel on various travel sites. I should have known the second I saw what appeared to be a lagoon shaped pool of toxic waste in front of the place. "Is that a pool?" I asked my boyfriend. "It must have been," he replied. The checkin process was rather strange and the coffee in the lobby was empty, apparently until further notice. The internet was not currently functional on the circa 1998 computer made available to users in the lobby. Under strict supervision and with frequent reprimands. Wireless internet was not available. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room which featured two Queen size beds and a roomy (but semi functional) bathroom. We were exhausted the first night of our two night stay and fell asleep without noticing the substandard air quality and freezing temperatures. It was literally close to freezing in our room and despite numerous calls to the front desk we were not even given extra blankets to ease the chill. We woke the next morning to the front desk pounding on our door telling us it was time to go, although we were planning to stay two nights and had prepaid on line. We went downstairs to consult the woman's computer but unfortunately the whole system was down. Since we were the only guests they elected not to offer the usual continental breakfast. With no where within easy walking distance to get food we looked at one another and said, "let's bounce". We then snuck out the side door at the far end of the pool to avoid having to explain this to the front desk lady. The stay was, without a doubt, the creepiest I have experienced. I would never stay here again, I can't even look at the place without cringing!

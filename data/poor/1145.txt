We stayed at Euston Travelodge for one night and that was one too many! To say the room was small would be an understatement. It was the width of a double with 18 inches either side. The shower and bathroom were equally as small with the shower being lukewarm at best. The bed was probably the worst in the world! Imagine trying to sleep on a jelly with the cocktail sticks pushed into it, then you will have an idea of how bad this bed was. Our room was on the ground floor next to a busy junction with constatnt traffic noise throughout the night and thios combined with the jelly mattress meant a very pooor nights sleep was had by both of us. The staff were not interested in moving us to a quieter comfier room despite several requests, oh and don't try to check in 1 hour early. I was told it was not possible as our room wasn't ready but then miraculously it was ready if we paid 10. We went to the pub next door for an hour and spent 10 on food and drink and at least had something to show for it. Are there any good points about this "hotel"? Just the one, it was clean. We moved from here to the Hilton at Kensington and this showed how a hotel should be run.

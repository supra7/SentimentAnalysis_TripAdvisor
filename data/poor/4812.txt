Terrible Sadly, discovered ,after the fact, that many of the very negative reviews of this hotel were completely accurate.Arrived at 9PM .Had to search for a bellhop, who later abandoned my lagguage in the hotel lobby. A bad omen of things to come! This issue however is trivial in comparison to the incredibly noisy and sleepless nights we endured in this hotel. As mentioned in many reviews, you can clearly hear toilets being flushed in the adjacent rooms. In our case the ancient plumbing actually banged as if someone were hammering on the wall! Also, even from the six floor, huge air-conditioning unitslocated on the lobby roof below roared like the diesel engine on a bus. Second room we were moved to was even worse. Originally designed as a suite, there was a two inch gap at the bottom of the door seperating our bedroom from the bedroom next door. Was stunned as it became occupied at 3AM. Could clearly hear our neighbors. It was as if all four of us were staying in the same room. I spent the remainder of that night sitting in the hotel lobby, furious!Finally, on our third night, we were switched to an acceptable room, which was quiet! Objectively, though understaffed and poorly managed, the front desk staff was receptive. If you are lucky enough to get a decent room, you might well enjoy your stay at the Mark Hopkins. If not, you could be in for the worst hotel experience imaginable. Be advised!

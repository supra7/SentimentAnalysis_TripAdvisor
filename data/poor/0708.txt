I thought the Hotel had changed, according to its new publicity, but it has not. Got there at 9:00 and there was only a security guard, no registrar, no keys to a reserved room....an hour of wait for the already paid room to be opened. Only 5 rooms occupied with people in the whole place.....hhhmmmmm. Sounds bad.... I will never go there anymore. I didn't feel safe there. In the morning, I only saw executives leaving alone, like if it was a secluded romance encounter for lovers. shame, shame shame.....

This was the worst hotel I ever stayed in. The staff bickered at the front desk and gave people a hard time over the phone while patrons were standing in front of them. My first night, I had no functioning air conditioning or ventilating of any kind and it was a HOT night. My room was stiffling. I asked to be moved but they claimed they had no other room available. I had to take cold showers during the night and hardly slept. I moved without assistance late afternoon on the second day. The new room had functioning HVAC but was grimy and the carpet wreaked of urine. I was repulsed but didn't have the energy for another battle. Seeing the room rateds now on this website I realize I was really taken to the cleaners. I paid $600 to an online booking service for these 4 miserable nights.

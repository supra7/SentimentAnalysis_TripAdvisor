I booked on Booking.com one month prior to my stay and then had to cancel due to the prospect of a British Airways strike. After having received a cancelation email from booking.com that I would not be charged (my actual check-in date was not for another month) - the hotel still deducted the first night from my Amex card. After contacting both Booking.com and the hotel directly with 6 emails I have yet to hear a response to credit back my account. Therefore my advice would be to stay away from both Booking.com and also Red Roof as they are just money grabbers without any care for customers. If you want a decent hotel in Orlando book directly with Extended Stay as I did this and had a hassle free, enjoyable stay.

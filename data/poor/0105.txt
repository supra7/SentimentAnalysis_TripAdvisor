Stayed at the Crowne Plaza in May 2007 for 4 nights during a business trip. I reserved a room at the "Executive Club Level" for  351 per night ! And besides that you have to pay $ 9.95 per day for wireless internet access, come on! I couldn't believe my eyes when I entered my club level room. Only basic furniture in the room, completely outdated and wornout, the desk chair could not be raised and was far too low for me, there was no other comfortable chair, colors from the seventies. The only good thing is the stunning view over Seattle from the 32nd floor. The club level has its own lounge with complementary beverages and snacks. However, it is closed on Fri and Sat. Can you believe this? Why do I book on the club level then and pay a lot of money for that? Don't forget anything when you go out because it takes ages to go up and down with the elevators. The only good thing is the location, on walking distance of the Conference Centre and anything else you want to do. Terribly overpriced hotel, depressing room, club level service ashame. My only advice is: avoid this hotel!!

First, my entire floor smelled like an army latrine. I am not sure what the problem was, but they said they couldnt handle it till tomorrow. Of course, they were unable to transfer me to another room... But even more annoying, is that when I arrived, they asked for a credit card for security only. Since I planned to use my debit card anyway, I gave them a credit card with not that much available credit on it. In the middle of the night I woke up to a phone call Miss, you have to come down to clear your balance - your credit card, it wont go through. It appears that they have just decided to charge the ENTIRE STAY to their card of choice (which they have asked for security only yeah right) without asking me first, and wouldnt wait till morning to sort things out. I had to dress up in the middle of the night, go down, and pay the entire stay (which of course cleared in an instant  please let ME decide which card to use in order to pay my stay). Oh, did I mention I had an important interview the next day? DONT GO THERE!

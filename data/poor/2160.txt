My group booked a block of 99.00 rooms approx. 6 months in advance. We had to cancel 10 weeks before the scheduled weekend. This is the first time our group has ever had to cancel our yearly trip. Myself and other organizers ate the 1,000+ cancellation fee. We continue to learn that the alledged 99.00 discount is the going rate for the rooms we booked and there is no mad rush to fill this hotel. The group booking department had no interest in reducing the penalty to incompass actual money loss on rooms that couldn't be rebooked. Bad customer service on their part. Of course now, the Palmer House is being referred to as "crooks" for the approx. 50 members of our group for getting paid for rooms they didn't book. I've stayed at the Palmer House and know it's not on par with many of the newer hotels in the city and its regular rooms are not worth more than $99 a night. There's a general consensus among the group that they can't compete with the other hotels in the city and would not have booked the block of rooms anyhow. Now, I wish I'd let this place sue us before I paid them one dime for rooms we didn't use.

This hotel is so bad I had to write a review. Check-in took over 40 minutes in line with only 6 people in front of us. The lobby and entire first floor, including elevators, are so smokey that we will never return. They must have NO ventilation! We don't smoke so it was a nightmare. Our 8 year old walked around with his shirt over his nose and mouth just to breathe. Our suite had floor to ceiling windows but the curtain valences are hung at about a 5' high level so you couldn't see out without lifting them up and walking under them -totally bizarre - kind of like living on the set of Being John Malkovich (1999). The cafe downstairs - again - lines took FOREVER just to be seated and don't be hungry. Food took 45 minutes minimum to arrive. And if you buy a bottle of wine in the shop, buy an opener. No openers in the rooms, room service won't bring one and the restaurants charge $25 to open your wine, even though you bought it in the store at Harrah's! There is not ONE reason to stay at Harrah's with all the choices of nice hotels in Vegas! Stear clear!

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was how dirty it was. There's a huge stain on the counter, stains all over the walls, stains on the chairs outside, and on the bathroom floor. The dishes in the drawers were dirty and made me not want to use them. The bathroom also smelled disgusting when I first got here, and there is MOLD growing on the back of the shower curtain. There are stains on our sheets as well. It's disgusting and makes me uncomfortable to stay in. Under the bed looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. It was never this dirty before, I don't know what happened. It's completely unacceptable.

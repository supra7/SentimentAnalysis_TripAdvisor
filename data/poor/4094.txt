Affinia e-mailed me 7 times telling me they were looking forward to my stay; once would have been fine.I can not have feather pillows because of an allergy, so I requested hypo-allergenic ones. All of my welcome e-mails said they would have the pillows there ready for me. When we arrived I had feather pillows! It took them 2 times in and out of my room to get me the correct pillows. ( I was trying to grab a quick nap before a long meeting) My room had dust every where! My vent in the bathrrom looked like it hadn't been wiped down for months! When filling out my travel expenses I called and asked how much was parking and was told $46. When I checked out it was $48. I explained I was told 46, she argued with me and I left very unhappy because of $4 bucks!!!!

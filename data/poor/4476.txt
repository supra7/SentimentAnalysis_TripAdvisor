Arrived at 3 am to find a stained room with sheets off the bed in the floor and one towel. Garbage was strewn all over. Tried to make it work because it was so late but the sink pipes poured water onto the floor when I tried to brush my teeth. Customer service said they knew "my type" because I tried to make it work and didn't come to them immediately. Avoid at all costs! You'll save money but sleep in a pig sty.

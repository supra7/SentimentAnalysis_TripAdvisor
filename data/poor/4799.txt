Not only do these Managers pick and choose the guests they like and dislike as they walk through the door, based on what I am not sure, they have no customer service skills what-so-ever. Plus, guests are only allowed 1 parking spot per room. And there is no convenient alternative parking. Our group had two couples and three vehicles in a two bed room. All vehicles had come from different areas 2 from different states. We were not told we could only have 1 parking spot until time of check-in, and one vehicles was handicap. We decided that we would park one car two-blocks away, one in a regular spot, and the handicapped vehicle in the handicapped spot. As we are sleeping at 11:15 at night the phone rings its the front desk telling us to move one vehicle or it will be towed. We argued with them that this situation is uncalled for. In the morning the same spot we moved our vehicle out of at 11:30 at night was still open. My Husband and I, and the other couple we were with, are not sure why they chose to pick on us. We hope no one else has to deal with these two men. They should not be in any service industry working with people.

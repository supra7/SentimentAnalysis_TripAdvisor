I have spent only 1 night it was a horrible experience. starting with the fact that I reserved the room with booking.com for 55 euro and for my curiosity i asked at reception what is the price for a room. SURPRISE 45 EURO :)) the room was awful, no window, the walls filled with mold, the bathroom was infected terrible experience. I didn't had much expectation being a hostel but also it has to besome minimum conditions of hygiene

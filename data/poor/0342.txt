How bad can a 4-star hotel be? Stay at the Westin and you'll find out. Here are some tips to enjoy your stay at the Westin: - ask for earplugs when you check in - don't expect good service. I think there is a service charge for smiles. - don't expect a clean room While the location is great, it cannot compensate for the horrible night's sleep, poor service, and unclean room. First, the room had an incessant creaking. It was one of those noises that you notice during the day, but in the quiet of the night, it gets progressively louder and louder and more annoying. If it was just my wife and I, we would have requested to move. But with small children already settled in and sleeping, we suffered through the night. I could not understand how they could rent a room that creaked like a haunted house. The next morning, I got my answer when I complained to the front desk. When you check in, they are *supposed* to give you a sheet of paper explaining that the creaking is caused by a safety feature for windstorms and offering earplugs. Unfortunately, nobody communicated this during my check in. This brings me to my second point: service. The worst part of the service was the stark lack of empathy the front desk expressed when I calmly described my night. I would have expected at least something like "I'm really *sorry* no one told you about the creaking. It must have been a horrible night.", instead all I got was a sheet of paper explaining the creaking one day too late. Note to management: verbal apologies do not cost you any money! When I told them I was never booking with them again, the front desk didn't seem surprised. I guess they hear that a lot. Third, other reviews have mentioned blood in the sheets, and dried urine on the toilet seat. My stay was consistent with the sub-par housekeeping with: - stained sheets - dirty coffee cups The Westin should be ashamed of itself.

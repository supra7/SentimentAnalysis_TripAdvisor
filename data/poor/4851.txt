I booked based on the rave reviews on the site, and was sorely disappointed. We were in Seattle for graduation weekend, and the hotel conveniently jacked its rates way up. This was in no way good value for money. The hotel is 2-star at best. Whoever says it is 5-star based on their world travels must be kidding. The place is shabby, the rooms are small, the bathrooms are at least 20 years old, and it feels like a bad Hampton Inn, remodeled out of a "fake boutique hotel" catalogue. This is not a pleasant, boutique hotel. It is a run-down pit taking advantage of people who are looking for a boutique experience.

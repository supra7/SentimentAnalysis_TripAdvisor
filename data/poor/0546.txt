Dread Lion ! Got the room on priceline, and then read some of the reviews. They had me a little gun shy, but figured we'd only be there one night. How bad could it be? After getting into Seattle from the east coast at Midnight and spending about an hour waiting in line for my rental car, I was anxious to hit the sack and get a good nights sleep before our drive to Eastern Washington the next day. Pulled into the dread lion around 1:30 am. Walked to the front desk and was greeted by a professional staff member , err...., a guy with a dirty , wrinkled, untucked shirt, who I was amazed was actually able to get me my key. As soon as we unlocked the entry door to the hallway, my wife, daughter and I were hit by a terrible odor in the hallway. It smelled like butt and scotch, with a little marlboro thrown in to add to the ambiance, It really did. At this point it was no longer funny, we felt UNSAFE as there were several hall doors and room doors propped open with towels. A chair was sitting in the hallway across from our room door. It looked like a cross between a fraternity and a crack house. Suprisingly our room was comfortable, plenty of towels , bath and body works , and nice pillow top beds. Unfortunately, I was not able to sleep well as I had serious concerns about this place. We got up early and showered and left as soon as we could in the morning. I have had many great experiences with Priceline before, but got burned on this one! Simply terrible.

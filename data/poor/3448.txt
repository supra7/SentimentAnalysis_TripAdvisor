Want Service? If you do, Stay Away from OMNI Although I like the location and relatively spacious rooms, I cannot say that Omni is a good choice. Two Reasons: Wrong Reservation and No Resloving Efforts!They offered me a low rate $239 avg when I made a reservation by phone, say first call. At that time I gave them my creditcard number and received a confirmation number. Next day, I visited Omni to see the room since it was not for me but for my parents. The staff on the front desk, once again confirmed the reservation. 7 days later (the arrival day was approaching)..I called Omni to make sure the reservation and modify something. Then, the person (a revenue manger?) on the phone this time, said: We do not provide such a low rate. And YOU CAN FREELY CANCEL IT. Despite the TWICE cinfirmation, I COULD NOT CONFIRM THE RESERVATION FOR MY PARENTS. Omni is Not At All trustworthy and provides very Rude staff. Conclusion:If you want service? Stay Far Away from this hotel. They do not know what service is.

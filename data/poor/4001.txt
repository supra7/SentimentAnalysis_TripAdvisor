Very, very disappointed. Electrical outlet in wall didn't work so lamps and tv and other items all running off extension strip. Appalled at the limited selection of tv channels. I have gotten a better selection at a Holiday Inn or even a Motel 6. There wasn't even a coffee maker in the room and I never did find an ice machine, even though there is an ice bucket in the room. If I had to pay the bill myself I would have moved to another hotel, but the meetings I was in Boston for booked the room. I also repeatedly informed the front desk that I would contact them if, and when I needed the room serviced but kept getting notices about needing to call housekeeping and then one day they went in the room even though I had the do not disturb sign on the door. Also the pillows and bed were very lumpy. About the only thing going for it was the location and the concierge was very nice...but I don't think all that money was worth it when I could have stayed elsewhere for less money and easily taken the T into town. Next time I'll know better and I'll go elsewhere.

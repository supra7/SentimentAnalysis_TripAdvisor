There's really no reason to stay here, there are much better options in Seattle for the same price or less. I'm a hilton honors diamond member, so I was hoping for some sort of upgrade. The rooms are the same on every floor, so no benefits here. I was given some coupons to the bad breakfast buffet, but apparently everyone in the hotel had the same vouchers because the tiny room was packed and there were not enough tables. The decor in the rooms are very outdated. The bed was comfortable, but the shower and all other furnishings were not good. It was just a depressing room all around. It is in a good location. Hilton should just close it down and re-make the whole place, it could be a lot better. It is NOT worth the price they charge.

I stayed here a few years ago. It was awful. The room smelled like hell, bugs were fighting with each other and so did the police with local criminals, hookers and other scum of the earth. We were so frightened that we put chairs against the door. I have never seen such motel in my entire life. If you hate yourself, stay here. If you love yourself and you're out of money, stay in your car.

My stay started with the computer system being down and the hotel being unable to give me a room. Since I had to change my clothes and freshen up for a work-related mixer, I had to drag my suitcase into the Ladies Room of the Casino and change in a bathroom stall, putting on my makeup under the fluorescent lights. When I finally got to my Pavilion Room that evening, it was tiny and extremely cold. The outside temperature was in the 30's. I don't know what the temperature in the room was, because the lowest the thermostat goes is 60, and the needle was lower than that. After an hour or so of having the heater on, the temperature in the room got up to about 64 degrees, and even with the heater on all night, it never got above 70 in my room. My feet were extremely cold from the tile in the bathroom/sink area, and there were no extra blankets to be found, so I had to take the very thin blanket off the other bed in my room and put it on the bed I was sleeping on, but I still felt cold all night. I went there with a coworker, and our first impression was that it was smoky and noisy, not only in the casino, but in our non-smoking rooms. The rooms across from us were smoking rooms, and there were ashtrays only a couple of feet from our doors, so smoke still gets into the rooms when you open the doors. The clock in my room wasn't plugged in, and the outlet was behind the headboard, so I couldn't reach it. The water in the shower vacillates between hot and cold, doesn't stay one temperature. But the icing was when the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night--not once, but twice! I've stayed downtown before, and never felt like I was at a motel 6, until I stayed at the El Cortez. It seemed run-down and sketchy. I wouldn't stay there again.

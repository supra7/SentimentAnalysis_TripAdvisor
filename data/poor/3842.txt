First, the good: The grounds are nicely kept and expansive. I didn't use the pool, but it looked inviting and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are actually quite large for standard hotel rooms. Now, the bad: The mandatory $10/night "amenity fee." If a fee is mandatory, then it should be included in the room rate - otherwise it's pretty much a bait-and-switch. They can advertise their rates as $10/night lower than they actually are, and then charge this mandatory fee. I'm sure plenty of other hotels do this, but that doesn't make it less scummy. I didn't even want the stuff it was supposed to pay for - I don't care about having a PlayStation in my room, I don't want to rent DVDs on vacation, and if I want wifi I can find a cafe. Seriously, if you want to charge $10 more a night, go ahead and list it as $100 instead of $90. Don't advertise as $90 and then charge a "mandatory fee." It makes you look shady and it makes the customer feel manipulated. The bathroom was not nice. The floor was cracked and yellowing, and the sink counter had big nicks in it. The mattresses felt old; I could feel the springs. I could have forgiven all of that if not for the inescapable white noise. Even if I turned the one in my room completely off, I could still hear the ones next door, and they were VERY loud. It was really difficult to get any sleep here because of the noise.

Checked in to room 217 and it was terrible: the ceiling was leaking and at a couple of places black stains of mold (each as large as a dining plate and, yes, all wet) were staring at me above the bed (photos uploaded). Contacted the front desk a couple of times and the response was to wait for the maintenance person to come up in an hour. Asked an agent at Egencia.com for help and when she called the front desk, she was told that "because it rained yesterday"! How does the rain leak to the second floor of the six floor building, and how does the mold grow so quickly in a day? I was feeling sick from the mold and requested changing to Park Plaza Hotel. If I will be sick for an extended period of time, I would request a compensation from this hotel. How come the hotel does not notice this leak - it must have been there for days - and does not recognize the health risk of the mold? I would sincerely hope that Holiday Inn does not endorse such a neglect of the health safety of the guests.

I absolutely cannot believe that I actually paid money to stay there! I am aresident of Mesa and saved up for my familys "staycation"..... I SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME!!!! The water park was FILTHY!!!! Not to mention that I had to wait TWO HOURS IN LINE to check in and carry all my own bags to my room with my 8 month old infant. When I FINALLY made it to "My room" SOMEONE ELSE was staying there!!!!!! I ABSOULTELY WOULD NOT NOT RECCOMEND THIS "RESORT"/ HOTEL, especially if you are not fond of CONTRACTING YEAST INFECTIONS FROM THE WAVE POOL, which I was told by an employee that they NEVER have cleaned!!!!! GROSS!!!!!

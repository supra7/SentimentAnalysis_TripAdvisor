When we checked into the hotel we were put in a room that had construction workers directly outside our room removing bricks witha jack hammer on the exterior of the building. After complaining we were moved to another tired, gross, worn out, disgusting room, however it was much more quiet. The funiture is so worn out including the old beds. The bathroom is so gross along with the nice mold!! I would not stay here again if they paid me! Take my advice... stay elsewhere! The pictures on the website are atleast 10 years old!

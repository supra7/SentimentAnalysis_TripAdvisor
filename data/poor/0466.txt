My family stayed at the W Hotel Seattle Thanksgiving evening and had a wonderful dinner together. The next morning, we took a walk around Seattle before checking out. Right as we entered our rooms, my daughter immediately noticed her new i Phone was missing from the nightstand. We tore the room apart and didn't find it. Upon checking out, we inquired about the hotel's ability to see if anyone entered our room when we were gone that morning. Hours later, I got a call from their Director of Security and he confirmed housekeeping was in our room..."for half of a second." They did nothing about it...not even checking the housekeeper's belongings. Even the police agree that it is very suspicious but there is nothing they can do since we have to actual proof. The hotel knows this so they do nothing about it. We have stayed at the W Hotel in San Diego last month and the W Seattle last week. We were going to book a New York trip for Thanksgiving next year but we will not be staying there. Even in nice hotels, thefts happen as we have learned. I am very disappointed that the W Hotel Seattle turned their backs on us and didn't even care or make it right. BEWARE!

My phone did not work. My air conditioner did not work. My TV remote did not work. I was put in a smoking room. The bartender was exceptionally rude. I waited more than an hour for my room service. The food was nasty. A drunk woman was passed out in the hallway (I'm not making this up!). Nicole, at the front desk, was unconcerned and completely indifferent. The only bright spot was John, at the concierge desk. His timely assistance and great sense of humor, maid my stay tolerable.

I planned a nice getaway for my boyfriend and I for August 2nd and we arrived to only find that we had no reservations for the night. They redirected us to the other Chelsea Hotel down the street. We decided to go back to the Chelsea Savoy Hotel to ask again if the reservations were there and they claimed that none were to be found under my name. So we decided to stay the night. The rooms are not a bargain for the price you pay. They are very casual and low-class for a New York City stay. A month later, after receiving my credit card statement, I had found that they charged another 224 dollars for a stay for the next night. When calling them, I found that we DID have reservations but for the next day, which we failed to cancel because they said that our reservations never existed. As a very disatisfied customer, I wanted to know if any compensations could be made. Monica, who claimed to be the manager, blamed the whole situation on us. After retelling my dilemma again and again, she finally said that Debbie (I guess the rightful manager) was to return on the 25th, she could perhaps make some arrangements. I think that this is truly an unfair trade for what turned out to be an unromantic night in a cheap hotel. If you are to stay here, watch out for their ways with money. They are not on your side.

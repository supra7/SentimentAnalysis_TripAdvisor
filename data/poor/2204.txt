We spent last weekend at this hotel and came away very disappointed. The location was great with lots to do in the immediate area, especially for kids, but the hotel is old and the rooms are in need of renovation. The rooms made you feel like you were in a low budget motel, not a Hilton. We had a room with a direct oceanview, but the glass on the sliders were so filthy you really could not enjoy the view. The room was not well cleaned and the bottom of the tub was very slippery ( I don't know with what and I tried not to think of what it might be) and yes I fell right on my butt as I stepped in the shower... I notified the front desk and a manager came to look at the room. The manager apologized for the condition of the room and said he would make sure housekeeping did a thorough cleaning the next day and offered me breakfast passes for the next two days. Well to my surprise the next day our room was not touched at all by housekeeping. We came in late that evening and were shocked. We called the front desk and told the clerk our rooms had been missed and instead of sending someone to clean the room she offered me free breakfast buffet passes. Yes again! Like that would take care of the problem... I gave up and just asked for clean towels and waited 45 minutes for them to be delivered to the room. I realized I was going to need more soap too and opted to go down to the front desk and pick it up myself to save time (a very long walk) but when I got there the clerk said she did not have any on hand, but would have someone bring it to my room...Ughgg!!!! I had to wait another 30 minutes, before I could take a shower. I'm wondering if the management of this hotel really feels that a free breakfast is a good substitute for poor service. I certainly don't. If you report a problem, they should immediatly fix the problem and then offer a free breakfast or something for your inconvenience. That is how you build brand loyalty.

This hotel has no elevator, even though my room was in the fifth floor. The ambiance is very tacky and worne out, although the room interior was ok. Is was also noisy to sleep. Since it is in a "so-so" neighborhood, the price is unjustified. I would stay there for US$90/day, but not the outrageous US$240 that I sadly paid.

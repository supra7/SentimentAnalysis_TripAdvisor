We stopped in at the Terrace restaurant for their plantation buffet, on a Saturday morning. It was a great looking place and we had high expectations. But we were ignored from the start, terrible service, slow, 10 minutes for coffee, never asked for water, never asked for coffee refills for decaf, never told how the buffet worked and then had to wait another 10 minutes for our bill afterward. The food was luke warm at best, cold sausage, runny eggs. It was a terrible experience. Save your money and hit a buffet at a less upscale establishment, you will be treated a lot better

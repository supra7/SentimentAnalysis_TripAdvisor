Stayed for 2 nights in "Superior Double" room t $269 per night plus tax nd $36 per day for parking. Room was tiny, no minibar, no coffemaker. Instead they want you to order in-room brekfast, which we did once - $50 for 2 people for bacon and eggs. One small window was facing service roof with a wire cage over a ballroom dome. Room above us had a leaking window air-conditioner that poured water into our window. Hotel supposedly won all kinds of eco awards for water conservation, etc. But shower in our tiny bath was as close to a fire hose as you can get - enough water coming out for 4 showers. They ask you to re-use your towels, or put the ones you want replaced on the bathroom floor. We left one on the floor - it actually never got replaced. Very curious experience, will never stay there again. Furniture and curtains were nice, but then the only blanket option was a down comforter in July!?

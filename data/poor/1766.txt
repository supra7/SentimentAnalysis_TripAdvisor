This is the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at! We weren't sure if the sheets had really been washed, and the 'clean' towels were all full of hair. The rooms are tiny and the hotel has paper thin walls. The hot water was lukewarn and the water pressure sucked, and there were broken beer bottles all over the parking lot. Totally overpriced for how gross this place is. Do not stay under any condition, unless you are a teenager who just wants a place to party! Next time I will spend the extra money for a better place to stay! The only good thing about this place was the location, but that still did not make it worth staying there.

Went to Chicago and found this hotel for a good price and good location-about 6 blocks off the Magnificent Mile. We had read the rooms were small, but these rooms are ridiculous. First room we found two bugs-front desk made us drag our luggage down ourselves just to put us in a room down the hall on the same exact floor. The guy at the front desk, Phillip, offered no apologies and wouldn't make eye contact, just gave us new room keys. Our room was even smaller than the first. Second morning we found another bug. They moved us again, and assured us the manager-who wasn't on duty the past two days- would get in touch with us. He never did. This place was the worst I've stayed in. I would never stay here again.

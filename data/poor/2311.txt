The staff is quite nice and we were immediately upgraded apon arrival for our honeymoon, but this place is terrible. It is a factory, children everywhere, food is beyond dispicae ( I ordered chicken on a salad and it was cafateria plastic chicken with fake grill marks and my husbnd ordered the worst fish tacos we have had this whole trip). You have to wear a wristband by the pool and don't expect a comfy lounge near the ocean or pool... Or for people to ring you towels...We ended up on lounges out on the grass and not one person came to ask us if we needed a cocktail. The Four Seasons was booked six months ago when we booked this honeymoon, so we figured we would just give this place a shot, but it is awful.

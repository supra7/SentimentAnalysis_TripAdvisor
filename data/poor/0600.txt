Stay away from this one. Booked it through hotels-rates.com was not a clean place. I found it not to be what it looked like on the web site. Changed rooms and still didn't like it. The rooms were smoking rooms, even though I was told they were non-smoking as per smell, light bulds were burned out. I chose another hotel and called for a shuttle to pick me up. Turned my key inat the desk and when asked for a refund I was told I didn't check out properly. Have contacted Choice Hotels to no avail yet and contacted Hotels-rates.com also to no avail. Beware--- if it is cheap $ wise it will not be a place you want to stay

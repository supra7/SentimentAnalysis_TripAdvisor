arrived after a 6 hour bus ride with my wife and daughter and was told we would be in the eaton hotel across the road . then having booked online by cc i was told by the guy on the desk we don't take cards only cash but i refused and am keeping an eye on my card statements. the room was at the end of a corridor with the stickiest carpet you could have imagined like walking through glue,the wall had dirty marks allover and the duvet cover had what looked like [-] stains on it . we didn't stay for breakfast

When I booked this reservation I thought of convenience and good rates. Well, let's just say it was short on convenience. There is no onsite parking. Visitors have to walk two blocks to a parking garage and bring a coupon with them each day to get a discount. The walk isn't bad if you are up to it, but the hotel is right next door to a homeless help center. Nothing wrong with that, but it is not most desirable for a first-time or for any visitor seeking safe lodging. Service is something we didn't get much of beyond a smile at check in time. Our room was one with a window with a view of a wall and construction site, loud construction. The carpet was damp and we were too tired too fuss. We were promised a new room the next day only to find another damp carpet, a TV that didn't work and a very weak shower head. So weak hardly any water dripped out of it. I booked this reservation through Priceline and when I wanted to receive some sort of retribution, discount, apology, something...anything to make us feel better, we were told that because it was not booked directly through the hotel I had to go through Priceline to make a complaint. Bottom line, this Travelodge location is not acceptable. It is what someone may call a "fleabag" hotel in my estimation. Maybe otherTravelodge locations are good, but I highly advise visitors to the PA Convention Center area to seek lodging elsewhere.

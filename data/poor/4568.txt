I went with my mother in law and baby. When I called ahead to request a double room or at least king, they told me they will only give me a queen since I booked with priceline. So then I called priceline to cancel because they GUARANTEE accomodations for at least 2 adults. A queen cannot accomodoate 2 adults in my opinion, unless you are lovers (an assumption priceline makes). In addition priceline has failed in meeting the 4 star criteria, as I booked fro a 4 star on the Mag mile. This hotel room is TINY, hardly any room for the crib and NO ROOM for the stroller and suitcase! This was worse than a hotel in timesquare! THis hotel no way compares to the 4 stars of downtown chicago!!!! The ant infestation didnt help either. We only were able to see them on the filthy black carpet because I had laid a white towel down on the floor. As I called the front desk horrified, I found some crawling up my arm while I was on the bed. Needless to say we didnt sleep well at all. In addition the AC unit is awful. You have to put it down to a freezing 67 degrees, otherwise if we put it up to 69, the heat turned on. I was never more exhausted and irritable on a vacation before! After all this, the front desk wasnt apologetic the least bit! When we eagerly checked out he asked if I took any waters or anything, something any other hotel would OFFER to make up for all the inconvenience. But NO I didnt drink your stanky water bottles or anything else, thanks for offering though. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE HOTEL. DO NOT GO. Unless you are going solo, and dont mind insects and an unreliable thermostat! HOWEVER I do have to say, the Bell man and door man were wonderful! Thanks to them, we were accommodated and assisted a bit in transferring to another room.

I am a single woman who checked into Mama Shelter after paying in full for 2 nights at the lowest available rate (108 euros per night) and the morning after my check-in, a man let himself into my room using the key to my room. He apologized and said he'd been given the key by the reception desk. I promptly called the front desk and they acted surprised and proceeded to call me back three times asking for my name and when I had checked in, because apparently my reservation had been marked as a "no show" in their system. They said they were sorry but did no more than that. This is a stylish hotel in a marginal neighborhood but the front desk is clearly inexperienced, young, unprofessional and made no effort to reassure me or make up for this security breach. Be warned.

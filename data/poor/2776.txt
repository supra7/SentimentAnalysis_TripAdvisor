I used to live in Manhattan and this was a favorite spot of mine for drinks after work. Thought it would be fun to stay here for once and the room rate was ridiculously reasonable for NYC. That said, I arrived at midnight from a long day of flying and was first struck but the tiny elevators with dirty carpeting. Then the poorly lit hallway that still did not hide the dirty carpeting. Now for the ridiculous - which I guess is what you get for a low rate (Room 301): 1 - Room was so small it would make a Ian Schrager hotel feel like the Taj Mahal 2 - There were NO pillows on the bed after an obvious turn down service had occured. When I called the front desk about this, they challenged me as if it weren't possible 3 - The window overlooked another building that was 10 feet away offering no light at all (I never opened my window shades as there was another window from an office building that looked directly into my room) 4 - The bathroom sink faucet literally was not affixed to the porcelain sink! 5 - The shower was like standing under a hose....heat was fine, but the water did not spray just poured 6 - On my last morning, I ordered a pot of coffee and waited about a half hour before calling to find out where the coffee was. The coffee arrived 15 minutes later in a porcelain tea pot covered in Saran Wrap. This was not enough for even 2 cups and then by the time I got to second, it was lukewarm. This was a $ 9.21 charge!!! All I can say is, I would never stay there again even if it were free!

This hotel was by far the worst, cheapest hotel I have ever stayed in. We went because our friends have been there and told us it was fine. First, is at the end of the strip, in a very bad neighborhood, we didnt even felt safe at night walking around there, it was surrounded by building that look like a project, windows broken, grafitti, abandoned buildings, etc they were even some homeless people around. It is far off anything interesting in the strip. Then the hotel has this bad smell as soon as you walk in, the rooms are awful, they didnt put enough towels, or soap, one day they didnt even put shower gel,another it was shampoo, nor shower cap, thank god I never rely on it but still, we have to constantly ask about it, then they gave us this room with an ugly view, not even the strip. only place to eat late at night was Roxie's so expensive and the food so greasy. there were people mainly teens walking around dragging big coolers to their rooms, the level of people was very low. The smell of the room was awful, I have to keep putting inciense and body splash in the room to tone it down, some days it was past 3 pm and the room was not even cleaned. I am sure there are better choices in Vegas at good prices that quality doesnt need to be sacrificed. We didnt even felt sure leaving nothing unlocked and the guest some look like hookers the woman, most of them drunk or else, and the men look like gansters, the only reason we didnt left was because it was a prepaid package

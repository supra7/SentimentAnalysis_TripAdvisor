My husband and I decided to stay at this hotel although most of the time in Boston, we like to be at Fairmont. Should have done it as usual. The room after upgrading was 624. This is one of the connecting room, and we were able to hear EVERY THING the next room women were talking about. The voice simply came through the connecting door. They were not loud at all, just to make things straight. It was as if there was NO WALL between 2 rooms. We were shocked. When I was in the shower, I heard someone banging on the door. I thought it was an emergency or something.. like the hotel on fire?? It turns out that people above our room were walking around. I could not believe the poor condition of the hotel. It didn't help when we checked in, NO ONE came to help us with our luggage. The room was average with poor amenity. Some of the lights were not working. I want to think that room 624 had some major issue and that we were unlucky. I want to think that they were too busy carrying guest's bags. However, I do not want to go back and risk another annoying night at this hotel.

Do not stay Tiny Rooms..Bathrooms the size of the closet...MOST OF ALL...my wife and I were asked to not sit on a particular couch, and Could we move to the seating over there?????? When asked why another couple was enjoying a glass of wine across from us...the response was they have a reservation to sit there!!!!! Amazing!!! Not to mention being stopped from entering and questioned as to what room you are staying in, your name, etc..... Save Your money--stay somewhere nice.If you must see it, go to the bar, wait 30 minutes to get a half full martini for $12, be rudely insulted by some super hip, brand new hairstyle bartender.

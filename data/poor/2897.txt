I was concerned for my stay at the W Lexington after having read numerous Trip Advisor reviews that were less than complimentary. However, I went ahead and overall my stay was less than memorable, other than the less than friendly reception at the front desk. Unfortunately I was allocated to a smoking room when I suffer allergies to smoke. An hour later and two failed attempts to check in, one into a smoking room and the other occupied the situation was resolved when I finally reached a non smoking room. I don't consider myself to be a difficult guest but my concern lies with the uneccessary attitude of the agent and the time wasted.

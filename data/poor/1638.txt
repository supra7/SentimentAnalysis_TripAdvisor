The sofa on the couch had 7 different color stains (do not want to know what originated) so let's just say I never sat on the couch nor did I want to put my luggage on it. The sheets did not seem like they were washed but thankfully I brought my pillow case with me. The bathtub had mold growing and coffee table still had coffee stains on it. Bottom line - avoid this place if you can.

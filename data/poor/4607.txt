We were left stranded, with two kids, on the street with no place to stay, after these awful people gave away our reservation. Do not assume when you arrive to the hotel that you will actually get your room that your reserved. They never told us there was a problem, and we called to make sure they had our reservation! There were no other hotel rooms in the city, seriously, they were all booked. So, we had to travel 50 miles to another city at 8:30pm in the evening to find a place to stay. Buyer beware!

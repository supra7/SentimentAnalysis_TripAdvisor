Be careful when booking your room through Orbitz or another 3rd party. You can miss the fine print. The hotel can put you in any room they want, smoking or non-smoking, regardless of what you request. One step onto the 12th floor at the Whitehall and you will smell what that can mean. The hotel should be ashamed to rent rooms with such a horrible stench, in the curtains, linens, carpet, everywhere. You and your clothes smell of smoke when you leave. Basically, you have no choice and the staff is less than professional in they way they handle the issue.

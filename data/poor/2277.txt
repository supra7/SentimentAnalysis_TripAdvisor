Decided on Fremont because of its location and because I'd heard it was recently renovated. Specifically indicated room was for ONE person and reserved room with 2 full beds. Arrived at 11:30 p.m. Was directed to room with one kingsized bed. Very small room with only available electrical outlet at a location where I could not use CPAP machine. They don't show the bathrooms on the virtual tour for a reason: they are about the size of a gutted walk-in closet - or smaller. Very miniscule shelf space in bath; if I'd left cell phone on shelf to charge (only other electrical outlet), it would have vibrated into toilet. Asked for different room, was told "company policy" is only one bed for one person; not true since I've stayed at other Boyd properties in 2-bedded room. Front desk was not at all helpful. Insisted and was directed to an identical room (and bath) on another floor. At that point, I called Main Street Station (owned by same company) and arranged to stay there; checked out and moved. Main Street comped me for the night that was by then almost over and gave me spaceous room with sufficient electrical access and bathroom facilities. Main Street is cleanest hotel I've ever used.

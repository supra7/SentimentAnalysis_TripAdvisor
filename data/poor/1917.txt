I can say nothing favorable about this hotel. The lobby is nice. That's one thing. At first I thought it was just because we had a smoking room, but the rooms in this hotel are repulsive. Old, greasy carpet, very small bathrooms with very little space for more than one person's things... the hotel bar, for example, won't make you a Long Island Iced Tea because there are 5 liqours in it. Neither will the hotel bar allow you to grab a glass of wine and take it up to your wife... you must go through room service where they can charge you a ton and coax a tip out of you. No officially available wireless internet in the hotel lobby or mezzanine. TV connection and remotes are lousy and unreliable. The windows are old, the paint is old. The room doors don't shut properly without some elbow grease applied. The AC in the room is hit or miss. There is radiator heat in the bathroom for God's sake. The staff is capable for the most part but this hotel is thumbs down all the way. We stayed at the Westin on the waterfront one night before we came here and I would give my left arm to go back there. What a nice surprise that was and what a disappointment the Park Plaza is! I wouldn't book a hamster into this hotel. Someone said the Park Plaza is old but has a reputation, well let me tell you the reputation is as old and dirty as the carpet.

Warning!!! This hotel is AWFULL. A small room is ok, but the rat poison behind the bed was unacceptable. Coming home one night, while waiting for the elevator, I saw a rat running across the floor in the closed diner next door (this is where breakfast is served). The bathroom was ver very small and smelly. The shower was also so small and dirty. Towels where smelly. The view was straight into a brick wall. All in all not a good deal for 80$ a night. Find somewhere else to stay.

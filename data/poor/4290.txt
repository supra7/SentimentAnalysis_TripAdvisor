They say the first person you meet sets the tone for the remainder of your stay and I never knew how true that is. I recently checked in at Harrah's while on a get-away trip with friends. When I got to the desk the girl was the most rude person I've experienced in a long while. McDonald's drive-thru staff have better customer service skills. I looked at the other checking in guests and they all seemed to be equally as miserable but the one I had won the prize. Since she couldn't handle the check in, 'Alame' didn't get anything right with the rooms. During the process with her perceived problems she went to a supervisor for assistance who seemed to just as unhappy with his job as she was. So, the check-in was terrible, the rooms were not right, and the rudeness of this person set the tone for the rest of my stay.

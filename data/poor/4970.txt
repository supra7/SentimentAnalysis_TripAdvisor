I'm not sure who is writing the reviews on this site but they are NOT accurate. The rooms are very basic and that's fine. BUT our carpet is ripped. The shower leaks and floods the bathroom every time you shower. There is tons of black mold in the shower and the bathroom smells musty. The bathroom is so small that you can't open the door fully without hitting the toilet. My advice? Go to The Antioch Hotel across the street. It's the same owners but it's much cleaner and the rooms and bathrooms are also a bit bigger. I don't think there is a big price difference, but whatever it is, it's worth it. Trust me.

The resort is beautiful with nice rooms and swimming pool. Location is Although our reservation for a two bedroom suite was change to a single room, management attempted to correct the issue and we had to change rooms after for the first night. For the beware part of my vacation. Signs in the parking lot tell visitors to remove valuables from the vehicles. We took everything inside. We left the room for about an hour to go to the pool. Maids came in to clean and they really cleaned us out. $200 from a wallet was taken. Management can read the card scanner to determine who was in/ out of the room, yet they would not rectify the situation. We had to contact the Orland PD, and they took fingerprints and opened a case for us. We have now returned hope and are waiting for the results. Management really let us down in the time of need. This took aware from the grandeur of the resort.

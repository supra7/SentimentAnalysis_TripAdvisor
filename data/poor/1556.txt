Ok- I will go over what transpired when we went to our room to go to sleep. I pulled the covers down and moved the pillow and there was a BEDBUG under the pillow. I freaked out, took a pic with my cell phone, immediately packed up our suitcases and vacated the room. We went down to front desk to report this. We also asked the young man IF they ever had a problem with BEDBUGS and he said " NOT FOR A FEW MONTHS!!"..We asked for the mgr and "Ms JANE" came to see us. She did NOT believe us even tho we had a picture of it. She said she was going to go look for herself. We asked the front desk man to get us another room in another hotel..NOTHING was done...SO we left and drove around til we found a NEW CLEAN HOLIDAY INN.....and stayed there for the nite. We had to return to the Sterling the following morning to see friends and the mgr said she put the "bug " in a bag and that it was a "Nat"...TOTAL bs...IT WAS A BEDBUG. do NOT ever stay at this Sterling Hotel..service and mgt are totally unresponsive and would NOT help!! We had to drive around at 11 pm in our robes to find a hotel...SUCKS! SUCKS! SUCKS!! i have enclosed a pic of the bedbug...use ur zoom lense and u will see it in full form !!!! DO NOT STAY at this hotel !!!!!!!

A family friend came to stay at the hotel and had some friends in the room prior to leaving for a concert. At 8pm there were complaints that they were talking too loud and security went to the room. They were told to keep it down. "Multiple other complaints" came in (heresay) and the young man was ejected from the hotel. Despite his having paid $333 for 2 nights through Priceline, he was not afforded any refund nor was given any alternative. I contacted the hotel and asked repeatedly for reconsideration for this evening's stay in which he would be alone and was told absolutely not. Not an ounce of compassion for a young man who spent hard earned money to stay here. Unbelievable attitudes from all staff members, condescending, rude and totally inconsiderate of the situation. Unless you are planning to only sleep here, not TALK, don't bother, you'll probably get thrown out.

I travel for work and need a place to relax at the end of the day and a quiet hotel. This was not my experience. 1st night - mid week, I stayed on the 3rd floor with a courtyard and it was quiet for the first 20 minutes until my neighbours came back and turned on their bathroom fan and left it on while they went out for 3 hours. Then they kept opening and shutting the fire doors and talking loudly. I was angry but knew there was nothing the hotel could do because of their lack of insulation in the walls. By 2 am the loud neighbours left and then by 5 am they were back turning on the bathroom fan. The next morning, I politely asked my neighbours were going to be back and if so could I please be moved. Sure enough, they claimed they did not hear the loud party and did not understand why I did not register a complaint. Ok so if I were to register a complaint, most likely they would not be able to stop the noise, esp. if they are renting their rooms to college age students. They kindly moved me and put me in the basement in a room facing the street with a single pained window so I could hear all the cars driving by, slamming their doors, and the click clack of people walking. I can hear my neighbours pacing their floor and slamming the doors even the fire door that squeaks open and shut. I hope to go for a run in Hyde Park before my long 10 hour day ... we shall see if I can pull off at least 4 hours of sleep.

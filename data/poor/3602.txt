Awful !! DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY!! The pics online is so deceiving! The rooms are SO small - the door hit the bed when you open the door. Our shower had bugs, hair, and whatever else in it. I felt dirtier after the shower than I did before hand. ICK. It is still a running joke about how awful the place was. NEVER NEVER NEVER. And, the parking situation is ATROCIOUS!!! We parked at least 10 blocks away, and it cost $20/night. Never never never again...I will splurge for a place on the wharf

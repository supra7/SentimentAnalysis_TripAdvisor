This was the worst hotel I have ever checked into. Rooms were filthy, broken window, broken table leg, dirty lamp shades, hair and urine in bathroom not cleaned, chair material shredded...looked like a lion was in the room and tore it apart. Moved to another room and was exactly the same except pulled bedspread back and found a big wad of hair and stains on the bedspread, bathroom just as bad as the 1st one and soda sprayed all over the door.- Didn't stay....cut our vacation short one day and went home.

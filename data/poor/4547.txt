This hotel is really past it's prime. Maybe it was nice once but no longer. The air blows in through the windows and so does the noise. You can hear every vehicle that goes past. Very noisy lace with the roaring of buses and trucks. Light sleepers beware. Also, it just has an overall worn feeling. There is no ice. You have to call room service for it. The beds are not up to the prices. Just a short distance away is the much newer Westin City Center and it can be less expensive. The Fairmont is also much superior.

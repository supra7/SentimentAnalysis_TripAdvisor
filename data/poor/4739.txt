I am sorry to say that this was a pretty terrible experience. First, please know that the resort is stunning and the staff couldn't have been nicer. But, my room was so overwhelmingly bad that I cannot recommend this hotel to the average business traveler. I do not know what type of room you get when you pay full rack rate but the room that I got under my corporate rate was pretty bad. The area behind the sink was torn out due to construction, the air conditioning kind of worked and the room smelled pretty bad. Why the hotel put me in a room that was under construction is just a mystery. The construction work continued in my room (without my knowledge) while I was in meetings. I learned about this around 9:00 pm on the second night of my stay when the housekeeping staff called to tell me that they needed to bring me towels. Apparently, I had no towels because they needed to remove my towels when doing the repairs. It is unnerving to learn that people have been in your hotel room when you are not there. This is not a small resort. I am sure there were other rooms avaiable (that were not under repair) during my stay But, I am equally sure that the hotel was happy to leave me where I was since I did not complain or make an issue about the construction. Shame on the Waldorf. You do not treat customers who complain with respect. You treat everyone with respect. When I submitted my on-line evaluation form to the hotel, the general manager called and offered me a free weekend certificate to "make up" for my experience. I turned him down. Why would I return for free? If a hotel does treat me with respect when I am paying...why would it treat me with repect when it is footing the bill? I'll pass.

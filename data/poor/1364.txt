Somebody get me out of here !!! I m still here and I m on the internet looking for a quick way back home !!! The food is terrible, the staff is lazy but the room is nice, when there s electricity . Of course, air conditionning is optional . Don t waste your money of the Elegance Club ..half the thing they promise in the booklet are not even available . Forget your pillow menu, your aromatherapy or anything that would make your trip special ...took us 4 days to get the slippers and the exclusive bottle of crap champagne is not exclusive ... the 4 bottles of alcohol they promise in the room are as follow ... a 2 once bottle of vodka and 3 x 10 ounces of rhum, scotch and bailey s ... and yeah, they re not renewable !!! pools are cool if you have eskimo blood I guess otherwise you could probably use it to keep your drink cold. The Elegance Club has a self serve bar , which is a cool concept , they only forget to bring alcohol to the bar ... i ve been begging for vodka for 2 days now ... that s beside the international beers that are well presented in the booklet, yet unexistant once at the resort ...

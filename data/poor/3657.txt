Lawn Mowers at 5 a.m. We were given a room along the golf course. I woke up at 5 in the morning to the roar of lawn mowers. There must have been 5 of them across the numerous fairways. The wear and tear on the rooms and facilities was obvious. This is a beautiful old hotel that should not call itself anything above 3 stars. Bring your earplugs.

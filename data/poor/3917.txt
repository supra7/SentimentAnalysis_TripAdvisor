We had great expectations when booking this hotel. When paying for a four or five star resort you expect the resort to be great. We traveled with a couple whose experience was even worse than ours. At initial check in we were given no direction on where to even go to find our room. After finially finding our room we entered to find two double beds so small there is no way two people can sleep on them. (found out when you book a room they cannot give you a gaurentee of a king bed). The smell in the room also smelled like mold. We walked right out and tried to approach the front desk. At first they were not very helpful and actually quite rude. After one night in the room we both woke up with severe allergy symptoms and my entire luggage next to the bed was wet. Come to find out the AC was leaking and a four foot patch on the floor had drenched my luggage and was causing the "mold" smell in the room. Our friends room was not much better but at least did not have the mold smell. Finally we were moved to a different room that was much better. When you stay plan on spending that 21 dollars a day in resort fees for no clear reason. Your have to pay for beach chairs, wine galsses, covered spots by the pool, rooms are average, and the internet is not even wireless. The resort grounds are great and offers excellent views but the women at the front desk support staff made us never want to stay at the Maui Sheraton again

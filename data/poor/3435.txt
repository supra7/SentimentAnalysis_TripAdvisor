Beekman Tower Hotel New York 11 People stayed at this Hotel from the 2 Dec till the 7 Dec 2008. We were split into two 4s and a 3. The room we were allocated was 1 bedroomed, with a bed settee in the living area. We were expected to sleep together. When we asked for extra beds we were told we would have to pay another 30 Dollars a night each or if we wanted to upgrade to another room it would be 70 Dollars a night. The 3 people had a room with 2 toilets and it was much larger, they didnt have to pay extra. There was only enough toiletries for 1 person, not enough towels or blankets. It was a dark dingy hole. It was miles from anywhere, Had to take taxis all the time, too far to walk, coming back it was hard to get a taxi. Decided to have breakfast the last morning it took 1 hour before we were even served, when the food came it was cold, took it away and put in microwave still cold, it cost us 20 dollars plus tip. A complete rip off. The safe in the room didnt work, the key was lost, they didnt replace it carried all out money with us. I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone.

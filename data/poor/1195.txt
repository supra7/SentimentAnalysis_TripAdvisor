romantic weekend for two in istanbul, only it ended up being us two, plus a bed crawling with fleas, which could be visibly seen. my partner was badly bitten, and yet the hotel refused to take any responsibility and were even reluctant to change our rooms. horrid, would highly not recommend this place.

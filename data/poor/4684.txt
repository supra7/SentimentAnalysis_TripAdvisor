We were booked into the ME for 9 nights, we checked out after 3, staff were very unfriendly and unhelpfull. the rooms are among the smallest Ive ever stayed in. Cannot understand how this hotel got rated with 5 star, no way, 3 star at best..The walls in room were marked, the corridors looked as if thay had never been hoovered. The sockets were loose. On the 2nd day, no one cleaned our room or made bed, we had to ring twice for toilet rolls and towels, The air con did not go down past 23. We couldnt wait to check out, we moved to the arts hotel where we found a real 5 star hotel

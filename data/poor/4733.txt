We stayed here during a work related conference. This hotel has several areas and the rooms are very different in each area. My experience was with the cottages (not by choice, this is the room type that they assigned us to). I was in 3 different cottages, one worse than the next. The first had no access to a patio or balcony and was very dark. The second was a smoking room (requested non-smoking) with a generator running in the lot next to the building. The third was a better location with a patio, however, the room wreaked of cigarettes. The curtains were torn, paint was peeling, chairs were old and worn, the towels were OLD, the sink was rusty, the water was musty, and the bed sloped to the center. THERE was no internet access in the room. Management said the system was new and they had some problems. The issues were never resolved, even after I spoke to their 'technical staff' for 20 minutes. This hotel is not set up to accommodate a large group. They have other rooms (Ocatilla, golf condos, etc.) that others said were very nice. We all paid the same rate for rooms. Management was not helpful (moving us to the same type of room three times). We will never stay here again. If you must stay here, avoid the old and outdated cottages.

What can I say. Booked a special night for $284, and was very disappointed. Although the lobby is very nice, it is downhill from there. Stayed in a "deluxe suite", which is like an emtpy airplane hangar. A huge room with almost no furnishings, sort of like sleeping in a warehouse. They charged $32.00 for parking for one night, but couldn't make change for $40.00. All put out because I wanted to pay cash and didn't have exact change. This place is a has been dump. Please please stay in one of the newer places like the 1000 or the W. The Alexis is a pathetic washed up joke! Wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews. They are right on!

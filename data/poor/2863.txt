rooms were too dark. in fact, the entire hotel was pretty dark. our room was so heavily perfumed, i thought i would have an asthma attack (even though i don't have asthma!). the smell was overwhelming. we asked the front desk if anything could be done, but we were told that housekeeping sprays the rooms when they clean them. no offer to change rooms, no apology. on a good note, the beds were very comfortable and since i used points, we got our room for $90 which is unheard of in the city. overall, who can complain about a $90 room, but i would NEVER pay more than that to stay at this hotel.

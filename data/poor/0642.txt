On Monday 7/26/10 I went to our room to retrieve an item that was housed in the safe. After returning to the beach for approximately 20-30 minutes I realized that I may not have locked the safe. I returned to the room and the safe door was closed, but not locked. At that time I checked the contents of my wallet and found some, but not all of my cash missing. The floor was still wet from mopping and the cleaning crew had just started on the next room. I immediately notified my concierge Alex (Alejandro) who was at his desk. He declined to speak with the cleaning crew and instead said that security would come take a report. Security arrived approx 45-60 minutes later and took a brief statement from me, but declined to talk to the cleaning crew at that time. They set the expectation that we would receive a report the next day. We did not receive a report on Tues and were told it would be ready at the time of our check-out on Wed. However, it was not ready at that time. I emailed Secrets twice upon my arrival home and did not receive a response. After involving my travel agent, Secrets emailed me a copy of the incident report that I filled out. I have followed up with Secrets numerous times without any resolution. I have finally given up dealing with the Red Tape that rivals any Gov office and admitted defeat. However, I will never stay at any Secrets property again or any property owned by their parent company.

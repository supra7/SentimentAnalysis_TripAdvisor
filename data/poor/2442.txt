Horrible Hotel. Railings on balconies rusty. Management & staff rude. Food mediocre quality. They let birds eat the food off the buffet while your serving yourself. The service is slow. The staff doesn't know how to use the computers so the edit your bills with incorrect amounts (so they can make larger tips). They run out of towels daily at pool. They over charge for crappy beach chair service. They are constantly doing construction and making noise early in the am. The rooms have horrible sounds through out the night from other rooms. The maids barely clean the rooms. The internet is sporadic which is supposed to be free. The pool staff is not friendly, rather rude when asking for help. 90% of the concierges have no clue what they are talking about and all they want to do is book you to listen to the time share pitch at the westin villas. the spa treatment staff talk during your whole massage or treatment. bottom line there is a hyatt right down the beach that is way better or a ritz up the road.

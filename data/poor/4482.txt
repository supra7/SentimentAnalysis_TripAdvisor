Suggest you check the review complaints as far back as 2004 nothing has changed obvious Management dont care ! All 80 people from our tour group (average age 50 years? ) were most dissatisfied with this poor excuse for a 4 star hotel. It is only suitable for YOUNG BACKPACKERS looking for basic food & accommodation. Appalling Negatives: 400+ Rooms 1970 decor, old and tired, many complaints from our group, some smelt so bad (dry pipes) people had to change rooms. No fridge, Air/Con ineffective, no tea facilities. Bathroom inadequate, damaged tiles, water pressure varied, plastic curtain over bath. Breakfast and Dinner was the worse we had experienced during our 5 week European tour, so bad most people refused to eat it. Apparently the Restaurant and Cafeteria are contracted by the hotel. Meat tough, poor quality, limited vegetables, watery scrambled eggs and dessert, only canned fruit, terrible coffee, processed meat & cheese. Some food obviously recycled. Staff unfriendly, unhelpful unless you are Spanish, except for receptionist Gilabert ( must have read his bad reviews and improved). Old TV, poor reception no English channels. Sirens & traffic noise from busy railway station. Positives: Noisy but central location close to train. Free wireless. Clean rooms although inadequate unless your young and dont care, just want a cheap bed & terrible food. Summary: Terrible. All 80 people cant be wrong. This is not a 4 star hotel lucky to be a 2 star. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED

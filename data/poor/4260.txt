Our plane arrived over an hour late so we did not get to the hotel until about 1 AM. Then we were told our room was not ready yet! Could have another one but the girl at the desk said this was one of their nicest so we decided to wait the xtra hour. The room was not nice-very small and nothing special about it. Thought the hotel was rather dingy looking. Did tell the person at the desk when we checked out how unhappy we were and that we would not be staying at their properties again. The next 2 nights were at MGM and were marvelous. We have been to Harrah's in St Louis and love the casino but LV Harrah's was a huge disappointment.

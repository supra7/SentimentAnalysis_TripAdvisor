I regularly stay at the W Westwood in LA. What an amazing hotel. I love it there. Boy, what a surprise the W New York was. The lobby is grand but the rooms were horrible. I ended up checking out and going to the Four Seasons for only $100 more a night. The room was dirty (hair on the sofa), the wall sockets were misfit and dangling, the carpet was ripped, and the wallpaper and plaster was peeling. While the manager went out of his way to try to accommodate me, the hotel was booked and they were unable to give me a better room. I would put this hotel in the Ramada, Howard Johnson catagory. I would never stay here, especially for that price ($609), and i'm glad I went to teh 4 Seasons- It was perfect. Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. I should have listened to the negative reviews here. Don't make my mistake.

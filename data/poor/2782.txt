Mold, paint peeling off the walls, bathroom and heater unit held together with caulk, nasty stains on carpets and furniture, failure to vacuum the floor even once during my 3-night stay, and trash and housekeeping supplies left in the hallway for my entire stay were just some of the frustrating, even disgusting, "amenities" of this hotel. The first room I was given was so small (and not New York hotel room small, but closet small) I could not roll my suitcase between the bed and the furniture on either side. When the thermostat did not work (room was at 80 degrees when I entered) they offered to move me to a different room -- on the third floor right above the loud bar/lounge. When I insisted on a room that was comfortable from a temperature perspective where I could sleep, I was told my only choice was to upgrade to a suite. The management of this hotel obviously cares nothing about quality or respecting their guests, and [-] clearly has a major hole in their ratings process to place this poorly maintained property at 3.5 stars. Even given the Times Square location, this is a two-star hotel at best. The fact is I have stayed in Motel 6 or Days Inn rooms that were cleaner, more pleasant and accommodating.

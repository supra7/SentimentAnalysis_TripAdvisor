This hotel is overprice!!! To be honest is not worth spending the money. the food and all the is overprice and is not good. There is no coffee pot, the water cost 5 dollars for a little bottle. A glass of milk is 4 dollars. the staff is very rude and they don't know anything. the rooms are very small with no views. the pools are always closed when you want to go, or there is no towels. The only people who are helpful are the hispanics that work there.

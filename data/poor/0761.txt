If you are looking for a comfortable vacation - this hotel is not for you! I had no idea that the hotel in Hawaii and the one they call most Hawaiian hotel can be so aweful! The room that they gave us first on the ground level was just behond unbearable and had sickening smell of milldew and mold. When we complained they moved us to the room on the 5th floor with the decent view but we were terrified to discover that there was ants everywhere on the floor. I was really scared they'd crawl in our bags. They treated them next day, so there were less of them the day after, but they weren't gone completely. Overall it was just an aweful experience. The mail lobby and main areas were also really bad and run down. The stuff was very friendly and tried to accommodate, but there is not much consolation in that when your room stinks and all the grounds smell like a dump. I guess what you pay is what your get, but this was just really aweful even for the money.

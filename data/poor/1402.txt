At first they tried putting us into a tiny room WITHOUT WINDOW OR A TELEPHONE! Room 316, scary. And there was a tree growing through the room in the middle. At our request they changed us to a different tiny room, but we soon found out there was NO HOT WATER at night, and the dryer doesnt work. Bedsheet felt somewhat wet. Also VERY NOISY at night, b/c the window faces the street and we heard all kinds of shouting/yelling. All experience there is disgusting and we will definitely never ever return.

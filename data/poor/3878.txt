With not cheap rate, I got my worst experience in my life. I was upgraded to an "ocean view" room, but when we arrived the building, we were shocked by the dirty area and how old the building was! The room was worth less than what I paid and the most concern was the safety. I felt horrible and couldn't fall in sleep. The "ocean view" was a lie, people will not swim at this beach and it looks so ugly. The service was rude, or you can say no service at all. Location was not good, far away from nice beach, far away from airport, far away from the shopping town.

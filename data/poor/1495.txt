Out of my numerous visits to Singapore, this stay was the worst of all. Not because of anything else but due to the booking in this hotel. It is lower then a budget hotel if you have any lower ranking. Cramped rooms, TV was placed above the bathroom door- you can imagine the size of the room. With light off when you enter the room, your leg get hit by something big - that's your bed. No restaurant. Lousy reception. I felt its for couples who need rooms for a couple of hours maybe.This should be your last choice- sorry not choice forced stay. I didn't know this was booked and my stay was short and I did not get my choice hotels, and I did not want to make another mistake by changing to any hotel I was getting after this horrible experience.

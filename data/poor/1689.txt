When we spend weekends in Dallas, this is the hotel we normally stay at for the convenience of location as well as price. Normally it is a pleasant experience. HOWEVER, this time we went it seems they have gotten new management. The first night there were several basketball teams there. They ran up and down the hall, yelling and screaming, slamming doors until after midnight. (These were adults doing this too). Also, the bathroom wasn't very clean. So we requested a room change. The next night, we awakened by what sounded like a few couples coming in intoxicated and talking very loudly and slamming their doors until well after 2:30 am. They were up slamming doors and talking loudly again at 7 am. The management did move our room, but honestly we could have used a small refund for all the noise we had to endure. We came to Dallas to rest, and rest we did not get. :( Also, there was a dead roach in the elevator the entire 3 days we were there. In our first room, in the tub, there was something gloppy hanging from behind the overfill drain. and the remote didn't work. In the second room, on the wall going into the bathroom there were 2 or 3 clothing stickers (the kind you see that tell you what size jeans are and such) stuck to the wall of this supposedly just cleaned room. ?????????

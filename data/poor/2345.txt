We were very disappointed given the cost ($998/nite). Started off with no one available to help unload our car then gave us bad info about parking. The exclusive gate to the Napua Towers did not lock so many people were walking through. Evening buffet was crowded with people/kids from everywhere dripping wet with beach tubes still around their waists knocking over trays/dishes. They did not enforce the no beach attire rule. The buffet itself has been downsized. No coffee or tea available. Morning buffet full of half awake bedhead kids in pajamas. Electrical outlet did not work in our cave like room which made it even darker. Room service could not supply the good smelling lotion we used to love even though we saw it on their carts. Pool was so crowded on the weekend that we could not find available lounge chairs. Women's restrooms at the pool did not work the entire day of Mon. Oct. 23rd. We could not use the pool for fear of where everone was really going.... Beautiful grounds to walk through and art work to look at but not worth it to pay the price to stay there.

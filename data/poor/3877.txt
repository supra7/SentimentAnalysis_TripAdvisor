My boyfriend and I went to Maui for vacation, and needed a place to stay the night that was cheap before heading to where we continued our stay. Upon arrival, the Maui Lu looked nice, and clean. Decent for the price, $99 a night. (Maybe we should have tried the other hotel for $4 more) We checked in and the staff was very friendly, and directed us on how everything worked eventhough we were there only one night. When we got in our room, we were very suprised. The whole room was run down. Looking at the outside, you would think it would have been updated. Our room had 2 double beds, when we requested and paid in full for a King bed. Everything in the room was brown. A mini fridge acted as a night stand. The beds were horribly uncomfortable. Our bathroom loooked disgusting, we refused to even take a bath, and limited out showers because of this. (Later in the night I found about 50 mini ants around the sink). And our "garden View" consisted of a fence with a bush. Our room was right next to the maids closet, so you could constantly hear the door shutting, and noises from the dryers. The only good thing about this "resort" was the pool, it was amazing. Very nice, eventhough we didnt find out where the pool was until after we checked out. And also, the access to the beaches in Kihei. After our day we went to the Cliff's Edge in Huelo Point, and I recommend that to anyone. The Maui Lu is run down, and not worth the money. We had a friend of the owner's of the Cliffs Edge who wouldv'e let us stay a night at his Beach House for the price of the Maui Lu. Too bad we didn't know before we made our reservations.

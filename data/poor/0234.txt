This hotel was terrible. My company booked this place because everything else was COMPLETELY sold out in Seattle. My room had an overwhelming smell of urine, stains in the carpet, the carpet was torn up in multiple places and the bathroom, beds and carpet were filthy. I immediately tried to find a way out, however, there were no hotel rooms anywhere in the city. After pleading, I was given the keys to 5 other rooms, and ultimately had to settle with the best of them. I would not recommend this place...EVER!

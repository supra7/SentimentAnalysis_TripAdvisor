My mother and I stayed at the Marrakech hotel for 3 nights. The first issue we encountered was that there was no elevator. There were around 20 steps just to get to the front desk. The security was very helpful and carried our luggage up the stairs and to our room. We were booked for a queen size bed on the 3rd floor. My mother has an illness that makes it very hard for her to climb stairs. We explained this to the front desk staff. We asked if we could go to a different hotel. They said we could not and the best they could offer us was a double bed on the 2nd floor (the same floor as the front desk). They would not reduce the cost, so we ended up paying for a queen size bed but stayed in a double bed. We were told this is because we booked through Orbitz. The room was extremely small. There was no place in the bathroom to place personal items except the toilet lid. The shower temperature was hard to control. Either it was very hot or very cold. There were gaps between the air conditioner and the windows where air, bugs etc. could enter the room. We wondered if the air conditioner could fall to the street below. The room did get very hot at night. We called to ask how we could turn it down. We were told that they would need to do that in the basement. They must have turned it completely off because the following night it was chilly. I didnt notice any bed bugs. The room was mostly clean except for the floor by the window being dirty. I will never stay there again and we will be asking for a refund. The only positive thing I can say was that the security staff was very helpful and seemed to care about our situation.

This place does not understand guest service. I can not believe they put this property together to compete in a very competitive Branson market without any thought from the guest perspective. Water park water is frigid, and there is not a hot tub??? The dumping water bucket was broken or off along with lazy river buckets. Breakfast buffet is a joke, filling cereal dispensers with always save cereals in the dining room, staff completely pissed at the lack of help, zero professionalism. The maid service didnt even bother to make up the beds or clean the bathroom. The marketing and the exterior look are beautiful, but the service inside is a miss. Sorry to say, spend your money somewhere else.

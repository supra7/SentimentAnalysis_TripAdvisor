Although this place looks charming on the website, RUN don't walk from this dump. As we walked down the musty, dirty hallway, we saw two patrons with their doors open in their underway smoking and cooking their smelly dinner. The room is small, shabby,dirty and cold. Amenities? None here. The location and neighborhood are great as is the price. However, unless you want a Flophouse or run down YMCA, look elsewhere. I swear this place is a half way house! We checked out the next morning and headed for the Westin. This place is scary!! I would not even give this place one star!

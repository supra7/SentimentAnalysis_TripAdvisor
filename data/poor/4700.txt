Two friends and I were scheduled to stay here on our girls trip to Universal Studios. It was chosen because of the price, we were only sleepig there. But when we arrived we knew immediately there was NO WAY we could stay there. The first thing we noticed were shady characters in the lobby. There was only one shuttle per day to our destination, which we had already missed, so we'd have to charter a cab. We checked into our room & were shocked to find mold all over the ceiling. All the furniture looked old & dirty. My friend quickly contacted her husband & he rebooked us in another hotel. The desk clerk was extremely understanding & gave us no problems when we wanted to leave. Overall, I'd say the little extra you'd have to pay to be closer to the parks is WELL worth it!!!

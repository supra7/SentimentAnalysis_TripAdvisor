The room was tiny, so tiny you had to move the matted footstool out of the way to move around to the desk. The fireplace did not work. The view was of the parking lot. Sheets paper thin, bedding was old in general. The prior guests items were not removed from the fridge. The lobby is small and cramped. Do yourself a favor and stay ANYWHERE else.

We did not have a pleasant experience at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. We got placed in the room across from the stairwell, which meant that we heard people outside our room all night. More importantly, the air conditioner stopped working in the early evening on one of the hottest nights of the year, which meant that when we returned from dinner, the room was 80 degrees and very humid. We called down to the front desk, and they called maintenance. Thirty minutes later the maintenance attendant came and said that the A/C was working fine (which it was not, incidentally). An hour later, although the thermostat was set at 64, the room was still hot and humid. We went down to the front desk to ask them if there was anything else they could do, such as fix the problem or put us in another room. They called the maintenance attendant again, who said that nothing could be done. Throughout this process, the front desk agents were extremely rude and apathetic to us during the process, even though there were no other guests who needed service. They were talking with each other, and when I tried to ask them, they would give me terse responses and refer me to maintenance. On the maintenance attendant's fourth trip to the room, he provided us with a noisy but effective table fan. We found it peculiar that the hotel front desk staff were so rude, while the maintenance attendant was quite accommodating. Lastly, we received a wake-up call at 5:00am that we did not order. So, if you're looking for a $200 room without A/C in the middle of summer in Boston, and to get woken up throughout the night by staircase traffic and finally by the front desk staff, the Fairmont Copley Plaza is the place for you. There are better choices, like the EconoLodge in Braintree.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the grounds are okay, almost pretty, in fact, as long as you don't look too far to the side (at the 1970's Ozark shacks) or too close to the wood and siding damage on most buildings. Its good to hear they are tearing down next year! Its probably a great investment property for a complete rehab/renovation. Of course, once they redo it none of us will be able to afford the place! BYO-hairdryer, coffee pot, cleaning supplies....even a lamp shade or two to replace the dirty ones! The price is pretty good but you WILL feel upset when you get to your room. Even for just a "room to sleep in" its too dingy, old, a little moldy!!! Digging up an extra $20-30 a night will be worth your peace of mind! Trust me (my idea of comfort is a clean $40-room on mainland, I'm not just being a snob)! You won't enjoy hanging out at their pool much and you'll enjoy the beach near by even less. There were a couple old, torn up beach chairs to sit on if you dare but I don't think the hotel even put them there. When its high-tide there's barely any beach to speak of. The better beaches (and probably better hotels) in Kehei are about 10-15 minutes south of where the Maui Lu is located (Kam I-III and below are the better beaches). Two good things about the hotel...I think there staff is probably pretty good considering their working environment is not great and if you are going to drive to the west, north or if you dare venture to Hana (seriously its about 1/4 th of the way there you don't think you can handle another blind hairpin turn!) at least the Maui Lu is one of the first hotels you come to in Kehei.

I stayed at this hotel for a business conference. My room was paid for by my company. I ordered room service and paid for it with my own charge card. The hotel failed to charge the room to the company even though I reminded the front desk to do so at both check in and check out. Instead, three weeks later, the room was charged on my own charge card. Nobody called me for authorization. I received no receipt. I contacted the hotel to remedy the error. The accounting department fixed it after my accounting department contacted them. (Thank you, Victoria.) My complaint is with the front desk. I had to call multiple times over the course of three days to resolve this problem. Each time I called, speaking to the various people who answered the phone at the front desk was like speaking to teenagers with bad attitudes. Further, had the front desk processed the reservation under my company's account as I asked them to do, then this problem would have never existed. What a bad experience. A little work on the front desk could have prevented this problem altogether, or at least it would have made the resolution process less frustrating.

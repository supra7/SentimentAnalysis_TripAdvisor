I had the unfortunate opportunity to spend one night , June 22, 2009 (3 were booked) in this hotel. I have never stayed in a filthier place. When I drove up I thought there would be a problem, once I entered the elevator and smelled the mix of urine and vomit and saw the filth I knew this was not the place for me. My room was dirty, complete with cockroaches and the smell of decades of cigarette smoke and filth compiled. I was so concerned about sleeping in the bed I sprayed it with germ killer and wore socks along with my pajamas in bed. I checked out the next morning and am now dealing with horrible itchy bumps all over my arms, which were not covered by pajamas and have not gone away after 1-1/2 wks. I have a dermatologist appt on Tues! When you read this is a great hotel for budget travelers, beware. There were people lingering in bushes and hanging out in the parking lot at all hours of the night. I did not feel safe at this hotel.

Our first disappointment was calling before arrival to have the concierge book a reservation at Salty's, only to learn that the concierge was "gone for the day" at 4:15 p.m. Upon arrival, we were assigned a room that was 76 degrees and wouldn't cool down. Then, they had one of their employees (name not remembered) take us to another room that was 75 degrees. Both rooms were in the South Tower on a sunny, 40-degree day and they obviously had no cooling capability available. Third room was across from the elevator (we requested not near an elevator or ice machine) and reeked of chlorine. Why would they try to put anyone in a room with a heavy chlorine odor? Doesn't anyone on staff realize this is not a good idea? At that point, the employee assisting us put me on the phone to a supervisor named Kathryn who sarcastically said "Sooooo, Mr. XXXX, I understand we don't have any rooms that please you?". Kathryn clearly needs some remedial training in customer relations, or better yet, another job. To which I replied that all we wanted was a room with working heating/cooling that didn't reek of chlorine and wasn't next to an elevator or ice machine. Fourth room was in the North Tower and was nice, but the ice machine for that floor had been removed and not replaced. We noticed that all four of the rooms we experienced had only one drinking glass in the bathroom. Be advised that there are no bathroom exhaust fans in any of the Westin's rooms and plan on a steamy bathroom when you take a shower. The Westin's location is superb, but they desperately need to pay attention to their level of service.

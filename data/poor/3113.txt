Be very careful before booking Use extreme caution before booking here. When I made my reservation by phone, I specifically asked for a quiet room. What I got is what I feared would happen: a room on the first level near Market Street. The conversations of people on the streets, traffic, streetcars, others slamming iron gates to the 2nd and third floors was a shattering noisy nightmare. The room stank, had no air, and it was difficult to breath. Tthe shower was something you would not want to use. I tryed to rest in the room after arrving early afternoon and it was impossible. After dinner, I returned to the room and decided it was not the kind of place I wanted to spend the night. When I announced at the office I would be leaving because the room was noisy, stank, and I couldn't breath, I asked for an adjustment or partial refund, the manager was called by phone (not on location) and my request was denied. It was a blessing in disguise. It was well worth the cost to leave this establishment- never to return.

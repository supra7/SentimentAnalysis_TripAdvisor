My friends and I travel together quite a lot. We had booked more than a month in advance and had requested two doubles, but despite the fact that we arrived at 11 in the morning, we were told that they were out of doubles, so we had to take a king (lumpy mattress) and a fiendishly uncomfortable rollaway (the good news: they didn't charge us for the rollaway). The room was so small that the rollaway barely fit, so that we had to crawl over the person in it to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The toilet leaked -- they fixed it fairly promptly, but after that, it flushed only with great difficulty. Also, the shower dripped loudly all night, and nothing we did could make it stop. There was no coffeemaker in the room (we were told, after the fact, that we could have "requested" one, but I'm sure they would have charged us for it), but you could buy coffee in the lobby during breakfast for $2.50 a cup! Needless to say, the breakfast wasn't free; there was a minibar in the room, but none of us were interested in paying the ridiculous prices for that. Our advice: get up early and go to Houlihan's a few blocks away for the $10 breakfast buffet. Internet access was $14.95 per computer per day, the highest price we've ever paid anywhere, and the only time we've had to pay for internet access anywhere in more than two years. There was one dataport in the room; all three of us had laptops and needed to get some work done, so this was very inconvenient. The only wireless access was in the lobby and apparently, there was a charge for that, too. The staff was nice but fairly indifferent, and I have to say we've been treated better at the cheapest chain hotel off the interstate than we were here, and at less than a third of the price. We were embarrassed to have recommended this place to our friends. No, we wouldn't stay here again.

When we got to our hotel, the room was not ready, and there were no baggage carts. I waited in the lobby until our room was ready (which is no easy feat with two young children). The room itself was fine; however, we noticed upon returning to the hotel to bathe our kids that night that there were no washcloths in the bathroom, only two towels, and two hand towels. Luckily the brought up towels and washcloths. When we went to bed, I discovered that there were no extra pillows in the room, and the pillows can best be described as huge clumps of cotton shoved into a pillowcase. The pillows were beyond flat. Not a huge deal - I called downstairs and asked for more pillows and was told they had run out of pillows!!!!!!!!! My quality of sleep was very poor because of this. Also, you could hear everything in the hallway - the walls are very thin. When people came back to the hotel at 3 a.m. being loud in the hallway, both I and my children were awakened. Several of the lamps did not work, and one of the outlets did not work. The location is great, but we paid $200 a night for this hotel, and expected much better quality than we received.

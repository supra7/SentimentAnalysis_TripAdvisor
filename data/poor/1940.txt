I was at the Park Plaza for a convention and was given a room that in many hotels in this price range would be the size of the bathroom. on my second night, I awoke to a large roach roaming the room. I asked to get another room so they gave me a room with a pullout couch for a bed (at least it didn't have any bugs). After getting home I begaN to itch and have hundreds of welts all over my body, BED BUGS!!!! Stay away from this hotel at all costs!

Good Hotel very poor service Difficult review to write. I'll start out with the negatives. We arrived at 11pm having flown in from the Carribbean. I had booked a room for three adults. When we arrived all they had left was a room with a King. They offered a rollaway bed for my 6 foot 2 inch son. They claimed they had no rooms left with more than one bed, including suites and they could not offer a second room. After much arguement, we had no option but to take the room and my sons legs dangled over the end of his very flimsly rollaway bed. For this reason I cannot give this hotel anythin other than a poor rating.They did give us two (although not three) free breakfasts as compensation.However, putting that problem to one side, the hotel is very well located, just off 5th Avenue. The room we stayed in was big, well decorated with a nice new bathroom. I would stay here again, but only if I had ensured that they would hold a proper room for me until I arrived.

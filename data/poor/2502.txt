Very bad place We stayed at the hotel in two days from the 12of dec. to the 14of dec. 2008. The hotel are run down, the room are smelly and dirty, and the staff are not very helpfully at all.Eating breakfast at the hotel is expencive and you are still hungry after, because of the very small portions. We where gratefull that we only had to spent two days there, before going to Miami port for a seven days cruise with the beautifull ship Freedom of the Seas. Never again the Marseilles Hotel.

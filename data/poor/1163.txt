I give this hotel 10/10 not a terrible review, it would not let me select anything other than 1/5. The hotel was nice and cosy. The staff were helpful. If you don't mind walking around then this hotel is conveniently located with a short walk to Macy's, we also walked to central park (~45 minute walk) even though everyone thought we were crazy. There are stores on the way to central park so it gives you something to do. 2 blocks away is a pizza place "2 bros" where you can get 99c slices of pizza, there is also a pharmacy/convenient store around the corner. I would definately stay at the hotel again. Last time we stayed opposite Madison square gardens and paid a fortune for a crappy room, if you want a nice room the Wyndham chelsea is definately a nice hotel.

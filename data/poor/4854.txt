Front Desk were all young woman I guessed they worked here part time and were college students. When checking in I felt like I was imposing and they were doing me a favor. After the cold reception I went to my room and though nicely decorated and clean was too small I couldn't walk around the bed without tripping. Don't stay here I would go as far as paying less for a 2 star than stay here again.

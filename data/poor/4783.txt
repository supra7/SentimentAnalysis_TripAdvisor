As soon as we got the keys from our rooms, we checked the rooms and I was really looking for bed gugs because of many reviews about that.. but did not find any. so we agreed to stay... I suggest to check the room more propperly before paying for it! after we payed, we got to room. then I found some other people clothes fallen behind the heatings, the aircondition was not working so good, the room was so small ( in the room I was with my boyfriend), we did not have enough space for all our stuff and when I imagined that I am going for shopping there... where should I put all that staff? There was a little space like warderobe , but with 2 hangers only! The other room of my friend was a little bigger I can say. Regarding the shower and restroom, it was not so bad, actually clean all day, but I would never step there without a flip-flops :) But what really made me confused and angry till now is that even we had privacy sign on the door, the housekeeping service entered the room! That time we were not inside, but I could recognize that they were there cause the bed was made. But exuse me, if I require a privacy by hanging the sign on the door.... this was too much. This hostel has EXCELLENT location for 100%, the subway station is really close!!

This place should have been torn down and rebuilt years ago, from the ants crawling everywhere in the room to the filthy carpets I will never recomend this place to anyone! The maid service is something else, as they clean or spot clean on their own time and don't give a darn about the person staying in the rooms schedule! No restraunt within walking distance and No services of any kind except a local newspaper and a Pop machine!! I WOULDN'T EVER RECOMENND THIS TO ANYONE (EVEN ON A BUDGET) If I ever go back to Maui I won't stay here! Pretty much left a bad taaste in my mouth for a vacation resort! Next time give me Mexico anyday!!!!!!!

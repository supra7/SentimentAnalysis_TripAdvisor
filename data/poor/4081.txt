If you like noise and no privacy, the Grant Park Hotel is for you. Be sure to ask for the "Lake View" room, which guarantees the soothing roar of Michigan Avenue beneath your bed all night. Forgot to set your alarm? Don't worry, you'll hear the one in the next room just fine. Room too warm? The air conditioner does double duty by loudly drowning out the buses and honking outside your window, and you'll think it's January with an open window as an icy breeze blow dries your hair as you sleep. If you want to remember your breakfast all day with stomach cramps and an urgency to be near a toilet, don't miss a meal in the adjoining restaurant. If you haven't had time to finish the novel you brought on your trip, you'll easily get through a chapter or two before your order is taken, and you'll be well into your next book before your food arrives.

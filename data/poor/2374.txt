We stayed at the Maui Prince for 1 night, we were booked for 7 nights. After spending 10 nights at the Mauna Kea, we started the second part of a 2 island holiday. Before booking this hotel we checked Trip Advisor reviews and the Prince hotel website. Both were very positive. On arrival we were shown to a room overlooking the rear loading dock. No upgrades which was surprising considering we had just stayed at the sister resort. This was one of the most depressing,dated, worn hotels I have seen. The place was deserted and had some wierd policies, such as not being credited the $50.00 per day credit unless you used it for their bland meals. After one night we went looking for other accommodations. Assuming the lack of people at the Maui prince was due to the economy. We were very suprised to find most of the other resorts on the wailea booked nearly solid. We ended up staying at the Fairmont Kea Lani at a price that was only about $100.00 more per night. The manager at the Maui Prince gave us a story about the sister resort Mauna Kea stealing all of their profits to finance the upgrades at the Mauna Kea? I heard later that the Maui Price is sold and is going to be torn down. Why prince resorts is continuing to promote this dump is beyond me. We were confused after the Maui Prince was being promoted by some of the staff at Mauna Kea. We were grateful to the concierge at the Kea Lani for salvaging an otherwise horrible experience,

I urge you not to waste your time and money on this place. I went to NYC for my birthday for a few days. On the last day of our stay, I personally found 3 cockroaches in the bathroom. I was utterly disgusted. We went to talk to the staff and they said they would need to check it out themselves. I am convinced that during that time they killed the cockroaches themselves and got rid of the evidence. I even called them on it but of course they denied it. Unfortunately we forgot to take a picture of the cockroaches so essentially, it was our word against theirs and there was nothing we could do. After I began to cry because this incident occurred ON my birthday and I was so upset, they FINALLY offered a discount of 50 %- too low if you ask me. We immediately left and stayed at another hotel for our last night. Dont waste your time on this dirty overpriced place !

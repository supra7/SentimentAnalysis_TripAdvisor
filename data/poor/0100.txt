The single rooms in this hotel are so sparse (which is intentional, I know) and ugly that it seemed like we were trapped in a hospital - all white walls, sink basin in room, small rectangle shape. The beds are hard as rocks, the blankets are rough, and it's really noisy. This is the most overrated hotel I've ever stayed at, and I'm a fan of 'modern' stype hotels.

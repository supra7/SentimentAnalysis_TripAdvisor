Miserable experience If I could have given this hotel no stars that would have been too many. If anything can ruin a stay in Hawaii, it is a hotel that is dirty, outdated, with an uncaring staff. The decor of this hotel is straight out of the 1980s. That wouldn't be a problem if it were clean and well maintained. But it wasn't. The carpet was stained and some of the lights didn't work. It is not near the beach and thus there aren't a lot of places to eat after normal working hours. The parking garage was difficult to get around and in some spaces if you are over 5 feet tall watch your head getting out of the vehicle. Perhaps worst of all, my coworker and I got stuck in the elevator for 70 minutes. Once we were finally freed, no one from the hotel asked if we were okay or apologized. And when I complained about the poor customer service still no apology. They did not seem to care at all. I don't know if that is common and thus they don't consider it a situation that requires an apology or at least an Are you okay?. The lack of customer service and dirty rooms can definitely ruin a trip to Hawaii. If I could have stayed at the delightful Hilton Hawaiian Village I would have.

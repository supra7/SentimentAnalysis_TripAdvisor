stayed here last week and they drew over 8000 usd on our credit card. after many phone calls we are still waiting for this money to be released. never heard of it before but they say it is a security. Rooms where prepaid and all trips have been paid. Please explain. Still have to wait 24 hours. Not fun with a credit card limit of 10000. Never again. On our Honeymoon.

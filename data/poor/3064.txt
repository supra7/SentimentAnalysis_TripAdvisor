I stayed at this hotel about 3 weeks ago and it was the worst time I have ever had at a hotel before. I had stayed here about 1 and a half years ago and it was the best time my family had ever had. Coming back to this hotel was a disappointment because the staff is very unfriendly and the hotel grounds look horrible. The restaurants on property were absolutely disgusting. I cant believe they call Latitude 30 their fine dining restaurant. It was dead when we walked in there and the food tasted like it was old. the only part of the hotel that was decent was the waterpark and the bar staff there was so friendly. I believe it was Brian and Sam who were our bar staff for the weekend and they were wonderful and made my stay better. I will never come back to this hotel and I hope others never come to this hotel.

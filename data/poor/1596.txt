This motel claims a bar that is open until 2am. I changed my original reservation was at another hotel; I changed it to this place because of the bar that was supposed to be open on a Saturday until 2am. I checked in at 12:30am and went to the bar and it was closed. I then tried to get on my wireless device to look for a local bar to go to. There was no wireless. I called the allstar at the desk for him to recommend a place; he recommended a gas station or the gift shop that only sold coke. No bar. No wireless. No usefull staff. No care. Beligerently pathetic excuse for a full service property.

Check-in Asked for a room with strip view on the higher floor, but was told no room was available. However, one of my colleagues arrived few hours later than me but he got a room on the high floor facing the strip. I am Asian but my colleague is white. It makes think the hotel registration staff is racist. Concierge No help at all. The service booklet in the hotel room states that if you want to go to XS nightclub, you could call concierge for help so that you dont have to wait in long line. So, I called the concierge but didnt get any help. The staff told me I have to wait in line and pay the $30 coverage. Resort fee It is mandatory to pay the $20 daily resort fee now. You actual daily rate would be your room rate plus the daily resort fee.

We are glad to hear someone was happy with the Hyatt Regency in Maui. We went there in 1988 for our honeymoon and would never go back. The grounds were awesome and it was an ideal location; however, we found it to be the most impersonal stay that we have ever had. We have returned to Maui every year since that and we still have to say that the Hyatt Regency did not even grant us a smile. The workers, at that time, were performing a job and did not even make eye contact with you most of the time. We had heard from others about their honeymoon surprises (even a simple lei greeting) upon arrival in Maui at their less expensive destinations. We were granted zero. We booked our own honeymoon 14 night stay with the hotel directly and my husband told him that it was our honeymoon and he wanted it special so that was why he booked directly with the hotel. We paid the full rack price since we did not know better that we were there during low season and that everyone offered discounts. We were basically going for "top of the line" and we were assuming that we would get it. We have directed and planned many travelers to Maui since we have been there so often and by " word of mouth" people we do not even know call us for tips and advice. We have always told people of our poor experience at the Hyatt and gave them other Kaanapali destinations as well as other delightful West Maui vacation spots. We have walked through the Hyatt grounds every year since 1988 since they are so nice and we have noticed the changes each year. We spent 2 weeks there in 1988 on our honeymoon and we still remember that year as our worst Maui stay and hopefully it will remain that way!

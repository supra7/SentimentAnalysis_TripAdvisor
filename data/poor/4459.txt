I traveled to Las Vegas with a group of cheap, non-gamblers! The four ladies I was with made their own reservations, separate from mine...thank God for small favors! They ended up staying at the Gold Spike (@$20.00 per night) for 4 days and 3 nights of hell! I stayed at the Rio for the entire time and they ended up staying with me the last night of our trip. When we arrived on Fremont Street, they were dragging their luggage and we could not find the Gold Spike. We ended up asking a man that was HOMELESS!! He directed us to the Gold Spike and told us it was the luckiest place in town! He failed to mention that the room was dirty, dark, dusty, and the casino smelled of fresh and old urine! It is a local place, but even the locals are kinda scary looking! No lie, there was a blind may playing the slots when we walked in!!! My friends complained of the smell and the dirty bathroom. Each night we were in Vegas, they returned to their rooms before the sun went down because they were fearful for their lives! Leason learned for my travel buddies...you get what you pay for!

This place is not worth the money we spent! My husband and I stayed for my birthday and the room is plain. I was expecting something more elegant. Also, we tried to get into Club PM which is under the hotel and my husband and his two friends were denied entry! They told us we were only allowed two guests per key!! And the club was dead inside! We would have been doing them a favor by coming in! The guy who was working the door was named "CRAIG" who wouldn't let our guests in. He even looked like CRAIG from the movie "Friday" and he obviously didn't belong in the club by the way he looked!!! We got a free breakfast because of this ordeal, and the breakfast was the worst breakfast I have had ever had! Crunchy and cold. Orange juice had a bad aftertaste. Don't go here, do yourself a favor go to the "W".

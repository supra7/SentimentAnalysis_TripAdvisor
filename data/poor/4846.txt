Planning a family trip with our grandkids, we tried booking a room on this hotel's web site only to have it crash on us. We called their reservation line and they made a new reservation for us, saying they would look into whether the web reservation had gone through and cancel it if it had so we weren't double booked. When we showed up at the desk they showed the web reservation as having been made and canceled but had no record of the reservation made via phone. Fair enough, these things can happen, but this is where things went from bad to worse. Having arrived after a day of traveling with our 9 and 11 year old grandkids, we were obviously frazzled and tired. Their response was to alternately leave us sitting in the lobby and send out various supervisors to question us again and again about just what happened. At the end of all of this they announced they had no room for us. They said they would try to find an equivalent room in a nearby hotel, and came up with what was obviously a third-rate hotel (the room would cost about 1/3 their rate and include breakfast) which was a mile away from their desirable location, or anything else. When we pointed out that this fell far short of an equivalent room nearby they "went back to the drawing board." After spending a total of just under two hours in their lobby I went to the counter and told the desk clerk to please get the manager as we were tired of waiting. The desk clerk returned without the manager to announce that they were still working hard on it so we walked out. No one tried to stop us or even said sorry for the mixup. If this is the kind of service you get before you even get in the door, heaven help you if a problem emerges after you're checked in! This hotel charges premium prices for a level of service Motel 6 would be ashamed of.

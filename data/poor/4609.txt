When I first go there I was assigned a room that spelled like mold and mildew. I contacted the front desk and I was later given a better room but the Air condition was loud and never cooled the room. I really didnt want to raise another issue. I just checked out the next morning. Thinking, this is the very worst Embassy Suite, I have ever stayed in. Thanks, Denise

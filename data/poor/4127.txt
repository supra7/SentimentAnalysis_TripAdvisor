A disaster from the start. We had reserved two adjoining rooms at the Whitehall, upon check-in were told that 1) only one of the rooms was ready (it was 4:30pm!) and 2) that they actually don't have adjoining rooms. There was confusion among the front desk staff about the difference between rooms "next to" each other and rooms "near" each other. We had waited about 20 minutes just to get to the front of the check-in line, so we just wanted to get to our rooms to relax before dinner and took what we were given. Next, the room. I'd expect better from a motel. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls (see pictures) and the a/c unit was literally falling out of the wall. After a little debate and a few phone calls, we gathered our things and checked out. I will say that the front desk manager handled the situation well and did not charge us a penny. Skip it--there are better hotel deals in the city. The only thing going for the Whitehall is the location.

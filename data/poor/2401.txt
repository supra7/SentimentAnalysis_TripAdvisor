We never even made it inside for a drink in their lounge because they ask for $10 to self-park. Don't get me wrong, sometimes parking lots should charge. But this is a huge, empty lot. They are soaking their guests and deterring others from checking out their facilities. We will just have to guess as to how nice the place might be.

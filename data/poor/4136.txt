Hotel was looking shabby. Non-smoking room smelled badly of cigarette smoke. When we left early because of the smoke odors, they tried to collect a cancellation fee for early departure. Don't pay it! I didn't and they backed off. Staff was not very helpful and corridor noise was horrendous. This once lovely old property has clearly fallen on hard times

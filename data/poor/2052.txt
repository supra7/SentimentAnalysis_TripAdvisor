THE STAFF WAS VERY UNFRIENDLY. Room was supposed to be available at 3 p.m. but we could not get into ours until 5 p.m. AND it was not the room we reserved because our room supposedly had an odor that the previous traveler left behind from cooking something in the kitchenette! Gross. Also, found several hairs in the bathroom. How gross is that?! Would not recommend this hotel to anyone....not even my worst enemy.

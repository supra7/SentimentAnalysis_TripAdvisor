I stayed here for my girlfriends birthday retreat. The worst customer service I've ever encountered anywhere. Hotel staff incorrectly billed my rooms after multiple attempts of explanation on my part. Staff is incompetent, not polite, and unapologetic about their mistakes. I live in Hawaii for many years and have stayed all over Lahaina area, but this is not worth the $350 a night I paid. Very disappointing. Small room, rude staff, and I did not feel like I was in paradise at all. There are many other amazing hotels in the area worth the amount you pay. Please look elsewhere before booking. Don't make the mistake I did, equating price with value. I won't pay more than $100 a night to stay here.

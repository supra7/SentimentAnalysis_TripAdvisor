We checked in to a room that was "maybe" 100 square feet with one full size bed...for my husband, myself and my teen daughter. When I was told the hotel was "100% booked" and nothing else was available, I tried to make it work by asking for a cot of some type for our daughter. They also had no cots, but offered us bedding so she could "sleep on the floor". Really? For $200 a night? I had to have Priceline intercede as I had booked through Priceline. Guess what: a room with two beds suddenly appeared out of thin air! The room we ended up with was very loud, half the size of comparable rooms in the Chicago market, no mini-bar, no bathtub, a closet that was a cut-out into the wall with no door and a vanity space which consisted of the top of the toilet and a small shelving unit. By the way, shame on Priceline.....this is what qualifies as a top 4 star rating in their system.

Room smelled terribly Our sole purpose for going to Honolulu was to go to the U2 concert, so we arrived at the hotel after midnight. We did appreciate that the hotel kept our room for us, even though we arrived so late.Upon entering the room, it smelled of old cooking oil, almost like the previous owners (the room used to be a condo or apartment) did a lot of deep frying in the apartment. The apartment is very spacious, but the cleanliness of the room was another story. Even though everything was orderly, it just didn't seem clean. Also, when we took our showers, the water wasn't even hot enough. It was just lukewarm.

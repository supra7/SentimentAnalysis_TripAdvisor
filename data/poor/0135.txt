Although my stay was acceptable, I have a colleague who had a reservation that was not honored. When she arrived at the Inn on Virginia Mason they did not have a room! They put her in a hotel 5 miles away. This is absolutely unacceptable: Having a reservation that is not honored and being sent to a hotel 5 miles from where you need to be! If you make a resveration have a backup plan. BEWARE!

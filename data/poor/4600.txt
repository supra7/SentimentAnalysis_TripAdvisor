We are attending an event in New Orleans and embassy suites is the official hotel. This is a great hotel for a gathering...people can get together for breakfast and happy hour in a pleasant central location. BUT the rooms are awful!!! They are not only dated but dirty. I have read previous reviews saying that the dirt should be overlooked because New Orleans is so old...no excuse !!! I stayed in a hundred year old castle last week that was spotless. I don't even want to set on this hotel's couch because it is so nasty! An old hotel can still have clean rugs, walls, and couches. It is 3:30 in the afternoon and our room has still not been cleaned. The entire facility needs to be gutted and remodeled. Embassy Suites has always been a positive experience for me so I am really disappointed in this one. We are paying over two hundred dollars per night (plus the $30 a day for car parking) for a hotel that is not even as nice as the local Motel 6!!!

For the rates, this is a very poor hotel. The amenities are minimal, to say the least. Location is fine, but it's not really a feature of the hotel in the long run. The room was average at best, although the maid did not replenish the toilet paper and the shower was flimsy and cramped. Having "free coffee" and a "sink outside the bathroom" is standard stuff for hotels, so it's something I expect out of a hotel at this price. We wound up paying for parking and were forced to use the valet because a truck was blocking the driveway. Two hotel employees were out on a smoke break and they did nothing to help us, not even a smile or a greeting. The front desk clerk did not ask us how our stay was when we checked out. There is no breakfast, the restaurant is overpriced and overrated, and the "room occupancy tax" is a joke. The heater smelled like cat pee when we turned it on. The coffee selection in the room was poor. The dcor was pretentious and silly. The staff was cold, unfriendly and unhelpful. We asked a fairly generic question at the front desk and the clerk literally shrugged and didn't answer. We would never stay here again.

It's never a good sign when the staff are desperate for you to settle your bill as you check in. The hotel is the only place for 5 blocks or so that isn't a chinese restaurant or other chinese food store; this might not sound too bad but try getting a coffee or some breakfast from one of these places! It also meant the sidewalks were littered with lots of rubbish, and consequently rats (one just missed my foot one night). Whilst I didn't feel unsafe, the area was deserted at night and the subway is a couple of blocks away. The room was awful, no main light in the bedroom, just 2 lamps (one of which stopped working during the stay) and the bathroom has a giant flourescent light which is enough to give you a headache. The toilet blocked during our stay though this was fixed swiftly. The internet didn't work properly. The single lift didn't work properly. The room hadn't been cleaned properly (i found a cigarette lighter on the floor by the side of my bed. The staff were surly and disinterested. They authorised $500 more on my friends card than they told us they were going to. They were most distressed that my friend and I wanted to split the bill right down the middle. We have since left to find they have overcharged her by around $100, and after we contacted them they acknowleged their mistake saying it was because they undercharged me by this amount (i'm not sure how this is possible as I have the receipt here!). Not worth the money, and there are far better hotels in New York.

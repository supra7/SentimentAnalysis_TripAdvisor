The "service" is the worst I've ever experienced; the rooms have an old, tired, and dirty feel. The word is they are tearing the tower down in the near future, and not a minute too soon. My son, daughter and I stayed here for a few days while visiting a family member in the excellent Hospital of the University of PA (HUP) which is across the street and attached by an enclosed walkway. There are only two floors of the tower that are used as a hotel; the rest is an office building and owned, I believe, by HUP. This "hotel" really is a disgrace. I would only stay here again if I absolutely had to be going to and from the hospital at night. It probably is safer than walking the streets around the hospital. However, after discovering how bad this place is, we checked out and stayed for about 5 days at the very nice Inn at Penn, a Hilton, which is just a few blocks from the hospital. I think they offer a hospital rate most of the time. I just made sure that my visitng hours were timed with lots of foot traffic on the streets and vehicle traffic on the roads around. The University of Penn's campus is right there, but they have had some crime problems in the past and now have a couple of campus guards on most corners. Still, even with this added safety factor, it's not the best place to be walking at night. Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless safety is the ONLY concern.

They should be made to take their listing off the internet - when looking it seams OK But when you get there - the place should be pulled down or have a total re-vamp. I have to say the sheets and towels and bathroom were clean - toilet needed some work and time to clear,the shower head needed fixing to the wall, but the rest of the room was "DISTGUSTING' The hotel is split in two and both sections are very bad, with looks and smell. The room had been serviced before we arrived(well) no tea/coffee in room. Got plenty when we asked for it. The curtains are half hanging on the rails,no handle on the robe, its also lost a leg - this really does not mater because you'd not want to use it......... We would have moved out if we could have found other accommodation at the time, but for us it was better somewhere than nowhere.... We booked this hotel beleiving it was 'middle of the road', (I don't think 70 pounds per night is a price you pay for 'slumming it') for its location, so close to the things we wanted to see on our short stay in London. Mind you they did give us a gift to take home, infact many gifts, which we are still admiring today, 2 weeks after leaving -BEDBUGS. We also thought we'd paid for our accommodation over the net, but on arriving was asked to pay with cash, But my husband said noway - card or nothing, at least this way we are covered if they do try and charge us twice. PLEASE WHO EVER YOU ARE AND FOR WHAT EVER REASON YOU ARE STAYING IN LONDON DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GIVE THIS HOTEL A VERY BIG MISS..............

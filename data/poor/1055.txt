Phone booth sized circa 1930 elevator was broken most of the time, and when it wasn't it was shaky. Stairway and hall to room were narrow and labyrinthan. No help provided for getting luggage to the curb. Room was remodeled by a vocational school dropout with an attitude. I could have done better blindfolded with duct tape and a glue gun. Room temperature would swing from the high 80's to the 50's. No thermostats in the room. Cleanliness was marginal. Found another hotel for another $30 per night that was 200% better. Overall I would say that only someone desperate for a room should consider this hotel. The desk people seemed apathetic and depressed and there was no effort to be helpful.

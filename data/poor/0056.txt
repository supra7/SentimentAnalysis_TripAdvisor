You will have better accommodations. With a name like Hotel Seattle I expected that they would take more pride in their establishment. My room was falling apart. From the baseboard coming off, to the unfinished shower, and not to mention, the unfinished pipes leading into a cut out hole in the floor. In the height of summer there was no A.C. and the only way to get some cool air was to open the window onto the busy street. I will never recommend Hotel Seattle and made sure none of the guest at the wedding I attended will go there either.

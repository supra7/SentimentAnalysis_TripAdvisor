We went to Vegas for my 1st time and I had waited 55 years to get there. We reserved a room with a view and got one of the Air Conditioning ducts for the hotel. At 8 AM our third morning we were awakened by hammering, power saws and grinding and when we called the desk they had "NO knowledge of any construction anywhere". My husband went up 7 floors and could still hear the noise on each floor but could not find the source. There were used glasses from the restaurant downstairs on our nightstands when we left and when we came back hrs later, they were STILL there, just covered with coasters. We found the mini fridge in the closet and it contained a note saying DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN HERE and they hadn't either. WILL NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN.

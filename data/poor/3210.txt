We booked in at the Encore for a night between flights. Having previously had a good stay at the Wynn, we thought it would be a safe choice. Wrong. The welcome was good, and we were checked in relatively quickly. The room was well appointed, but the decor is far less inspiring than the Wynn. Our room faced the Strip and looked over towards the Fashion Show Mall. We had a good meal just off the casino before seeing the Garth Brooks concert (which was excellent!). The problem materialised when we got back to the room after midnight looking forward to a good sleep. Despite being so high up, the noise from the pool nightclub was very loud. We phoned downstairs and were told that they'd arrange for the music to be turned down. Three hours later we could still feel the beat of the music, and our water glasses were vibrating on the bedside tables!!!! We phoned again, to be told that the club would close soon. We were also told that it was pointless moving rooms because all suffer from nightlub noise! The only positive was that we were refunded 50% of the room rate. This hotel is okay if you're a clubber, but no good if you'd simply like a good sleep.

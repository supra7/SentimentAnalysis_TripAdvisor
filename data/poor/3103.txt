After a long day of travel from richmond va my husband and I were looking forward to a relaxing great honeymoon on the beach We checked into the room at the surferbeach The place was A DUMP with 2 box fans for airconditioning and it smelled like mold!!! Lucky for us we got a great room across the street at the Best Western but had it been summer we wouldn't have been so lucky. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS SITE IS SO MISREPRESENTED . If it was updated I hate to see what it looked like before. The sign in the office should have had said we accept payment by the hour!!!!!

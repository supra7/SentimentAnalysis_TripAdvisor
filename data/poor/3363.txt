Ocean City was wonderful, but this hotel was the pits. First, their web site (from the description to the picture) is totally misleading. The only true picture was the color of the hotel and the look of the lobby. It was the ONLY thing updated. It does not take much to please myself and the others in my party. Usually give us a clean room and a bed and we are okay. This hotel was anything but.... The balcony was filthy (sand and dirt all over the table and chairs), there was mold in the bathroom tub, food on the carpeted floor, broken ice bucket and ice cube tray, there was no safe in the room and the "safe deposit boxes" were not private at all, the pool was filthy, the sand under the swings was littered with cigarette butts and cups, the indoor pool was dirty, smelled musty, was cold and the surface around the pool was uneven and if you were not careful you could trip and fall. It was just so disappointing for a Holiday Inn. It is not the experience we thought we would have at all. Really investigate the hotels before booking... we learned our lesson for sure. I would go back to Ocean City MD in a heartbeat, but I will NEVER stay at this Holiday Inn again.

The W has a wonderful and sleek lounge and bar and that, along with its marketing have given it a "wonderful and sleek" repuatation. Once you get to your room, though, all of that is out the window. I mean - our bed did have scrumptious linen and the room decor was pretty sleek. But the room is tiny! I've stayed at upscale Manhattan hotels as well as typical brand name airport hotels ($109) and they all have a decent amount of space. not so the W. I called and asked. The room is 170 square feet. May very well be the size of your closet at home. Beyond the entryway and bathroom, the bed area part of the room is about 10 by 10. Maybe even 9 by 9. It's tiny. You walk, you bump into something. No bath. The standard room you get without complaining has only a shower. Sound like an upscale NYC hotel to you? Stay somewhere else and use the W's bar and spa.

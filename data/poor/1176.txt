Worst experience ever with any hotel I have ever been at!!!!!! This is a 100% true story or what happened; 1) False advertising that we get a bayview that we paid for but did NOT receive . 2) Rude staff; who would be better suited to work in a jail than a upscale hotel. 3) Disorganized and made us wait 3 hours for a room. 4) The room we finally got was already oocupied by another guest when we entered after our three hours wait- the guest was totally naked also did I mention? 5) They insulted my fiance because he is french. If you have the misfortune to go here and see a Supervisor by the name of Pierre -- or a surly clerk named Brent --- Run!!! I say again this place is the worst- stay far away.

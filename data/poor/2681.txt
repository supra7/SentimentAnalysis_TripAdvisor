The room was facing the street with two double glass doors! We never slept the entire trip, One employee sit on the step to the doors and was fighting with her boyfriend. Drunks walk by all night long, talking very loudly. The dead roach was really discusting, and never cleaned up by the staff. And, the breakfast glazed doughnuts! WOW! Loved New Orleans, just stay somewhere else!

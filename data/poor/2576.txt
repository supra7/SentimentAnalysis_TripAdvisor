We booked the Dauphine after reading the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel was a great disappointment - our room was dark, smelt very damp and hadn't been cleaned properly. There were empty beer cans and cigarette butts on our balcony and pools of water on the table. It seems that there are very different classes of rooms at this hotel and it just depends whether you get lucky or not. The rooms around the courtyard looked a lot better - our room was up on the 3rd floor - room 327 - to be avoided!

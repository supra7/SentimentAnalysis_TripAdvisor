Horrible Hotel Policy We couldn't get to the Hotel Intercontinental Mark Hopkins in San Fran because of Hurricane Katrina.We were told that ALL of our almost $500 pre-payment was going to be kept by Orbitz/Hotel Intercontinental... that there was nothing they could do to help us in our situation.I will never go to this hotel, EVER, or a Hotel Intercontinental again and I will also never use Orbitz again.

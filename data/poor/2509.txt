Don't stay here This is a poor pick for a hotel! To start the windows in the room do not open, they are screwed shut! Did I forget to say there is no AC! They have a vent that turns on about every 10 min for 5 minutes to add air. The Rooms are OLD, and need lots of work. The bathrooms have mold and the paint is cracked if not falling off. To help with ventilation of the room there is a vent built into the door of each room so the cigarette smoke is shared by everyone. The burn marks and tears in the furniture are free of charge. The person at the front desk was more interested in the email on his IPhone than helping anyone. When the other people lined up at the front desk the second person helping at the front desk got off the phone and screwed up the registration. The pool is in need of work, the floating pool light still wired to the pool was a turn off and the dirty towels hanging around did not give anyone a place to sit.The only good thing about the hotel was not the scratched up front door or ripped front awning. It was outside bar with a TV for sports and the music (was too loud at times) they also had small fire pots in the sand to attract people. The service and room were not worth the money. We were booked for a business trip and did not make the reservations. 3 other parties canceled within an hour of being there. And we were tied up at meetings to look for a room. Did I mention their cable TV broken so when watching TV it just gives out! Real nice. My advice if you have to stay there, Rent a tent and stay on the beach!

Very terrible customer service. Pictures on website are miss advertising. We were told we would have a pool and hot tub only to find out that they are both too dirty to open and they said they had been waiting on a pool cleaner for a couple of weeks. Ya right! We should have been told that in the fist place. Our room was filthy. Sheets looked like they hadn't been changes and whole room was full of dust. Bathtub had shaving trimmings all over. Our remote to our TV would not work and they could not find one that did. THere ice machine did not work. There complimentary continental breakfast was a little muffin and homemade juice that tasted like crap. When we expressed all these issues with the motel owner. His exact works were " that's your opinion, it doesn' t mattter" "we have 50 rooms full and 1 or 2 complaints so it's ok" what kind of customer service is that!. We will never stay nor reccoment this motel to anybody. Prices are not that great either could find alot better for the price. Don't stay here you will be very unsatisfied!

We'd booked the room two months ago through their own website and received a confirmation e-mail a week before. None of that mattered. They overbooked, didn't have a room for us (but did check in the people behind us), and sent us to a hotel a 20-minute drive out of town. No room service, no indoor pool, tiny room with only one bed and a rollaway for our son that barely fit in the entryway, blocking the bathroom door. We were exhausted and it was awful. Doubletree is probably lovely, but you can't count on them honoring your reservation. Or even treating you well when they bump you.

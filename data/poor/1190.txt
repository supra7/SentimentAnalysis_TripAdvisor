Stayed in this hotel 4 times previously when visiting family. This time however, we were extremely disappointed!!!!!!! Firstly the larger of the two swimming pools was closed after the first few days, half of the hotel rooms were being closed and sold off. Secondly, we went to Vegas for a few days, and on return, we found our two rooms had been flooded from a DIFFERENT rooms toilet!!!!! The rooms stank and the staff did not even tell us or think to check the rooms, even though they informed us that a total of 9 adjacent rooms had been flooded out!!!! On moving to the "new" rooms, one of the doors was broke and only needed the application of pressure to "unlock" the door. So yet another room switch!!! We went out, and returned to find that the door frame had been cracked, presumably by someone trying to break in whilst we were out. There were lots of weirdo's around, confrontational and often staring at you. The hotel seems to attract the wrong crowd as the rooms were quite cheap. Every night we had people banging at the doors, shouting and arguing. There appeared to be a room occupied by some individuals who were "up to no good". The remaining swimming pool was not heated, often the pool towels were dirty or you had to ask to get one. The best two things about this hotel? The maintenance guy who was very friendly and helpful. And the distance to Raising Canes (fast food chain).

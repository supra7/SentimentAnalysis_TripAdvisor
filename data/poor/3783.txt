Poor Service -- Relocated to Ohana East This property is now a part of the Ohana and Outrigger family of hotels. This is initially why I booked with them. However, they overbooked the property when I got there and would only accomodate me in a smoking environment. This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties. I thought they were updating their standards. The folks at the front desk were very poor on listening to our needs and were extremely uncooperative. I finally got the attention of a young gentleman (Alex) to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties. It was so easy but the other women at the front desk were horrible on helping anyone and even one tried to be confrontational. I accepted a reservation at the Ohana East, just around the corner. Read my review and see my photos from that stay.This hotel was conveniently located, though not on the beach. However..it was in need of some updates and doesn't have a very welcoming atmosphere. But I would start with the hotel staff.

I took a trip this summer with my daughter and heres a list of the goods and bads. Restaurant Mixed Drinks They were weak in flavor. You need to go to Bubba Gump to get better drinks. Chase Lounge Chairs Were dirty. That turned me off right away. I just came from the Outrigger on the Beach in Oahu and it was so perfect. Rooms Bathroom and Kitchen They were very little. There could only be one person in the rooms at one time and barely turn around in there as well like a airplane bathroom. Bedroom The room felt so tiny cus the bed took most of the room. My daughter hit her head quite often on the counter when going to the vault or to the refrigerator. If you're looking for a place only 'cus of the showerhead, stay here. Ceiling It had the popcorn ceiling, which kept falling down on us. We havent scene this type for many years since the Best Westerns going through the United States. Walls Dark and depressing Time Share Desk I asked about the condominium time-shares and they were so rude. I asked about a brochure and prices and they refused to give it to me. Usually around the world, theyre so pushy on selling time-shares but in this situation, they acted as if they didn't want to sell them; so that was my last thought of those people. Lobby Was good. 3rd Floor Waiting chairs next to Elevator Were dirty. You dont want to sit in those. Parking Terrible cus there were not enough spaces. Unless you have a handicap sign or dont have a car, or pay for valet, dont do it. The Good Things Showerheads They were good. But that's it. Pools Maid - nice Other Hotels we walked to I took a walk down the beach to the Marriot, and saw their hotel seemed better, but their snorkeling was as good as our hotel. Their people were friendly who showed us their time-shares which is the normal way to be. Overall, the Westin Maui needs an overhaul and in general, its for honeymooners and families with kids.

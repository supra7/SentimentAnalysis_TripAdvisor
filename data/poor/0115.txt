Truly the worst "hotel" I've ever stayed at! We came to see a concert at the key arena across the street. We reserved the room 3 months in advance and specifically asked for a parking spot. We showed up, no parking spot available. They sold them all off for concert goers. Customers? Forget them! Had to park 6 blocks away in an overnight parkade for another $20. Then walked back to "hotel" to check in. It gets worse. The room was nice (around 80 years ago maybe) looked like a low income housing/halfway house. Situated right by the staircase without even a deadbolt lock! Then we look at the matress.....really scary! But as we were already late for the concert we just said we'd stay the 1 night instead of the 2 we booked. The "help" at the front desk was pretty useless as well. She was the one who informed us that they didnt have a parking spot. Also, they advertise a continental breakfast. Went to the lobby and found some oatmeal bars and oranges. At the end of the day, I recommend no one stay at this place! It should be condemned! Very dirty and disgusting. The Mediteranian hotel is 100 times better!

Yes the price is reasonable. The remodelling is OK. However if you are unlucky and the front desk staff put you in a room with mechanical problems, it can be very unnerving not to mention spooky, wierd or disgusting. This a very, very old building. Obvious and unseen maintenance concerns are ignored. If you like to gamble on your hotel also, STAY HERE AT THE EL CORTEZ.

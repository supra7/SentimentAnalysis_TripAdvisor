We booked a two bed non-smoking room. When we arrived the front desk clerk was very friendly and gave me my room key. When I arrived up in the room it smelled like a bar and there was only one bed. I phoned the front desk and they told me they would get us a differant room that was non-smoking but they were not going to give us two beds. So there was 2 adults and 2 children in one bed . I was told for a 35.00 dollar charge we could have a rollaway bed. The parking was the most ridiciolous thing I have ever experienced. My parents just retired to Texas so we will be traveling there at least twice a year and I would never stay here again.

Definetly avoid this hotel Well, there were so many terrible things at this hotel, I hope I can remember them all forthis posting. First of all, (and my biggest compliant) was when the housekeeping staff stole $50 from my room and the manager did absolutely nothing. Also, the person incharge of the pool bar was totally rude and completely unhelpful, ontop of flat out lying to me. Those things were nothing compared to the enormous roach I saw in the shower when I checked in, and once I alerted the staff about it, they told me there was nothing I could do because they were all booked up. At one point, (when I was dumb enough to eat at the hoetl restaurant) I asked for a coke, and the waiter told me We are all out of coke, but there is a coke machine inside, and upstairs. At one point during my stay, there was a very loud party going on on my floor, when I called the front desk for some help, the person on the phone started yelling at me and told me to Stop complaining.I don't care about how much of a budget you are on, or how important it is to stay close to the 'action' this was THE WORST hotel I have ever been in. I really wish the better business beaureu would shut it down. Beware when staying there, be ware.

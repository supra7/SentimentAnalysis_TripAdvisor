I intentionally waited over a week to write this review to make sure I was speaking from a rational place... so here you go... "You are in America, that is not how we pronounce it here" Front Desk Clerk at check in "It is what it is, we cannot shut down the night club" Front Office Supervisor "And why do you expect me to change your room?" Front Desk Clerk after night of hell All the quotes are accurate with the first one being directed to my Mexican-American travelling companion who happens to be a Vice President of IT and, not that it matters - GREW UP AND WAS BORN IN THE U.S. - and witnessed by two attorneys who were traveling with us.... and in reference, of all things, to the pronunciation of his own name. As this took place at check in and we had 5 days to spend, we thought it better to not make a big deal and move on... although this bitter and completely ignorant comment never left our minds.... Add to that the nightclub that kept us awake until 3am.. and we were on the 17th floor...followed by the move at 3am to a LOWER FLOOR..lol...(what?). Apparently, they must make a lot more money from the nightclub patrons than their guests that gamble and dine and drink at their restaurants because I see now this is a consistant problem with the management staff apparently uninterested in fixing it by simple keeping the music to a dull roar.....and the consistantly astoundingly bad attitude from the front desk we will never stay here again. We have stayed at both the Bellagio and the Venetian in the past and will be happy to stay there again... but never again at anything owned by Steve Wynn...

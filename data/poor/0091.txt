This place is by far the worst place in the Seattle area unless yu want to sleep under the I-5 bridge. The rooms are totally run down and falling apart. The shaowers have ten year old caulk and are stained from neglect and smell like rotting animals from absence from cleaning. Unfortunatly this place was the last to choose from for us and we deeply regret having to stay here. The police were here several time dealing with the drugs and prostotution. The manager was totally stressed out as a slum lord is and because of his stressed state he makes it hard to get to your room because he is having to weed out the crime. This "KIng's Inn" is fit for a rat king that manages his roches. Please PLEASE do not stay here unless you want the worst place you want to be on earth. I felt like puking on myself just to fit into this rat infested hole that crack head and hookers live in.

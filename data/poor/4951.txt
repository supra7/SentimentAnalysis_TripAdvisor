Checked in this last weekend 04/08/2007 and it was the only time we have ever checked out of a hotel before staying the night. The room given to us was supposed to be a suite, but it really was a converted 1960's motel, except that the bars on the windows and the seven foot by eight foot living room area made the place feel like you were not getting any real value for the $115+ per night I was paying. My wife freaked out at the first impression this place made. We attempted to get something better, maybe an upgrade, but at that time were told that this was the best that they could do. So we litterally went to another hotel 2 blocks down the road. We attempted to get a partial refund with the understanding that we would atleast have to pay for one night in that it was 5pm when we first got there. But no refund would be offered. The next morning I went back to the "resort" and wanted to know why we were kept registered even though we told them we were not staying and they offered a more deluxe upgrade. That room was considerably better, but the surrounding area was still questionable. If you decide to stay at this place make sure that you get one of the promo suites that are a part of the main structure. Other than that you'll just get various degrees of mediocrity ranging from truly poor (pathetic is probably more accurate) to only just nice. Never before have I felt that I have been taken, but didn't get any money back, and didn't stay at the hotel for any of the 3 days planned. Tuscany was a nice alternative, Modern, Clean, Spacious and a nice property too. For about 30% less!!!

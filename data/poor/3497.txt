I spent five nights in the hotel Marrakesh for my wedding travel, the staff was nice but rooms were not very clean . after 3 nights my legs and my arms were covered of red bits and i thought it was a food intoxication, but later i learn it was bedbugs bites. When i came back in france, i had to go to the doctor and I can't work during 3 days. I a m very disappointed by this hotel

We booked this hotel and were confused when we arrived as it did not seem to be as the website indicated. The name is so similar to the Pacific Plaza and Tripadvisor do not differentiate as the confusing travellers reports indicate. The Executive Pacific Hotel is meant to be a boutique hotel. It is overpriced and shabby. The rooms are tiny and the room service dreadful. There is no bar or dining facilities. There is a coffee shop at ground floor and a japanese restaurant next door. I complained my phone was not working on arrival and 4 days later they fixed it and no apology. I had messages waiting from my arrival date and they had done nothing. . The public space is split level and simple. The experience was unexciting and all in all it was a big dissappointment. There are better places to stay and we walked passed many of them during our stay.

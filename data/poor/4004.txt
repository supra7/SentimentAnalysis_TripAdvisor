We had the worst ever experience with Visconti Apartments. Last year we booked the place for 2 nights for four people. We arrived in Venice 30min later than planned, due to the train delays and made contact with the organizer who insured they were waiting for us which was a lie. As soon as we got the meeting point no one was there all the phones were switched off and we waited until 3am in the middle of the street with no address, no hotel and no person to meet. They kept their phones off the next morning still as we tried to call many times. Be careful as they are very tricky - there is no address of the apartments mentioned on booking.com website or via email confirmation from them. So there was no chance to find them in Venice. They had the nerve to charge us the full 2 days stay, one week prior to our vacation. Since then, we have been in contact with them almost a year to at least refund half of our money which they originally agreed to do. They keep lying that they will refund one nights stay and they asked us 100 different papers which we kindly provided but still no results, just frustration and ignorance. The final conversation was with the financial director who mentioned that because we put their names in Trip Advisor  the owner is fuming and will not pay anything because the damage is done, which infact was another lie because we only put this in trip advisor after suffering so many difficulties and lies from them. They are just very lucky that something more serious didnt happen to one of us from being left alone in the dark streets of Venice. Its a shame on this company to ruin the names of Italians. We were a group of 4 from 4 different countries and had a meeting with another 6 international people from different places in Venice. Unfortunately the memories and thoughts about Italian hospitality is ruined for everyone.

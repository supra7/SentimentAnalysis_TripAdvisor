First of all, the pictures on the website are a lie! I booked through Travelocity and thought the hotel was going to be what I read online. I had no idea the hotel did not have elevators. The first room we we got was on the fifth floor as we are walking up five flights of a dark, very humid,dirty carpeted staircase, to our surprise the room was just the same!!!!! The very small window AC was not blowing air, the room was dingy and cold looking it did not feel inviting in the least! I eventually asked for another room after it never cooled down. We get to our room and even though cooler the AC was located behind my bed so when sleeping I had to put pillows up so it was not blowing directly on my head. When I did that it made the room warmer and uncomfortable. The mattress was so bad, I actually felt the springs poking me! I did not get one nights good sleep! The lamp did not work, the bathroom was very small and dirty, there was visable dirt on the toilet paper holder! There was no closet, all we had was a dilapidated metal shelf. The blowdryer did not work and there was not a mirror outside the room like most hotels. One night the toilet overflowed and we had to call to have someone come up with a plunger!!!! If your looking for comfort, cleanliness and convenience YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE!!!!!!!

We rented 2 rooms this past weekend, since we took our kids and granddaughters to Branson for the weekend. The granddaughters loved the water park! The restaurant was ok, the staff was real nice. The rooms were horrible! The bathroom hadn't been cleaned from the last customers: used soap & shampoo in the shower and hair in the bed. The sheets had holes in them from wear. The topper though was the bugs that were in the picture frames! Dead bugs!!! I am not talking just 1 bug, in our room our 2 picture frames had 5 dead bugs in 1 and 3 in the other. In our son and daughter in laws room they had 6 bugs in 1 of their picture frames. I have pictures, but unsure on how to upload them on the website.

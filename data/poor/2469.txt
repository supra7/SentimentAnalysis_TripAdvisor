The Westin Maui Hotel and Spa are on a great beach with great activities but the hotel is a perfect example of poor management. Check in and check out took greater than 10 minutes with only one person helping the long line of guests. Front desk staff who could have helped just ignored the line and went on breaks. The workout area is a joke most home gyms have more equipment. The gym had several cardio machines but only had eight different weight stations for a greater than 400 room hotel. The television in my room would turn on great sound no picture. Each nigh I had to call maintenance to fix the television. They would work on it for 10 minutes and eventually get a picture(a suggestion to Westin change the television or fix the problem). I would definitely not recommend this hotel. Lastly Starwood packages internet into the resort fee but you can opt for higher speed(don't it is no faster than the resort packaged internet but costs $4.99 per day)

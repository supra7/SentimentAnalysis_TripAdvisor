This was the biggest hotel disapointment that I have ever had! My wife and I scheduled a long weekend in Phoenix and wanted to try the Biltmore for something different than our usual stays at the Phoenecian or Royal Palms. There is no comparison....the Biltmore is very dated, has horrible service in the restaurants, and is somewhat depressing inside. Even in a suite, you almost feel as though you are in a dungeon. We joked that it was somewhat similar to the "tower of terror" ride at Disneyland. The worst part about it is that we were woken up early 2 out of the 3 mornings by the groundscrew and their leaf blowers outside of our room. We ended up checking out early and spending out last night at the Royal Palms...and were happy we did!

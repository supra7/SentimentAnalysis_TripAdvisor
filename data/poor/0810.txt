Hotel is not how i would describe this disgraceful property. It is absolutely filthy, and in need of URGENT refurbishment. The staff are unhelpful , disinterested and appear to regard guests as an intrusion. Our "ROOM" if that is the correct term was tiny, perhaps 5 meters X 3 meters with the bed crammed into a corner to allow access to one side. No table,chair or room to put a suitcase - i refused to hang clothes in the free standing wardrobe. The bathroom was like a galley, my knees were up against the wall while seated on the toilet, had to sit to one side. No ventilation / window in the shower cubicle, which was dirty and smelly. The hot water lasted all of 60 seconds, and there was precious little room to dry yourself with a towel that had holes in it. On returning to the "room" in the evening we were greeted by scurrying cockroaches over an inch long. on close inspection we found other dead ones presumeably dispatched by previous guests. After our first night the TV had no reception, i reported this to staff who advised it was a network problem. A quick visit to the nearby Mustafer center confirmed many different channels working including one of the two provided in our room. A second complaint failed to produce the promised maintenance man and we retired early, bored with little else to do. I rarely if ever use in room mini bars and did not do so here. However on checkout the reception claimed we had used one bottle of water and demanded payment . i refused ! Our stay was during the Singapore Grand Prix and we had little or no choice of hotel. All acceptable establishments either booked out or beyond a resonable budget. Had i not already paid i would have gone back to the airport and spent the night at the AMBASSADOR TRANSIT HOTEL, - a very different proposition. Travellers beware this Doss house is DISGUSTING ! !

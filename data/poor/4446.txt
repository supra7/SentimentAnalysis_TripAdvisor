We stayed there on a saturday night for $40. A very sketchy area, even for downtown. You have to walk through a smoke-filled casino to get to the hotel lobby. Filthy elevators. Apathetic staff. They gave us a bad room key on check-in. On check-out, they went to inspect the room before we left ---I have never had that happen before. The newly redecorated room had a large flat screen tv with lots of channels, but the whole room smelled like fresh paint. The hot water took a couple of minutes to warm up --- what a way to waste water in a desert! There were little bottles of drinking water with Gold Spike advertising label --- and a price of $2. We passed on the $13/day Wifi. I will not go there again.

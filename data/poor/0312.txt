Wow. After staying at The Edgewater for multiple visits to Seattle over the years and planning to make this our "regular" place to stay, I'm sad to say that we are officially never staying here again. Why? Here's why: - paying 5-star rate for 2-star service - battling with constant noise disruption due to either a) where we've been placed in the hotel and/or b) how thin the walls are - having the manager be so completely and utterly rude and trying to justify us being kept awake all night by saying that this is a "rock 'n roll" hotel. Seriously? If Smoky-the-Bear-rustic-cabin retreat is "rock 'n roll", then I totally missed something along the way. This hotel is basically a cliche of "waterfront"...bad service and marginal value. Here are some good alternatives for the rate: Pan Pacific Four Seasons Grand Hyatt Fairmont And if you want "rock 'n roll" maybe try the W downtown which has a fighting chance of calling themselves that.

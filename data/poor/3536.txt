I cannot believe my eyes. No elevator so be ready to climb 40-50 stairs to get to your room. I am 300 lbs and it was hard. I get to the room and there was no TV, no iron, the room was cold (the radiator did not work), and the toilet was clogged. I will really read reviews on any hotel that I stay in. Lesson learned.

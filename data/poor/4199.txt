I booked three rooms for four days. One of my associates had to come in a day late. She called and confirmed that shed be in a day late but would still take four days. When she showed up, Hilton had given her room away. She complained stating that she had confirmation for her four days. The front desk person said it was Hiltons word against hers so she wouldnt be getting a room. I then came back to a room that had not been cleaned. We left for dinner at 7:00 with the front desk saying it would be cleaned while we were out. We return at 11:00 to a dirty room. We call the front desk again. They say housekeeping will be up within 30 minutes. An hour later, no housekeeping. This is a very poorly managed hotel. Choose another place if you want basic services.

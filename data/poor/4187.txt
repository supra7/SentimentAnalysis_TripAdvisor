think twice before you buy This resort is a great disappointment for anyone with kids and those who are expecting to get excellent service for the money they are asking for the villas.Not sure where to start,but possibly only hopeless romantics couldoverlook total lack of services and proffesionalism.1.taxi drivers at the airport got no idea where is this new resort2.reception is available only from 9-6pm.Too bad if you need to speak to the manager later,becuase he is the receptionist.3.1 restaurant out of 4 functioning 4.the resort is a building site and is not finished=website is completely misleading5.2 days the beach elevator was closed for maintenance,so explain it to the kids6.kids club to no avail.due to lack of staff,which you can feel overall.This place felt like ghost town.7.if you expect to bath your kids,only in your dreams.All villas have showers only(congrats to the architect)8.staffs`uniforms are not exactly the cleaniest and staff doesnt seem to be trained for 5star service if at all9.we felt so appaled with all this that decided to check out early,when we were overcharged on our bill.Honestly the manager is completely useless and because the place was nowhere near completion this should be stated on the website instead of describing all great facilities that are not available.Complete waste of money and time,because nice views cant simply make up for the incompetence and uselesness.

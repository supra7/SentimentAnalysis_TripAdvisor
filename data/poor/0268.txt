I stayed at the Shearaton in downtown seattle. And had my vehicle parked by the valet when we arrived which is pricey at 35 dollars. They were very pushy at hurring and parking the car and when we did trust them with my vehicle it had numerous items STOLEN out of it. When I called the valet to retrive my car the next day I got in to find out they had went trough my middle consule. Took my medication and money. When I told the valet manager about this he told me it was my fault for trusting his employees.And there was nothing he could do about it.

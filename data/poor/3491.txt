Worst hotel stay ever. Trendy lobby/lounge area, but the rooms are awful, stuffy, stale, and not comfortable. Lighting is awful. Front desk staff NOT helpful when we asked questions, it felt like we were a burden and an intrusion on their time. Folks standing at the door with their fancy headsets often missed the fact that we were coming in/leaving the hotel & failed to open the door for us. Bugs, both living & dead in our shower & they failed to remedy the situation. No closets. Bathroom space is WAY TOO CRAMPED for the rates they are charging. GREAT places to eat in the neighborhood, and an awesome Lounge down the street @ 107th & Broadway with comedy. I would visit the neighborhood again for the diner & lounge, but would NEVER stay here or recommend the hotel to friends.

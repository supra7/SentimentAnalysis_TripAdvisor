Me and a group of colleagues made reservations to stay at this hotel. Within two days of our visit a member of our party contracted a highly infectious staph infection and we had to cancel. In lieu of cancelling I rescheduled. I was told that the charge for the two rooms, due to cancelling within the 72 hour period, would be applied to the next stay. When that time came it turned out that I was charged for the first night's stay on both rooms and NONE of that money would apply to a future room. I finally, after many, many calls spoke to a manager who was rude and diffiult to work with and the best he would do was give us one night credit on a slow night but not a weekend night unless we PAID for the other weekend night. Like they didn't have enough of my money? I have stayed at many hotels and on occassion I have had to cancel at the last minute and NEVER have I had to forfeit $300. They must think they are the only hotel in the French Quarter.

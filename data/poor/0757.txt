Run down, bad service, lousy resort. As a sufferer of chronic leg pain, carrying my luggage up 3 floors of this run down hotel without elevators in this building set the tone. No bell men at the door to take our luggage. Check in was extremely slow, also. This place is sucks all around. The rooms are run down. The plumbing is so loud that whenever someone flushed a toilet in a near by room, it would wake me up in my room.

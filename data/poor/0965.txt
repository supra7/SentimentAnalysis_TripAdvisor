my husband and I just came from vacation we were staying from 05-22-2011 to 05-29-2011, this was my second time going to Cancun, last year we stood at another resort wonderful service, i regret not going back to the first place, unfortunately i wanted to try something new wow and do i regret it, the minute we got there the customer service person was not friendly at all did not even smile took a copy of our passports did not even say why he needed them they are very short staff so the service was not as i expected, another thing that they don't advertise is that the beach is not clean or crystal clear, so we couldn't get in the water we only were at the pool, they do have things to do like Unlimited tours at exclusive Tres Rios Natural Park including snorkeling and kayaking in rivers and cenotes, SenseAdventure tour you have to book this a day before and when i did they said they did not have any more tousr available this was on a wed and they said they only had 2 left for friday or sat, for the ladies if you decide to come here for vacation do take a hair drier all though they say the rooms come with it not true, It also advertises a robe and slippers included when in the your room , robe yes slippers no, the drinks were always hot, the beer and mixed drinks, also in the morning the milk was warm and the orange juice tasted more like water, some of the food was not good at all, i must admit the italian food was great and the food from the grill outside and the calsones were really good too, they also advertise this:Exit Lounge - Enjoy a warm farewell in this private area after checkout again not true, another thing that my husband and i also notice is that they have special treatment for the people that have invested in something like time share or real estate investment there was a family there that you were able to see the different treatment they gave him and his family versus the other guest there i found that very wrong and rude because we also spend money at that resort and the majority of waiters were giving vip to his family there is nothing wrong with that but what about the rest of the guest,at the last resort that we stood at everyone was treated as royalty, it did not matter who spend what or how much everyone was treated equally , if you also will like to visit this resort make sure you take allot of singles and fives they ask you for id to change american money even though they have all of your info and keep in mind they take a photo copy of your passport and still ask you at front desk for id to change your money and at the end they tell you they don't have any change available, also look for Juanita or Manuel, Armando and Carlos these are the only waiters that treated us excellent not only my husband and i but they were making sure everyone was taken care of only when they were there,

When we arrived everything seemed to be great...we were able to check in early, etc. Once we were unpacking we went to put our clothes in the dresser (we were planning on staying a few days). The drawers were loaded with dust. Not just a normal dusting but an actual layer. We opened all drawers and they were like this. We looked at appliances like the coffee machine they had dust on the top. We called the front desk because the drawer dust ruined the first pair of pants I tried to put in, we had to ask for these to be dry cleaned and insisted it be done that day. When we returned from a few hours of shopping we were greeted by room service with a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates and a note of an apology of how they presented the room to us. We thought this was nice, the box had 4 pieces as we got to the 4th piece we realized the piece was infested with worms.....it was hard to see them as this piece of chocolate had crumbled nuts and maybe oats so this seemed edible until I saw it move. We took these down and they apologized but not like we would think hotel that is managed well. They blamed this on their manafacture stating the manafacture would be reimbursing us one night's room expense. They never really apologized that this box of chocolate went through their room service and wasn't first inspected. All apologies were that the manfacture supplied these. We did not pay for any nights there and would have switched if there would have been rooms available elsewhere but we were there during the holidays. I will never stay at any Omni because of this experience and because after we were sent worms we had to approach the staff there. We were very shocked and disappointed. If you decide to stay there look before you consume anything there.

Had booked this hotel over easter through Hostelworld (one of the worlds largest accomodation booking websites, and we'd previously book 18 hotels/hostels in 10 different countries with no hassles) and they claimed to of never received our booking, and said they're never heard of hostelworld, and that they must be a fake website (yeah right). This hotel has good reviews, and i'm sure its nice (for Istanbul anyways) but there are alot of reviews about lost bookings etc. We have a feeling we fell prey to overbooking scams of taking the highest payer (particularly being Easter). We were driven 25 mins west of the Sultanahmet to their 2nd 1 star hotel, in a very bad area. Said the 1st night would be free (but of course charged us for two) and that they would move us back when a rooms was free. By day two we never heard from the manager and decided to cut out losses and check out. A very horrible introduction to Istanbul for us. Basically ruined our Easter break. Again, it seemed like a nice place, centrally located (from the lobby) but definitely overbooking is a common occurance.

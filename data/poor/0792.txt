This Condo Complex was built in 1969 - only some of the units have been updated. If you must stay here - insist on a renoed unit. Ours leaked water from the ceiling, the bath/shower wouldn't drain, carpet smelled moldy, couldn't talk when the dishwasher was on, balcony drapes kept falling off. K-111. Housekeeping dropped by every day - usually forgot to leave any coffee. You can't function here without a rental car and they charge $7 a day to park it - very little sense of customer service at this facility. The only thing the Eldorado has going for it that it's quiet - not much street noise. There are many alternatives in this price range and I would recommend taking just about anything else.

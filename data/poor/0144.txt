We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel after our Alaskan Cruise. We stayed one night and flew out the next morning. The room was pretty but very small. We arrived early after getting off the cruise ship so we asked that our luggage be stored while we explored the city. We sat in the lobby for 25 minutes, eyeing our luggage that the staff stacked in a corner, unattended, hoping no one made off with it. No one seemed concerned about unattended luggage and it was totally ignored. I wouldn't leave until I made sure someone actually took the luggage and stored it. After 25 minutes, a bellhop finally came and got our luggage. We were going to go into the mall and ride the monorail but being this early on Sunday morning, the mall doors were still locked (it was about 10:30). So, we had to exit the hotel and walk to the monorail. When we got back, we checked in and our luggage was retrieved. Our room was pretty but nothing special. It actually wasn't much larger than our cabin on the cruise ship. It was comfortable, clean. Late that afternoon, after exploring Seattle, we decided to rest in our room. We looked in the hotel directory and my husband went to find a vending machine so we could enjoy a soft drink. There weren't any to be found. After calling the front desk we discovered the only way to obtain a soft drink was to go to the bar. We thought this was pretty bad for a hotel of this caliber not to have vending machines and force people to buy a soft drink at a high price in the bar. Needless to say, this did not endear us to this hotel. We've stayed at better hotels. Next time we'll stay at the Grand Hyatt.

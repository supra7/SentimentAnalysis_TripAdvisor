Had back to back reservations, I told the hotel staff when checking in but apparently that information was not noted anywhere. Receved conflicting explanations about my reservation, whether or not I should move rooms, price of rooms, an alledged cancellation of the reservation -- amazingly these varying explanations all came from the same individual. Finally I was given 5 minutes to change rooms, no time to pack just stuff my things in hotel laundry bags, very kind and helpful bellhop (the only individual I encountered at Harrah's who appeared to care about the guests). I will never return to Harrah's and encourage others to avoid it. Casino was very smokey and smelled bad. Faucet in tub/shower dripped steadily through the 6 nights I was in first room, second room didn't drip.

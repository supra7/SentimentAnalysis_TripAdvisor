Hotels are service industries. The mark of a hotel is how they treat their customers. Doubletree at SeaTac gets an F. I can't issue a review on the actual rooms. The reason is that after paying for a room, the Doubletree didn't provide a room. No refund and no room. I prepaid for a room. Not just a reservation, but pre-payment. According to the hotel's cancellation policy, the room was 100% non-refundable. No changes allowed -- at least by me. Doubletree doesn't hold itself to the same standards. When I arrived, however, the front desk said that they were full. Which wasn't exactly correct, since during the time I was at the front desk, they checked in several airline-related employees. Evidently, the hotel was full for non-airline guests. Also evidently, they double sold the room I paid for.  They then shuttled my family down the street to another hotel. After being dropped off, we were told by the replacement hotel that it didn't have a room to house my family. Numerous calls to the Doubletree resulted in rude responses from the front desk -- when they bothered to answer and not leave me on infinite hold. Finally, I called our booking company, who called the Doubletree's manager -- Robert. He hung up on the booking company's representative. Two hours later, the Doubletree shuttle showed up and dropped us off at another hotel. But after repeated assurances that this wouldn't happen again, this other hotel also didn't have the room. It was now 2 in the morning. I finally arranged for my own hotel accommodations. As to the Doubletree, after taking my money, they did absolutely nothing to fix a problem they caused. No refund. No replacement room. Not even an apology. Instead management ignored the problem and hoped I would simply go away. Their solution was to dump my family off at another hotel that didn't have the inventory to replace the room I had already paid for. In 30 years of business travel, this is the worst treatment I have received from a hotel.

This is meant to be a three star hotel - it's more lik a two star. The rooms are tiny with none of the facilities I would expect from a three star hotel. One small upright chair, for instance in a double room set in a corner with no room to sit and no hotel info in the room. The breakfast was adequate and the staff mostly unsmiling and surly. Worst of all the area around the square is downright dangerous. Not so bad in the daytime when it is full of down and outs but a different story at night. Three out of four nights we were accosted on our way back to the hotel by up to three young men who harrassed and crowded us and attempted to steal our belongings. I would not recommend this hotel - rooms too small, no facilities, surly staff and dangerous area.

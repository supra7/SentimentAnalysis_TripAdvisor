We have definitely learned our lesson about the word "cozy". My husband and I could not even fit our suitcases into the room; we literally had to rearrange the furniture to create enough walking room. So tiny! Also, there were no "antiques" to speak of. The staff were not very friendly at all. We ended up leaving and staying in Hana for two days, despite the fact that we were already locked into paying for our rooms at the Inn. It was the best decision of our honeymoon, if we had to stay in that room for 6 straight nights I would NOT have been happy. I will definitely write to Fodor's and tell them this inn should NOT be recommended!

Never have been in a place like this before! The pictures on the website are so deceiving. I checked in if you call it that, because there really isn't anyone there to check you in. I think a kid came in off the street to do it. Had to walk up three flights of stairs with my daughter and two large bags. Once we got to the third floor, the door was closed to the hallway and all the lights were off! Walking down the hall there was trash all over. Got to the room finally, opened the door and it hit the bed! Most disgusting place I have seen! Mirror was down, drywall all over, roaches, ants, sink right next to my bed. I think a prison cell would be much nicer! My daughter was scared and we walked all the way back downstairs. Asked for the manager and of course not there. Never ever think about staying in this repulsive place!!

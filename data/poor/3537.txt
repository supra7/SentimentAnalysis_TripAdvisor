I was in New York for 10 days as the best man at a friend's wedding and ended staying here for the 3 nights and had 2 different rooms before moving out. Had mice infestation in the first room. Complained and was moved to another room which had mice & bed bugs into the bargin. The staff weren't too bothered, I think then know and don't really care. They seem happy to to play musical rooms every time you complain. Don't be fooled by their web site, the entrance & reception is decorated well, the rest of the place is poorly maintained and decorated (a dump really). And for the price it's jus not worth it. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!

We stayed in a suite in this hotel for 3 days. It was the worst hotel experience we have ever had in Montreal. More importantly, none of our problems were fixed and, an extensive letter to the manager was totally ignored. The lobby was consistently full of unhappy customers with problems. There was never adequate desk staff to deal with them (e.g., it took 30 minutes to get our key reprogrammed after we could not get into our room). Avoid this place like the plague.

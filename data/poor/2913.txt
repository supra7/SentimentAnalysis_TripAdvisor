I have stayed at the W New York twice now. The first time, the AC in my room didn't work in the middle of summer, there was trash in the hallways, a large stack of someone else's luggage was delivered to my room while I was out, it took 20 minutes to check in, and they an out of coffee in the lobby and towels in the gym - all for a $600 room. Oh yes, and the $80 laundry bill (which they quickly wrote off). An operational mess. I swore never again. But two years later, there were no other rooms to be had so I gave them another try. The second time, the hall rugs are dirty, the room corners dirty, and things still ran out. Check in lines were long and elevators didn't work properly. This time for only $375. I understand that the W is a concept hotel, but do they have to be so bad operationally? And absolutely no response from the manager's email or phone calls when I left an item behind. I'll leave the W to those who want the atmosphere (dark halls, lots of scented candles, new age music, and such) and don't need the little things done well or even at all.

This is the worst W I've ever stayed at!!! I'm not joking when I say our room was no larger than 10" x 11"!!! The queen size bed took up the entire room w/ a tiny little desk in the corner. The tv looked like it was going to fall off the stand. Luckily we weren't in the room a lot but this hotel is NOT worth the money! The maids were terrible- they barely made the rooms up and on the last day they didn't even come after we requested they make the room up when we went out for the day! The bar/lobby scene was the best part as it was nice to come back for drinks after dinner before going to bed. I heard the W in times Square is much better- think i will try that next time...

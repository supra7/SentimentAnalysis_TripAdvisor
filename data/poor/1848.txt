I am so terribly sad for this glorious old hotel! The property has a rich history and is located in the heart of beautiful Boston. Unfortunately, the hotel has not been maintained and was a terrible dissapointment. I arrived late in the evening and was promptly greeted in the nicely appointed front desk and lobby. The bell hop took my luggage as I checked in and he escorted me to my room. The hotel looked lovely, with an old world charm including wide hallways. So far, so good. The first room I was assigned was obviously two rooms that had been converted into one. The room was awkwardly set up and had two bathrooms. Both bathrooms were very small and only had showers, no tubs. The showers were tiny, dirty, and dingy...with tile that desperately needed cleaning. There was even a dirty wash cloth on the floor! But wait...there's more. As I settled in for the evening, I noticed something moving....a mouse! No kidding. I immediately called the front desk to inform them of the critter and requested to be moved. The first person I spoke to didn't seem at all concerned that there was a mouse in my room. The second person screamed "Oh My God"....yeah, pretty much what I thought. Anyway, after two more phone calls they finally moved me to another room and comped my room service charge (kind of lost my appitite!) The second room was marginally better....Again, the odd layout with two bathrooms...however, this time I had two tubs instead of postage stamp sized showers. The room wasn't much cleaner and the bathrooms were both in need of a serious scrub. In addition, the toilets didn't flush very well.... Overall, it was pretty gross. There are so many great hotels in Boston....don't waste your time or money here.

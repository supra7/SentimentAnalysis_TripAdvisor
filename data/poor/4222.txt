I will be here for 14 nights for business. Because of the room it will be (and is) unbearable. I can put up with a tiny room (and mine is actually larger than the average) however, the rooms are old and worn out. The wall paper is coming off and has mold along the seams and part of the carpet is actually rotted. I hate to plug in the very old worthless hair dryer ,because the socket is surrounded by mildew and pulls out. of the wall with wires exposed when I unplug it. Stains on the chair and carpet. The night stands and desk are so beat up if you had them at home you would throw them out. There is no excuse for this at $350+ U.S. per night. Pure greed on the part of the owners. Needless to say this is very depressing. So they dress up the lobby, hallways, exterior - but LOOK OUT when you get to your room - it's simply nasty. The only good thing about this place is the service - the employees in every area of this establishment are outstanding. But that can't even come close to making up for the awful living conditions.

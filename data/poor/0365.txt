It's now a hour past check in time and the front desk can only say our room isn't ready yet. We've been sitting here in the lobby of the hotel for about an hour and a half now. Don't make plans for the day of check in or they will be ruined by the horrible service of the Westin. The front desk will ask you for your cell phone number and then they say they will call you back as soon as your room becomes available. Guess what, you will get your call back after the front desk is done servicing everyone that is standing in line at the check-in counter. The line at the check-in counter is really long because the hotel can't seem to get people their rooms at the time designated, so everyone is standing in line trying to get a room over and over again.

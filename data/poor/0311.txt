The website needs to update the pictures of this hotel--there is so much false advertising! First, the photos do not correctly display the TACKY decor of the rooms. We also found the hotel to be dirty and the carpeting needs to be changed throughout the hotel. There were many places where the carpet was frayed and torn. The website refers to this hotel as a 4 star?????!!!! Are they serious????? It scares me to think of what a 3 star hotel would be in Seattle! This hotel is also not convenient to downtown. The website states that the hotel is in the heart of downtown Seattle.......another false advertisement. It is actually not in the best of areas. Don't let the website fool you into thinking that you will be near Pike's Market or other amenities in the downtown Seattle area! It is quite the walk! And not necessarily in the safest of walking areas! You will need to take a cab many times......oh, I forgot! They do have a shuttle service every hour, but make sure that you get there early.......it is a "first come, first serve basis!!!!!" When the shuttle is full then you have to wait another hour!!! My mother and I had to get a cab (one of many from this hotel) because the shuttle was full!!!!!!!!!! The only nice view from this hotel is a room smack in the middle of the hotel. At least from this part of the hotel you will have a nice view of the water and islands......the one and only "perk" from this hotel. The other rooms have herendous views of the concrete docking area and parking lots. Oh, yes........let's not forget........if you like to hear the roaring sound of a train then you will love the city view (or should we say, "parking lot views?"). I would not stay in this hotel again......NEVER! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I think staying in a youth hostel would be better! 4 star! HA! That is so funny!!!

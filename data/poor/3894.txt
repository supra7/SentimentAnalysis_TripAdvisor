I was delighted when I first arrived at this hotel, we were upgraded to a suite and loved our room. But I was showering before dinner and was chased out of the tub by the largest charging cockroach I have ever seen! Soaking wet I slipped on the edge of tub and landed on my outer thigh. I am fine but shaken up by the incident. I called guest services and explained what happen and asked them to send someone to kill the roach that now was living in a wet towel in the tub the said ok and sent no one. We had to call three times before someone came. There was no apology no one called to make sure everything was taken care or that I was okay, nothing.

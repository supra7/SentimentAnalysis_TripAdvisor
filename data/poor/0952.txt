Tres Tios is a gorgeous property and many of the staff are helpful. However, I would warn anyone who is considering staying here to say a very loud no to the offer of a timeshare presentation . I am currently an owner at Sunset Fisherman and, although I very much enjoy staying there, I urge you to resist the offers of these slick sales promoters. They will tell you what you want to hear and promise you the moon. However, if you purchase (a contract upgrade in my case), when they call to confirm the contract you will discover what was omitted. I am currently trying to rescind my upgrade and stay with my original, very expensive timeshare purchase. At this moment I am waiting for a callback from someone in the legal department. She is thirty minutes past the time we arranged for her to call. Am I surprised? No. I do have a credit card company that is working with me to refund my purchase and I am grateful to them. At least they keep their word.

Travelled to NYC with a friend back in May 08 - the hotel was booked by my company and according to their website - "Hotel 91 is the perfect synergy between luxurious downtown boutique" - well I am not sure where they have stayed before if they think this is luxurious! Arrived outside the hotel which is in the middle of Chinatown - very shabby, garbage was everywhere outside! Inside was like something out of a horror movie until you found your way to reception! No restaurant or ANYWHERE to get food or drink. No cafes or shops near the hotel either so we always had to venture out in a taxi and bring things back. The hotel room backed on to the subway and every ten minutes (I kid you not) a tube would come past and the whole room shook! It was like something out of a sitcom! We had no sleep the whole 3 nights we were there. Never stay at this hotel - pay more money and get what you deserve - for what this hotel is it was a rip off anyway!

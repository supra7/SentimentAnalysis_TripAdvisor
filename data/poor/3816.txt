Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at The staff when we checked in were not helpful. The room wassmelly and the carpet was in bad shape. The sinks, fridge andfloors were not sanitary. The cups were not sterile, in fact they had lipstick on them from the previous guest. The replacements I requested were also dirty they had been used for someones ash trays in the past. The bedding was too small for the bed and had cigerette burns in the sheets. There were cockroaches crawling around in the elevators and hall ways. The noise from others woke us up through out the night. The maids used dirty towels to wipe out the tumblers each day and just smeared the dirt around. I will never stay in this hotel or any other offered by this company. This was my second trip to Oahu and it was supposed to be a comfortable one!!. The parking at the hotel was $18.00 per day and was not mentioned on their website or any other on the web. Just picking up the phone cost a dollar per time, local or not. Having worked as a manager to hotels in the past I found it less than satisfactory and not even close to health code standards!!!! Very disapointing!!!!!

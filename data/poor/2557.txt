Yes it's a cheap hotel. But the staffs there are rude and not friendly. I stayed there 2 night with my friend in winter. The heater inside the room are not working. We cannot sleep well because its too cold, the next day we complained and asked for refund, but the staff are rude and didn't give our money back. They gave us another heater for the night, but still cold, and lucky our friend from there lent us his heater. And the breakfast there, just only 2 toast with butter and yellow jam. And we need to pay GBP 2 for towel. No kettle also. I will never stay in this hotel ever again.

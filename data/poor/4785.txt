This hotel would be decent...in a third world country. First off, it was way over priced for one full sized bed. The room was dirty and had a cement floor with a very thin carpet. The art work was on the floor beside a mirror which was also on the floor. No soap or towels in the bathroom, no soap or towels in the bedroom. On the 2nd day of us being there, we arrived and the staff had stuffed another full sized bed in the room. We asked them to take it out since room was clearly too small for two beds. They replied they would remove it and never did. In addition, no drinking water or beverage dispenser. Finally, room service didn't knock on the door before entering.

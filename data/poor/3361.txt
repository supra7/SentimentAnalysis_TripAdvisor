Expected more for the price. The pics make the place look great but when we arrived in the lobby we knew it wasn't going to be good. I'm used to Holiday Inn hotels in other states like NY, CA, VA where it's a decent 3.5 star or better. In my opinion this place is more like a 2 star. The room is basic and no frills. It felt dirty and ichy. It just seemed really low budget to me and not even comfortable for our weekend stay. Even the maids clothes were dirty. I didn't want her cleaning anything because she looked more contaminated than anything else. I would definitely not stay here again. The outdoor pool is over run by college students and THE over boozed/undersexed. The indoor pool was full of toddlers. My 13yr decided to take her chances at the beach after reviewing her options. Next time I may opt for a condo rental instead. I get the impression all these hotels are functioning at 2 stars despite their name. There is a kitchenette and microwave. If your not fussy like me then come on down but if you are like me -go else where.

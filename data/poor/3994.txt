I was recently in Boston on business and had the misfortune of being placed in this hotel. Although it is in a good location for touring Boston, it is not convenient to the financial district. The rooms are semi-spacious, and well designed. However, what the hotel really lacks is knowledgeable and helpful staff with any understanding of customer service. The staff refused to book cars to the airport (had to wait 30 min. for a taxi), made egregious mistakes on my bill and were outright hostile when I had to ask for assistance because my room key didnt work. Also, the neighborhood immediately around the hotel takes a seedy turn at nightI wasnt entirely comfortable walking around on my own. Needless to say, I will never return to this hotel and dont recommend it to others.

Room smelled awful and our clothes reeked of a mildew smell several days after leaving. Our room overlooked a dumpster complete with a dumpster diver who yelled so loud he frightened my children> Hallways are poorly lit. Rust on lamps, cracks in bathroom floors, some rooms do not have a bathtub only a shower. Could hear people walking and moving around above us. The hotel staff were the only bright part of this dark dingy place

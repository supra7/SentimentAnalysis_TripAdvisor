I had booked this hotel 4 months in advance asking for a courtyard view. My "courtyard view" looks at a wall. I went to the front desk, and they told me TECHNICALLY that is a courtyard view. If you have to use the word "technically", something is wrong. They wouldn't give any type of credit for the room. I don't know who is writing these reveiws, but every time I walked through the lobby, someone was complaining and wanting to switch their rooms. The beds are incredibly uncomfortable - you can feel the springs, and the rooms are musty. I love the location, but I will NOT stay there again.

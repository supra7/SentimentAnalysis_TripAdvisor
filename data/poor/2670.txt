This place was so overrated and overpriced. The quality of Motel 6, but 10 times the price. Don't be fooled by their website: It is NOT a charming boutique hotel with beautiful furnishings. Rather it was a run-down place with very little charm or service. The room was musty, dirty, dark, and had very little character - evidently no updating in years. The carpet, window treatments, etc. were severely stained - the kind of place you don't want to touch anything with your bare feet or skin. The common spaces were also uninviting - again dirty and uncomfortable, with dust and cobwebs all over. The breakfast was a ripoff, and don't take their restaurant recommendations - they send you far away to a mediocre place run by the owners' children (found that out after the fact). A true disgrace that they're more interested in nepotism than the experience of their guests in such a culinary city. There are so many better options in New Orleans - definitely look elsewhere.

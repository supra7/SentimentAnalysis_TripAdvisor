This hotel did not have my dates correctly listed on their reservation system. thankfully I had my confirmation as they were very rude about the dates I needed to stay. I was then directed the wrong direction to the wrong tower to get to my room. The internet service did not work, the hotel signage is very poor, the restaurant, Capriccio Grill had the rudest bartender I have ever seen. He ignored me for quite some time as I was alone and wanting to order a drink and dinner. He was busy plaing around with some sort of problem with the register. Finally I asked if he knew I was there and the reply was "Yeah, I have to fix this first." I was there for a very large convention that was held in the hotel and on several occasions had meetings in the Rocks Bar as it was convenient to meet for attendees. On the 3 occasions I was there, 2 around 5 PM and one at 1:00 PM, each for 30-45 minutes, no one ever approcahed to see if drinks were needed. The waitresses were busy hanging around the bar and chatting. I could go on and on about service related issues over my 4 day stay but suffice to say I would never return to the Peabody Orlando and would never recommend a stay here. For the price of the hotel one would expect much higher service.

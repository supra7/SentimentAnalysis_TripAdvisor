After many hours of research we finally found the hotel we wanted. Small, good beach, good food, adults only (leaving three kids at home). Four days before our scheduled arrival the hotel notified us that they were cancelling our reservation (we still haven't had the $2,500 credited back to our card) because a 'large organization' had booked the entire hotel. And we thought we had booked a room as we had already paid for it. To their credit the travel agency listed on the hotel's website was very helpful during the booking process and also very professional and responsive during the cancellation process. I would give them a higher rating - but this review is for the hotel. Also in fairness the hotel did offer us a room which was a slight upgrade (meaning it was slightly more expensive than what we had booked - not that is was actually better for what we wanted) at another property and a package which was a very, very slight upgrade over what we had paid for already (they basically threw in a massage and 'towel art'), but the 'upgrade' resort was nothing at all like what we had booked. Many times larger, no usable beach, and our friends had just been to that exact hotel and would not go back. On top of it they also thought this was our honeymoon and they were still cancelling it! It wasn't our honeymoon, but I didn't correct them on that point in the hope that they would try harder to do the right thing. They didn't. So if you want to book flights and a hotel then have the hotel cancel four days prior to your arrival this is the place for you.

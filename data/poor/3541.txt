I booked this hotel on line. There was no mention on their site about the long narrow staircase you have to climb just to get to the lobby. We came early before it was time to check in so they held our bags for us. We told them we will be checking in late, they said they would make a note of it. When we got there the guy at the desk said he didn't see our reservation and that the room with two beds that I had booked was not advailable. We ended up getting a double bed and they brought in a folding bed on the 5th floor! More steps!!! The room was so small. The room had a old 17" tv with no remote control or reception for that matter. The worst I think is the stairs.. We were able to climb them but I couldn't help to think of the people that might book this hotel and not be able to climb all the steps. They should warn you. Also to give up our room even though they had our luggage there is pretty tacky. After reading other reviews it sounds like this isn't uncommen. The picture you see of the stairs is on the landing before you go up a few more stairs.

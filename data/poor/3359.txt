I have always enjoyed staying in Holiday Inn hotel chains; every time I have traveled, I received nothing but great customer service and always recommended the Holiday Inn to friends and family. However, after my last stay I am extremely displeased. During my stay my wallet was removed from room 119. Although the hotel provided a safe in my room, I was unable to use it because the door to the closet, in which the safe was located, was broken and restricted my access to the safe. Prior to my discovery of the broken closet door, I had already called maintenance to fix the broken balcony door and I did not feel the need to call again, so I kept my wallet in my gym bag, which was located on the luggage rack. In addition the Hotel Manager was rude, provided poor customer service and failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into my claim. Rather than apologize for providing me a room with broken doors or for the failure of the maintenance staff to repair these defects during my stay, he repeatedly stated that I should have called maintenance specifically to fix the broken closet door and that I should have used the safe. As stated earlier, I had placed one call for maintenance services and I was not aware that it was a guests responsibility to 1) ensure the services are completed or 2) that a guests request for maintenance services nullified the Holiday Inns responsibility from providing me an adequate and secure room.

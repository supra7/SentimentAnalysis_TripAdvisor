We never actually stayed. The customer service was so horrible when trying to make reservations that we decided to cancel our stay. The front desk rep - Porcia - hung up on me because I didn't understand when she said once the date I wanted was open, and in the next breath she said they were sold out. I telephoned the manager and he was patronizing at best. I wrote to the hotel execs and never received an answer. Very poor customer service. I've vowed not to stay at Coast Hotels again.

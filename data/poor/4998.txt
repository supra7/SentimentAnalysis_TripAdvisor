Where do I begin? As you'd expect from an easyGroup company, the predominant colour scheme throughout the Hotel is orange, from the walls in Reception, through to the bedroom doors, bathroom doors and one wall in each room. Being a budget hotel, I wasn't expecting much, and on that front I wasn't disappointed! I paid 69 for what is described as a "Standard" room with a window. The room itself was in the Basement (or Lower Ground as they call it), and the window had a cheap plastic roller blind which, when raised, revealed a vista of a tiny backyard with a ladder and some air conditioning units. The room itself was not much larger than two double beds put together, with "storage" space limited to two coat hooks (a luggage room is available near Reception but, of course, that costs extra), and a floor covered in non-slip lino rather than carpetted. Whilst there was a TV in the room, you need to pay an additional fee (5 a day) if you want to watch it, and you only get BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4 and Five for your money. The "bathroom", meanwhile, was barely larger than two shower cubicles side by side and contained a shower, tiny washbasin and toilet and ineffective extractor fan, so it had a musty smell. There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms, nor is there a chair or desk, but there are four power sockets, one of which is used by an air conditioning unit mounted on the wall above the bed. Overall, the only thing this hotel has going for it is its location, just a short walk from St Mary's Hospital and Paddington station, and I wouldn't stay here again.

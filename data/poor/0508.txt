Ok, so I would have rated this a 2, but I wanted the 1 to adjust the over-all score a little more. This place needs a serious facelift!! We had a Suite as I booked a romance package...What a horrible room!!! I have seen better Super 8 Motel rooms. Dont stay here! There are much MUCH better places in Seattle...Like an alley or a shelter. I will never waste a penny at this hole again. It is really sad, as the staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel has great history...but it's a hole.

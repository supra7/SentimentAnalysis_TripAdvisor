Im not sure this hotel understands customer service. Day one no house keeping, day two they messed up our food order and it took them 2 hrs to rectify the in room service. Also what was supposed to be a 10 to 15 min wait for our "valet" car, took 45 min. Also the waitess in the gazette dropped our food and we had to wait another 20 min. Day 3 room service said they will be there in 5 min, took them 2 hrs. They just don't understand service.

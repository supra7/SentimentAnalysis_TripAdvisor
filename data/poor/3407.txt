What can I say ? I was referred to this place twice! First time, the 1 bedroom kitchenette my companion had the bed room and I had a hide a bed. We got there mid day and the room STUNK! Burns in the cushions, mold in the shower, light bulbs burnt out and the cups in the kitchens? Also growing! It looked like the cookware has not been washed from the last guest. My stay last week, I thought I would give the hotel another chance. The first room they offered us, the beds although firm, squeaked like the springs need oil. My companion requested that we changed rooms. We were moved down the hall to a room with little better furniture and the beds did not make a sound, however the upstairs guests did. The hygiene of the bathroom was less than acceptable, too. Mold and mildew around the base of the shower, the drain plate coming off the floor and holes in the wals where to pipes are. Furthermore, the shower is so small, there is barely enough room to turn around! When I walked out to their patio, all the furniture was in considerable disrepair and I found that out the hard way! When dealing with the hotel manager over the phone, he was nothing but rude and insulting saying that I had signed a waiver which released the hotel from any liability or accident which may occur on the property . So the only real draw to this place is that Janice Joplin died there (and to my understanding, other guests have drowned in their pool) If your standards are low, and like paying over-inflated rates for what you get, this is your place. Also, no free wi-fi! If you are concerned about cleanliness and a well maintained property stay across the street at the Hollywood Celebrity hotel. Spacious rooms (including the bathroom and shower) friendly, unpretentious atmosphere, and you get what you pay for.

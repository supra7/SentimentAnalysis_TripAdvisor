This was the second time I stayed at this hotel, the first time a few months ago there was a very rude lady on reception and when I checked in there she was again - just as rude and patronising! Not a very nice welcome! The bar man (Steve) was also extremely rude and the service was the worst I have ever experienced in any bar and/or hotel anywhere in the world. I will not stay here a third time and will definitely book the Intercontinental which is where we spent most of our time as we had been told by the Langham concierge to go there as they had stopped serving dinner and drinks in the evening! The Intercontinental was a dream - I even tried to change hotels but they had no space!

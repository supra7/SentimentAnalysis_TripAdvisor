This hotel is absolutely horrible and should be charged with fraud!.. If you are reading this and thinking "maybe it will be ok for me", STOP...it won't be. It's disgusting, dirty, run down, horribly furnished, poorly lit, just so awful it makes me mad that I spent even $1 to stay here. It's just so awful I could go on and on, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE believe me do not stay here, you will absolutely regret it. The website makes it look really exciting...it's not, it's just horrible, awful, and a disgrace. It feels like a boarding house/dorm.

I would love to review my stay... but there was NONE! I booked this hotel with a late checkin, and when I arrived I was informed that there were no rooms available. They had given away my room!! I was later told that there had been a mistake in one of their MULTIPLE reservation systems. YOUR CONFIRMATION/RESERVATION has NO meaning at this hotel... TRAVELER BEWARE!

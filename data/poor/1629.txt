The Magnolia Hotel in Dallas could be a serviceable, mid-range hotel in the downtown area; an attractive option for business travelers. But--alas--the hotel undermines itself in a variety of foolish ways. The service at the front desk can be gracious or surly, depending upon the clerk. The rooms--though handsomely furnished in a faux "W" style---need routine maintenance and care. The throw-pillows on my sofa were torn, and the sheets on the bed were frayed. There's a convenient coffee maker available, but the maid service never replenished the supplies; no coffee, creamer, or sugar after the first night of my stay. Similarly, the room service menu was never replaced after I'd used it the first night. (For the hotel, that's lost revenue! I would've gladly ordered my room service breakfast all five mornings of my stay!) Regrettably--when I did place room service orders--the wait was long; over thirty minutes for a simple pot of coffee on one occasion! And the order was never correct; missing muffins, or the wrong side dish. My "same day" laundry wasn't returned until after mid-night two days after I sent it to be cleaned. The hotel seems to be trying; but--given the plethora of hotel options in "Big D"--- it comes across like a slightly hapless, confused teenager in a room-full of sophisticated adults.

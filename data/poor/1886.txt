We stayed here for 2 nights and would seriously advise anyone to consider carefully whether to stay here. Like a lot of american hotels superficially everything looks good with an impressive lobby area etc but the rooms are basic and depressing with minimal facilities. I've stayed in hotels all over the world and would say that this place is 2 star at best in fact the rooms are no better than a Travelinn or Travellodge standard [ if you are based in the Uk] but of course you pay 5 star prices. Simple examples of how cheap the place is:- plastic disposable cups no glasses, no mini bar or fridge, tatty decor, dirty shabby bathrooms. If you have suicidal tendencies DO NOT stay at this hotel as it could well be your last night. The place is a nightmare avoid at all costs!!

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, on arrival we were ignored for a while as the front desk is definitely not that of a 4 star, no concierge, no welcome smile etc. We were shocked when we saw the room which was underground, poky with a view of a bare courtyard. While checking out nobody asked us if we enjoyed our stay. No free internet in room. On the last night there was a loud party which made sleeping difficult. The staff at the buffet breakfast was disinterested except for one. I wonder how this hotel has four star ratings because at four star rates one does have basic expectations, except for the location which is beautiful and the charm the hotel has of being a former monastery there is absolutely no warmth or any comforts to speak of. Guess the rating on TA have made them stop putting in any further efforts.

I reserved a room with two beds. They did not have a room with two beds, despite the written confirmation. "Robert Smart" the person with whom I spoke in Seattle, said there was no availability AT THE TIME I MADE THE RESERVATION. He implied it was somehow my fault because I made the reservation only 2 1/2 days in advance. He was unapologetic and argumentative. When I called the off-site reservation center -- IN BRAZIL- they, too were no help. So, even if you have a written confirmation for "Room type: classic double beds", it's not necessarily so.

I planned to stay two nights with my partner to go to museums and enjoy the city. We cut it short by one night. The hotel has an antiquated elevator (doors on ground floor close manually), have machines on each floor dispensing air freshener (what are they trying to mask?), a hotel staff that has had NO training. Our room was across from a man who literally screamed and cursed all night. "Oh, that's a non-market room." It was clear that this hotel is still a repository for chronic psychiatric patients. I had no apology from the hotel staff. (Why would they deliberately assign a room across from a known disturbed person?) It is a non-smoking hotel, but people smoked out of their windows anyway, so smoke wafted into my window. There is no thermostat and no individual air-conditioner. There is wi-fi but it did not work in my room (again, no apology from the staff). The neighborhood is great, but there are reputable, safe alternatives.

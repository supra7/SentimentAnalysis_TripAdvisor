The Stay at hotel Re, was for a city Break with My Mother and Wife which we spent 5 days in singapore. The Triple room that we got was a bearly enough for single person and the third bed was kept in a niche where I had to crawl to get on to the bed. Just check the Photographs published arn't they Graphically inproved ( Photoshop) Images. The real thing does not follow most of the images. Quite far to most of the activities and should take a taxi The staff was quite friendly, However I consider this as my worst hotel experiance I ever had, and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

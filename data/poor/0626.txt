from what i heard from friends and the pictures online the hotel seems to be very beautiful. how ever when i was attempting to book a executive suite for my birthday weekend in montreal ( i am from ottawa) Edith [-]( whom i also emailed) talked to me in a very rude and stuck up way. I am 15 turning 16 (which is why i think she was being such a snob) but due to the fact that my father cannot speak english that well i was calling on his behalf. and when i mentioned that i was booking a room for me and my friends and my father and this lady kept mentioning that parties are not allowed. but i have mentioned many, many MANY times that i was NOT having a "party" How was i supposed to have a party with 2-3 friends and my father? If i wanted a hotel party i would of STAYED in Ottawa. all of this has made it very difficult for me to book the hotel room and has repelled me away from this hotel. which is a shame because i think the restaurant and the rooms are just beautiful. and the location was also wonderful. when i found this hotel on the 5 star hotel website i thought this hotel was the one. clearly not

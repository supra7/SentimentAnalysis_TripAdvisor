They must write their own reviews we booked on expedia for $31 after reading reviews here. This is not an option to stay in to save some money. We couldn't stay here, the floors were wet and stinky, air conditioner didn't work. The guy was friendly but yikes there is no way I would feel safe here or comfortable. I came away with this, if my dogs kennel is more expensive than our hotel there might be an issue LOL. I was looking for a deal why I don't know but came away with having to find a hotel late at night after arriving for holidays with my family. We ended up at the holiday INN maingate for $79 a night and it was great.

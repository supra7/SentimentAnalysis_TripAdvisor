We booked a nonsmoking room online several weeks in advance of our stay at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle. Upon our arrival, the front desk staff asked if we would consider a smoking room. This was completely unacceptable to my family and we clearly stated that no, we would not consider a smoking room due mainly out of concern for our infant daughter's health. This particular staff member went to speak quietly with another front desk staff member and they both agreed on a particular room for us. When we entered the room, the smell of cigarette smoke was very apparent, and yet we could not imagine that the front desk staff would intentionally put us in a smoking room without informing us. Two days later, we discovered an ashtray and matches and checked with the front desk to discover that in fact we had been put in a smoking room intentionally because they had not kept our reserved nonsmoking room for us. All our clothes and other belongings as well as our baby reeked of cigarette smoke. In addition to this appalling lack of concern for our health and wishes, our room was not serviced during our three night stay. When I asked the front desk manager why our room had not been serviced, he checked with housekeeping and informed me that we had had a do not disturb tag on our door so they did not disturb us. This was not the case (the tag was on the inside of our door the entire time) and I had anxiously been awaiting staff to empty our garbage of dirty diapers and replace our towels. The front desk manager offered us the pathetic compensation of a complimentary hotel breakfast for my family being exposed to carcinogenic cigarette fumes for days and not having our rooms cleaned. This was our first and will definitely be our last stay at any Crowne Plaza Hotel.

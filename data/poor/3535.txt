Hmm would I stay here again, hell no worse hotel ever.I booked of the website, from the glamorous pictures on there Yes the lobby was nice but thats were it ends smells weird very dirty even by NY standards. I think even guests from [-] would be appaled at the standards this hotel conveys my rooms bed was covered in bed bugs and the bathroom was like a ethiopian refugee camp toilet. worse hotel ever I left 3 days early and checked into what is known as a 5 star luxury hotel compared to this joint, A roadside motel. Do not stay here save your money i'd rather sleep outside.

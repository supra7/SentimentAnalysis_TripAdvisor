If you like freying carpet, mould in the bathrooms and rooms with a lot of noise....then Harrah's Las Vegas is the place for you. We took advantage of a two nights free offer and booked a week at the Rio ( the sister property) 4 months in advance. Two weeks before we departed for Sunny Las Vegas I confirmed the reservation only to discover that we had been moved to Harrah's. What a complete disappointment. The room...small and standard overlooked the pool ( such as it is) and the carninval court. The noise from the courtyard carries right into the room and the pounding musics keeps you from sleeping anytime before 3am. Other than the housekeeping staff, no one appeared to be friendly. Don't bother with room service ammenities. The suprise gift basket that I had ordered for a 40th birthday suprise could not be delivered to our room prior to check in.......nor could it be delivered after check in. Despite being told it would arrive immediately after our arrival.......I had to call room service 4 hours later to find out where it was......What a dissapointment that was . We booked a higher end dinner at the Range Steakhouse. The food was excellent as was the service, but you are seated according to your Harrah's rewards card points. Apparently if you are a big spender in the casino, you get a better table. Our warning....be careful when taking advantage of the free night stays offers......they are not nearly as good as they appear!

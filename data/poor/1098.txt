I had an early flight and was planning on using the airport shuttle. I called ahead to make sure they had transportation. Extended Stay told me they do not have a shuttle however they said I could walk across the street to the Embassy Suites and use their shuttle. NOT TRUE!!!!! The shuttle driver saw us walking over and informed us he is not allowed to shuttle guests from Extended Stay even tho they tell you it is ok. I walked inside and asked Embassy Suites to call a taxi. The woman informed me that taxis do not come out to that area and if they do it will take about 1 hour...I did make it to my flight but will never again stay at Extended Stay...The hotel and room had a very odd smell....Do not stay here!

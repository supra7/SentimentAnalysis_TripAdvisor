Overall, the staff was excellent; unfortunately, certain aspects of the hotel were horrible. I could not get a cell phone call anywhere in my room during my entire stay, my alarm clock had no reception, and my tv couldn't receive half of the stations. To make matters worse, I found hair in my bathroom in addition to a tick in my sink. The tick was there when I arrived, so I know I didn't bring it. And one day when I came back to the room, all the lights had been left on and the trash can was in the middle of the hallway--as if someone was still lurking in the room, waiting to pop out and scare the heck out of me. Good breakfast and comfortable beds, but I won't be staying again. Be advised that most cabbies won't know where this is (name has changed recently); make sure to mention the Wabash address.

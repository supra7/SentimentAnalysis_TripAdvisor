The hotel seemed decent upon check in, and the room was nice enough. However, the experience following was absolutely miserable! The first night we were treated terribly in the hotel bar, where the bartender seemed more interested in getting off of work than treating the customers with care. He was extremely rude. The following night over shadowed the previous with flying colors. We returned to our room after an entire day out in San diego only to find a room that had not been cleaned. Upon calling the front desk, the "manager" accused me of having left the do not disturb sign on the door. His only offer was to send up 2 fresh towels and expected me to be satisfied by that. After spending $200 a night, and $36 on parking alone... I was livid. I would advise against this hotel to any friend or family member for many reasons, but primarily because of the extreme disrespect I felt from the staff. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY TO STAY HERE!

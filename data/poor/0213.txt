I DON"T RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL. I stayed at this hotel in June. I thought that because it was newly renovated that it would look better than the last time I stayed here. I was so disappointed to see an old looking carpet which to me didn't look so clean. I'm not sure if they replaced the carpet at all. I have been to other Renaissance Hotels and they all look very contemporary, nice and clean. This Renaissance (Seattle) is so ugly, dark and dirty looking. It looks like nothing has changed sine the 70s. The price per night isn't reasonable at all. Overall, I wasn't pleased with their service and I feel like its a waste of money to stay at this hotel.

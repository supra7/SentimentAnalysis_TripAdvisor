My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary for 2 nights. At $250/night, this place was not what I had hoped for. The rooms are very small (though the view was good). We actually had stained bed linens (not permanent stains), and a toilet that didn't flush! They would not fix the toilet; maintenance claimed that it worked fine. It quite clearly took a half dozen attempts to just flush a single tissue. My husband called and went in person to the front desk multiple times on our second day to try and get the toilet fixed, as using the bathroom in the lobby seemed unacceptable. It got to be very late on our second, and final night, and we just gave up. At check-out, the manager simply said sorry sir. For that kind of money I expect a clean bed, a woking toilet and maybe even a little concern about customer satisfaction. The trip was good, but the hotel was a lousy choice and a huge rip off!

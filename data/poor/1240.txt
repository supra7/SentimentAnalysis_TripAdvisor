Unfortunately, my staying at R&R did not go as well as i wished or planned. On the first day, I went to the bathroom I could not stop noticing some irregularities. The shower courtin was with mold/mildow, the shower gel was empty and worst of all, the sink was with broken glasses. It did not make feel comfortable at all... I summited my complaint to Mr. Elmer Groenewould (Manager) He replied to me saying that " My collegue informed me this evening that your shower curtain was replaced and your bathroom inspected. I hope, that after this, it was to your satisfaction." However, the situation was not resolved. My shower curtain was not replaced. Actually, i did not have any courtin at all. Besides that, i also had a craked glass. Mr Elmer did not even bother to apologize or reply to my e-mails.

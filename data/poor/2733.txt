Was incredibly disappointed with the room and service at this hotel. The hotel itself is badly in need of refurbishment and the rooms could use some more regular upkeep. Our heater was leaking and the toilet blocked several times. However, it was the rude employees at the front desk who really spoilt our stay. Completely hopeless and just plain rude. Try to charge us twice (we had already paid and booked on Expedia). They were also hopeless with their wireless interest, which, despite being expensive, kept playing up.

We have stayed many times at Kimpton Hotels and cannot believe that the Alexis is a Kimpton. Prior to making my reservation, I inquired as to whether there would be construction at the hotel and was told there was none. WRONG! The entire place was encased in plastic. Construction debris all around. In fact, a worker dropped a tool on my leg, and no one seemed concerned over the fact that I was bleeding! We stayed in the Honeymoon Suite and were shocked to find workers looking in our skylight over our tub banging away at 7 am! Room service was a joke. Took almost 2 hrs. to get a simple order of mac and cheese and a salad. When it arrived, it was the wrong order. Had to wait almost 30 more minutes. Then, there were no utensils with which to eat. I could go on and on. TV didn't work. We were constrantly disrupted by housekeeping who would enter without knocking, never any toilet paper. etc. etc. Save your time..save your money. This place needs to get its act together!

never again In all my years of travel, my stay at this hotel was the worse. First of all, the outside appearance of the establishment is very outdated for the location they are in, two buildings away is the Ritz Calrton and The Delano, you would think they keep up withe place. Then you proceed to walk inside where there no one to greet you or help you with your bags and the outstanding smell of wet carpet with a mixture of suntan lotion and roach spray slaps you in the face. Then the horrible customer service by the overnight front desk employee, James, because he proceeded to check us in without reading the vouchers and giving us two beds standard room when specific request was done for a one king size bed standard room, to make things worse, I get into the elevator where the stench gets worse, got to my room greeted by the same smell through out the hotel, there no air-conditioner in the room and according to the front desk no one was available to repair it. The bathtub had peeling paint all over to the point where I took a shower with my flip flops and the sink had rusty fixtures. I had to wait for the following day to be accommodated to another room. Thank God I was just there for 3 nights.

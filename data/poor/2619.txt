Just got back from a 4 day stay and would definitely not recommned this place. Our room was dirty, the paint peeling and tiles were missing in the moldy bathroom. You have to stand on a chair to adjust the rattling air conditioner. The breakfast had so-so rolls with weak coffee. The pictures on their web site and brochure are nothing like the place. Don't stay here.

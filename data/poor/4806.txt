Beware Online Bookers Don't book your stay via any online site as the Inter Continental Mark Hopkins San Francisco will not treat you as their customer. The staff said you are not our customer and if you don't like it complane to Priceline. Priceline of course says that they do not help their customers, that you need to deal with the hotel. I not only will never stay there again, will never use priceline again, but I intend to make sure everyone I meet knows how poorly these two companies treat the people who do business with them.

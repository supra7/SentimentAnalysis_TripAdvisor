Location okay. Near Termini which is convenient but this convenience does not outweigh all of the negatives and, trust me, there are plenty of those. Arrived after a long trip with heavy bags and was told to walk up three flights of stairs. No hotel staff was assigned to help guests with bags. Room extremely small and smelled. Mold also in shower. Staff was disengaged and had no grasp of customer service. Breakfast was pathetic. The whole environment was depressing...no light, no energy, no vibe. Skip it!

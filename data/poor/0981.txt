Absolutely the worst experience ever! Not going to go on and on as you can read the other experiences that we failed to read beforehand...BUT READ THEM...do not take a 3 or 4 mark rating to be good, take the time to read what the travelers have experienced, you will be shocked! You will be made to feel like you have been abducted and that if you do not buy a membership into their "lifetime" package you may never see Playa del Carmen (a good 30+ minute drive from there) or anything outside of the swamplands their property is on, again. I am not exaggerating! Their sales tactics are the worst I have ever seen. You are attacked by one sales representative after the next, each worse than the previous... the final one literally taking you into a "back room" and abusively yelling at you (and your crying wife by this point) at the top of his lungs "I work for the developer and you are stupid for not investing in this opportunity!" I will not use last names but CHRIS from Canada should be ashamed of himself, for putting us into the hands of that abusive individual in the first place. Your boss DALLAS has sorely misled you about how to treat honest good-hearted people. We have contacted the American Consulate, Better Business Bureau in the US and travel agencies to notify them of our frightening experience and to find out what can be done to prevent anyone else from this "bait and switch" DANGEROUS situation. If you go, be warned about the mafioso sales tactics, the dark and murky ocean water due to the proximity to the swamplands the hotel is built on. And know that just up the beach there is crystal clear water for swimming, snorkeling or diving, with no sharks (sales sharks that is).

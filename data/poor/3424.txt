I just came back from a business trip and would never stay at this hotel. Booked this on Priceline which rated it a 3 star hotel. Thats the first problem. What does Priceline consider a 3 start hotel in New York. I have used Priceline many times and this is hotel is nowhere near a 3 star. I tried to reach Priceline only to get a recording and could never get to the right dept to put in my complaint. Now for the hotel. Our room had no bed spread and no boxspring. The carpet was torn between the bathroom and the bedroom with carpet tacks sticking out. The heat was turned off until the temp dropped to 40 degrees and then we had to get up every 1/2 hour because it kept shutting off below the requested temp. TO get it back on you had to raise the temp 2 degrees. By the end of the night the room was at 86 degrees. There was a window well outside of our window. At 7:30 A.M, there literally were 2 workers up against the window of our room doing repair! My colleague became quite ill with a dangerously high fever. We requested a late checkout. They gave us till 1:00 P.M. On my return from business I called and told them I would be running about 40 minutes late. They said not a problem but then charged me $60.00 for being 1 hour past checkout. In addition on checking in when we complained about the room and that this is not a 3 star hotel the managers answer is you get what you get! The only decent people at this hotel was the clerks behind the counter.

After reading good reviews for the Whaler, on Kaanapali beach, I decided to stay. I got a great deal since they were under construction (or so I thought until I was given my invoice at the end of the stay). There were fees attached that were never discussed. I was extremely disappointed. It was printed in fine print that there "may be other fees included ". My fault for not looking into that. The room had carpet that must've been 30 years old. A lot of dust in the corners, and some little bugs. It was terribly dirty and I didnt even want to take my shoes off. The drains didnt drain in the bathroom. Some people may not be as concerned about cleanliness but if you are, DO NOT BOOK UNIT 364 AT THE WHALER! I happened to book the stay through Whaler's Realty. That was a terrrible experience. I had a great place booked elsewhere on the island but since the Whaler seemed like such a great deal and the pictures didnt look so bad, I switched hotels. I wish I would've kept my original plans. I would have spent less money in the end and had a much better room! Lesson learned! I write a review only to save future clients from having the same experience. If you consider the Whaler, go directly through the hotel itself or at least read the fine print if you rent an individually owned condo. AND I Would highly recommend NOT doing business with Whaler's Realty. I wish I had taken pictures to post!

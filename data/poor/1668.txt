I must say that the staff was very friendly, albeit slow. This is one of the most misrepresented hotels I have stayed in. The pictures shown online are in vast contrast to the actual hotel experience. The rooms are very small. The elevators (only one worked while our stay) are excruciatingly slow and the walls are paper thin, allowing noise from the adjacent rooms to infiltrate our guest room. The hot water during our stay was spotty at best - either scalding hot or freezing cold with no constant pressure. The description of the bathroom online stated dual shower heads, while our bathroom had only one that was antiquated. The continental breakfast was okay, and of the caliber I would expect from a LaQuinta - not a $200+/night, boutique hotel. The overall atmosphere presented was dark, dingy, and dirty - not the cool, 1920's-esque experience my girlfriend and I had expected when reading the website. Overall, our experience was poor. The hotel uses descriptive phrases such as 'destined to be one of Dallas' premier downtown hotels'. This could be true, after an extensive revitalization and renovation. Dollar for dollar, I would recommend the Hyatt next door.

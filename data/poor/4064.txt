Believe me, It was just OK. Great fancy hotel name - but ultimately disappointing. Uneventful dated 80's room decoration, hot water faucet in bathroom leaked constantly - tried reaching front desk to have them fix it and there was nobody ever available to help. Room phone gave out after a day, front desk management "too busy" to attend this very simple request - fix the faucet. OK Dreadfully slow laptop connection and yes - NO Wi-FI available. Air conditioning got me sick, do they ever change the filter? guess not, since my sinuses were literally killing me. I was truly disappointed with this hotel- frankly, I went for the FANCY name w/o first reviewing it on this site - learned my lesson. Please stay elsewhere in Chicago - there are plenty of options know what I'm talking about.

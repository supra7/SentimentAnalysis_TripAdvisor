We stayed at this Holiday Inn about two summers ago. It was so horrible, I had to comment even though it's been awhile. We had a corner room with a really nice view. Beyond that there was nothing pleasant about this hotel. I think someone who knows nothing about hotel maintenance runs this one. It was in such bad shape. The outside and inside of this hotel were dirty! The room was dirty, so dirty I cleaned the the kitchen before we used it. The carpet was in incredibly poor shape. The elevators were rickety. Everything was dirty and worn! For close to $400 a night you expect more. My biggest complaint was the pool.... it had pieces missing and broken and had dangerous, uneven tiles and pavement. Just like so many other people commented, It is a pool with a bar in it... reminds me of spring break in college. The water gets so crowded and cloudy by 3 in the afternoon, you can't swim in it for all the people wading and drinking and smoking. Defintely not a place for families and kids... Unless you are young and like to booze it up.... THINK TWICE ABOUT THIS HOTEL.!!!

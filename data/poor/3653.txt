Non-existent service at Kahala Hotel This hotel has gone so far downhill since Mandarin left, it's a crying shame. Such a beautiful location which is the absolutely only reason they can charge so much. It was literally the worst service we had during our entire 3 island tour in Sept. 2007. We stayed in medium range hotels in Kauai and Maui, just so at Oahu we could step it up and stay in a supposed 4-star. We had FAR BETTER SERVICE in both the 3-star hotels on the other islands. It was no comparison. The Kahala was a disaster... don't even consider it!

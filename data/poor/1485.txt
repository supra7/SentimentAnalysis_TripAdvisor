This hotel was okay for the first night. It is far from everything else, which means more money to be spent in taxi fares. The beds are very hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom smells of urine. The worst of all happened on the second day. As I was watching TV, I happened to see a lizard crawling on the wall. It took my breath away. This is rated as a 3 star hotel, and should be a one star. When I reported this to the staff they quickly had someone from housekeeping come to the room and get rid of the lizard, but when I said that I wanted to leave they told me that I couldn't get my money back, since it was after check-out time. I called hotels.com, since I made my reservations through them, and they couldn't do anything about it. The hotels.com representative called the hotel staff and was informed that the money would not be returned to me. Cancellation policies are not set by the representatives of 3rd party booking.

I do not recommend anyone staying at this place they call a resort. The restaurant was not open and on the website the do not mention this, nor did they when I called to book the reservations. One slide was broken; but the water part was enjoyable to my 8 year old and 3 year old and the lifeguards were very nice. Now the manager of the resort Michael is a total different story! He is one of the rudest mangagers I think I have ever had to deal with. I checked into the hotel on Monday and checked out on Wed. I paid cash for my stay; but the hotel also charged my credit card not once but twice for my stay. A $323.60 stay ended up costing over $1200.00; when I contacted Michael to get the charges removed he was friendly at first and got 2 of the charges off. So after 48 hours 2 charges were still on my account; once again I contacted Michael; he told me once again he was working on this, after a few words he informed me if I was not nicer it would take a little longer than usual for the charges to get removed from my account, he was not concerned that I was calling the Better Business Bureau or my bank on the fraudulent charges. He also would not let me talk with his superior and hung up on me. Luckily the bank removed the chargers since I have my receipt showing I paid cash and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau. I would not recommend anyone to stay at this resort; newer is not always better.

Have stayed at many W hotels-usually very happy with them. This cannot be a four star hotel! No way!!!! The room was so small that you bumped into furniture. Awful.Reminded me of a college dorm room. My husband speculated that a prison cell must be comparable! The heating system clicked on and off loudly all night! On the positive side, the staff is super friendly and it is in a great area-walking distance to Rock Center and St. Pats but I would never stay here again!!! The bathroom was also tiny. Better off at Doubletree or Eastside Marriott in my opinion. Couldn't wait to get out of the room!

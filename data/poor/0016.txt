My wife and I had prepaid for two nights and after the first we gave up and moved out. What a dump, I can not believe they had such dirty carpets and threadbare linen, on the bed, they even had holes in them. To be honest, until they completely remodel the place I would not recommend anyone staying there. We didn't even care we had to pay again at a different hotel. Just as long as we were not staying there.

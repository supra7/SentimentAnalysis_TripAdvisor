My fiance and I arrived in Ocean City late afternoon on Sunday, September 25. When he checked in, he was told that we were booked two doors down at the Dunes Manor Motel. He came back to the car and informed me, and we proceeded to the motel to find out what was going on. Upon entering the lobby, I asked the desk clerk why we would be booked at the motel, when we made reservations at the hotel on-line. She didn't seem to know what to say except there were no vacancies at the hotel. I then asked to speak to the manager. At this time, she said that he was dealing with another patron and would be awhile. She said that we could look at the room if we wanted to. We did, and I was so angry I couldn't see straight. It was our wedding week (we were getting married on the beach in front of the hotel), and they had ruined our plans. I had envisioned our stay at the Victorian style hotel, and what our wedding would be like. I told my fiance that I would not stay in that outdated 50's motel, when everything was planned around staying at a supposedly very nice hotel. Well, we waited for approximately 30 minutes and still no manager, so my fiance decided to call the Quality Inn Beachfront where we had stayed two years prior. We had a very nice stay there before, and they actually saved the day! We were able to book a suite for the entire week for $50. less than what we would have paid for that outdated motel. The Dunes Manor Hotel makes false advertising claims, overbooks at the hotel, and then sends unknowing guests to the motel. After driving many hours, most guests have no choice but to stay there. Something should be done about this. I hope other people come forward who have had similar experiences with this hotel. Our wedding turned out lovely, with no thanks to the Dunes Manor Hotel.

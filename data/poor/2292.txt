We normally book stays at Super 8 hotels while traveling because they are usually very clean and kept up in their maintenance and are always at a reasonable price. However, the Super 8 at the Las Vegas strip has to be the WORST Super 8 in the country. We normally don't care about fancy hotels if we need to save some money as long as where we stay is clean with reasonable access, but this place was downright offensive. We went to Vegas with some other family memebers to attend a cousin's wedding, and I was very embarassed to have recommended that we stay at this hotel, which we opted for because each of our traveling parties were traveling with pets, and there are a limited number of hotels that accept pets. The whole time there, I felt compelled to constantly appologize to our relatives for this hotel that I picked out for us to stay at. This hotel was dirty, and falling apart, and the staff didn't care about our problems with our room. I could not receive internet connection as promissed, and the ONLY handicapped ramps into the facility were at the front door on each end of the covered driveway, which were both blocked by either cars parked at the ramps for hours at a thime, and by cast iron benches. My mother, who cannot walk up steps, had to struggle getting past the "road blocks" at the ramps with her motorized scooter to get both in and out of the hotel, and our room was far away from the front enterence. These ramps were the only way for my mother to enter the hotel. The only good thing that I can say about this place is that the hotel casino directly next door has a great restaurant with low prices that we ate at a couple of times and enjoyed. Next time we go to Vegas though, we will definately stay at another hotel. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 hotel to anyone to stay at, even someone I didn't like!

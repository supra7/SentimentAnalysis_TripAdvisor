We changed our room within 10 minutes of being in the hotel! Room so small, not well appointed, low lighting so that you couldn't see in the bathroom, no hot water - only luke warm, towels had holes in them, bath tub so slippery we had to ask for a mat so we didn't break our necks, they let people smoke in their rooms and if you call to complain you become the problem - poor staff reponses - terrible customer service - who would ever want to stay here? We have stayed at a lot of hotels in the city and we always try to give a new one a chance - but this one was TERRIBLE - THEY WORST! I know it's not the PLAZA, but NO CUSTOMER SERVICE _ NO COFFEE IN ROOM, NO SAFE IN ROOM , NO NIGHT SERVICE (you get the room cleaned once and that is it!) , NO newspaper - but I think they feel they make up for it with apples in the lobby! At $359 a night they can forget it! I willl never stay at a W=WORST again! Stay at a MOTEL 6 and you'll do better. The only people that can be writing a good review must be the employees! Even the bartender in the lobby was only interesting in hitting on some of the male customers and didn't want to look at or serve the male/female couples! What a disaster! I am actually going to try to not pay for what was one entire night of a smoke filled smelling room! UGUGUGUGUGUGU

Are there negative stars? We bad experience with this hotel from the start. Regarding the other good reviews, don't believe all. I saw the staff on their laptop there writing reviews for the hotel in their free time. Our own experience, there is NO HEAT in the bathroom. We stayed in February. It was very cold use the toilet or shower! The breakfast is terrible. Most foods are sweet like cakes that have been there for days. If im going to pay high price, please give me some real hot food. Orange juice is charged separately (they dont tell you it's extra when they ask u if u want OJ, they just hand u the bill to sign with the oj. This is not fair.) The staff were very annoying when we ate breakfast because they all just stood there looking at what foods you pick, how much food u take and how you eat. Very annoying. We took a deluxe room and there is no frig or coffee maker in room. if u dont have kitchen, then at least they should have a small coffee maker. The cleaning staff dont know english, turkish or how to read basic signs. We put a Privacy sign on door and the cleaning lady just walked in on us! The local people that live across the street from hotel are nosy and intrusive to ur privacy. we had our curtains open and they kept peeking thru their windows seeing what we do. I'm never, never, never going to stay in this hotel! i wanted to leave early but we already paid for the rooms. They call this Best Point Hotel. It should rather be called Worst Point Hotel to better describe their crummy joint. There are other nicer hotels in this old historic area that are better and cost less. After this bad experience, we went to stay at nearby Erboy a bit north and had a nice stay there to make up for this bad experience.

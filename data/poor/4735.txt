Awful...just awful. I stayed here for a week at the end of July. A MAID STOLE MY COMPUTER, IPHONE, AND DOCUMENTS FROM MY ROOM!!! After meeting with the manager and security I was assured I would be reimbursed by their insurance company and have a night deducted from my folio. When the bill came not only did they charge me for the 'free' night, they also charged me for my free AmEx platinum night. Then the insurance company declined to pay for ANYTHING. I should've filed a police report right then and there, but i (mistakenly) chose to believe their employees. Stay here at your own risk.

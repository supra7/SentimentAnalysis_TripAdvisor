This hotel is a big rip off. My husband and I stayed at this proprety for a recent anniversary weekend getaway. Let me just tell you that our stay was anything but pleasant which is a huge disappointment for the price we paid. The building is old and has a strong musty smell throughout. The beds were very uncomfortable and the towels looked a little overused. The girl Christine that worked there was very rude and could certainly use a lesson in customer service! There was trash in the elevator in the corner. Our tub had a very slow drain and it was disgusting taking a shower with dirty water covering your feet. You would think that would be the end of our troubles but it wasn't. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed red bites all over me. I pulled the fitted sheet up to look at the corner of the mattress and low and behold there were BED BUGS! My husband and I packed our things and were out of there in no time flat.Thanks Embassy Suites New Orleans Convention center for helping us celebrate our anniversary in such an awful way. Just to let you know, I would NEVER, EVER stay here again!

Place was clean as well as the room. Price was also very reasonable. The real problem is the hotel is located right in the middle of enemy territory. You are at high risk trying to walk anywhere. So unless you just stay at the hotel, you will run up a high cab bill. We spent on average 90 to $100 in cab rides to and from this hotel. $20 to $25 each way to just about anywhere. Found the food very marginal and expensive. Next time I'll pay a little more for a room somewhere close to "things" and save on the cabs.

1st trip to Las Vegas, stayed at Harrahs. I gamble enough in Atlantic City and New Orleans that my room in Vegas was comped. I checked in, went to my room and discovered the only view was that of some dirty pipes and a brick wall. I went to the desk and asked to have my room changed. I was told by the desk clerk that I had already been upgraded to a junior suite (news to me) and there was nothing available. She then coughed all over my paperwork and handed it back to me. I checked in on Monday afternoon and left Thursday. Didn't spend one dime in their hotel/casino - went to the Bellagio and spent tons of money - their service was impeccable.

A dump Definatly nothing like the description that we were given by our agents.We found the same conditions as the previous review. There was supposed to be air conditioning, our room had a ceiling fan and an old cast iron radiator and the elevator was out of order.We took one look at the room and walked out, there was no way we would stay there and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

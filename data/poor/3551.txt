Please check when you book this hotel that your room is not described as a double on the ground floor. We booked a double ensuite, what we got was a single with a double bed in it, no room to move, a shower that was impossible. It was so hot that we had to have the window open, there was a nest of pigeons flapping and cooing all night and the family below who had no regard for guests, i had to shout at them to be quiet late at night. Pillows (one each) were rock hard. The room itself was spotlessly clean but unbearable, no storage for luggage. Breakfast was included ,a selection of a boiled egg or cereal or toast but with all guests in one 'breakfast' room the size of a shoebox, we ended up eating out. The other rooms may be fine but just be warned about the ground floor doubles.

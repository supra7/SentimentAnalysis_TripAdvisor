Overall experience - BAD....reflecting on the last reviewers comments....Don't stay at Hotel Felix.... The overall rooms are nice, but extremely small. NOTHING is outlined on their web-site to reflect the postage-stamp sized rooms.....Very misleading. I traveled with my 3 and 8 year old, checked in, only to find ONE queen bed in the room. Upon returning to the front desk, I was told there were no king bed rooms available...for our first night, but a good chance of king bed the following night - Well, no deal.... The front desk's response was patronizing, short and RUDE. What I find pathetic is the fact they even offer a ONE queen bed room, that is no larger than a normal 4 star hotel bathroom.... This hotel is a 2 star....no higher. Positives (and yes, there are some) are cleanliness, location and front door persons are awesome, polite (maybe promote them to front desk - fire the current ones...)

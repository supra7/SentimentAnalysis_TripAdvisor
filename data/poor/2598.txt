The front desk staff was rude and unhospitable. Granted we stayed on a busy Friday night, however we have stayed at IC hotels before and never had such rude staff. Louis at the front desk, Gregory a "manager" and Shedrick also a "manager" had horrible customer service. The room had some sort of construction writing on the wall (see photo), rooms were not sound proofed properly, screw fell out of the vent in the bathroom due to doors slamming all night long in hallway. Contacted both managers for a barely there apology. I will NEVER stay here again and seriously question stays at other IC hotels. No Wifi...had to pay for it!!!!

This is an old property. Carpets are very worn and smelly. Room seemed clean at first glance but on closer inspection not so clean. Hair on bathroom floor from previous guests. Lots of dust and fluff behind the nighttables and headboard of bed. (I had to move them out to plug in our CPAP machines - don't normally look behind the nighttables). Sleep number bed was good and we were on the backside of the hotel so airport noise did not bother us. Had to pay more for a wheelchair accessible washroom. Shuttle staff were helpful on the way back to the airport. Had to lift electric scooter into shuttle van as they have no ramp. They recruited another employee from a different department to help load and unload when we got to the airport. This was appreciated. I asked if they had a wheelchair ramp when I made the call from the airport and they said "Yes". Another customer helped to pick it up but I had to help and hurt my neck in the process.

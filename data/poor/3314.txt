There were two ladies that worked there that were friendly, but other than that, everything that could go wrong, did. The evening we checked in I went to draw a bath, to find hair still inside the tub from the last guests. The tub took over 20 minutes to drain afterwards, and I had to stay in the bathroom to move the plug because it kept stopping the flow. The next morning in the shower the water temperature went from scalding hot to freezing cold in a matter of seconds throughout my entire shower - the shower would not stay at a constant temperature. That day, we couldn't get the heater to turn off in the room, so we went out and left the window open to cool it off. On our way out we talked to the front desk about the shower, their only response was, "Wow. I've never heard of that happening." After dinner and a movie out, there were no parking spots left in the parking lot, or anywhere nearby for that matter. After circling for 15 minutes, the manager told my husband to park in a spot that was partially blocking the fire lane and so far into the driveway that we almost got hit twice as we were parking. When we got back to the room that evening, there was a large beetle laying on my pillow. We decided to sleep on the second bed in the room in case there were more critters. As I pulled the sheets back I saw a small pile of hair. The evening manager was curt and even arguing with valet staff in front of a lobby full of guests, he is the same one who told us the "fire lane" spot was safe to park for the night. In an effort to avoid a ticket, my husband had to go back down an hour later and move the car. I would have expected these types of things from a Motel 6 (although I have seen some very clean Motel 6s), but not from the Red Lion. Staff was informed of our concerns verbally as well as through a comment card, so far no attempts have been made to remedy the situation.

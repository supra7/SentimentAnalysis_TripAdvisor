Staff treated me and my husband like kids and acted like we couldn't afford events and spoke down to us. (I am in my 20's my husband is 31). They also gave us a room with 2 full beds even after we told them its our honeymoon. My husband makes very good money however after our experience here we decided to go out of our way to spend our money OFF their property. Avoid if you are under 50 they treat you like garbage if you don't have white hair.

I stayed there with my family as a transit before flying back to Bali. This place looks more like a jail than a hotel. My "family" room was so small, no more than 4m by 4 m, walls are paper thin, i had to knock on our 2 doors away neighbors at 3.00 am in order to sleep. One of the most lifeless room I have ever encountered. Forget about service, it is all "do it yourself" in this place. Breakfast is really basic. 150$ for this.....forget about it.

Friendly staff. What you see on the website is not what you buy. The room they gave us when we arrived was a tiny and hot one in the basement, then we compalined and they gave us the nightmare room 6 which is close to the brekfast room. We could hear everything from outside and so impossible to sleep well. Then thy moved us to room 20 which was better. Bed had wheels and moved far too easily. Bathrooms are tiny. Nowhere to hang towels. Breakfast area was very very tiny. A joke... we could not move!!! Breakfast was far too simple and even the coffee was cold. We (couple) paid 110 pounds for 2 days. After all that was mentioned above, this price was far too expensive. Ah! They charge you if you pay by credit card and this is not mentioned on the website.

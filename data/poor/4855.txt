The place felt like a cheap one star hotel masquerading as a nicer hotel with its superficially chic, but cheap-on-closer inspection-art-deco furniture. I am a middle-aged professional that travels for business at least once a month. Hotel Deca looked like the appropriate place to stay, given its proximity to the University of Washington. I have probably stayed in over 100 hotels in the past 20 years. I have never met a staff so ignorant. My first question regarded gym facilities at the hotel. The staff person asked another: do we have a gym here? Each time I inquired about gym facilities, I received a different answer. I was constantly faced with inaccurate answers to my questions. I was incorrectly told that there were no laundry services. When I asked about restaurants nearby, I was told to: just walk down the street (it was night). When the wireless stopped working, I was told to: just purchase a cable from the front desk. I noted that perhaps some of the other guests would like to use the wireless service. The staff were well-meaning and friendly, but completely ill-prepared to perform their jobs, and unfamiliar with the norms for a hotel. On my second night I received no wash cloths, shampoo or conditioner. This problem was corrected by the night staff. The room was small, and there are no drawers for clothing, except for a small plastic one at the bottom of the closet. I emailed the manager of this hotel, but received no reply. Generally, unresponsive.

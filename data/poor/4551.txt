A nice renovation spoiled by the failure to double glaze the windows. Every car, truck, and motorcycle that passes the hotel is clearly audible in the guest rooms. In addition, the hotel is on one of the approaches to Love Field, so plane noise is a problem until that facility closes around 11 PM. But, worst of all is the presence of a late night club accross the street that features a patio open until 2 AM. Loud music and revelling are very audible in the rooms facing Maple St. This hotel is far too expensive for these problems. I recommend the Hotel Za Za nearby which is similarly priced and has similar amenities.

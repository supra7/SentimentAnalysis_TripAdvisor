Don't Expect Much!!! What a disappointment. When you are paying 600.00 a night for a room you expect Four Seasons quality rooms and hotel. What we got was Quality Inn. When walking down the hall you cannot help but notice the that the halls are not air conditioned. When you walked in our rooms 929 and 927 you were overwhelmed with the smell of mildew. The bathtub ( which you had to walk to the shower to get to) was rusting, peeling wallpaper and the parkay floor was coming up, due to the mold growing underneath it. They obviously have a mold and mildew problem. I cannot believe that this hotel is a Leading Hotels of the World and a part of the American Express Platinum travel program. Someone form the respective companies really needs to go visit this hotel. The only thing would improve this hotel is a bulldozer!

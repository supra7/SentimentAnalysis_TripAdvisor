Beware of this Resort. Booked 2 rooms "poolside Deluxe" according to website. Rooms were 120 yards from pool, overlooking stairwell and delivery lot. Sedona Block third floor. This was "within guidleines of 5 minute or less walk to pool" accoring to manager. Why didn't they tell me that when I booked instead of "they will be a nice poolside room". Rooms had overwhelming odor of cigarettes and wet animal. Floors very damp in one. Awoken first morning at 6:30 am to diesel truck engine idling for one hour, (manager says "sorry but this is a place of business"). I contacted front desk four times the first day asking for a new room but never received. Rooms are very tired. OLD CRT tube 1990's TV. despite four phone calls throughout first day was not given room change option. Manager offered cash compensation but I refused. I wanted what I paid for and what was promised. How can they advertise this as a "poolside room". What a joke. I wouldn't stay here again for $50/night nevermind the $300 plus $20/person/Day resort fee. Speaking of which, the water park is huge BUT, with advice of another resort guest we got in line to enter at 9:20AM before park opening at 10AM in order to get chair. Lucky for us as we managed to grab last ones. By 11AM even all of the grass areas were crammed full of people sitting on towels. Waited over 1 hour for poolside drink service to be delivered and never saw the attendant for over 2 1/2 hours despite leaving a $10 tip the first time. Stay away from this place unless you have very low standards. Kids enjoyed the waterpark slides and lazy river though. Don't be fooled by the nice lobby.

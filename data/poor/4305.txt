Due to flight delays, instead of arriving on Sunday night at 5:30pm, we arrived the next day at 2am. Although we prepaid for the room, since we didnt call ahead to let them know wed be late, they had no rooms that we requested. They upgraded us for one night. The upgraded rooms in the Carnival tower are far superior to the cheaper Mardi Gras rooms. During my frequent visits to the customer service desk (see below), I heard them offer to upgrade many people for one night. I also heard people being told to wait for housekeeping to finish cleaning their room. This leaves me to believe that they are overbooking right and left, and while its nice to be upgraded, it is a huge inconvenience to have to keep calling the next day to see if your room is ready, and then repack all of your things and move them! The lock on our door was broken. It wouldnt read the code that theyd made for the card at check-in. We trekked down to check-in and back way too many times. It was suggested that we were somehow demagnetizing our cards! After two full days of getting new cards, having them not work, and being accompanied by security to let us in, they finally, a locksmith came and fixed the lock. But we will never stay at Harrahs again. Though our room was nonsmoking, the sheets had cigarette burns. Housekeeping changed the bedding by leaving on the dirty sheets and turning the pillowcases inside out. We had 2 coffee mugs for three people. The drain in the tub was very slow. We also had the crappy view of the top of part of the hotel, as Ive seen in other pics here. The buffet was delicious, but I could always eat there and stay elsewhere. The day of our departure I heard on the news that Harrahs had been sold. Hmm... Did our no-customer service have anything to do with this shake-up? Im not going back to find out!

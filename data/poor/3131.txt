The staff forgot the promotion offer so I had to ask for the $5 starbucks card. Rarely were we greeted with a hello or polite salutation as we walked through the lobby during our two day stay. I usually initiated the salutation. In fact, the staff seemed understaff adn overall very unhappy. The walls throughout the hotel are dirty which shows readily due to the poor choice of cold white paint. The bed was the worst I've ever slept on in a modern hotel. It was lumpy and slanted to one side. Two days later, my back is still sore. The decor was an attempt to be modern yet the sparseness is highly uncomfortable. Upon checking out, we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our car from the valet service and there was no one ahead of us in line. A true diva would be fuming mad about having to spend the night in this high priced dump.

We recently stayed at W for a long weekend. I absolutely agree with the previous person's (Vanderbilt) review. Whilst the room at W is no doubt very cool, contemporary and new, but their service really sucks. The staff are cold and apathetic, their attitude is as if they don't really care. If all they want is to make a salary and do not really have passion about delivering hospitality or care about guest services, then they should not be working in the hotel industry!! The staff at W needs to take a serious lesson from the attitude of hotel staff working in Thailand or Japan who really take pride in what they do. The food & beverage also sucks big time. We had read some very horrible reviews about the restaurants at W posted on "openrice.com" , but we did not really believe them originally. But now we do, we tried the food at their Kitchen, and it was really as bad as people said. All in all, our experience at W was extremely disappointing. It was over-priced, their service lacked heart, and the food was terrible. The only good thing about the hotel was the roof top pool and conveniently locating directly inside the Elements mall.

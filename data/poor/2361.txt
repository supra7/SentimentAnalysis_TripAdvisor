We stayed in Room 255. We had planned on staying the whole weekend, but we checked out first thing the next morning. The hotel looks nice on the outside, but room 255 was very old and shoddy, worse than a Motel6. I would use the word "fleabag." Bedsheets were soiled, blankets had cigarette burnholes. I am not exaggerating. Beds were hard and uncomfortable. The A/C unit was weak and made the room smell. Furnishings were outdated and creepy. A marble endtable? A 14" TV? Bathroom showerhead was one of those flowsavers, very disappointing. The room we had was way in the back; it was quiet, but it had a view of a dirty unlandscaped courtyard. We also found ants and flying bugs in the room. We couldn't sleep it was so disgusting. The front desk personnel were pleasant enough; they actually tried to move us to a different room when we checked in, I guess they knew the horror we were in for. We checked out the next day, and will never go back. Maybe your room will be better, but I wouldn't risk it. Stay at a nice hotel chain, like the Hilton or Hyatt or Renaissance. The worst thing is to visit a beautiful place like Maui and wreck it with a dumpy hotel.

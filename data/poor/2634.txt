We stay several times a year at Place d'Armes Hotel. This time will be our last. I was traveling with my 75 year old mom who is handicapped. I had asked for a specific room as I knew it would meet our needs and was told "we cant guarantee requests" When we checked in, the room I requested was full. The room we had was terrible. It was a long walk for my mom from the elevator to her room, and the bathroom was too small for her walker and she nearly fell. My husband has a larger bathroom in his 27 ft. travel camper. The next morning my kids spotted folks checking out of the room I had requested so I called the front desk to ask to be moved to that room for our second night. I was told, someone is checking into that room today and they had specifically requested that room. HAHA. What about "we cant guarantee special requests"? So we made the best of it and spent our last night in the room way way away from the elevator with the bathroom so small I had to decide if i wanted to scrape my booty or my boobs going thru the tiny bathroom door everytime I needed to use the toilet.

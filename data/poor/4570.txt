I've stayed a lot of nice hotels and many not so nice. Felix Hotel in Chicago ranks very close to one of the worst ever. Priceline ranks them as 4 stars - that's about 3 too many. The Super 8 or Motel 6 has more room and amenities than Felix. Priceline booked me into one room of about 200 sqft with 3 adults (another story altogether). We joked that one of us sardines would need to sleep outside the room - though the hallway didn't offer much either. It was so bad that I ended up booking another hotel with two beds a few blocks away. I promised myself that I'd write this review so that others would avoid the same "4 Star" mistake that Priceline lured me into!!

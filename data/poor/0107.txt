We booked King Bed room for a week though a travel agency, but when we arrived at the Hotel, they insisted we had no choice but stay in the handycapped room (No Bathtub, extra height for toilet, big door, queen bed) for the night. We would have accepted if they discount a little, but they did not. We could accept it if it were only one night and if they guaranteed they would change to regular room from the next day. However, they did not guarantee that. They just said they would request changing room, but they cannot guarantee it. WHY? Request to WHOM? We were talking with the front desk manager but he did not do anything about it. After we did not move the front desk for more than 15 min, one of front ladies asked the manager something, and they checked the computer, and finally they guaranteed they would change the room to regular room from the next day. See! They can do it! They just did not want to do it! If we did not insist to change it, they would force us to stay in the handycapped room for the rest of the week.

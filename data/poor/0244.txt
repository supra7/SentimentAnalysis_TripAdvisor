The rudest hotel staff I have ever encountered. Refused to let me use a restroom pre-check in to change my infant's diaper. Over one hour late in "cleaning" (ants on the floor does not usually indicate clean!)) the room, delaying check in over 1 hour. When I attempted to speak with a manager she berated me and threatened to kick me and my entire family out as my infant and I stood there sobbing. Tiny,dirty rooms with very thin walls- kept up all night by loud neighbors. Small parking lot. Wrote 2 e-mails, 1 typed letter to corporate and 1 phone call to corporate to complain and was always blamed for everything and never received an apology. Boycotting all Choice Hotels at this point.

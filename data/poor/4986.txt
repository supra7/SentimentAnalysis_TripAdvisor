Stayed at Westin Montreal for two nights during labor day weekend. The hotel was somehow crowded and although I asked a high floor room and checked in at around 1pm, they weren't able to find a room higher then the 3rd floor. Obviously we got waken up early in the morning since there is a lot of traffic noise coming from St-Antoine st. Staff at the reception was a total disapointment, rude, indolent and wouldn't speak to me in french (do feel more comfortable speaking french). Also, when we checked-in our room, I checked the sheets to make sure they were new (as I always do) and I found some red stains that looked like lipstick on it. We also got surprised when we asked for bathrobes and that the delivery man, about 7 seconds after knocking on the door, got into the room although the do not disturb sign was on the door, this shows how well managed this hotel is... On the plus side, they brought (after two requests), a nice dog bed for our pet (30$ a night). Beds are also very comfortable. Very limited selection for room service. Won't return..

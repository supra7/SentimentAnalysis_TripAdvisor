We got to stay in this hotel via priceline.com which somehow rated the hotel as 3.5 star. It was definetely overated in my opinion as the carpet was damp, old building, dusty, rusty wood door, smelly room, hot air conditioner, old elevator and have a garden where every morning thousands of birds are coming there and make so much noise which can be heard from the room.

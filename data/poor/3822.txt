Worst Vacation of my life! I was one of about 75 girls who were taken to Hawaii with all the money that we raised by selling girl scout cookies and doing SOOO many other fundraisers! We were all exhausted by the time we got to the hotel with the 20 hour flight we just wanted a room to relax in and hang out. That wasnt going to happen that night though. We got our keys after about an hour and they were short about 5 rooms even though we booked this far ahead of time! I went up to my room with my 2 friends who i was sharing a room with and we tried to open the door but it wouldnt open! It looked like someone had broken into the room with a crowbar which REALLY scared me since i was thousands of miles away from home without my parents! To get into the room one of us had to turn the knob and then another person literally had to run into the door and hit it with your shoulder to get into it! Not that that was bad enough when we went in it was all moldy and musty! The windows were shut and you cant open them. And the room was very creepy, it seemed like someone had died in that room. The whole place was dirty! We tried to get another room but they didnt have anymore. We were unhappy with this hotel so we put all of our stuff in the rooms and we left to find another hotel. We couldnt get another one for that night so we went back and there was a strange bottle with a blue substance in it that wasnt there when we left. The beds they give you to sleep on are very uncomfortable. Not one person in my room slept the whole night. When we got up in the morning all of our backs hurt and we only had another long day of walking ahead of us. We left the next day and went to the Pacific Beach Hotel! That hotel was awesome and i would highly recommend that if you are staying in Wikiki Beach

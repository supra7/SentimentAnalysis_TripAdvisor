We had a confirmed reservation for "non-smoking double" but when we arrived we were told that was just a "preference and not guaranteed especially since we booked through the internet and with ---- ".We ad arrived early in the evening not even late and they knew we were coming for several weeks. We had a confirmation paper stating nonsmoking double and it was worthless. What we got was a smoke filled TWIN. Efforts to rectify this with management and even calling hotels.com could not correct this. They said that they would look into possibly changing room next day but we never got anywhere. The bathroom had recently been remodeled and although small was the nicest place to hang out.We only spent 2 days there and left for another hotel with at least nonsmoking double.The smoke smell was choking and pervasive.Dec 2005. The location was great near the subway.Couples who expect to sleep together need to look elsewhere.

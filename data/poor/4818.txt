Crappy Hotel and Poor service The only way to describe my experience at the Mark Hopkins is terrible. From a value standpoint, it is not worth the money. The hotel is old and the walls are paper thin. I received several calls throughout the night from security because of complaints that the television was too loud. I have pretty good hearing so I assure you that the tv volume was not unreasonably loud.The rooms are nothing special and were outdated. The location is great as the hotel sits atop of Nob Hill but there are several hotels in San Francisco that I would recommend over the Mark Hopkins. If you are used to upscale accomodations and solid customer service, then I would advise you to refrain from staying at this hotel.

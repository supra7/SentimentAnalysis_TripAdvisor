What a scam! I booked a room at the Marseilles Hotel for a convention in May of 2007. I called the week before the convention to confirm my reservation and was told that everything was fine at that time. When I arrived at the hotel on a Friday night, I was told that the hotel had overbooked, so they had no rooms available for me. They took my credit card and told me that my reservation was still with them, but I would actually be staying in the Continental Hotel, one block away. When I arrived at the Continental, I immediately realized that it was a much lower quality hotel (stains in the carpet and on the walls, cracks in the ceiling, trash in the hallways, shower head and sink did not work properly, etc). Additionally, when I inquired about rates, I discovered that the Continental charged $30 less per night than the Marseilles. However, when I returned to the Marseilles to check out three days later, the hotel manager refused to adjust my bill to reflect the quality of my lodging. In fact, he informed me that he paid $25 per night more than I paid in order for me to stay at the Continental. I find the entire situation to be pretty questionable. I do not recommend booking at the Marseilles under any circumstances. Just go ahead and book directly with a lesser quality hotel - at least that way, you will pay for what you're getting.

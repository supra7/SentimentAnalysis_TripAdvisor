I never wrote a review on here before but after a long trip up the pacific coast - thought I should add my thoughts on a few places. The inn at queen anne was by far the worst place we stayed. There are not any huge problems- like bedbugs- but there are a lot of little annoying things like no elevator, breakfast of just english muffins and machine juice, no coffee maker or hairdryer in the room, etc.. The hotel staff appears friendly but cant say there are helpful. For instance, we had to use their parking ($15 per night)- the desk girl gave my husband horrible directions and he parked in the wrong lot and got a ticket. Becareful what you ask for here too- they told us they had cribs available- even though our baby sleeps in our bed we thought we would take it if its available- at the end of our stay we realized we paid $15 per day for the crib- which isnt a lot- just wish they would have mentioned the cost when offered. The neighborhood is okay- some restaurants, lots of bars, lots of homeless, close to the touristy things. The hotel isnt aweful for a night- or two but if you stay longer- I am sure you can find something nicer in Seattle.

In 1st room the shower didn't work, nor would the tub drain. Moved up a floor to have a shower which blasted half it's volume out the back of the shower head onto the ceiling. Teenagers were partying in hall outside our door till past 1 AM. Fresh vomit on the sidewalk just outside the front entrance in the morning. We'd have enjoyed ourselves more if we'd just piled our money in the street, burned it and then slept in our car.

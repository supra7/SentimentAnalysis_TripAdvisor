Absolute Disaster Had made phone reservations for 5 nights beginning 1/17/05. Personally asked for something special as we were celebrating 40th anniversary. We were promised and sent confirmation for a deluxe room with ocean view. Upon arrival Julie advised us that they had overbooked and the only room available was a mt. view room at $249/night and they would move us the next day to the deluxe ocean view room at $339. We advised her that we had already reserved for 5 nights at $235. She said she would have to check into the rate discrepency and then tried to make us feel grateful for a mt. view room which, even though on the 19th floor, was noisy from service and garbage trucks below and overlooked the roof of a parking garage (got this beauty at $194!). Rooms are very small, balconies are not useable (will not accomodate even a chair), rooftop pool is very small and virtually useless. The shower curtain in our room had a strange odor that the staff had tried to camoflage with some type of cleaner. The lobby is nondescript, the rooms are staid and dated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. I spent hours researching hotels for our anniversary and relied heavily on comments from this web site to make my decision. I would have been much better off going back to other hotels we have stayed at in Honolulu. The attitude of Julie about the overbooking was unforgiveable and her audacity in suggesting that we should be paying a higher rate than we booked for was inexcusable. I would guess we lost our original booked room to a tour group.

Still under heavy construction and still lacking I stayed at this hotel in the summer - not a good experience. I was told, during my stay, that the resort was going through difficult times due to the heavy construction. Well, I could understand that. So, when I was looking to go back to HNL for a getaway last month, I saw that the hotel's website was devoid of construction warnings. So, I booked a room. Let me tell you....they are still heavily under construction and they still have all of the same problems. I felt so cheated that they are not telling people that half the hotel (Dolphin wing) is closed down and boarded off - literally. This hotel is not playing straight with its customers. I will not return again.

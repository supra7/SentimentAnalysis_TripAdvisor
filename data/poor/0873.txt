Our family and friends booked the Trump for our son's 21st birthday. From the moment we arrived things went wrong. We had booked our rooms (3) directly with the hotel and one week prior to arrival we called and canceled ONE NIGHT of our reservation. Upon arrival the hotel had no record. After about an hour they finally found the reservation (they claimed they were changing booking systems) and finally cleared us for our rooms. We checked our bags curbside (we had all driven in) and went to our rooms. After waiting an hour we started to call the front desk to find out where out bags were. No one knew. We called several times and could not get a decent explaination. Our bags finally arrived after almost 2 hours and with no appology or explaination. The afternoon of our second day our 21 year old son called to say his key wasn't working and when he went to the front desk they explained that the reservation was only for one night. We then discovered that all 3 rooms were "turned over" as the wonderful front desk staff had only corrected THEIR reservation mistake for one day. After a visit to the manager the hotel did solve the problem but I would never stay at another Trump property. It is not worth the frustration! If this is the common Trump experience I would watch for a bankrupcy notification.

We experienced a very dirty room, shower with a plugged drain, blankets on the bed tattered and torn and that was once we got into the room. The desk issued many keys to even find one that would work to get us into the room. Bathroom tissue boxes were filled with dirty tissues, extra bed mattress was filthy, and smelled with no sheets to put on it. One of the elevators malfunctioned with no phone inside to call for help. I could go on and on but the message I want to say is not to stay at this hotel. I feel badly that coming from out of town, I had to experience this bad example of what is listed as a Dallas "luxury hotel" on this hotel's website.

Stayed 3 nights with wife, 25 yr old son, and 21 yr old daughter. Toilet leaked in one room. Noisy hallways made it hard to sleep. Rooms would get hot at night. My son had too much to drink one afternoon and was a little wobbly. The security would not let me take him to his room. He was not the least bit violent or being verbally offensive. Security supervisor Keith Smith created a situation where there was none. I was physical abused and verbally threatened by this "man". Please avoid all Harrah's casinos.

If the lobby were anything to go by, the hotel would be great. The bar looks very cool. However, once you enter the elevator, it all goes wrong. The room was tiny and dark and shabby. The carpet was worn, the closet did not close because the ironing board hanging there was too big for it, and broken. The television was old, the bathroom tiny, and it smelt musty. DO NOT STAY HERE

When we checked in our hotel room. I felt something under the sheets! I found a used condom! I was horrified! I assume the Hotel would be somewhat apologetic but all I got was we'll have someone remove it when we service your room! I want it out NOW! I'm not about to touch the condom! Also, My gf and I had a extremely intoxicated man follow us to our room. We called security and had these two security guards that need canes come to our room with really bad attitudes. They banged on the door and really scared my gf. Then we explained what happened and really thought we were getting carried away. In conclusion, if you want to stay at a hotel where it absolutely disgusting and have the lowest of low stay at the same hotel than this place is for you! NO wireless internet and charge 12.95 a day for plugged in internet!

We came for the mens final four, booked months in advance, had to leave a huge deposit and totally pay for the room a month ahead of time. Paid over $300.00 per night for a couple of the nights and close to the rest. Got there and the room was very, very small, balcony looked out of construction, Balcony next to us was off the hallway so everyone smoked out there, so our room smelled like smoke. The pool was empty and dug up. We arrived on a Wednesday and were told it would be fixed by Friday, then Monday and when we left on Wednesday no one had even started the repair. Also we had to book a minimum 4 nights and while we were there they we accepting people for one night at $89.00 per night. Horrible experience. Beds were horrible, worn out.

From the moment we walked in, it was a horrible experience. We had prepaid for our stay. But it took them an hour to find us in there system. We were there first, but they checked in 30 people who hadn't prepaid before us. We paid for a non-smoking room, they gave us a smoking room, a horrible mix with asthma. We put the do not disturb sign up, they came in anyway. There was pet stains all over the hotel. There were holes in the walls were termites came through. We ordered a queen size bed, we got a double, we could feel the springs coming through on the bed. Will never go here again. The ONLY good thing about this place is the location. However, even with that, there was a bunch of homeless people hanging around the hotel. My husband stated "The world's dummest people work there"

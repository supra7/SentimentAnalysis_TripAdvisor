Reserved through Hotwire and called the hotel to make sure the room I was assigned to had a double and not a king bed. "Anna" said she could not assign a particular room and I would have to call Hotwire. I called Hotwire who said it was up to the hotel which room they put me in. The Hotwire agent volunteered to call the Seattle Radisson and request double beds. The agent spoke with "Anna" again who said I was assigned to a king at present and she would not change it. Radisson graciously allowed that I might request a room with double beds when I arrived. I have booked other hotels through Hotwire before and had no problem requesting a room with double beds. Radisson clearly has instructed its clerks to refuse to accommodate Hotwire customers. Lousy customer service.

I had a fairly short notice business trip out to Maui and the Maui Lu was the only place available in Kihei. Upon arrival, I knew why. The entrance is deceiving. When I pulled into the registration desk I thought "this isn't so bad. It's quaint and rustic" The staff was friendly. It went down hill from there. The room I stayed in was across the street. The parking lot hosts the smallest car spaces I have ever been in and it was full. I had to park across the street and cross Kihei Blvd at night, alone. It's not very well lit. When I reached my room, I cried just a bit. The room is in DESPARATE need of new carpet and new paint. The bathroom gave me the willies, I dared not step barefoot on the floor. There was a small A/C unit that I promptly set to cool, but the room never quite got comfortably cool... Probably because my front door did not adequately shut. The Maui Lu still uses the old fashioned KEYS for your room and the deadbolt barely fit into the door jam. There were traces of an old bar slide lock but the area where the lock would fit into has been long wittled away leaving about a 1" gap between the door and the door jam. I am guessing this contributed to the mass of tiny mosquito like bugs flying around. The beds were not comfortable at all. There was a wall print that was dated "1989"...I'm guessing nothing has been done to the property since then. The upstairs balcony had bubbled paint that exposed rotting wood and it was starting to fall. Read: the balcony was not 90 degrees straight, it tilted slightly to the outside. There was a small mini fridge - next to the old broken mini fridge in the room. The outdated rattan furniture had stains and grossness on the sides. For a single woman traveling alone, I did not feel safe at all. I checked out of the hotel and found a place a few miles down the road for just a few dollars more. The location has potential, but for $200/night, I would expect a lot more.

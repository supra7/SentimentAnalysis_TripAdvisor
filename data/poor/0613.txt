Wow that was like stepping back into the 50', but in a very dirty unclean situation There was the yellowed (from previous smokers) wall paper with ugly green motifs, ugly enough to make you puke your dinner, the bad choice of colour for the walls, the old furniture, in great need of replacement, the overpowering smell encasted in the walls, the old dirty carpet throughout the suite and the feeling of sleeping in an unclean bed. Ouch what a disaster. So cheap looking and way too expensive for that kind of environment. Very unhealthy room. When I looked up at the fan in the ceiling it was encrusted with a thick coat of dust balls, the fan was the gray dust colour. The mountain of dust on the side of the dresser was so thick, I wrote my name in it. It is so much like stepping back in time that behind the toilet door, screwed to the wall, is a bottle opener. Wow quite the nightmare back to the 50s. Luckily we were only doing an overnight on our way home from Seattle. Will never go back to that decrepit hotel again. The shuttle service was good and on time but that is the only good thing about the hotel.

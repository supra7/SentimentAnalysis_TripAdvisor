Stayed Labor Day Weekend. I would estimate more than half the rooms are being completely renovated. Hotel should advertise this on their website...desk attendant did not mention anything about this either upon checking in. We had 5 people and came in late and could not change. Stuck on the third floor. Breakfast was OK.

Our room smelt of burnt cooking fat. I think this was because it had a dirty oven. I asked if it could be cleaned, they said they would try to get round to it in a few days. The smell was still there when we left three days later. The place was full, so we couldnt change rooms. In general its not particularly clean and in desperate need of a face lift. If you use the internet they charge you $4.99 to connect. If you can find somewhere else to stay, do so!

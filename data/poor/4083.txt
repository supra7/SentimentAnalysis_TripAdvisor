This place was terrible from the word go. To start the hotel is in such ghetto condition - I was prepared for what i pay for - but this was just simply ridulous! The lady who checked us in was kind enough to stop talking to her co-worker long enough to give us our room key and some serious attitude! After seeing the room, my husband asked me if they rent these rooms by the hour. The continental breakfast was pitiful - and that is being nice. But the finale was the best part of all - checking out! We were again greeted with less than impressive service. We had made 2 calls during our one night in hell (one local call 3 min long and one long distance - 4 min long) we were charged an exorbant $57!!! That was something like $6.50 a minute. And all we got was "we just charge you what our service provider charges us" ---. Then after trying to reason with them and maybe half - they charged us even though we refused to sign the form - WHICH IS ILLEGAL - and received a lovely --- you from the Manager. Yes he actually said that to us - I was floored. The was another manager there from Florida and he was just disgusted. We are following up with this claim - also wot.if (the place we booked through) has taken them off their recommendations list. That is all

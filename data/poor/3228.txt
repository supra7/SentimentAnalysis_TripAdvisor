Encore definitely makes me think Wynn should have closed the show with the first performance. The staff definitely tries to make it a first class experience. They definitely cater to an upper class of business traveler, but it just doesn't make the grade. There were multiple faux pas while we were there. From rude security guards to improper charges for minibar items we didn't take, to being shuffled from one room to another in the early morning after our room becoming 'unusable'. Our first room on the 38th floor was nice and quiet, but after we were stuck on the 23rd floor, we heard the booming beat of the nightclub until the wee hours. Our 2nd room's lock was broken, there was no amenity kit (shampoo, soap.etc) and there were missing rugs. If we were in a best western, we would have been happy, but for Steve Wynn, we were sadly disappointed.

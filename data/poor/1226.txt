Made my reservation last week for a possible trip to New Orleans in 8 months.....only to find this morning that they've already billed me in advance for my stay. I can understand doing this during Mardi Gras or Sugar Bowl, but not for an April weekend. After reviewing my reservation, in the section where it tells the cancellation pollcy....is one line that says they collect the deposit in advance. Needless to say, after reading the other reviews here, I've cancelled this one and will be looking elsewhere!

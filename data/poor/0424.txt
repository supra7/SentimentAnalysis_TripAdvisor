We stayed here only one night, only, thankfully, for new years eve (we were partying in downtown to ring in the new year and my friends from the area live in a far away suburb and it wouldn't be cost effective to get a taxi). What garbage. I know this place is cheap compared to other hotels in the area, but boy, I didn't know how cheap. Honestly - you are better off staying in a hostel if you had to choose. Or maybe sleeping in your car until you are sober enough to drive. The staff were okay...but the quality of the hotel...my god...sleeping in a sleeping bag at the bottom of the space needle would have been better. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. I would not have showered in the bathroom - using the toliet was bad enough. When my friends found this cheap accomodation, I thought to myself, "oh, it's just one night, how bad can it be". I should have saved that money for the car ride home!

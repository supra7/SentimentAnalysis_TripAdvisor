This pension couldnt be in a better location for visiting the Ramblas area of Barcelona by DAY unfortunately when you return to your accomodation at NIGHT you will find you are situated in the dodgiest RED LIGHT AREA and it has a completly different feel. I was astonished to find a hole in the wall at the side of the hotel which is a "bar" with the whole street becoming incredibly LOUD street party style every night. Do not expect to sleep a wink till at least 8am due to the noise then get woke up at 12 by the maid. What was supposed to be a rest for me ended up wearing me out!! This place is more suited to late night party animals than quiet couples wanting a quiet break. However if your idea of soaking up the local culture involves getting oral by a black transvestite hooker this hotel could not be better situated. Enjoy your stay!

We went to Vegas for my daughter's college graduation. We booked her at the Flamingo and ourselves at Harrah's. First impression of the hotel is when you catch the elevator to your room in the Mardi Gras Tower. It was -yucky dirty and dark as though you ducked into a subway entrance. The button for the elevator has a halo of dirty paint around it-when you go into the elevator-it was not vacuumed-. (corners never )-and it was not dusted-so that the wood panelling in the elevator had dust all over it-. Hmm...I started to wonder...if they don't care enough to paint vacuum and dust what is the room like? The bathroom toilet was dirty-your imagination. Right then and there I wanted to call the lobby-but my husband didn't want to make a fuss and went in and cleaned it. The next day I went to the front desk and told them it was dirty and yucky and questioned if the $50 upgrade they had tried to get me to buy at check-in-was newer and cleaner-because I was so creeped out I was willing to pay more to feel better. She said to me that where I currently was staying was -"actually just renovated". She left it at that-no upgrade which I wasn't wrangling for-no option to buy into anything better. ...it was just bad housekeeping and nobody that managed the casino apparently cared or bothered to walk around and check our their hotel. The Flamingo where my daughter stayed-was great. I know both properties are owned by the same people-which is why I really can't understand why the quality and housekeeping can be so lax in one of their proporties and not the other.

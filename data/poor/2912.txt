I come to New York every few weeks on business, and the W has been my backup hotel when my preferred choice (the Intercontinental, a block away) is full. I'm going to look for a new backup hotel. I have stayed here a number of times in the past, and every time I wonder why I come back. Yes, the lobby is very hip, and if you're planning to hang out in the lobby bar, then it's certainly hopping, and that's a plus. But now head up to your room... When you get off the elevator (which itself is incredibly tiny -- an omen), there's one sign pointing the way to your room. But at that point it gets challenging. The floor design is a complete maze, and there are no more signs after that first one. Depending on where your room is, be prepared to wander for a bit. The hallways are very dark, with almost no lighting. The standard room is tiny, and *don't* be persuaded by the reviewers on here who say, "Hey, it's New York, what do you expect?" The answer is that for this price I expect much bigger and better, and I get that at the Intercontinental, Grand Hyatt, Millennium, Sofitel, Helmsley, and others, all within a few blocks of the W. The room literally has no drawers -- not one -- so you're living out of your suitcase whether you like it or not. If you're planning to do any work in the room, you won't be happy. There's a tiny desk, with a very cheap and very uncomfortable chair. If the view is important to you (it's not to me), you had better ask about that at the front desk, since many (most?) of the rooms look out into a small central area that is all ventilation pipes and other "behind the scenes" features. And not in a good way. If you think you're going to be persauded by the hip lobby, the new age music, and the Bliss products in the bathroom, then this hotel will work for you. If you prefer a decent-sized room in a quality hotel, I highly recommend the Intercontinental or any of the others mentioned above.

We arrived just after 7pm to find the hotel locked with no staff in sight. We continually rang the door bell and phoned the number in the window repeatedly. We waited over an hour outside. Eventually a staff member turned up and said the doorbell doesn't work and the phone is too quiet to hear (but no one bothered to check the front door). Once in, it was a serious disappointment, a dirty, smelly hotel that should be called a hostel. It was a very, very unpleasant stay. A shop keeper up the road told us a couple of weeks ago a prostitute had tried to murder a man in one of the rooms. Good area, awful accommodation.

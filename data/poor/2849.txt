This place is my idea of hell. Writhing souls, incessant din, rude staff, dimly lit. When I complained about the lack of light in my room, one of the Satanic underlings said "It's part of our concept." Every place is entitled to their concept, I guess, but Priceline loses a lot of credibility as it keeps trying to foist this dog off on its customers as a 4-star hotel.

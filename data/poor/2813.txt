I stay in NYC 10 nights per year and will not stay at the W New York ever again. The room was not ready at check in (3PM) which I get for a Hampton in but not W. I had to wait for a call (that never came) so just stood in the lobby. The other, bigger issue was a significant party in the room next door that went on until 1AM. The noise was so loud through the adjoined door and walls that we had to call down 3 times starting at 12. Each time, it appeared that nothing happened. At 1 am management finally cleared the room out. Not sure why they did not deal with it to begin with.

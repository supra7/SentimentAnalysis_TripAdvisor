I was staying in this hotel since it was at a walkable distance from Pennsylvania Convention Centre( just opposite). The attitude of the front desk personnel was awful. The breakfast was stale-is it just because it was complimentary? No eggs were served and there was no variety. Of course no restaurant is there in the hotel and food will be served from Chase Lounge, a pub nearby ,if ordered. Though I was staying there for 4 nights, the front desk personnel would not give me 3 hours extra to check out on the last day saying that it was their policy. The hotel also not full at that time either. In the rooms towels will be changed only if asked and no room cleaning was undertaken. God knows why a 50 $ deposit is collected as precautionary measure and the signed bill was not returned when I checked out. Shall I say a permanent goodbye to the Hotel with unpleasant memories of the same?

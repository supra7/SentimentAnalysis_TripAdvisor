we arrived there late in the night and they told us our room was not available and moved us to the Alahambra hotel 50 mt away for the first 2 nights (3 altoghether) At first I was pissed but later when I spent the 3rd night there I was relieved I had spent the first two in a much cleaner, nicer place. at the Lisa hotel the bedsheet had brown yellow stains, the fridge was horribly dirty and there were insects on the floor. lets talk about breakfrast...we woke up went downstairs and it stunk like hell from the kitchen...we decided to avoid it. many people will think it is ok for what one pays (yes we paid as much as in a youth hostel for a double room) but I dont pretend the world only cleanliness.

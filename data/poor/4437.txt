This hotel has BED BUGS!!! Its been awhile since, but I need to let other people know that I was a victim of serious bed bugs. As a result of these bed bug bites, I was miserable for almost 3 weeks with serious itching and swollen red welts which was the most miserable time of my life. And what did the hotel do to mitigate this? I got a lousy buffet ticket to eat dinner and a change of room (2 doors from the bed bug room). We also have pictures of the bites on my legs, arms, face, back, and feet. Imagine you have hundreds of bites on your body and all I got was a dinner.. Do you think that the hotel did their share in compensating me?? I have not started the lawsuit yet and probably decided not to since I am not a sue happy person. Another thing is that one of the security officers asked if I ate one too. Do you think that that was appropriate thing to say to their hotel guests? I did not laugh....Any comments or requests for pictures, let me know. What a birthday party I had!! MY

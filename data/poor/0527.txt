We were shocked at the Friday night clients! We chose this hotel, essestially to make a 4 am airport check-in. (Another draw - we were able to leave our car) We had less than 6 hours to sleep...however, we both barely slept. It was hourly activity in adjacent room and across the hallway. Worst part - shower did not work. (One of us having been a Wildland firefighter - could not budge the faucet to pull, twist or turn on in any fashion) We told clerk and he said we didn't pull correctly. We called manager and she said we would not be compensated in any way for the inconvenience - very matter of fact....I'm wondering if this is an everyday occurance. (We flew out that morning and ended up at our destination with the 'no-shower' look and feel. After our day of flight and days activities - we were relieved to be able to finally take a shower at our new motel! Never, ever will we recommend this hotel - EVER!

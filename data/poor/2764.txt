Upon arrival the room was not ready 1/2 hour later 4:00 it was. Went to room headboard falling of the wall it was held up with double side velcro, bathroom filthy tv did not work, phone did not work just a mess. Went to another room that was the same way. Called Manager and she ROLLED HER EYES WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HER ABOUT THE FILTHY ROOM. Changed to a 3rd room still the same Mold in the shower and the sink. They just caulked over with clear caulk and left the mold. The staff is very rude. Owners should take a good look at the staff as I am not the only one that did not have a nice stay. Would never stay there even if it was the last room in NYC. I do have pics on all of this.

I have stayed at the Felix on three occasions this year. The rooms are small, pretty basic, but clean. My most recent booking was for four nights. On my first night a woman was murdered in the hotel. While this is clearly neither the hotel's fault or responsibility, As a female travelling alone I did expect some communication on the subject from hotel staff. I thought the general manager might leave a note in guests rooms, or the reception staff may have reassured guests when passing through the lobby. But no, the silence on the subject was deafening. Furthermore, on checking out the receptionist did not speak to me except to confirm my debit card. She passed me my bill and said "Here you go." I politely asked her what she meant, and she said "You're done here." And that was it. The service has declined over the course of this year, but the dismissiveness of the staff is now breathtaking. I shan't be staying there again.

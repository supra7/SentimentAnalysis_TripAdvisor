Approximately 2 weeks ago (April 25, 2007), I made a reservation with this hotel for one night, May 19, 2007). I wrote to them with a follow-up request, and in their reply, they advised me my reservation had been cancelled, due to overbooking. I wote to them again, giving my reservation number, but they just wrote back again, just saying "sorry", and making no effort to find me a room in another, nearby hotel. I had rhe emails from Brigeta, Operation Manager. And if I would not have written to them approximately 2 weeks before my stay, I am positive I would have been left to scrambe for a new hotel from the lobby of the Inn at Queen Anne. I find this practice unforgivable, especially in light of having a resevation number guarenteeing my room on May 19, 2007. What is the point of making advance reservations at this hotel if they suddenly cancel it, with little advance notice to me? Sincerely, Greg Scanlon San Francisco

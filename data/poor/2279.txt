This joint is so old it is disgusting, dirty and things are falling apart, not to mention the ventilation system. The rooms are very small and musty smelling. The right hand/cold water faucet on our sink broke off and the shower/tub was filthy...you turned on the water and the bottom became dangerously slippery. Then, we tried to turn on the 60's thermostat and once the fan came on, my husband went into a violent coughing attack because so much dust blew out of the vents and into the room. This place needs to be imploded NOW.

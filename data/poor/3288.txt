Don't take a room on the inside unless you want to be awakened by the garbage trucks at 5am. The air conditioning vent had so much filthy residue trapped inside that it could not possibly pass a health audit. I stayed for 5 nights and by the 5th night I was dreadfully ill. I cannot say for sure that it was due to the room but it is highly suspect. My desk chair was broken and I asked for it to be replaced or fixed. They never did it. I would not advise you to stay here even if you think you have a great price. No breakfast no restaurant except an attached Asian food restaurant. Which was OK by the way for dinner.

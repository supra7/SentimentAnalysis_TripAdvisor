i booked this hotel coming from boston to attend the burins flyers playoff game. i was not looking for anything too special or expensive because i was staying one night and didnt spend much time in the hotel anyways. when i got there i saw it was right next door to a homeless shelter i feel like i should have been notified about this. after i checked in, went up to my room and realized there were NO windows in my room. not happy at all about the price i paid and the service i got. i will never again stay at this hotel!!!

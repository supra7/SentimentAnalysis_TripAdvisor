The place was packed with people. NO parking anywhere near hotel room. Two of our party got very sick at Aunt Chilada's recommended by the hotel. Drunk person banged on our door late in the night. We had to shut the bedroom door to block out the partying noise. At 8:30 am while the two people were still actively sick and we were taking care of their toddler in our adjacent room, housekeeping knocked. I said no thank you. To which the woman said housekeeping again I said NO! And then she proceeded to try to come in with her pass key. 8:30 in the morning?? Check out is noon or something like that. We will NEVER ever go back.

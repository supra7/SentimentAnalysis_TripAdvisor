Horrible, just horrible, I don't know where to begin: - plumbing in my bathroom was never fixed. The shower ran from hot to scalding. And it would randomly fluctuate during your shower from those two temperatures. I have an infant daughter and was deathly afraid of giving her 3rd degree burns during her bath. - Breakfast was OK as long as you showed up before 8 AM. After that it's pretty slim pickings as the food does NOT get replenished. The lady who looks after it from Mon to Thurs is very nice but the other two who do the weekend shift spent most of their time hiding from guests. - the hot tub was out-of-order during the entire week I was there. The pool had a LOT of sand in the bottom of it. Neither were fixed nor cleaned. - anytime you asked the front counter staff for anything (shuttle bus, detergent for the 4th floor laundromat) they didn't know the answer, the bus just left, we just ran out of soap, the plumber just fixed it, etc... It was like listening to people describing UFO sightings. - front counter staff did NOT know the neighbourhood at all. When we asked him where the closest grocer was he had us walk 20 min down to the bad part of Washington Ave. How bad? I was in line between a drug addict and a drunk. We found a grocery store later that day just 4 blocks away. In my case this was one of the last hotels available (I was going to the ESRI conference June 2007) and I will never allow myself nor any of my coworkers to stay here at future conferences. San Diego is a beautiful place to visit. Just don't stay at the Sommerset Suites.

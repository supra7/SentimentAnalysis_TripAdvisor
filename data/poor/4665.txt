Very disappointed in general about the entire place. First, it is a timeshare. That says alot right there... after 3 or 4 calls to the room to "sell us" the place, they quite calling. Twice, the room was not made up, and one night the entire hotel did not have hot water. The rooms are small, and with only one restuarant (which was closed 4 times for private functions) we ate at the surrounding hotels for dinner. The bathroom facilities were "old" to say the least, with wallpaper peeling, missing lamps, and a TV that turned everything "green" and looked like you were looking through a fish tank. Not much I can say, if you enjoy a nice place to stay, with atmosphere inside and out, this is not the place!

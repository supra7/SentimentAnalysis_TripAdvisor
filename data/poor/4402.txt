I just recently stayed at the end of March 2009 and was terrible. I booked two queens with a premium view and got the parking lot. When I asked about this, I was informed that is a premium view, crazy. In the room, there was a table with two chairs and no recliner. Very Motel 6 like. No coffee makers and no cable TV. Got 8 channels. Asked about the coffee makers and was told only the sites have them. Bathtub was dirty as we found hair in it. Service in the casino was poor. I was sitting at machine and asked for a black coffee and was told I was not pplaying as there was no credits in the machine as I just sat down. I advised I was a guest at the hotel and I was forced to show my room key. The C bar bartender was horrible. He did nt how to make a martini nor a shot called snakebit which is Yukon Jack and Lime Juice. Crazy. Too far to walk to anywhere and at night it was creepy out with the cab drivers elling hey u want a date. The casino is rather small and you will get bored of thesame machines. Not even worth to stay for free. I am willing to give me details if wanted you may email me at sweetbug0609@yahoo.com as I do not want others to have experience such a horrible time when you are in Vegas, you are to enjoy your self.

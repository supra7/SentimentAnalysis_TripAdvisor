the azul's try to play as they are 5-star resorts...and they are not!! the hotel truly opened in november and i was expecting great things as the consigner giovanni assured me that the beach was excellent and the pools where magnificent... the beach is the worst I have ever been too. there is no access into the ocean as it is all coral!!!!! we had to walk 400 -500 yards in the sand to get to an area we could get into the water...but the pool side workers would say, "dont bother with the ocean stay in the pool" and the pool was nice but in december the water in the pool was 50 degrees f. it was so cold that when you got out your lips where blue!! they have 2 jacuzzi's in the main pool but have no heat!! there is no heat in any of the pools. accomodations: the rooms where big, and i got the penthouse with roof jacuzzi...again no heat in the jacuzzi, and it runs like a bath tub!! the rooms are not kid friendly with pointed ends, and the master bedroom has a step up to the bathroom. the service is mexico, always amazing as the workers work hard to accommodate and keep there jobs... if you want 5 star, great beach, and warm pools and hot tubes in the winter..stay away!!!

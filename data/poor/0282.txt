A group of us were in Seattle for a conference, and were booked into the Sixth Avenue Inn. I was concerned after I'd read reviews before going there - as it turned out, rightfully so. My room - a queen - was dingy and smelly. I couldn't identify the odor, but it may have been a combination of a former smoking room and, well, I don't know what. The place was also not designed for a business traveler. My laptop computer uses a 3-prong plug. My room had only one 3-prong outlet, nowhere convenient to where I needed to use my computer. Incredibly, the coffee maker, also with a 3-prong outlet, used a hardware store 3-to-2-prong adapter. I strongly suspect that's a violation of every fire code in the US, especially for commercial buildings. While they claim to have internet access, in my room there was no wireless, and the wired version cable was so short it did not reach to either the bed or the table. I never did figure out where one could use it. They've not figured out to put a water proof shower curtain liner inside the shower curtain - instead, they use 2 fabric shower curtains, so if one puts one on the outside and the other on the inside of the tub, after the shower, one was left with a flood in the bathroom. When I was gone during the day and the room was made up, half-filled styrofoam coffee cups and dirty water glasses were left where they were. I don't recall having every stayed in a hotel where I didn't want my feet to touch any floor surface, or my body to touch the bedspread or blanket. It was just grungy. The only upsides: location is good, and staff was very friendly.

the unprofessional and very uncourteous way we were treated by the staff of the Chelsea Savoy hotel in Manhattan.Our arrival went as follows: -We got to the hotel at noon and at first were informed in poor and ill-mannered English- that we had NO reservations. After I showed them a print out, they changed their minds and rudely told us that check in was after 3:00 pm. We were then told to put our 7 pieces of luggage into a cart because there was no one in the hotel who could help us- and to return at 3:00. Upon our return, we were greeted by another person who again very rudely- gave us our keys stating that Our reservation was only for two nights. I again showed him the print out, but he was uninterested saying he would not argue with me on the matter.

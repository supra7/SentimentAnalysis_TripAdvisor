Read this before you go! We stayer a week here, before going for a week to Kauaii. We have 2 children - and hoped the room - ocean view would have been nice. My husband said refugees have nicer rooms than this place. We had noise all night from the market place - and Luau show noise from within the hotel until 3:00 in the morning! Not to mention all the fights we heard down below. It was the noisiest hotel I have ever been in - we heard the people jumping upstairs till late at night, heard the people next door, too! Great...just what you want on a holiday. The pool was very small and crappy...the hot tub was a plastic tub on the tile.The room had dirty stained carpets, the towels that were supposed to be white were beige, pinkish tinted...any colour but white. The furniture in the very small room was old and damaged. Had 2 double beds....way too small. The ocean view was more like a glimpse. Supposedly in a years time they will be renovating the rooms....until then I say don't even think about it - it was horrible.

This is a high rise apartment building with some vacant studios that are 'rented out' & have zero amenities! It's a fraud--in the middle of the lovely Brickell neighborhood. The room was in dire need of a thorough cleaning and overhaul. We slept in our clothes & didn't even take a shower....the bedding wasn't clean, no mattress cover under the sheets! The bathroom had mold and mildew in the shower, a dirty soap dish, a half used roll of toilet paper, no bathmat, hand towels or washcloths-only 2 towels. The few utensils in the "kitchenette" were dirty with dried food residue on them, & no soap or anything to wash them with. I could go on and on. We tried to find another hotel in this area for the night but everything was booked. STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU WANT A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP!!!!

We booked this Hotel through Hostel a hostel booking website at a good price of 90 Euros for 3 nights, however 7 weeks prior to leaving they emailed us to say that they had made a mistake with the prices and since it was Easter they were going to make us pay an extra 130 Euros or they would cancel our booking. We found this totally unfair and have since booked another Hostel at the same price we originally booked for. Hostel looked ok but would not be bothered with this one from they way they have treated us!

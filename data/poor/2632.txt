My family stayed at the Place D'Armes from 09/28/11 to 10/01/11. Our room (212) was up a staircase that led ONLY TO THAT ROOM! No other rooms were accessed via that staircase, and we never saw another guest or hotel employee other than housekeeping come up the stairs. On the morning of 09/30, we returned from breakfast and touring to find the room had already been cleaned. We hung out for a couple of hours, deciding where to eat lunch on the way to a riverboat cruise. We left at around 12:15, and returned at 6pm to find an $800 iPad had been taken from the room. All doors were locked (including those to the balcony). We went through the room (and our luggage) with a fine toothed comb before contacting the front desk. The front desk worked with us to contact the police, and we filed a report on the spot. We were told by the front desk that key logs for the electronic doors existed, but were accessible only to management, who would not be in until Monday (this was Friday night). We were assured MANY times that this had 'never happened here before!'. Needless to say, that evening was ruined. My wife didn't even want to leave the room to eat dinner, and we were very ready to check out the next morning. A week later, we have still heard nothing from the hotel management about the incident or what was found via the key logs. You'd think that if this was such a rare occurrence, management would be a little more concerned. This was not the first time we have stayed at the Place D'Armes, but it will be the last. We love the hotel, but this was atrocious customer service during an already painful incident.

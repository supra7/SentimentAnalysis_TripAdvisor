When you save the entire year to go to Hawaii you expect to get something out of it. We have stayed at Outrigger properties before on Kauai so we were extremely dissapointed when we went home. The decor was outdated in the room. The main pool above the parking garage was just a cement pond with water with absolutely no Hawaiian charms at all. In a previous post I agree with the person who said the bathrooms were dark and old. We stayed in G building. On the 3rd night there I heard rumbling in our kitchen. Somebody had eaten thru a plastic bag of food. Well when we mentioned that there was a 3rd party in our room and by the bite marks it was very large they said they couldn't move us for a day and not even a sense of "we are sorry." When they did get us a new room they wouldn't even help us move to K building which wasn't close. I even got some snide comments from the staff "Oh you are the one with the rodent" and then a chuckle. The manager admitted to me that they knew of a problem in Building G that is why they had an exterminator there the day I found our roommate. They offered to move us to building H but I refused considering it was fumigate the first 2 days of our stay. We have been to Hawaii 3 times in 6 years and this was the worst place we stayed at by far.

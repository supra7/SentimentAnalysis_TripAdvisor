We wanted to stay in Town for night and thought this would be a nice historical hotel on the water. For the money we paid for this place any Hotel6 would be a better choice. They should tear this dump down and rebuild it. Theres no elevator and all the rooms are on the 2nd floor. No bellboy either, pray you don't have back problems. The poll is Ice cold and dirty. The rooms are remodeled and clean but I think Motel6 rooms are much nicer. If this place was about $40/night it would be ok. But they charge Hyatt rates for this dump. The only plus is restaurant has decent food next door. Also found the staff to be friendly. Breakfast is not included with the room. The walls are paper thin and you can hear evryone in the halls and people next door. The plumbing in the shower was not draining quickly. I'm assuming it's the original plumbing from the 1900's. Look for something else in this price range, theres many other options in the area as this place will disspoint the most common person.

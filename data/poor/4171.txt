We stayed at Canterbury Hotel on the first weekend of Superbowl activities. We arrived and the parking lot guy was awesome. We walked into the the hotel and found it to be exactly the hotel we love. We are from New Orleans and actually eek out these type of quaint charming hotels. Now, the bad. We are waiting to check and were not greeted with a bit of an poor attitude. The owner's wife was telling everyone about the concierge floor and inviting guests to come inspect. We love concierge floors and we always pay the extra rate to be on the concierge floor; had we known this was an option we would have doled out the extra 200 or 300 bucks. When we arrived in our updated room, which looked awesome, charming and exactly what we look for in a hotel, the TV did not work. We called down and they said we would have it fixed(no problem there). Since we did not know about concierge except for a guest that told us later that the owner's wife was showing it off to everyone, except us , we went to St Elmo's for dinner. When we arrived back at the room around 10pm we were going to watch TV, relax and order late night room service. Much to our surprise the TV did not work. We called down they moved us to a handicap room where the TV worked, but offered us nothing in return for our inconvenience Not even an offer to help move our bags etc. We would have been happy with literally in small token- ie a 10 dollar bar voucher. The long and the short, the hotel looks great but lacked the hospitality we are accustomed too, when paying for a hotel room. We were impressed that the parking attendant remembered our names. Something that simple goes a long way.

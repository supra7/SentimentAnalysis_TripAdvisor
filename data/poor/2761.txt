where do I start. Moved to this hotel from the amazing Distrikt hotel due to having our flight cancelled when hurricane irene hit and the distrikt being fully booked...it looked nice on the website and wasnt cheap either. We got there at 3 and our room wasnr ready..even though check in is at 3. The staff werent helpful at all and the girls behind the reception desk were more concerned about where they'd be partying tonight than the fact they had guests waiting in the lobby for their room to be ready. When we eventually got to the room...it was vile. the hallway leading up to the room looked dirty and had an awful smell so I knew we werent in for much... but the room STANK i dont even know what of it just had the most disgusting smell. It backed straight onto a building and there was no natural light in the room..as well as this the bathroom was dirty. the bright red bed linen also made it seem brothel like. we didnt even have a remote for our tv..........literally the worst value hotel ive ever stayed in.

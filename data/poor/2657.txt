I stayed at the Place d'Armes for the July 4th holiday and it was very disappointing. The room was not the type of room we booked and the front desk was very non-chalant about it and would not change it. Parking is completely unsecure (your car is left with the windows down and key in ignition). The room we stayed in was not clean and had a mosquito problem--something I've not seen in a domestic hotel ever before. They use unfitted sheets that come undone and tangle throughout the night. In consideration of the rate, there are plenty of hotels in the quarter within $20-$40 of this hotel where you'd be much better served.

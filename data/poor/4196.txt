I stayed at this hotel for business in late October. Before I arrived, I called to ask what transportation options were from BWI. My call was transferred and dropped several times by the hotel before I spoke to a representative, who seemed incredulous that I did not possess deep knowledge of Baltimore's transportation options. Short story: I told her I was arriving at BWI after 9pm on a Sunday, and she said I should take the light rail. Which stops running at 9pm on Sunday. Terrible sign, and things got worse from there! The front desk staff was rude. There was a pair of underwear in my room when I arrived, and the staff seemed to think this wasn't a problem of any kind ("Did you want us to send someone up to retrieve the underwear?"). I spent $1000 to stay here for several nights and found the whole stay deeply impersonal and, really, unkind. The room was average. One major pro: the fitness room has an unbelievable view into Camden Yards.

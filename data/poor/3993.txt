Upon arriving in the circular courtyard for valet service. The wait was long. My wife unloaded the luggage and began to make her way to the door (she tired of sitting the in the car.) The valet approached her as she neared the door and in a rather rude tone, asked her if she was checking in. Thought it rather obvious suitcases in tow, heading for the door and she had just exited the car in line for valet service. Finally the valet came for the car, there was no assistance with baggage, the door, etc. My wife then noted that as we were heading through the door our car had been left running with the drivers door wide open and no valet near it at all. I was traveling with sensitive work items and spoke to the valet that the car was to be parked and locked, not left open and running with no one near by. (The street with people is only a glance away and anyone could have entered, hopped in and left with the car.) We paid the additional fee for an upgraded room (meaning step out balcony). We had requested it overlook F.H. however we were placed on the side that overlooked the North End. Okay, we could deal with that, but.... and this is the big but, directly below our step out was what appeared to be a shanty town (a farmers market apparently in disquise.) It did however look like a shanty town, trash from the fruit/vegetables all over, torn tarps, ropes and pieces of plywood abound. Not to the mention the individuals who decided to setup another "spot" at one in the morning banging and clanking around. The worst part of this however was the rats that we could see darting in and out. Yes I said RATS! Absolutely disgusting. The service was non-existant at this hotel, the valet service was rude, a doorman was no where to be found, nor was a bellhop to assist with the bags. A complete disappointment.

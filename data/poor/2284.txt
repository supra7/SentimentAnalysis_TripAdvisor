I stayed at this Marriott when it was opened maybe 12 years ago and it is exactly the same today as it was then.It has never been re-painted, touched up, or re- newed in any way. It is the same today as it was then. The same old tv's the same old furniture and the same old carpet. The fitness room is an antique and the tread mills the old ones with the crowns in the miiddle they are truly dangerous. The property is a disgrace and Marriott should be ashamed to have their name on it.

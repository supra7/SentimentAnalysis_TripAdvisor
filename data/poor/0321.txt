We travelled to Seattle for a weekend getaway and our first night was at the Edgewater and our 2nd night was at the Hotel Sierra in Bellevue. We had a Gift Certificate for a Waterside Room at the Edgewater but none were available the night we stayed so rather than the hotel upgrading us, they put us in a Deluxe City Side room which we did not argue with. It was far from Deluxe. Upon checking in, my husband was greeted with a curt "last name on the reservation?" No eye contact and no "Hello, how are you doing tonight?" At 4:30 a.m., we were awoken by the beeping sound of some big truck backing up into some part of the building, then the garbage truck came to do its pickup, then the train came whistling by. Then we thought someone was using our toilet but we figured out it was the loud plumbing rolling through the pipes in the walls when someone in other parts of the hotel flushed their toilets. The halls had a musky smell and the decor, well, we don't really know what to call it. Our 2nd night was with the Hotel Sierra in Bellevue which was far superior to The Edgwater. Hotel Sierra has no view of the water but it has friendly staff and fine customer service. Our stay over the weekend at the Edgewater was our last and we will now be staying with Hotel Sierra in Bellevue.

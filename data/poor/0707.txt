I have not been in prison. This has to be what it is like. You walk in the entrance and all you see is concrete. The chairs by the pool all 6 of them are in bad shape. The vendong machines all say out of order. This hotel should be too. I hate for anyone to go out of business nut this is on the way. We are the only people here. That alone is scary. Treasure Island what a joke. Prison Island is more like it.

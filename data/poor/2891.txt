I'm a business traveler and have years of hotel experience but this takes the cake. The W has to be the most horrible hotel I've stayed in in years. Staryed for 3 nights...first room had torn wallpaper, hair on the floors and "short hairs" on the Bliss products and pictures ripped form the wall with holes showing. Second room not much better with a barking dog next door...for 2 nights...and managemant said they could do nothing about it. Unresponsive management with an attitude. Stay away!

I was OK with the smell in the lobby, the street people outside, the shoddy renovations. I was OK with the contempt when I asked the desk who I should call for a food delivery late at night. I was OK when the deliveryman brought a prostiute with him...laughed that off as local flare and declined. HOWEVER I am not ok with the bedbug nightmare I am enduring 24 hrs after staying in this dump. Saw a spot or bug on the sheets and didn't think much of it...until later when the bites started itching, blistering, and oozing puss. Try to find a different place. We stayed at the Staybridge Suites earlier in the week, and it was fine. Great even, and with a much better neighborhood.

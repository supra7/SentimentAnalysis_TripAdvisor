If you are a business woman or man, well-traveled and have client service standards or any standards of being respected at all, do not go to Encore or the Wynn hotels. These are not the place for you. My husband and I, business owners and professional were asked to give up our table in front of the piano at Encore lounge for four 20 somethings that looked like Brittany Spears little sister and gang (not her just looked like her, you get the point). My husband and I were shocked that the hostess had the nerve to ask us and be so rude to us. We are twice hers and the coveters of our table age. The other four tops in the lounge were not good enough for the four young 20 s/gs. So ask us to move for them, I still cannot believe it. Another clincher...we reported it to management and they could care less. I even spoke to the top management (a woman) and she had n/g to say. It is obviously their training from the top down that puts that kind of rudeness into their hotel and makes it acceptable. Imagine Elaine and Steve Wynn being asked to give up their table to four any one of any age, doubt that lounge would be in business after that. Their double standards on how they should be treated and how their hotel treats other business men/women (anyone for that matter) are enough for me to never return to any of their hotels.

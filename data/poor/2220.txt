After a long drive in terrible weather we checked into this hotel very late. We were very specific about our needs as my husband is handicapped. When we checked in we were told that there was a charge for towels, wi-fi and parking, an added expense that we were not informed about. The room was disgusting! Urine and feces on the toilet. Dirty bathtub. Carpet was gross. Pictures had been torn off of the wall with holes left. The frig had rusted out on the bottom and did not work. I could not keep my husbands insulin cold. One of the bedspreads had blood underneath it and they smelled so bad that I had to take them off of the bed. We were very concerned about the cleanliness of the beds. When I reported these things and more to the management they were very apologetic, but did nothing about it. The next morning the General manager approached me and offered me another room. I declined as the hotel did not meet my husbands handicapped needs. He then told me that they would not charge us for the night and gave me his direct number. He has not returned my calls and I was charged for the night. I would never stay at this flithy, shabby place again.

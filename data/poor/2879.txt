Stayed there on business for 2 nights, will never return. The lobby is a nightclub, couldn't even here the woman who was checking me in. Got a room on the 16th floor, it was a "cozy, queen" that was a claustrophobic cave. Lighting was terrible, don't plan on getting any work done. It is impossible to get from the entrance of the room to the bathroom without bumping into the TV. And they charged my for 3 nights eventhough I only stayed 2 -business plans changed at the last minute. Their cancellation policy "The time for canceling without penalty has passed. If you cancel, the forfeiture amount will be a 1 night penalty. If you cancel after 04:00PM hotel time [3 days prior to check-in date] , the forfeiture amount will be 100.00 percent. There may be additional applicable charges and taxes." The only thing that I enjoyed about this hotel was the bath products.

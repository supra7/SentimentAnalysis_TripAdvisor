My stay at the Homestead suite was anything but pleasant. The rooms were very dirty and the hotel staff and service was horrible. At one point during my stay there was no toilet paper you had to supply your own. One morning i woke up to the biggest TN cockroach sitting on my kitchen sink. After advising the staff of this they were not shocked they advised me it was a very common thing with being on the first floor. But the final straw was when my truck window was busted out during daylight while i was at work. My truck was also backed into. They advised me sorry for your inconvience and they could not do anything about the matter.

Im gonna run through this terrible hotel step by step.First off we were told when booking that there was FREE parking in a lot right ext to the hotel, let the lies begin.. Parking was close to TWO blocks away & cost $25, and the employee working in the lot spoke next to NO english! When we finally got inside the hotel we were rudely treated by the front desk clerk. The computer took over 5 minutes to even pull up pur reservation, and when we asked for a late checkout the next day we were told something of the effect " I can only give out 2, I'm only allowed to give out 2"! My boyfriend and I were appauled by the way she spoke to us, and after some 'sucking up' she agreed to give us the hotels version of a 'late check-out' of 12pm. When we finally got to the room, it was small, dark and to say the least uninviting. There was no fridge, only 2 towels that were half the size of a normal bath towel. Later that night we learned that the shower didnt drain, so after a quick 5 minute shower, and some puddle splashing in the 6 inches of water at my feet I quickly dried off with the 'hand towel'. The woman in the room next to ours was coughing from 6pm to about 1am, and we were every minute of it. The walls were so thin we both thought at one point she was in our bathroom! Needless to say this hotel was subpar, the location was alright, but for next time we both agreed we would rather spend the extra money and stay in a reliable hotel, not some dump! Dont stay in the hotel, you will be very very unhappy.

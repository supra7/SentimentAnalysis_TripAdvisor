Greatly overrated, in my view. Front desk and support staff were great and the location is wonderful, but the facility is old and objectionable. I stayed here twice (frequent business traveler to San Diego) to be fair to the facility. On the first visit, there was a strong offensive musty odor in my quarters. Because I used it only as a sleeping room, I remained for several days. On arriving home, I discovered that all my clothing and luggage smelled moldy. Further, there are many electrical safety issues (I'm a firefighter). Code-violating extension cords under carpets, jury-rigged wiring tucked inappropriately behind moldings, electrical wiring run into walls without conduit, overloaded receptacles, all contributed to give me the heebie-jeebies regarding my safety while there. On my second stay, I found the same kitschy decor which has bothered some other reviewers, but I also found yet another unit with a strong objectionble odor of mold. This unit had evidence of water intrusion from leaks in roof (it's a flat roof with parapet walls, about one hundred years old, so no surprise). When I complained about the odor, the desk clerk acknowledged that they receive many complaints on this from throughout the buildings comprising the Inn. The owner was tight-lipped and not happy, but agreed fairly quickly to refund my prepaid lodging charges for what was to have been a five-day visit. I simply cannot recommend this lodging to anyone, but especially for those with allergies to mold or chronic respiratory diseases, this will be a nightmare.

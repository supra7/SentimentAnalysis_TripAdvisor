I said everything in the title...it' s the worst hotel I've ever seen (and I've travelled a lot). With an incredibly tiny bathroom, the first room we had was also incredibily dirty (we preferred to sleep with our jackets instead of the quilt...) and at the fifth floor (without lift). We asked for another one, and we had another not so clean room, but a little larger, on the second floor. The people at the reception was also quite arrogant (at the beginning he didn't want to carry our luggage from the first room to the second because there wasn't the lift and it was too difficult for him...and for us?!?) and asked us 2 pounds to hold our luggage after the check-out for 4 hours.

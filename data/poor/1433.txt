Hello there, I live in Barcelona and go out to eat a lot, I happened to visit the restaurant in the ground floor of the Barcelo raval and it was the most horrifying food experience I've had in years. Of the 5 dishes we ordered non of them were correct! Not even the maitre knew what the dishes had (a real danger if you have any allergy) and we had a couple of special request that of course weren't met. Besides the food no waiter or manager was available and in the last dish I had to stand up and go almost to the kitchen because was NO ONE around. If you are in the are don't waste your money, because you are going to have better attention and better food in any of the kebab places around!

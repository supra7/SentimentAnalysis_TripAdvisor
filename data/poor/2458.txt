Had 2 delux ocean view rooms for 9 days. The good -bell and valet staff, they were excellent spa was good, workout room nice and the grounds beautiful. Now the bad - front desk slow, rude and even after complaints would not get manager to speak with numerous upset customers. Rooms very dirty, small, scuff marks, slow drains, bad beds,screens worn and broken, carpet dirty, bathrooms ugly and old, wait staff slow and rude and the pool attendants were not friendly. I went to they Hyatt in Nov had 2 ocean front rooms and it is not even close, the Hyatt wins hands down in almost every category. Value for your money at Westin Maui is horrible, I am sorry to say. It was so very disappointing, Westin should be embarrassed. It was so bad it moved me to purchase at Marriott's Ocean Club so the next time in Maui I could count on a nice size room with modern, clean facilities and friendly staff or at least a management team that cared....

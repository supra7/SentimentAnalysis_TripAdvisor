Within a half mile of this overrated, and overpriced hotel, are such staples in luxury hospitality as the Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, and Viceroy. For the price that you pay at the Epic, you might as well stay at the Hyatt Downtown across the street. The hotel touts itself beyond its actual deliverance of service. First off, upon arrival, there was an army of valet attendants and bellboys, all of whom seemed less than pleased that they were being paid to stand around and assist guests to the check -in counter, where two clueless girls behind the front desk couldn't offer suggestions to local restaurants. Additionally, they were getting argumentative with a family whose room keys were not working. Room Service arrived forty-five minutes after ordering. It was cold and the order wasn't accurate. I called to have it picked up, because I refused to pay for it. But I might as well have had eaten that cold cheeseburger than go down to Area 31, where the service was terrible start to finish, the food came cold and a smaller portion than what I was expecting, especially considering the price, and there was not a manager to be seen to complain to. No one ever came to check in on how I WASN'T enjoying my meal. The stay didn't get better from there. It seemed as though the hotel was running on a skeleton crew, with the exception of valet, and that no one was in charge of the staff who barely seemed competent in their jobs.

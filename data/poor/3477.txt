I just stayed at this hotel 2/10/2011, & 2/11/2011. I awoke my second nigh itching horribly bad. This is when I Googled this hotel name and the words bed bugs. I found a few recent complaints regarding bed bug infestations just Nov 2010. I called an outside creditable source to come in and investigate my room, due to the management response to other customer complaints on this very site, and sure enough, I had bed bugs in my box spring. Definitely recommend not staying at this hotel ever. This was my first time visiting New York. What a horrible stressful experience. So glad to be home..

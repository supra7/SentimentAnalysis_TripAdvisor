Not so great. The Hotel Marseilles' photos on the Web site were very misleading, as many have said. The odor was awful, kind of musty and moldy. Rooms were very small and cleanliness was an issue. The window of one of our rooms was boarded up and the staff goofed on our reservations and said there was only one room booked, even though we had booked two and verified three days before that the rooms were still available. We ended up moving to another hotel, and the only great thing about Marseilles was a supervisor who took away the charge for cancelling on the same day as check-in because he understood our situation.

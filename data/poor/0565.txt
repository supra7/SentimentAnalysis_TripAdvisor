After 1 night, I had to leave! I was booked for 4 nights here, and after my first night's experience, I had to leave. The website photos are very missleading. this place is located in an industrial area, with no restuaurants, lounges,or even convenience stores within 5 miles. The front desk staff was very inadequate, and slow. It took 45 mins to check in. The pool was closed, the restuaurant was closed,and the parking lot had razor wire around it. It reminded me of a prison Four miles away and $20.00 more, I found a real nice motel.

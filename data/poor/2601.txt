When we arrived at 7pm our room was not ready and we were told by the front desk "you all are not the only ones, you should see the wait list", well she sure was telling the truth, the lobby was full of guests all waiting for their rooms to be ready. The reason being given was there was "a lot of late check outs". One would imagine a hotel that charges as much as the InterContinental could afford to hire a staff to keep up with basic housekeeping. Speaking of housekeeping, they did not enter our room for 2 days in a row, when we called Guest Services to inform them of this we got major attitude-"you must of had the do not disturb sign up" and were informed that there was no evening housekeeping shift so we were given towels and DIY instructions. The room was small, in need of updating(there was a big rip in the carpet which they attempted to cover with a table, I am not positive but it sure looked like something I donated to Good Will about a decade ago) and begs for a dresser. We visit New Orleans all the time and this hotel was both the most expensive and the worst one we have ever stayed at. There are so many better hotels in New Orleans for about half the cost of the InterContinental

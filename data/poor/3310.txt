This hotel was awful.. from the staff to the rooms... let me start off by saying that we had to move to 3..yes I repeat 3 different rooms.. why you ask.. well let me tell you.. the first room we didnt get any sleep in because the ac kept making a very loud rattling noise all night and we were sweating by the end of the night.. ends up that the ac was busted..so we requested a room change.. it took a while but we got another room.. packed all our stuff back up and headed there only to find out they gave us the wrong room key.. so we had to go back downstairs.. so they gave us a different room.. well the air still rattled and to make it worse the tv didnt work.. when the engineer came out he told us that the room they gave us was a downgraded room and that they only give those rooms to "free guest".. so we packed up our stuff again and moved to another room.. after all this we asked for a price adjustment on our stay.. the least that they could do.. but noooooo they offered us a free continental breakfast.. yes the free breakfast that you usually get at other hotels they charge 7.99 here.. so we got compensated with a continental breakfast.. then they couldnt get that right because they didnt have us on the "free breakfast list" I had enough.. I went to the front desk and ask for a manager. When I didnt think things could get worse said that there was no manager on duty and sent a chef from the continental breakfast over to talk with me.. he said he was in charge.. are you serious??.. they wouldnt call the manager or offer any type of an apology.. it was the worst hotel experience ever.. would never ever stay at a Red Lion Hotel or anything associated with them..

Very Disappointed. Original room booked was not available 30 minutes after check in time. We upgraded our room at additional cost and was given a room right over the freeway and next to roof air conditioning compressors. No way to sleep. People walked in to our room after management assigned the same room to another party. Room had hint of cigarettes even though it was stated as non-smoking. We will never return to this hotel again.

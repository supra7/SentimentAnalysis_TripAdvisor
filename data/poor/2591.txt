Our flight was canceled and so we had to book a one night hotel stay. We were very excited when we saw the entrance. It looked elegant and modern. That's about as much modern as we would get. The check in was quick and the attendant was chatty and pleasant. We were placed in room 725. When we exited the elevator which was dark and dreary, the first thing that hit us was the stale smell of old carpet. It smelled strongly of feet, but we brushed this aside and continued to our room. When we entered our hearts sank. There was debris on the floor from past guests, there were water stains on the bathroom counters, the furniture was worn and scraped in many areas. After finding an empty coca cola bottle behind the night stand, and hair on the pillows AND sheets, we were too disgusted to stay any longer. We called downstairs and requested a new room to which they quickly sent a worker to switch us out to. The front desk called it the deluxe room. I think they called it this simply because it had a balcony? In reality it was just as bad if not worse than the first room! There is peeling wallpaper by the air vent which you can see mold underneath, more debris on the worn out urine smelling carpet, and we just found almonds on the floor from another previous guest! I sit here in this very room writing this review because I couldn't wait to get home to do so. I was considering before having my guests stay here during my bachelorette party but after staying here I've changed my mind. There is no way that this is a 4 star hotel, I've seen lesser star rooms much cleaner, and there's no way that this hotel has housekeeping.

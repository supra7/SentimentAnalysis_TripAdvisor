The service offered by this hotel was utterly despicable. The room appeared to be clean upon checked-in. However, during the first 15 minutes I had opened the window. It was evident that there were numerous spiders lurking outside of the window. There was one spider that was substantially larger than the rest and had successfully created a web that covered the entire window. I had tried to remove the spider myself, but I was unable to do so. I had contacted the staff at the front desk; they had verified that someone would come within 15 minutes of my complaint to resolve this. I was checked-in for 2 nights, no one came to check on the room nor did the spiders move. On the second day, I noticed that there were dead spiders and bugs both in the room as well as in the bathroom. I had also left the indication sign on the door so that the housekeepers can clean the room. I came back to the room that evening, it was evident that the bed was remade using the same sheets, the same towels were folded and replaced on the racks and there was no soap replaced in the washroom. I truly believe that this service is unacceptable, whereby the maintenance is unhygienic and the front line staff/ overall hotel management leaves complaints unresolved. Ultimately, I would not recommend this hotel under any circumstance.

Me and my husband decided to stay at the h10 roma citta for our first visit to Rome which was our last stop after travelling Europe for 2 months. The hotel itself is a standard modern buisness-like hotel. The room was very small but comfortable and clean.We did have trouble sleeping as the rooms are not sound-proofed very well, as we could hear the couple in the room next to us being''intamate''.They have a rooftop pool and gym which was quite good and a good selection of food for breakfast. This would have been a good stay, if it wasn't for the extremely rude staff. We are a young Australian couple and we are very polite to people and always say thankyou and please with a smile on our face.But every time we asked a question, directions,bus times, ect. We were given a short answer followed by a up and down stare. Even when we would come home from dinner and would walk in to the lobby we were greeted with not a friendly hello or even chow but a rude stare and it was mainly female staff. This is such a horrible way to act towards guests and made me feel uncomfortable. I also found that my italian is not the best and being a hotel speaking english would be ok, there was lots of Aussies,Americans and british guests there too. But i always got a confused look when i started to speak....i really don't know where this attitude comes from. This is a real shame...and by the looks of some other reviews they are stating the same thing. So maybe it's time to be friendly when working in the hospitality industry....it's your job!!!!!!!And one last thing the location is not convienient at all...way too far and the hotel bus stops at 5pm, so don't think about catching it for dinner. I would not come back again.

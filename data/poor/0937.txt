their website makes you think you are staying right by the water but unfortunately the beach area they show is the size of a small backyard and there is absolutely no privacy and not way to get to the water. Everytime we wanted to go to a beach we had to get in our car and drive there. The 4 pools are very small. Thie place is not worth the price. If i am going to pay $450-$500 per night i want to be able to walk out and go to the beach! also, my idea of Key West is not to stay next to the Home Depot. there are so many other nice places to stay, don't bother with this one. Also, there are no places to park. we ended up having to park in the Walgreens parking lot next door.

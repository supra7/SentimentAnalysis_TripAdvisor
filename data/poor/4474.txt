I had to attend an emergency meeting in las vegas on saturday and every hotel was sold out or ridiciously expensive so i decided on motel 6 tropicana next to the mgm grand and hooters. WOW stupid decision... If you like the smell of marijuana and smoke you will love this place. I was so grossed out by this place, I understand motel 6 is a value chain and your going to get a basic room with no frills...When I got there I went to check in and they lost my reservation for a newly renovated room, so they gave me an older room which was a smoking room. I accepted it because every other hotel was either sold out or about 350 a night (yes even the Excalibur and the Sahara). Upon walking to the room which what seems 2 miles away I was greeted by 2 men smoking some marijuana and making obscene gestures toward people walking by, finally at the room I walked in and the smell of smoke overcame you. I walked in and the beds had smoke holes all over the comforters, the TV didnt work, the floor looked like it havent been vacuumed in months, wow the list goes on and on... STAY AWAY STAY AWAY!!!!! Never again will I stay here.

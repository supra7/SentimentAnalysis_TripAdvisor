Stayed 2 nights at Sedona Suites. Room was completely filthy. Carpet heavily soiled. We forced everyone to wear shoes at all times. No sitting/playing on floor. Counter tops with rings left from drinks. They easily wiped away with wet wash cloth (proof that no attempt to clean) Worst of all were the numerous hairs in the bathroom, mostly in the shower! A pair of shoes left under one of the beds and a coconut bra in a drawer. We stay approx 30 nights in hotels/etc per year. This was the second dirtiest room we have ever been assigned. Arrived a little late and the parking lot was teaming with unsavory characters. Had a 7 week old and two other children ready to get out of the car (drive from Dana Point, CA) so did not feel worth looking for other accomodations. Also 8 year old turned 9 during stay and was excited about water park. To be fair, water park was clean and grounds were well maintained. Rustler's rooste provided a nice birthday dinner. Birthday cake made on site was also very nice. Overall a terrible room with a few nice amenities but safety was also sketchy. (Left early to avoid heat and would never pack vehicle the night before!) Would NEVER stay here again, look at 2 area Hilton's. Kudos to web designer for the 'resort'. Made it look great, don't be fooled! Did not complain while on site, only spent about 36 hours in the filth and both Hilton's were booked.

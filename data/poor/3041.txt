My family and I purchased 2 Living Social deals for The Arizona Grand. Included in the deal was a night stay, 2 free breakfasts at the Lobby Grill, the $30 resort fee, and $50 voucher towards any service at the spa. However, what they left out of the "fine print" on living social was that the $50 credit towards the spa can only be used on massage and facial type of services. The least expensive service in that area is $95. They also do not allow you to use both vouchers at once. Since I had purchased 2 deals to extend my stay to 2 nights, I had 2 $50 vouchers. I was only allowed to use 1 per day.They wont allow you to use the Living Social voucher on manicures, pedicures, etc. Therefore, if you use the vouchers you are forced to purchase a $95 service. Which your voucher can be applied to. They also claimed that you were getting 2 free meals at breakfast. They are actually giving you $23.50 towards your breakfast. The average cost of a breakfast plate is $16. The water park is a joke. It was over crowded and boring. When we arrived at the waterpark, we walked around the water park for 45 minutes never to find a single chair to place our belongings. It was impossible to get a tube to ride the lazy river as well. The resort was alot older than I expected. Apparently its the old Point at South Mountain. Even though our $30/night resort fee was included in the deal, I am terribly disappointed that they even charge this fee. Apparently, its an automatic fee charge per night to get into the water park and to receive the so called "complimentary" newspaper and in room coffee. So, technically their room rates are $30 higher than they indicate. No free wifi either! $14.95/day. And on our second night our ac was not keeping our room cool. With highs of 110 that weekend, it sucked! All in all, this staycation was a serious disappointment! We will not stay here again!

I stayed in this hotel on July 31, 2004. This hotel has the creakiest floors. Unless you stay on the top floor, you will not get a minute of sleep. Earplugs help a little bit. Walking from the bed to the bathroom causes a lot of creaking which certainly disturbs the people below. The location is pretty dumpy -- all you will see is a brick wall out your window.

First off - this Hotel is not remotely located near to anything of interest to the traveller except 6th-Floor Museum. That maybe makes it a Hotel that trades on the Kennedy assassination as a tourist/traveller feature, which tourists/travellers maybe need to consider,. We checked in on Oct 11th '08, having booked this 3-nite stay as a highlight of our 12 night trip to Texas (in my own mind!). The room was hopeless. There was 3 of us (Mum/Dad/Daughter ... all adults, as indicated on e-mail booking, and phone call) - the 2 beds were poor (comfort-wise) the sheets were marked on one bed (looked as though someone had stepped on them in the laundry!) and the blanket on the other bed had a brown stain on it (not that! - would likely have been bleach), the ironing board and iron WERE filthy, and the shower gel container was half-full (why bother at all, we wondered - if you're gonna do it, then do it?). Anyway, a grumble to Reception got us another room - more space, but same crumby kind of beds. Throughout our stay, the staff were fantastic - valet, reception, bistro, rodeo grill, ... all great. We had the feeling that they were lions who were being led by donkeys !!!

We could not get anything at all below $250 a day the week of valentines and we were booking on the fly - that's how we wound up in this 'motel'. guess why it was available? read on.... one wing is supposed to be newer, but we got an old 'barrack' - 2 story long corridor, hallways open to outside. the smell was insecticide horrid - i tried not to breathe getting to my room. the whole week totally avoided eating there or using the pool (tiny) or the beach (riptides, warnings posted at all time, steeply receeding bank - hard to climb out). hotel is u shaped around a grassy area with tiny old pool with a few lounge chairs - cannot see the beach at all! very outdated everything - tiny tiny breakfast nook with very poor choices. mostly really old folks. we went to sheraton for breakfast all week and for dinner to whalers village - very crowded, hard to get in to eat without reservation, mediocre food. the other hotels' restaurants around the beach are good (and expensive), but you have to book in advance. best driving experience - going to lahaina and back everyday (great restaurants there - io my favourite - and supermarket). best local activity: walking the very narrow boardwalk back and forth, going to other hotels. warning: mosquitoes even during the day! biting while you eat in whalers village! on a hot sunny day? yes!. around sheraton - especially bad, especially at sunset. bring bug spray! beach very disappointing - i did not even dip once! in front of sheraton there is a shallower crescent shaped stretch, stuffed with little kids, of course. if you want to see the water (nothing pretty, sunsets very average) and just sit on the beach - will have to rent an old wooden lounger for $15? a day?? not even a bench in sight anywhere! passing by , we perched for a few min on the lounger and were asked to pay or leave....

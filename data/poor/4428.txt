My two girlfriends and I stayed there for 2 nights. After waiting in line for a long time at the counter, we finally gor our non-smoking room that we requested and reconfirmed with the hotel clerck. When we opened the door of our room, we could definitly smell the smoke...disgusting. It was 2:00 am and were very tired so me got ready for bed anyway, to discover that the sink in the bathroom wasn't draining properly. The shower drain was also slow to drain and the toilet made a super loud noise when flushed. We called the front desk to request a new room and told us to call back in the afternoon the next day. When we went to the front desk to request the new room their key system was down and they couldn't issue a key!! So we stayed in that stinky room for the last night and moved to the excalibur the next day. The bathroom was very small with the toilet and shower in a seperate room (poor lighting, every time you open the light it flashed like a disco ball) and a separate sink with counter next to the toilet. The first morning there, we got woken up by a big noise on our window like someone was trying to break in. Being 3 girls, we got scared and jumped off our bed to discover that the window cleaning guy was doing is job at 6:45 am and was going down the floors with his ropes and big suction cups clinging to our window!!! Oh! and the electric outlet next to sink wasn't working....I will not stay there again, it is also very far from the central part of the strip where the action and beautiful hotels are. The stratosphere is located in a poor part of the strip, lots of itinerants and garbage...

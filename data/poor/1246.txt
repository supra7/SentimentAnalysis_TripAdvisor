terrible place but good location though. - this is the only advantage for this hotel if you are museum-lovers... better to pay with your cash; you don't wanna use your credit card here. they might take your money from your credit card while you didn't even noticed. this scary thing really happend to me. i found unknown transaction and that was went through by this hotel. they don't even have full service responsibility on their own mistake. i feel like too scary to use my credit card in Amsterdam now. if you still want to go to this place.... well, then it's up to you. but better watch out what they are doing with your credit card !!!! keep track your all transcations !!! -i didn't get my money back yet =( make sure that you have strong legs with well trained muscles specially when you have heavy luggages. i was so regret myself to book this place when i climbing up(?) the stairs to get to its main entrance.

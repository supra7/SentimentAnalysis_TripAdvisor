Disgusting! I will get right to the point.... The room... beat up furniture, dirty linens, stained carpet, falling ceiling in bathroom, and the kicker......rat bags under both beds and the dresser! I picked up the phone to call the lobby, and it didn't even work. When we went to the front desk, we found that this was a common occurance. We were offered a $100.00 refund, which we never got, and taken to a new room. It was still sub-standard, and we had to sleep on towels and never walk bare-footed on the carpet. Spend a little more and stay next door. It truly was a nightmare to have to sleep with one eye opened for fear of what might crawl in bed with you!

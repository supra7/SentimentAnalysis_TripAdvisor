We just returned from a weeks stay at the Whaler. March 11-18. I have read many reviews of the Whaler and the majority was good. Our experience was terrible. The room that we were given was very outdated. The carpet was white with stains everywhere. The wallpaper was coming off and had hand prints and stains all over. The bathroom was filthy. The bed was rock hard. Inbetween the bed and the nightstand had never ever been vacumed. The floors in the kitchen were dirty and sticky. We complained about the room and they offered to show us a new one but none were available until the next day. The next room that we received had a better view of the ocean and was a little cleaner, but not much. I have read in some of the reviews that you don't go to Hawaii to stay in the room. This is true, but it does help when you have a comfortable, clean place to stay. The weather was cloudy and rainy for 4 of the days we were there and so we ended up in the room. When looking at the Whaler website, they don't show you the true rooms. I would not recommend this place, and I won't return.

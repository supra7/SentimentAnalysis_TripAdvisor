Do Not Stay Here!!!! I would not recommend staying here! The maids painted the desk chair in our room while we were out one day and did not leave a wet paint sign!!! I put my coat on the chair when I arrived in the room and it is now covered with blue paint and RUINED! The manager will not call me back - has not offered to assist with covering the cleaning or replacement costs.It is an idiotic thing to paint anything in a room while there are current occupants!

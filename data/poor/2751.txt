We stayed at the Larchmont last week, in one of the fairly large queen rooms. Location is super, prices fair enough, and I personally I don't usually mind the relatively shabby budget hotel with shared washrooms if it is in a great neighbourhood. It is reasonably quiet and clean-seeming too. However, I must say that the previous mention of the bed bugs is absolutely for real. I was practically eaten alive with large welts appearing all over my arms, shoulders, and abdomen. We know for sure it was bed bugs based on seeing some in our room and the nature of the bites and the secondary allergic reaction I had. Our holiday was pretty much ruined -- much of it spent hunting down cortisone cream and antihistamines and rebooking at the Holiday Inn on Layfayette St. Management at the Larchmont was very stingy with compensating us. At least we had good weather!! Until this hotel gets the pest problem under control I'd recommend staying away. Side notes: our tv didn't really work and the breakfast is just pastries so isn't really doable for more than one morning.

I use to sale this property-The Whaler.... when I was a travel agent....We went with friends for my 40th Birthday and to say the least~ NOT IMPRESSED!! The Hotel was over priced for a 1 Bedroom/Garden Room. They we're remodeling, very noisy. promised a pineapple when we arrived(not) broken lawn chairs, air cond. quit working in our room, and they never even lowered the price of the room for all the noise!! The property has NO RESTAURANT....had to go to other propertys/hotels or restaurants near by, PARKING WAS $12.00 A DAY (what happen to free when you stay at their hotel, omg) and finally I got a RASH ALL OVER my Arms and legs from the POOL (bacteria) in it!!! I would not recommend this property to anyone!!!

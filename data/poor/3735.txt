Awful - Checked out after one night After reading fairly good reviews on TripFinder I booked my stay at the hotel for a 4-day trip. Overall the hotel lacks any personality, but my main complaint was with the rooms. There were bugs in the bathroom, a sticky carpet and the room smelled awful and was freezing. I told the hotel that I was unhappy with the room and they didn't seem to care. There are much better deals than this hotel in Honolulu.

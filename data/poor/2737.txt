I booked this hotel with Expedia. I reserved a room with 2 double beds, I ended up get one with 2 single beds. The staffs asked me to read the terms from Expedia carefully, the terms said Expedia does not guarantee the rooms I books, (of course, you won't find it if you don't read it carefully), it depends on the hotels availability when you arrive. So, what's the point to reserve a room in advance? The hotel is very small, noisy, staffs are not friendly. You may not get the room you booked and paid. I ended up got a roll-over bed against the wall for my daughter, but I still paid full price for a room with 2 Queen beds. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, it's cheap for a reason! Don't be fooled by the price!

If you are a couple or single traveler stay away! My boyfriend booked this room, looking at the numerous positive reviews but failed to see it is not recommended for couples. The place is substandard, and I am surprised at all the rave reviews. It is a Holiday Inn property, so keep that in mind. When we first checked in, there were left over belongings from the prior guests, tv remote and wall clock did not work. We requested room service not clean our room the next day and not only did the maid knock on our door the next morning, the maid proceeded to enter without waiting for a reply. PROS: Large rooms, hot tub, nice pool, buffet breakfast CONS: average service, cheap decor, tiny bathroom, no interior room access or elevator (only exterior outside stairs room access). Not really as close to the parks as they say - 1.4 mile away. Shuttle stops running earlier. Bottom Line: If you only plan on sleeping here and have kids, then this might be the place for you...But if your accustomed to quality or service, you will NOT find it here!

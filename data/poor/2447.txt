The building is showing its age, and the business is nickel and dime-ing its customers. The elevators are SLOW, the hallways are dark and all the ceilings are LOW. They charge us for internet and other services, regardless if we use them or not. I stayed in 4 places while in Maui, a hostel, couch surfed, a VRBO condo, and the westin, and the westin was the worst by far. my room at the hostel was bigger! not to mention cheaper! Don't let the brand fool you. This building needs to be razed and something more modern should be built in its place.

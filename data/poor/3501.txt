My stay at this hotel was in early October of 2007. I did report this to top staff--Front Office Manager and Hotel Manager. I discussed the issue with them in their back office. I showed them the bug bites on my body and explained that I had actually seen a bug in the bed, however, didn't realize that it was a bed bug. Also, I did not start suffering from the bites until a few days later. I was due to stay for 2 weeks, total.They offered me a glass of wine and moved me to another room. I ended up checking-out early as I could not rest. I was always in fear that I was being bitten again, and the itching was absolutely horrible! The bed was not very comfortable, but satisfactory. Also, there is a long flight of steps from the street to the hotel lobby--be prepared. The Front Desk staff are not very friendly. This by far, was the most humiliating and disgusting hotel stay I've ever experienced. I wish I had read this Web site beforehand.

On arrival at the Hotel after a 12 week long dialogue with Best Western over our group rate we found that the Hotel charged us all an extra 100eu per room because we had 2 people staying in a double room!!! Surely supplements apply the other way around???...The reception staff seemed prepared for this as soon as we arrived and were extremely rude (especially Angela!!) whoimmediately said that we had booked double rooms for 1 person and that it would be an extra 100eu per room to have the second person stay... We should the conformation we had received from Best Western only to be told that it was correct buy only for 1 person per double room!!!... The recpetionists became quite aggressive and as we had no choice we all had to agree to pay. We are inthe process of complaining to Best Western over their hotels antics.. Other than that the Hotel was in a nice location and clean... The restaurant food was average and extremely pricey and the drink tariff was on par with St Marks square!!!! On the whole our group weekend away for two of our party's 40th Birthday was soured by the Hotels behaviour. Though they advertise on their website an early bird booking, they do not honour this on arrival and leave you no choice at all but to pay the standard rate.. On the whole I would not recommend this hotel and suggest that you avoid Best Western hotels in general. I will certainly not be booking with Best Western again!!!!!

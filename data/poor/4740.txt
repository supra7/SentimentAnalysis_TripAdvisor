I had the unfortunate experience of staying at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel over Labor Day weekend. The first night I was in the hotel room, I found a black beetle in my bed crawling all over me. The second night I started noticing red itchy bumps on my back, stomach, legs and ankles. I began to realize that these bumps were spreading as the weekend progressed. I notified the front desk about the bites and they sent security and the head of housekeeping to check my bed. They stated that they did not find "any substantial evidence" as to why I was getting bitten. They changed the sheets and gave me itch medicated pads but sure enough the next day I woke up with more bites. It is almost a week later and I still have these bites that appear to be getting worse. I am very disappointed in the experience I gained from the Biltmore Arizona. I never expected to feel miserable while being on vacation. I will never return to this hotel again and I will never recommend it to anyone.

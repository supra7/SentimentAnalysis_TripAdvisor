I'll second the review of the Front desk staff. I also stayed at the Chateau last summer with my two children. The staff was incredibly rude to me and other guests if you dared to ask them a question. The only time I have ever seen guests treated so badly was perhaps in New York and I really think the Chateau staff was worse. The valet and maids were exceedingly polite and our room was okay.

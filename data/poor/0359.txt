I spent a single night in the Westin Seattle and left a favorite jacket in the closet as I left the room. I wasn't worried as I reported the missing jacket just six hours after check out, and I was still in town for a few days. But it was nowhere to be found, and it was only after three inquiries that anyone seemed to pay any attention to trying to track it down. The jacket has not appeared, and the only logical conclusion is that a hotel employee now has a very nice jacket. This could be expected at a budget accommodation, but not at a supposedly fine hotel. So keep close track of your things if you choose to stay there.

This was hands down the WORST experience my husband and I ever had at a resort hotel. DO NOT STAY HERE. The hotel is filthy and the staff is completely non-responsive almost to the point of being mute. The food is disgusting, the rooms are gross and very small. We vacation ALOT and this was so bad that we almost left early. I cut my foot on a piece of broken glass in the room and the staff woldn't even bother to help us. Luckily we salvaged the rest of our vacation by checking into the TIDES (directly next door). If you are going to Playa Del Carmen, stay at the TIDES, not the Le Reve....otherwise, you will regret it!

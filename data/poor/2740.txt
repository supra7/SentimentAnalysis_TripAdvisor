I booked the Newton partly because of good reviews on this site. What a mistake! I arrived late at night because of a train connection and the staff used this as an opportunity to put me in a bedroom that nobody who could have left the hotel and looked for another would have accepted! Despite being called a 'twin', it was absolutely tiny. A bed for one person and no room to move about in at all. It also looked disgusting! When I complained the night staff said they could do nothing about it but the problem would be sorted out in the morning. When morning came, of course, it turned out to be rather more difficult to solve ... In the end, they 'upgraded' me to a normal size room but added a huge amount to my daily rate! I would never have chosen the hotel at the rate they charged: it was more expensive than some 4* hotels elsewhere in the city. I am convinced that this was a scam and possibly one that has been repeated on other customers in the past and will be in the future. So all I can say is be VERY careful if you do book in this hotel and try to avoid it if you can.

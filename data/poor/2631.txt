we were stuck in the back where it was being renovated, we were told construction wouldn't start till 10am but we were woken up at 8:30am. the parking fee was allot more then what was posted online. the girl at the front desk was rude and said i needed a deposit because i paid with cash. the only good service was from the valet. i will never stay here again!! the only thing this hotel has in its favor is location but THE HOTEL PROVINCIAL is allot better in every aspect!

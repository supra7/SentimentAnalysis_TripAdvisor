The only way you can stand this hotel is if you have a room with a window facing the courtyard. And the only way you will get that room is if you pay the top asking price! Absolutely do not get stuck in a room with no windows. They are disgusting and full of mold. My entire ceiling was green and black with mold and it was growing out of the vents. I told the front desk that a must move for health reasons and they were not able to accommodate me until the next day. I then moved to a fabulous room overlooking the courtyard. Simply NOT WORTH THE RISK. This place is great if you have a window...a nightmare if you don't.

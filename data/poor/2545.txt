We have been customers of the Calistoga Spa for over 5 years. Often we come for the day but the past two years we have stayed for a few nights. The rooms are very basic and "look" affordable but the pricing scheme is sneaky...read the fine print especially if traveling with young children and especially if you've reserved 2 queens, the family unit, or the suite. Bottom line is that I was overcharged in a very misleading manner and when I took this up with management they were unwilling to do anything about it. The service was the worst I have ever received from any business that I have ever dealt with...no joke. One of the employees even threatened to call the police on my family and I. When I spoke to the manager about the treatment I received from the employee, she replied that she would "talk to her about it." Not exactly the response I was looking for. I will say that the pools are great, especially for young kids however, for the price we ended up being charged we could've rented an oceanfront beach house (seriously, I looked into it). I am heartbroken that one of our favorite places has become such a horrible disappointment. We will not be going back, nor will we be recommending the Calistoga Spa to any of our friends. Just the thought of dealing with the staff and management makes me cringe. With so many other great spas in Calistoga, I would choose another place to stay if I were a new comer.

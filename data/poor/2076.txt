We had trouble from the first step inside. The asked for a $100 cash deposit, made us fill out a bunch of papers, and the front desk person didn't even know what they were for, he told me to call and aks the HR deprtment during the week !!!!!???? WEIRD! The room was horrible, we had a view of the buildings' garage, right above the garbage, the windows did not open (Thank God), there was no heat, just blowing of cold air. The papers on the wall were coming off, very dirty and over used bath ropes, too disgusted to put them on, no amenities in the bathroom, without paying for them. Charged for phone call I didn't even use. Charged my credit card for the stuff I did use, instead to take from the deposit, and then being very rude about thier mistake. They seemed all nice in the begging when we came in, but when we had trouble and obviously on thir part, they didn't even let me speak over the telphone. Very bad experience, will never in a million years ever go back, a total nightmare. And were weren't the only ones going with our wrongful charges to the reception. I don't know who makes the other super great remarkes about this hotel, but it's a lie, they are probably made to write this during their shift to cover all the bad posts about them. WASTE OF TIME, AND I HAD A GIFT CERTIFICATE AND IT WAS FREE (and still had to put down a $100 deposit), AND I STILL HATED IT, SOOOO GO FIGURE!!! Plus parking is $40, which is far more than any other, for a hotel of just 10 floors. Cheapest hotel ever!

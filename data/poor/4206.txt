We had difficulty with getting our roome clean. We requested by phone twice and in person at the front desk twice. The room was cleaned after 9 pm one night. Each depatrment blamed the others and no one took responsibility and seemed to care. Would not return. Although close to the convetion center would walk from another area hotel next time. Expectation were not high and the hotel fell far below.

Where does one start with just how awful this hotel is?! We booked a condo but because of scheduling conflicts we needed one night elsewhere while on Maui and seeing it was our last night and that we would only be in the room for a few hours sleep and a shower in the morning we went the cheap route. It wasnt worth it. First, when you pull in the parking lot there is a dilapidated and I believe condemned building to the left that was one of there older hotels. That should have been a warning to us and to anybody else who stays their. We stayed on the other side of Kihei blvd not the ocean side. The room was horrendous, plain and simple. Filthy carpet, filthy bathroom loud and obnoxious A/C and the room stunk. When you turned on the shower it blew the shower curtain around like it was in a hurricane. Water rushed over the tub, onto the bathroom floor and into the living area. I could go on and on but you should get the picture by now. And in case you dont look at some of the photos of the reviewers on this site!!! Hey! Aston Maui Lu! You seriously need to implode this place (along with the building in front thats ready to fall over anyways) and start from scratch.

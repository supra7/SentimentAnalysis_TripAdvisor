We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the W Hotel. Where do I start? This was our third time in New York and we have previously stayed at the Roger Williams and Millenium Hilton without any complaint. We decided to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt as we were slightly apprehensive about going somewhere which had so many negative reviews but reading the recent complementary reviews we thought we should give it a go - we were WRONG to do so! 1) At check-in we were 'greeted' by Emily who had a sour expression from dealing with the customer prior to ourselves. She did not inform us about any of the amenities within the hotel e.g. where do we go for breakfast, how to operate the complex lifts etc.... 2) The room was labelled a 'Wonderful' room and it did not live upto it's name. It was far too small and uninviting. It felt overcrowded with just the two of us in there! 3) The next day we wanted to use the iron in our room but would you believe it, there was no power socket in the room to plug an iron into!! We called hotel maintenance and the engineer came up and said "I've never seen a room like this". That was not very helpful to us. He spent a further 30 mins to arrange a complex extension lead!! 4) Later in the evening, we phoned concierge for a list of recommended Chinese restaurants - they did not answer the phone but we were asked to leave our request on an answer machine. No one called us back!!! 5) Be warned the lifts are a nightmare in this hotel! No-one tells you that you have to insert your card for them to work but even when you do, your card does not work. We met at least three different people who were constantly going up/down in the lift as their cards would not work!! 6) Finally, we were preparing to share some of the above feedback at checkout but they did not even care to ask us if we had a good stay, hence why we need to write this review on Trip Advisor!

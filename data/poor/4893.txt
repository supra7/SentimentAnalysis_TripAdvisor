Check in took over two hours. They offered the guest the Service of late check out due to the rain. Two days later we asked about the late service check out and staff informed us they had not done that in months. I know for a fact they did it that Wednesday. We were told they had just changed the policy when the hotel was booked to capacity. Room was filthy. Clon of hair in the bath tub. Pubic hair on the toilet. We paid an extra $10 to have a refrigerator and microwave brought in. We requested that it be turned on so it would be cold when we arrived. It wasn't even plugged in. There were no hand towels and we had to go get out own bath towels from the maid cart. Indoor waterpark chlorine content will choke you. Kids could not hardly stand their eyes burning so badly. I could Bartley breathe in their. I had to sit next to a window that was propped open. There was an accident in the pool and staff were not having children get out of the pool for it to be cleaned. This hotel does not card about its guest and only care about their money. Go to grand country to have indoor swimming.

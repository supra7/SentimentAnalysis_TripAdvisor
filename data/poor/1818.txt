While staying in Boston this past weekend we took a cab from the hotel to the aquarium. While trying to return, we became aware of how many marriots were in Boston. Taking our mistake in stride we decided to get a map and make a hunt of it. After walking to 2 different locations I told the woman at the counter in the Marriot Copley place about our situation. She told us that she could not help us. I asked her why she couldn't just call and see if we were booked at another one and save us a trip. Acting irratated she obliged and told me that we were staying a mile and a half away. I was walking with tired children and asked for use of the shuttle or a call to our hotel for a shuttle. The woman told me she was done helping me and flat out "NO." I asked if we could have help getting a cab, and that was a no as well. Talk about poor service...

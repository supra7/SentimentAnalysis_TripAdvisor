My wife and I spent a week there from 5/26 to 6/3/12. Rooms we not very clean. Maid service was a hit and miss. Rooms were need of repairs. There was a hole at the bottom for my front door. On my Balcony there was a drinking glass with butts in it. Called front desk to remove, it was still their when we left. It took 17hrs for TV to be fixed. My phone went dead on the last day. Lamp was broken,never fixed. The last two days there were ants in my Bedroom,which I had to kill because no else did. Pool was very small. Too many unsupervised children . Breakfast! Cooks were not very organized. Food was not made to your order but to there order. Managers reception was a JOKE. There would be 70 to 80 people on line for a drink and 1 bartender. Only went once. The staff was Good answered all question well. I'm a HH Hilton Member and I've been with the company for over 15 yrs. and I must say this was the worst Hotel I've ever stayed at.

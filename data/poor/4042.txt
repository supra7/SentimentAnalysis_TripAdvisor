The hotel looks nice, but the service was HORRIBLE and we barely slept - the beds look nice but are uncomfortable, it was noisy, the walls must be thin, we could hear everything outside- we got very little sleep!.. The weird thing is, the elevators dont go to every floor, so we had to get off at a floor below ours, and carry our luggage up the stairs....and, I had a cold shower (I called downstairs to tell them there was no hot water, and they said "the engineer will be in at 9, he'll call you then"--- I had to be at work before then, so that didn't help), then the blow dryer didn't work, and they didn't come up with a new one for such a long time, I had to leave for work with a cold, wet head. Also, one of the employees literally yelled at me about a credit card "issue" that actually ended up not being an issue at all.

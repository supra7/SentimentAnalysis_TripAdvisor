***DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I THOUGHT THE OTHER REVIEWERS WERE EXAGGERATING, BUT TI'S ALL TRUE** My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights this New Year's weekend. The relaxing, hip, luxurious lobby is VERY deceiving compared to what the hotel rooms look like. Let me just say from the moment we checked in to this Motel it was nothing but problems. The beds are NOT heavenly, the AC knocks every 2 seconds to remind you its on, the walls are peeling, the carpet is beyond repair, and so on... The size of the rooms are beyond tiny (there are tons of NY hotel rooms that are standard sized.. you dont have to sacrifice... try the Sofitel) If I took the time to list out all of my complaints of this hotel and its staff, it would take me all day. They are totally not worth my time. This Motel is a disgrace to the Westin/W/Starwood name. And the attitude of the staff is comparable to any low quality greasy spoon hamburger stand. To pay nearly $400 a night for this is robbery. Again, DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!

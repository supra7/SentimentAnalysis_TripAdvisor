Because there are a few guests It looks like a ghost hotel. Nobody of the staff speaks good English. The few who do, very bad. Every day around 1 PM a big group of around 50 children is visiting the pool. Screaming yelling and shouting the whole afternoon. The food is bad. The prices high especialy wine. SaBeNa. Such a Bad expereance Never again

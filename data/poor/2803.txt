I was very disappointed with the attitude of staff. I expected my luggage to come up to my room quickly. Wanted to take it up myself. Ended up in someone else's room and had to be found. Made three calls to reception to sort it out. No apology. Think the owners need to educate staff on what hospitality actually means. Cool and chic staff don't just cut it when service is what guests want!

We stayed at this hotel from july 15 to 17, 2010. the walls are made out of paper. We could hear the neibourgh flush the toilet. We had the unfirtunate opportunitues to stay next to a bunch of drunk people whow screamed and yelled all night he first night. When the morning came they got the wake-up calls but wouldn't answer. We heard at least 7 calls coming in. When you pay over $300 a night you expect more. I travelled the world and never found anything like that. I will never stay in a Hyatt for the rest of my life. The following night, a bunch of ignorant drunks were arguing in front of our door and kept us awarke for awhile until they move to a romm where we could hear them. Frankly, i have been to Boston before and never found so many loud ignorant drunks. The quality of the insulation between room is non-existent.

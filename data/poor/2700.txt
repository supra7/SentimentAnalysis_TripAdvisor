While we were exploring the city, the maid(s) came into our room to clean like we expected. when we returned nothing seemed to be out of place, well, nothing that we would consider to be out of place, our bags were messy, but we did NOT think anything of it. One of the girls had placed her bag up high cause there wasnt much room. on our final night there, while gathering out belongings, we realized that there were earphones missing. we searched the room and could not find them. when we went back on the bus, we noticed that the earphones that belonged to one of the girls was wrapped around SOMEONE ELSES ipod. the maid(s) who had cleaned the room, had stoled the earphones and wrapped someone else's around the ipod! I should add that we saw many of the employees hanging out in the room next door to us, sitting and lying down on the bed. pretty sure one was the manager! watch out for the employee traffic infront of your door!

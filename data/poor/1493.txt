We booked this Hotel through an online booking representative, on arrival at the Hotel the booking was not in the Hotel reservation system. The Fragrance Waterfront wanted a cash payment to the value of the rack room rate. The next day the Hotel refused a refund of the second payment, now the one night is paid twice with the second payment at a high rate. I have yet to determine if this is a Hotel scam or not, tread very carefully. Avoid online bookings with this Hotel - unless you want to pay twice!

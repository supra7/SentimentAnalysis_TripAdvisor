This hotel has only one good thing to offer - the cental location. My husband and I could not believe this hotel room when we walked in, it was so small it could only just fit in the bed. The carpets were so dirty. The bathroom was so small you had to close the door to use the sink. The corridors were so poorly lit i assume that was to hide the state of the carpet. The staff were so unfriendly and unhelpful. The door men were trying to offer us overpriced and not always insured black cabs instead of the yellow cabs. Enough said I would not stay here again.

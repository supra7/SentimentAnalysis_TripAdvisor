I stayed here for three nights the first week of April. Be careful of the prices they charge! When I made my reservation, I was quoted a price and then when I arrived they charged me $15 a night more because they claimed my discount was no good! After taxes, I ended up paying an extra $75 for the three nights. My room was on the 4th floor. It was tiny but clean when I arrived. The second day I was given towels with make-up on them. It was also noisy. I never had a good night's sleep. You can hear doors slamming all over and also personal hygiene noises from other rooms. The doorman was the only friendly staff member I encountered. I never ate the breakfast so I can't comment on that area. Elevators ran fine---I never had an issue with them---and location is nice. I don't need a fancy or upscale hotel, but I do like cleanliness and quiet. All in all----if you don't care about prices, room size and cleaniness---it would be a good place to stay. If you want to know you'll be charged the correct price, and that your towels will actually be clean---stay somewhere else. I will never stay here again, would never recommend the place, and have informed my company to not recommend it to other employees when they come to town.

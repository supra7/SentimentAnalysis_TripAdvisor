Where to begin... 1. I checked in simultaneously side-by-side with a couple who apparently did not book their room on hotels.com as I did, thus they were treated better than I was. I got my room key thrown into an old envelope and was told where the elevators were by a point in their direction, while the full-paying couple beside me had their room key put in a nice little envelope and was directed to the bell desk. 2. My heat did not work! I spent my night shivering under my winter coat. My friends in other rooms also had no heat, while other friends were sweating when they turned the heat as low as it could possibly go. 3. WORST OF ALL--THERE WAS HAIR in my bed!!!!!!!! I turned down the sheets at 2am after coming home tired from a wedding to find not only that my sheets were ripped, but that there was hair in there---and I do not just mean one piece (as if that would be acceptable)--then I put the sheet back down and there was also hair between the sheet and the cover...I WANTED TO VOMIT.

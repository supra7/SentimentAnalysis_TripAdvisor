We weren't thrilled to stay at this hotel in the first place, but it was a busy weekend in Memphis and all the decent places were booked. We paid the same for our room here as we did at the much nicer Doubletree downtown, so it felt like a rip-off but we soldiered on. Overall, we felt like it was an ok place to stay, albeit out of the way, but that changed when we discovered BED BUG BITES in the morning. In the week following our stay, we contacted the hotel directly to report the problem and ask for our money back. They never returned my calls, did not seem to care that we had been bitten, and finally determined that there were no bed bugs and so no problem. They refused to reimburse us for our stay and remained unapologetic. We are taking it up with the national Days Inn company.

Unfortunately, when Quailty Inn took over this previous Travel Lodge they may not have been aware of the poor building quality. This hotel is listed as 3 stars on many sites. The staff is friendly and if the star rating was based strictly on amenities found within the room (mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, iron and board etc) I too would give it 3 stars. But the hotel itself is a older building with paper thin walls and the floors constantly squeak as guests walk up and down the halls and back and forth in the very very small rooms. If you arrive late parking will also be a challenge due to the limited number of spaces with in the fenced property. There are many other newer 1 and 2 star hotels in the area that would give you a better nights sleep. I would avoid this hotel.

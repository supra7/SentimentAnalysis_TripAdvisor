I have nothing good to say about my 3 night stay here. The room was suppose to have two beds, which it did not. They couldn't change the room until the next day so I got to sleep on the floor as three people do not fit in one bed. Oh and the bars outside sounded like a re-enactment of Stomp outside my window till 4am.The next room did not have working heat!!!! but they were kind enough to give us a space heater. The next day we woke up to no hot water in the entire place. When i got my car from the valet service, the glove compartment and center console had been completely rummaged through and the contents all over my car!!! Do no book at this place ever!!!!!!!

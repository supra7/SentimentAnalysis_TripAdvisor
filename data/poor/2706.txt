Based on the price we knew this would not be a luxury hotel but was just looking for something clean and safe. The room was very basic but clean. The day after we checked in my camera was stolen out of my suit case and my daughters coat pockets were gone through as well. We reported this to the manager who indicated our maid was only employed with them one week. The manager did not follow up with us as promised. We spoke with another occupant who had 2 cameras stolen from their room the same day. When they asked the hotel if any other cameras had been reported missing they were told no, which was not true. We were not advised to fill out an incident report and were discouraged from contacting the police. So for the rest of our stay we had no maid service because of concern about additional items being stolen. There is 1 ice machine and it was broken half the time we were there. Several of the hotel employees were very friendly and nice, unfortunately the theft and lack of candor and appropriate followup with the management really tainted our stay. I would not recommend staying here. The cost savings with this hotel will be spent to replace my camera that was stolen out of my suitcase.

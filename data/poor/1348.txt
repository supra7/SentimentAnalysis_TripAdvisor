Nice hotel but two big problems. Even though I booked via a large hotel booking site, I was told very brusquely when I arrived that I had to get an extra room for my child! Incredible - another 200 euros I wasn't expecting. And the wi-fi is flaky - not very useful for me when using my work laptop. I know my technical stuff too - I do this for a living so I know the wifi is flaky (I'm not making this up - I tested it). If the hotel staff had listened or tried to help, I wouldn't be writing this review. The guy on the desk was NOT friendly or helpful and pretty much suggested it was a new room or go away. Not what you want to hear when you've travelled all day. Sorry but I won't ever be using the hotel again, not because it is poor but because they gave me a bad experience on my first trip. I run a large online business and we get customer service right, first time, without doing stuff like this. If you have children, find somewhere that is helpful, friendly, polite and less like some french comedy sketch.

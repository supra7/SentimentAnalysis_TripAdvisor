After reading hundreds of reviews on trip advisor, I choose this resort. I booked a three bedroom suite 3 months in advance of our trip. I confirmed the reservation by phone and email three weeks before arriving. I received an additional confirmation from the resort three days prior to arrival. We travelled from Canada for two days with two chronically ill teenagers and grandparents in tow, arriving at 11 p.m. Upon arrival we were told that they had "overbooked" and they gave us mapquest directions to another hotel. The night clerk couldn't even produce a proper business card for the Worldquest manager, instead he crossed the name out on someone else's card and handed it to me. I was told that they had made arrangements for us to stay in a 3 bedroom suite in another hotel. When we arrived at the other hotel there were only 2 bedroom suites. I travel frequently for work and I have never experienced such a ridiculous lack of professionalism. At the very least I would have expected the hotel to contact us with an apology and some form of compensation. If you want to be guaranteed to have a room when you arrive in Florida, Worldquest Resort is NOT the place to go.

This hotel was nothing special.Our room 21736 was covered in dust, I do not think the room was vacuumed during our 10 night stay. Had to ask for toilet paper,bottled water.(would not mind but when you are being charged a resort fee of ridiculous dollars per day this is unacceptable !) Would never stay there again. This hotel is more of a business travellers place but they are trying to dip into the tourist market too.On the last night of our stay my husband was approached by a hooker (04/01/12) asking if he was looking for a good time ! Disgrace for a top class hotel .Security staff or whoever monitors your monitors need to get a grip.I witnessed the aforementioned hooker entering the lifts at half hour intervals with different men while her friend was pacing the lobby area ,mobile phone in hand ! If your security staff were as vigilant as the valet staff in ripping you off for 22 bucks per day for valet parking then perhaps your resident hookers would dissapear ! I also left a recently purchased jacket in lobby area on our last night ( we were last to go to bed that night! ) .On inquiring at lost and found next day it had not been handed in .Would not recommend this place to anyone.

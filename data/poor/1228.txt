We stayed here because of a child that needed treatment at a local hospital. We arrived in the evening and were appalled at the laziness of the front desk attendant as well as their "security guard". No greeting, the questions I asked were a bother to them to answer, and with all doors locked with ramps for luggage carrier, and a baby they never even offered to help us with anything just sat there and watched instead of at least saying here can we hold the door open. We finally got our room key after they double booked me and tried making me pay for two rooms, when we got up to the room, imagine our surprise when we walked in and there was someone in the room. Had to go back downstairs and get another room (with a baby again). Then the next morning after paying $14 to park my car, walked out to a drunk with broken beer bottles around my tires. The general manager just said "ma'am we sorry", but never offered to help me clean or move the broken glass so I could leave to make the appointment. Every staff member was sitting there texting on the sofas or kitchenette areas. I didnt expect the Ritz Carlton, but i will never stay here again!

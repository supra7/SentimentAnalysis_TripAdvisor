Location of this place is fantastic - about a 5/10 minute walk from the main train station. - and thats the only good thing about it! As we had arrived during the easter holiday time for the business trip - we paid 97 each which was abit much, especially for what your getting! Two rooms were booked and we had requested for ensuite for both, one was and the other room wasn't and the manager refused to refund the difference! Yet worse was to come, the rooms stank, the carpets were dirty...and my bed was broken- literally! as soon as you sat on the bed it sunk in the middle! The rooms seemed so unsafe at night and I really felt uncomfortable the whole night (on my broken bed!) Can't remember breakfast- as I was getting over my aching back - thankfully as I was staying one night no long term damage was done! But really, avoid this creepy, seedy little place that looks lovely from the outside but stinky from the inside- and dont bring your kids here- they'll never forgive you!!

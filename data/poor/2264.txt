After reserving a room here and unfortunately having to have cancelled it, my checking account was charged one nights stay in error. Apparently there was a mixup between Hotel kingdom and the hotel and each is blaming the other for it. Subsequently, I am out that nights stay and bank fees. I have attempted several times to resolve this with their accounting department to no avail. I have not received phone calls back from upper management after a first call which led to no resolution. It is obvious that they have no interest in fixing their mistakes or in taking care of customers, nor does Hotel Kingdom. I have attempted to contact both businesses to resolve this. I sincerely hope that no one else has a similar experience. I would recommend blocking any charges in the event you have to cancel your reservation so that your situation does not end up like mine, costing you time, money and a poor experience.

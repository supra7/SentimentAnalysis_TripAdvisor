We booked a room that was supposed to be 300 square feet for myself, spouse and daughter. When we got to our room, it was the size of a closet. You could barely move or turn around. The bathroom was so small your knees hit the door...all for $240/night plus $30/day parking...not even a coffee pot...and even though we told them we had three in our party, we never got more than two towels or drinking glasses. We finally measured the room and it was 185 square feet and NOT 300 as we were promised yet we were still charged for a 300 square foot room. It was not much nicer than a Motel 6.

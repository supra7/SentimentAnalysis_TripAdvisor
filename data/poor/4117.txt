OMG! This hotelbis ridic! It started off from a phone call to confirm my reservation. Although I had book through a third party, I understand that They were in responsible for making the arragements. But becuae I have years in the industry I know that the hitel should have my resevation on the computer. There I called to make sure.The laziness and unwilligness of the front office staff made me uneasy already as he relentlessly try to divert me to my travel agent. When I arrived, we checked in and walked around. They location is a plus. Though much of a tease to be a across from the Four Season and the Westin.(def. Should book at chain hotels if you want consistent quality). Location to the mag mile and tour are prime that seem to be the only benefit. Not worth it if you an hear your neighbor throug paper then wall and creak of the elevator all night.We also attempted to use the business center, which was not in service because they didn't know the password. No ice on the foor we were at. Horrible service. This hotel wa taken upon a recommendaton by a friend.which will not ever be taken again.haha.Please don't waste you noney here.

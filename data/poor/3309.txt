This hotel bills itself as a stay and park option for SeaTac. The valet parking is provided by MasterPark, which abuts the hotel. I reserved a 7-day stay and park package and when I moved my car to the valet I was told to put it back where it was (in front of the hotel restaurant) since they were taking no more cars that were there for the parking package. They did have parking spaces and offered me parking at $14.95/day. MasterPark didn't care that I had already paid for 7 days of parking, Only after I steadfastly refused to leave my car along the side of the restaurant (I might as well have put a sign on the car that said "please vandalize me") did the hotel agree to let me park the car in a roped off area behind the hotel. However that meant I had to drag my luggage around the hotel in a rainstorm to catch the shuttle. And of course I will have to do the same when I return. This is not valet parking! Sadly this is the third, and last, time this has happened with this hotel. The prior two times the manage apologized profusely and one time even gave us an entire parking package for free. He also assured us the problems with MasterPark had been solved. However, as the saying goes "The definition of insanity is doing the same trying over and over and hoping for a different result". So I am stopping the insanity and will not stay at this hotel again, nor will I use any of the MasterPark parking facilities. They can take their squabble out on some other unsuspecting customer.

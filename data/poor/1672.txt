The pictures are a joke, our room was the size of a cracker box. One elevator working only I wrote e mails to explain that we needed parking, what a joke. My handicapped husband had to walk 2 blocks out of a parking garage, while I handled all the luggage. The dining area next door was also a rip off. Never even think you can believe the pictures. This place should be shut down for a fire risk. The baths were remodeled, but so small you couldn't get in them. I was so disapointed in the whole thing.

Small and expensive rooms. Walls must be really thin because everytime someone walks in the hallway (including nightime, possibly by staff.... hem...) I get woken up as it sounds as if they're almost conversing really loudly in my room. You have to pay for internet access, which really blows if you are doing business from overseas. They charge you 5 dollars for 2 hours, 10 dollars for 10 hours, and 18 dollars for 24 hours. Which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't a continuous connection. That's right... the time keeps on ticking even if you log off... way to get screwed.

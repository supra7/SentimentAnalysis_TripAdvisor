Never Again! I never thought I would know what staying in a prison cell would be like until my night at this hotel. The front doors are locked at 7 p.m. and, like the earlier reviews stated, the cashier at the deli next door checks you in as there is no one at the front desk. The hallways are depressing enough until you get to the room. It was stark and tiny with bad lighting and absolutely no amenities, no form of heat, an ironing board, but no iron, a television but no controls (or remote) and no hair dryer, even though the slick brochure boasted of all these things and more. After I went back to the deli cashier and told her I needed a hair dryer, one was delivered to the room that evening. The bathroom toilet and sink were new, but you could see through the towels and the shower head (less than one inch in diameter) was not even worth describing. Of all the quaint bargain hotels that San Francisco has to offer, this one should be marked off your list.

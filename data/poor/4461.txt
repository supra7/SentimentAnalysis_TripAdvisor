Where to begin?Oh yeah I was on line looking for a hotel on the old strip that was decentely priced and that looked nice.Well Gold Spike was on there and had a beautiful room for viewing.I thought for the price it's great and liked what I saw. Well when we walked in I thought we were stepping into a human ashtray!! I had already purchased the rooms months ago and we were good to go or so I thought, the staff starts giving me grief because I won't put an additional deposit per room down.Can you believe that they wanted me to put more money down then the room actually cost.After we finally got on the elevator to go to our rooms I was now over powered by the smell of burning rubber.(I was scared the elevator was breaking)When I got back to the hotel later that night after dinner I needed an ice pack for my leg I called the front desk to ask where I could find an icemaker,her exact words were "In the restraunt" click! I couldn't believe how rude some people can be. The next morning my friend called the front desk and asked for some extra towels, again the front desk" There down here come and get them" click! At that point all I wanted to do was go somewhere else but ofcoarse no refunds!Now I know not to believe what you see on the web.

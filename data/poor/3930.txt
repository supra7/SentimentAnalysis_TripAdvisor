I don't give people a bad rating unless they really deserve it! The location, it's on a dirty river next to a train station and by America's best a Walmart! And I guess Walmart and the Westin share their employees because they were about the same amount of friendly! Room ok! Food over priced and small! I found little bugs in my room that I think we're bed bugs! Who ever owns this hotel try again because Westin your not!

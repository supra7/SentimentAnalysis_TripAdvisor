This hotel is in a great location, but the room is dirty and hot...The air-con does not work. I asked the reception why it is so hot which she suggested to open the windows..which is so noisy and dirty. The worst is the design of the bathroom where the floor will get flooded after taking a bath or shower.... Will definitely not be coming back. I would not recommend it!!!!

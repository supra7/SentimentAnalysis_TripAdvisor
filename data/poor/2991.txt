As a Platinum Priority Club member, I have stayed at MANY HI brand properties. This one was chosen after reading some of the reviews. Not quite what I expected..... Front Desk staff (Juan) was extremely abrupt and did not seem interested in trying to check us in early if at all possible. No acknowledgement of Priority Club member, etc. I understand the hotel was busy, however no effort was made to even offer pool access, luggage storage, etc. When I requested pool access, I was given a HUGE sigh and after a minute a short "ok". Room was sub-par. Looked clean at first but after looking under the beds we found other people's socks, popcorn, gift cards, etc. Counter tops were dirty, window blinds were caked in dust. Call me fussy but when I pay for a hotel I expect some level of cleanliness..... Breakfast was not on par with most Staybridge Suites. Being in Florida, I would expect some fresh citrus fruit. Only fresh fruit was terrible Red Delicious apples. There were some canned peaches but really? No English muffins, not much on "healthy" choices. The hotels seems designed to be a flop house for theme park visitors and staff appear to have the attitude of "get them in, get them out". I asked for a review card from the front desk and was told I would get one via email. THIS NEVER SHOWED UP. I eventually sent a concern email to IC hotels main group who forwarded my request to management. I received a short email from Melissa saying "sorry" and that was all. VERY DISAPPOINTING. When considering this hotel, think again. You can do better.

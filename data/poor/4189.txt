For the price of the room, I expected more. The check in process was painfully slow. The lobby was pretty and I loved the gift shop and even the restaurant until I got food poisoning. It was awful. I had to pay a few hundred more dollars to get an extra night to recover, missed most of my conference, and had to pay to change my plane ticket. The hotel staff was completely incompetent and although I called, explained, and paid for the next night, my sleep was interupted with 3 more attempts to remind me to leave, to try to clean the room although I asked them not to, and to call and see why I was still there. When I asked room service to bring me anything I could eat while ill - rice, broth, etc they came up with nothing. I'll never go back,

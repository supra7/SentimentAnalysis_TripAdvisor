All the other hotels in downtown Seattle were booked except this hotel...there was a reason for this. We took the elevator up to our floor only to have the elevator door open and it was filled with dirty laundry and no hotel worker. Rooms were old, dirty and not well kept. Also the door did not shut properly and there was a hole in the window. The walls were dirty and you could tell that the carpet was not laid properly as it was coming up all along the edges. Our bed sunk in the middle and the sheets had stains on them. I understand it is a budget hotel but this is beyond budget.

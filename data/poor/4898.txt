.....because we didn't!!! This place is NASTY and not well maintained AT ALL. Our room had major plumbing problems (toilet overflowed all over the floor and sink almost overflowed just washing your hands....gross). I have no idea how this place will survive in a struggling economy....because their customer service is lacking as well. The manager was rude and so was one of the ladies at the check-in desk (although one of them was super nice and apologetic). I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. YUCK!

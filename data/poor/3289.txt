We stayed at the Paramount this month to attend a play. Everything about the experience was great until we checked out. Our GPS system had been stolen. It was put away in the glove box and we noticed immediately that it was gone when the Valet brought our car to us. When we talked to the front desk, they told us they contract out their parking (United Parking) and referred us to the supervisor of the company. He contacted us on Monday and told us he would do an "investigation". One week later (after calling twice for information) we heard back from him were informed "my employee has been here three years and I trust him. I don't believe it was taken from here". So now we are out a GPS and will NEVER stay at the Paramount again.

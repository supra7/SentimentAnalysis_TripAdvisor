This hotel does NOT live up to its reputation. During check in I asked if my room had a view of the harbor. The staff person informed me that they are actually not close enough to see the Inner Harbor and that the hotel is thinking of changing that info on the website because it is misleading. I asked how far away we were from the harbor, she said 7 blocks. The first room I checked into had a rancid sour smell. I left the room and came back in about an hour, thinking the smell would go away. It was still there when I returned. I called the front desk and they gladly changed my room. The next room they put me in had no smell, but when I sat on the bed I noticed that there was hair all over the pillows. I called the front desk again. They sent a housekeeper up to change the pillow cases. After a few hours I needed to get dressed to go to an event. I tried to iron my clothes, the iron didn't work. I called a manager and they sent the head of housekeeping up with a new iron. He tried the old one out himself and was apologetic because he agreed that it was broken. When I got back in that night, the manager had written me an apology note with two comp tickets for breakfast. I ended up staying another night at the hotel. The check in staff offered me a view of the ball field. I said sure. When I got to the room there was no ball field out the window. I would not stay here again. They are not a 4 star hotel in my opinion. They 2nd night I spent $209 for a small room. There has to be better deals for the money in downtown Baltimore. At the very least a hotel should be clean.

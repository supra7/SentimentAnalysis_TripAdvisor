Had occasion to stay at the Peabody Orlando on International Drive, for 2 night stay. First room assigned was on the elevator shaft and every time an elevator car went up or down there was noise. Changed rooms and went out to dinner and shopping. Returned at 9PM, party across hallway, doors slamming and yelling. Called front desk at 10:30 to complain, called several more times, no help. Party went on until wee hours. Checked out in the morning, complained and, after 15 minute wait, a junior manager arrived and argued with me for 10 minutes. No resolution. Finally after 3 faxes, 2 Emails and a certified letter to Peabody headquarters in Memphis, a credit appeared on my charge card for the charges. Also, the hotel has the nerve to add a fee (undisclosed until you arrive) onto your bill, for which they say you get 2 bottles of water per day. A cup of coffee in the lobby is $4.00 and the standard rooms are smaller than Motel 6!!

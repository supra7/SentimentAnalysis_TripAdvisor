If ALL you like to do is party-stay here. For $250 a night I expected air conditioning not a window fan. The first room had a double bed against a king headboard and futon instead of queen convertible bed. Ocean view was the pool fence. Only one TV too. We requested another room... Second room a bit better-King and a pleather broken queen convertible bed-again no air and one TV. This hotel WILL CHARGE YOU 30% of the nightly rate for the reservation if you shorten your stay!! Still, we moved. "Acting" manager was rude and I will deny charges to my CC!

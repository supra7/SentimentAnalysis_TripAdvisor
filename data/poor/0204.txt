Stark Contrast to the Radisson LA Westside On Aug. 28th my flight from LA was very late and I missed my connection. Since I had such a wonderful time at the Radisson Los Angeles Westside, I was delighted to try the Radisson at Sea-Tac. Well, I was amazed at the difference. The carpeting was filthy. After a shower, (which wasn't very clean), I tried to use my phone and it wouldn't work. I called the front desk to find that since I hadn't left a credit-card imprint, they wouldn't turn my phone on. I explained that I was only making a calling card call anyway, and was told to bring my credit card to the front desk or forget it. I explained I had just gotten out of the shower, it was almost 1:00am, and I'd gladly read my credit card number to him and let them run it in the morning. He basically said that it wasn't his problem, and if I really wanted to use my phone that badly, I'd bring my card up front! Then, out of desparation, I asked if he would call a number for me and just have them call me back, and he said NO! A while later I called someone else at the front desk and requested a wake up call. Well, luckily for me, I set the alarm, because they never called me. Not only that, but 2 out of 4 glasses in my room were disgustingly filthy. I took them to the front desk the next morning and the lady was appauled at their condition. When I told her of my entire experience, she was nice and offered to pay for my room. That would have been great, but it was courtesy of Alaska Airlines anyway. But, at least she tried to make me feel better. Had I not just had such a great stay at the Radisson in Culver City, I would NEVER set foot in another Radisson Hotel. T. Hewitt

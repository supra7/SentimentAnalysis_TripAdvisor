First night, no hot water, not even warm, they moved us next day, but because the room was not ready, they had to take our luggage to bell station (another tip), we were told to come back around 4, not to stand in line, just walk up and ask for key. I did this, only to be screamed at by one of the front desk clerks, who had no business working with the public, which embarrased me and actually made me cry, because I was sick, running 103, the manager tried to make me happy by giving me a $30 room service credit, which at check out they tried to charge me. The next 6 nights were in a room that the AC sucked and would not go below 78, but the front desk people are the main problem, they are rude and I would never, never go back. Harrah's your hotel is really going down hill.

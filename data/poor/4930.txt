We stayed at the Summer Bay Resort last year about the same time as an "time share owner". It was so nice. The one bedroom we had was really beautiful. The service was great also. We decided to come back this year but couln't get in as a "timeshare owner" so I booked through Traveocity. I expected to have the same type of room as we had in the previous year.....BOY WAS I WRONG! When we walked in the door I looked in to see that the green leather looking couch arm had a huge gash running down the whole side. It smelled like no one had been in it for a long time. We walked into the bedroom and the carpet was frayed and coming apart all the way down where the tile and carpet met. The carpet was also filthy in the whole unit. The garden tub had large cracks running up from the drain with black stuff inside them. The tub itself was dirty too. The were very few pictures in the unit and just a general lack of amenities. When I called to complain about the room and wanted to move they told me that this was room that they rented to the travel companies and not to the owners! I knew what the rooms looked like because I had been there the year before! I told them this and they asked me if I would like to contact my travel company and I told them I wanted to be moved! They moved us to another room a little better than the frist.....no rips in the sofa and the tub was a little cleaner but I wore my shoes the entire time I was there. They were required to clean the room each day but after the first day they missed 2 days and finally on the 3rd day they showed up to clean the room and leave us some towles. Only becuase I called each day and complained. When I go to a place and stay and go back the next time I expect to find the same caliber of room that I did the last time. I would NEVER stay at this place again even though I could stay as an OWNER and have a beautiful room. NEVER.

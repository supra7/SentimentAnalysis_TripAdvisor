The staff went out of their way to make us feel as UNcomfortable as possible. They made it seem like they were doing us a favor letting us pay to stay there. Our rooms were not ready when they were scheduled to be. There was no communication between hotel staff and no one knew where our rooms were. I cannot believe such a "fancy" hotel could employ such incompetent staff. Not once during our stay did anyone on staff apologize that our rooms were not available as they were reserved to be. On checkout we informed the staff at the front desk that we had used the room's fridge for our own drinks, but did not consume ANYTHING from the mini-bar. We were assured that we would not be charged...however- there was an extra $25 dollar charge on our credit card and now we need to waste more time with their incompetent staff dealing with this excess charge. We stayed at the Hyatt regency a few days before- their staff was very helpful, even gave us a free upgrade, would recommend the Hyatt regency over the Fairmont.

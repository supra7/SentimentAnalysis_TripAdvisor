I chose this hotel based on the reviews, location, and price. I stayed June 27 thru July 5th. By the time I left, the place had become a Jerry Springer episode with some guy on my floor banging on the door to his or his ''girlfriend's'' room saying, ''come on baby, open da door.... come on baby open da door and lemme in", over and over and over. Then it would stop and then start again. I called the front desk about it and they said, "We'll send someone to your room." I told them my room wasn't the problem. The walls and windows at this hotel are so thin you hear everything in the room next to you and all the street noise below which goes on ALL night. There was constant pounding somewhere in or adjacent to the hotel for what seemed endless early one morning while sleeping. In addition, doors to adjacent rooms were constantly being slammed, and I don't mean once, I mean over and over and over as if the door wasn't shutting properly. This happened at all hours along with parents arguing and children yelling. The bedding was very poor and worn-out. Don't stay here if you have allergies! Free wireless internet was slow and completely down late July 3rd into the evening of July 4th. On the plus side, the hotel is in a convenient location and the staff were helpful and pleasant most of the time. The room description said there would be a mini-bar or frig. This was not true so I asked for one only because I have medication that needs refrigeration. The staff was good enough to put a small frig in my room although it was not very cold. I'm glad others find this hotel satisfactory but I will not stay at this hotel again next time I'm in San Francisco.

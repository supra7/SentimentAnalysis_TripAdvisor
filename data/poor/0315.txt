Guys, avoid this place! Stayed there June 2010. It was first time in my life when after staying I was discovered extra $250 on my card charged. When I called hotel, they said this is "smoking fee" and they can not remove it. The problem: I don't smoke and never smoked and had nobody smoking in the room during my stay. It really looks like rip off!!! Are they so desperate to get extra cash?

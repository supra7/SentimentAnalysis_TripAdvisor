MOST DEF. NOT A "MUST SEE" or "STAY AT" IN FRISCO I was actually fortunate enough NOT to have the displeasure to stay at this hotel. I arrived at around 10:00AM, room wasn't ready, and the bitter manager told me I would have to come back after 1:00 PM. No effort was made by them to acknowledge my patronage, they wouldn't let me register or allow me to leave my luggage with them. That however proved surely a good thing for when I arrived in the evening to finally check in, I was greeted by a locked door. No staff was available on site, and the for assistance number posted-ala Energizer Bunny-kept going and going and ringing really. I was, in retrospect, luckilly forced to go find another hotel. I guess their idea of being a real hotel at 1/2 the price really means only providing 1/2 the service. Even the online Co. I used to book my trip, realized-after contacting the manager-they weren't surprised by my hapless experience.

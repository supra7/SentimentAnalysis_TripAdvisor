First, Didn't realize this was a condo building with Trumps name on it? Although they rent these units out as hotel rooms, this is in no way a typical Vegas Hotel. They should have left it as a condo building for residents only & not opened it to the typical tourist. The overall feel is like visiting your old grandmother on Park Ave: a high-end unit to sleep only & find any reason to get out! Simply nothing to do! Although this just might appeal to the older crowds? Meaning: it's smoke-free, non-gaming, & extremely quite. (except the train honking at all hours of the night). Like every other hotel I have stayed at in Vegas they have endless amenities to keep you from visiting the next hotel. Don't expect a cab to be waiting outside when you decide to go out (OFTEN). There is no cab stand. This hotel isn't on the strip so you will need to walk about 10mins to the nearest hotel. And if you drive, expect a mandatory $14 parking fee. (no-self parking)! So some more of my frustrations & lack of amenities. Only two front desk clerks so check-in took>30mins. Room was spacious with a kitchenette but had no mini bar? So this hotel has over 1200 rooms but only one restaurant/bar, & located in a museum like lobby? Which was very very quite! Oh and it doesn't stay open late. And forget about room service as it wasn't available after 1am? The only attractions are the pool area & spa/fitness room. The one & only pool is very basic & small, but did include a lounge area with bar & tvs. Again very quite & lack of people? Finally the fitness center. Nice cardio machines but limited weight machines & free weights. Oh, & it's $22! (with an empty frig & empty water cooler). Very annoying not to have water when working out. The spa didn't open until 9am so had to walk down the hall to get water from a warm water fountain. Like every hotel I have been too in Vegas there was always excitement in some way. Of all places, Circus Circus could do a better job of entertaining, seriously! If you're into extreme quite, very few people to see/be seen, & lack of amenities, give it a try. Don't say you weren't warned if you do stay here & ask yourself "Am I in Vegas?" _____________________________________

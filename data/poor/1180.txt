When we entered our hotel room, the tables were dirty, along with the floor. The shower curtain did not have any rings on the shower curtain and the the curtain was covering half the bathtub (it was ripped). The water was not even going through in the sink or the bathtub. They have serious plumbing issues. The tables had something sticky all over them. We had to call the hotel management at 12 am to get the water to go through. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. It was horibble. Please do not book it.

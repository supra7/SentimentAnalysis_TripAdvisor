we booked at this hotel because of the great reviews and we were shocked of what we found. the hotel was renevated. the bulding was soraunded of bulding construction, the stairways were dirty and the construction works made lots of noise. we decided not to stay there. louidji the owner said that it was writen about cleaning jpbs- the building was'nt only cleaned it was renaveted. louidji helped us to find another hotel, but he chared us a night's cost because we had to cancel. it is not a hotel- it is a hostel

First impression - a nice, spacious suite. Upon closer inspection, the whole place was grimy. The shower was disgusting and the wall around the faucet had decayed so much the handle was falling out of the wall. The bed was rock hard and had a dirty bedcover. A co-worker reported his bed had a big sag in the middle. Another co-worker was so skeeved he claimed he needed to fumigate his luggage after we left. Have subsequently stayed at another hotel in NYC that was very nice for about the same price. You can do MUCH better.

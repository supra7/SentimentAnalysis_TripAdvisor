I am a long-time fan of Affinia New York hotels. I wanted to try their new Chicago property. After reading the mostly positive reviews, I booked a junior suite for $389. I asked for a guarantee that I would be put into a renovated room as the description of the unrenovated rooms sounded terrible. The main reservation line could not accomodate the request, but put me through to the Chicago office. I was greeted -- then put on hold for almost 15-minutes. I gave up. I tried to go through the main reservation line again and was told that there was no way I could guarantee a renovated room. They put me through (again) to Chicago. The Chicago person repeated that they cannot guarantee a renovated room. Bad marks for treating a loyal guest so shabbily, for the poor phone service, and for the attempt to charge almost $400 for a sub-standard room. I am re-thinking staying at their New York faciities based upon this experience.

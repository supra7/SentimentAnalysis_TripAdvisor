Arrived at hotel to be greeted by friendly, efficient + helpful staff. Went to the room, 1616, to be greeted by a smell of vomit! Informed maid who cleaned carpet + sprayed airfreshner around. When we returned to the room it still stank! Then we noticed the noise.......the kind of noise you hear when you close your eyes on an aircraft, this went on 24 hours a day so we had 4 sleep deprived nights, not able to move rooms as hotel was fully booked and never found out what was causing the noise. On the 2nd day found vomit that I had been assured was cleaned up, got some cleaning materials and cleaned it up myself.......end of smell! As for the rooms, small and unimpressive. Great location but very busy, would stay in hotel away from Times Square next time. Loved New York and it's people, hated the Time Hotel.

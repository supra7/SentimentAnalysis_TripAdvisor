I stayed in a single occupancy room in July 2011. The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in. Just enough room for a small bed, a small wash basin and stool. The bed was short and sunk in the middle which meant I had a very uncomfortable night's sleep. Adding to this, the "Hotel" is in a busy part of town near a fairly major road with alot of traffic and pedestrians at all hours. The walls are thin and you can hear the comings and goings of the other guests throughout the night. The toilet and showers were shared and located in the hall and were extremely small - it was difficult to fit inside and close the door! The shower and toilet did not appear particularly clean either. The building itself is old and the interior has a very "knocked around" feel about it. More like a very average hostel rather than a Hotel. Except they charge high hotel rates! The one redeeming feature is the "Hotel's" location. Easy walking distance to most touristy places in Amsterdam. I didn't need to take trams, I walked everywhere. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of hotels in Amsterdam, many with good, if not better, locations. I would not recommend this hotel to family and friends. Even if you are happy to stay in hostel style accommodation, go elsewhere to get a better rate. This place is very overpriced for what it is.

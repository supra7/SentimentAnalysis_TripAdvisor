We stayed at Harrah's when we were in Las Vegas for a convention. Out of all the hotels this was one of the worst. As soon as you enter the smell of urine, cigarette and Ozium hit you. You have to wait too long in the line just to check in or check out. The staff don't care when you have a problem and they wouldn't move their pinky to help you. The managers are condscending and rude. (They are called VIPs... yeah right!!!) The rooms are small and overpriced. Concierge is clueless about the town. The only dept that was working in this hotel was housekeeping for rooms. There is no security. Don't even consider using the business center unless you want to go broke. The service is always awful. They treat you like garbage at the restaurants and even worse at the front desk. That is if you can wait in the line for a long time and get in. If you go there trust me you will spend most of your time at another hotel like Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, Mirage, Treasure Island or Ceasers so do yourself a favor stay away from Harrah's and book your room in any of these other hotels.

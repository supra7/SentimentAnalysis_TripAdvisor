We decided to stay here for our final nite's stay in Vegas, we had a timeshare the other nites. We walked in and they would not honor the prices that we saw on the website. They said we were staying in the newer section but there was nothing new about it, the steps to the upper level were lopsided. We had to take a hike just to get to the unit passing through another motels property. This place was very noisy and a DUMP!! The room only had 2 large towels and no alarm clock and no hairdryer. The only thing it had was tiny bar of soap. I was almost afraid to sleep on the bed. The sheets did not look that clean to me. The only good thing I can say is that we only had to spend ~5 hours there before it was time to catch our plane. At $60 for a Sunday I didn't think it was a deal at all.

Everything was beautiful until we stepped into the fridgid water at the indoor waterpark. I have two small children and the indoor waterpark was the ONLY reason we decided to stay here..At first glance we were thinking WOW this is going to be WONDERFUL.. so terrible wrong, it was just the opposite. The water and atmosphere was soo chilly that my 3 yr old's chin shivered soo hard that he begged to go back to the room for a hot bath. There is NOT A HOT TUB at all, On the upper level was the two cool slides and the really neat lazy river also EVERY WINDOW was opened and the air was blowing. When we asked why, we got a snappy answer from a cocky "lifegaurd" that is was ventilation control and they get hot. The attendants acted as if they were forced to do community service instead of a paying job. So later that night we decided to try the water park again because that was the reason we paid the pricey amount to stay there, when we arrived we found that not only were the windows still wide open on the upper level, but now they had the 4 sliding glass doors wide open on the lower level.. The only thing that came to my mind was that was just a way to keep people OUT of the waterpark.Make it as miserable as possible. This place was a huge disappointment, we asked for a partical refund and LEFT.. Never to return again.

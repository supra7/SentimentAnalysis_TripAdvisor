We have family of 4 and stay at his hotel Feb 2012, we chose it because of the good reviews we saw. But what a horrible mistake. The outside of the hotel is very nasty looking. The hotel is very old and it looks like green moss is growing on the outside windows. As we entered the hotel, it had a very nasty, and a dirty smell. The room also had a very sour, wet funny smell. The bathroom was very small that you could barely turn around not to mention the tiny tub. The beds were good size and felt comfy. I would not recommend anyone to this hotel and i strongly feel it should be shut down for remodeling. We could not wait until next morning to get out of there.

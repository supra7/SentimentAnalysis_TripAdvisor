The Westin Ka'anapali was not up to regular Westin/ Starwood standards. If you are looking for a cool, sophisticated, upscale hotel - DO NOT book this hotel. My experience at this hotel REALLY makes me question the validity of the other reviews on this hotel OR perhaps the other guests arrived with really low expectations. I am a Starwood Gold Member, I arrived at the hotel at 4pm, stood in a LONG line to check in (did not have a special line for Starwood Preferred Guests), even with a 3pm check in, our room was not ready. We had to wait in the bar for an hour, wouldn't have been so bad if we hadn't flown in from Florida. The hotel is VERY, VERY, VERY crowded. The rooms are sub par, reminded me of a Holiday Inn. Nothing special, certainly nothing luxurious. In addition to the room, I called the Spa several times to make an appt, left messages, however, no one ever called me back. All of this could have been ok (I mean we were in Hawaii) but our room was on the 10th floor with an Oceanview (which of course we paid more for) we were literally in the middles of a CONSTRUCTION ZONE. RIght next to our room was MAJOR Construction, hammering, drilling, walls were coming down, etc. The Hotel Manager was completely non accommodating to me and only offered to move us to a different room (twin Garden view) after my husband called. The fact they put ANYONE in that room OR even on the 10th floor is unbelievable and unacceptable. They also turned off the water due to the construction. They finally moved us to 7 and you could still hear the construction. I understand construction happens but do NOT put guests next to it. Due to the fact they put us in that room and how management's unaccommodating and unprofessional way of handling the situation, I will NEVER stay at Starwood again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

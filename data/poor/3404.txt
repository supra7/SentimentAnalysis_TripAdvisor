Having read some of the positive reviews, it's obvious that the quality of this hotel varies drastically room to room. We, unfortunately, got a terrible one. The headboards on both beds were leaning in and looked as though they'd fall on top of us. The table and chairs were in the same shabby/wobbly condition. The carpet was dingy and puckered up, and the shelf in the shower was missing. But it wasn't just that the place was old - it was also dirty. The carpet had not been vacuumed very well and one of the chairs had a huge stain on the seat. As others have said, the location is great, the parking is free, and the garden/patio areas are nice, but none of that makes up for the outrageous condition of the room. Don't risk it - spend a few extra bucks and stay somewhere else.

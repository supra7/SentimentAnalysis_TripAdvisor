I looked on line to try to find a reasonably priced hotel in New York. Based on the Marrakech website, I though the place was decent. It was not. First, the traveler has to climb a steep flight of steps to get to the lobby. When I got to the room, the lamp needed a light bulb, the room was so hot that I was perspiring. I complained and was moved to another room that required climbing another flight of steps (no elevator, but the website doesn't tell you that). The second room was too cold, but it was late at night and I couldn't go elsewhere. I complained immediately and let the management know that I would not be staying any additional nights. They refused to cancel the second night because I didn't notify them by 3:00 pm. I was on the airplane at 3:00 pm, so had no idea that the Marrakech Hotel website was deceptive. The place was not clean, the so called lounge area was tiny and I was told that the bar was temporarily out of service. This is the worst travel experience I have ever had.

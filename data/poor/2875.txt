Service was very poor, we had a room that was as big as my suitcase, the bathroom wasn't cleaned the way it should have been and the staff was rude. If you stay 2* you can expect something not to be perfect, but to pay this much.....idiots! We went to the Waldorf on the opposite side and were given a congierge room, same price, much better service, very kind staff, complementary newspaper(!!!!!) and no fuss. Much ado about nothing, although Times Square seems to be better. Anyway, we're NEVER going to stay in a W hotel again.

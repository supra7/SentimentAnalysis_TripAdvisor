Not a good Experience Resort just opened in October of 2008. This should have been a signal. But we went anyway. Hotel is/ was not ready to open. Numerous mechanical problems.. TV's didn't work, Lack of hot water at all times. Power outages every day, No shower head installed in one of the three rooms we moved to. (When shower was turned on the water came thru the ceiling in the next room thru an open pipe in the ceiling that should have been connected to the missing shower head. ) Staff was totally overwhelmed, undertrained and really didn't understand or know how to respond to all the issues. Their response was to offer a 25 minute massage at the sister resort ( their own spa was not even built yet although they advertised having one.) if you released them from all responsibility. My main complaint was the fact that I paid for a one bedroom Suite but never got to stay in one for the entire 7 days. We were takened to one on the second night but it was missing an extra bed (which we specified upfront, had two non working TV's and of course had the imfamous no shower head and very flooded bathroom when we turned on the shower.) Most of the staff tried to be nice but generally was so distracted with the problems they were simply ineffective. I tried to turn in my beach towel one evening and the staff absolutely refused to take it. You could be having a focused one on one conversation with the staff and they would simply start doing something totally unrelated ( walk away, start another conversation with someone else, claim no english understanding, etc. It was like being with a group of puppies with a 5 second attention span. Give them a year or so to get the problems worked out before you go. I'm currently working on getting a refund for the difference in the One Bedroom Suite I paid for vs the room we actually stayed in. I will update the reveiw to tell you how that goes. It DID NOT go well at the resort so I'm working thru my travel Agency.

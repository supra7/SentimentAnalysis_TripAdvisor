Unfortunately our guestroom was located above the outside exit of the hotel lounge. When the club let out early Monday morning, we were startled awake from the loud, obnoxious people outside. There was no soundproofing in the windows, so we heard everything. We heard the screaming, a fight that broke out, drunk people yelling, extremely loud bass from a car that rattled our room, and when the police arrived. The police presence did little to calm the crowd down, with drunk people yelling at the police. I would have liked the staff to be a bit more apologetic than they were. I also would have appreciated some sort of discount for the room, since I was kept up for about an hour and a half while these issues took place. My likelihood to stay at this hotel would be low. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends or colleagues based upon our experience. Soundproof windows are a must, especially in a hotel that sells itself as being upscale. Needless to say, I was disappointed.

So the hotel has some rooms that are older, a little worn out. like this one. Okay. I paid in that category. I also paid for a "ROOM WITH A VIEW OF THE STRIP" per their website. I got a room with a view of a parking garage and a partial view of the tops of a few buildings. And was charged the rate for a full view room. And upon complaint was told, well, you had a kinda sorta partial view so that's good enough for you, and worth the additional $20 you paid for our kind of older, worn out room that SUPPOSEDLY HAD A VIEW OF THE STRIP. There are a million hotels in Vegas, most of them with better deals that $69 on a weeknight for an old room WITHOUT THE VIEW THIS PRICE CLASS ADVERTISED ON THE WEB. There are a million hotels in Vegas, ALMOST ALL of them with better customer service than this. Hmmm... why do you think Harrah's almost ALWAYS has available rooms? Hmmmm....did it ever occur to you that one of the people staying in one of your rooms might be a travel writer? Hmmmm...

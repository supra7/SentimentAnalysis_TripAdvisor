The TIME Hotel's website was slick and stylish, like a better version of the W Hotel chain. We were impressed with the central Time Square location and our being able to nab a $180 per night rate. When we arrived in our room we were shocked to look out our window at a solid brick wall within touching distance of a dank and dark alley. When we complained to the front desk, we were offered a room for $200 that looked out onto a noisy side street, but had some light. We immediately noticed that our tiny yet trendy, stylish room was worn and dirty all over, but the rest of the areas hotels were full for the Tony Awards and we prebooked our room for a week. Each day we left a nice tip for the maid in hopes that she would make an extra effort to clean our room. No such luck. We even noticed a used length of dental floss in the hallway and laughed each day we saw it. The only cleaning the maid did was the removal of our daily $$$ tip on our pillow for her. The used floss was how we based the daily progress of the hotel cleaniness. Not well indeed. We finally got tired of our shabby digs and tried to talk to a hotel manager who was always in a meeting, although the hotel is tiny. We did finally get the last night comped by the manager, and the "upgrade" charge removed per night. A fair compensation for a disappointing week at the Time Hotel.

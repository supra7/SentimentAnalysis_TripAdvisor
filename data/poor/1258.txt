This hotel was very cheap but there were problems. The sink and bathroom wall was dirty. Once I pulled back the sheets, there were greasy looking stains, along with something reddish brown smeared on the sheets, along with a hole. I called the front desk and was told that they would check to see if there were clean sheets and bring them to my room. The hotel staff came to the room with the blanket. I explained the blanket was fine and showed him the sheets. He went back downstairs and returned later with two flat sheets. I took them and had to change the linen myself. YUCK!! With another "!" During the night my family and I sweated so bad we were wet. The air was turned down as low as possible and blowing as hard as it could. However it just did not work. I spoke to the manager at checkout and he was completely unconcerned. Probably had heard the complaint before and just didn't do anything about it. His attitude was "Oh really. So what...I got your money. Now get out. Too bad for you." He did nothing. So I'm doing what I can by giving him some free advertisement. Travelers spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere that will be cool and clean.

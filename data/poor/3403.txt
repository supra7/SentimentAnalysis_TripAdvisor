This is a dirty little hotel with guetto cleaning ladies that are laughing an talking loud first thing in the morning. The tv was as big as a portable radio and just about everything in the room was broken in some way. No hair dryer, ice, or wet bar. The breakfast is never there on time and is cold. The coffee is disgusting and the cream was sour. The female receptionist was rude and acted bothered everytime I asked her for something even though all she does all day is it around on her butt. If you want to impress someone this isn't the place. If you don't want to stay in a hostell and are totally broke with no standards then this is the place for you. This is a nasty little hotel and looks like a place porno movies would be filmed! Never again! Gross!!!!!

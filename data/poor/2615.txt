We were looking forward to staying at a quaint family run hotel but we couldn't have been more disappointed. My friend arrived the day before I did and was offered room 104 off of the courtyard, instead of the 2nd floor room that we were originally suppose to stay in. Since this seemed reasonable, she agreed. What a disaster!! It started when entering the room and having the room door handle fall off in her hand...it went downhill from there. The smell of the room was awful. She was told that this was an old building and she may not be "used" to the musty smell. "Musty" doesn't even come close to describing it. After trying to put up with the smell and finding that it was almost unbearable, she requested a change in rooms - but was told they were booked full and we couldn't be moved. The entire place needs to have a deep cleaning. There was black mold very visible in the bathroom corners/ceiling and on the bath mat. Moths were flying around in the room. We could have put up with the holes in the walls and the worn furniture but the lack of cleanliness was appalling. We didn't unpack anything as we didn't want the smell and anything else invading our clothing. Our belongings still picked up the odor of the room and it was very noticeable when we moved to a new hotel. The room was so dim, even with every light turned on, that you couldn't read a book. Parking is free but make sure that you realize it is 5 blocks away. Thank goodness we were able to find another hotel. A positive - they didn't hold us to their 72 hr cancellation requirement but we did give them a 24 hr notice as we couldn't immediately get into another hotel. While it was in a convenient location, there are certainly more options available. I would never consider going back to this hotel.

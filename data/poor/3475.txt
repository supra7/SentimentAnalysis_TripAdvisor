We stayed at the Marrakech for one evening while in NYC for the night - I have stayed in better roadside motels for 1/2 the price, and have stayed in places in the city 3x as nice for less money. First, there are no elevators, the room numbering system makes NO sense, so we spent 15 mins walking up and down stairs trying to figure out which floor our room was on. Once we arrived to our room, it was understandably small, but the toilet had clearly been recently used, and not properly flushed. There was no closet, and our room did not even have a clock. The bed was beyond uncomfortable, the shower controls were automagically switching between hot/cold, and I could not wait to leave. I am sorry, but I do not have a single positive thing to say about the property or my stay there.

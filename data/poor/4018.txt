I stayed in Park Guest House for a night (3rd May) before continuing my travel plans to China. I was scheduled to return to HK to stay in Park Guest House for 2 more nights (6th & 7th May) after returning from China. Upon check-in, we were ushered into Hollywood Guest House instead of Park Guest House with no Internet access, and extremely noisy construction work on a Sat noon. The owner' Fillipino maid immediately returned us HKD680 when we wanted to call the police. I decided to stay in another Guest House on the same level with no construction noise at price HKD220 a night. On that same night, this demanding owner from Park Guest House came to quarrel with the worker from the neighbor guest house and even hit him. Despite giving the owner verbal prior notice 2 days in advance, that I am staying only a night, instead of 2 nights she wanted to charge me HKD1,030 for both nights. She took advantage of the situation as she has confirmation on paper that booking was made for 2 nights. Eventually a police report was made against Park Guest House to safe-guard my interest as I did not stayed with Park Guest House on the 2 nights. Although Park Guest House is indeed one of the more popular Guest House, with clean rooms. However charges is over-priced for HKD680 a night as their neighbor guest house is only charging HKD220 with the same cleanliness. It was overall an unpleasant experience with Park Guest House and definately not value for money.

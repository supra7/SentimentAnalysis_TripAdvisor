I found a great rate on the web site. $169....total bill around $200 for one night. The good news was that it was only one night. The service was lousy starting with a long wait for check in... they didn't have any rooms ready at 4:30 pm and no they couldn't upgrade us. 90 min later the room we got was small, so cramped that you had to almost leap over the beds. The room over overly hot.. so that we sweated non-stop and the front-desk could do nothing to help us. The shower in the tiny bathroom had a drain that was plugged so 6-8 inches of dirty water accumulated in the tub during a shower. There were multiple room service trays left in the dark, dingy hallway overnight, ripe for someone to trip over. Finally when we checked out, the front desk woman, who had horrible teeth and bad English took my complaint about the room and told me she would pass the comments on, but could do nothing about the bill. Even though it has been almost 18 months since I stayed there, the experience was so terrible that (1) it is fresh in my mind and (2) I shudder whenever I see a W hotel anywhere. do not stay here even it is was free! I was prompted to write this review after reading an article about tripadvisor in the NYT.

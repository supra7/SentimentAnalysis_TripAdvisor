Forego the Pink, cause it do STINK As seasoned travelers and frequent Hawaii visitors (we are the top level on both Hilton and Starwood, and Platinum on Hyatt) we have admittedly come to be quite demanding in our choice of hotels. But when you pay the big bucks for a well known, and almost revered Hawaiian hotel like the Pink Palace, you expect a little more...read on.We were told we were upgraded to an ocean view because of our Platinum starwood status. Although you could see the ocean, it was a poor view overlooking large green pipes in the foreground, and a small window (befitting the small room). The room was dinky, and shockingly dirty. This Sheraton was in one of the worst if not the worst conditions we have seen. The carpet was stained, the wallpaper was in disrepair, there were water stains by the air conditioning outlets, the bathroom had not been dusted. The shower was curtained, and was missing the normal curved out shower rod we have come to expect with the Starwood chain. While showering, you constantly were rubbed against by the wet shower curtain because the tub was so small. I wouldn't have dreamed of taking a bath because the room was so dirty.To be fair, the hallways and grounds are lovely and charming. The doors to the rooms are carved and gorgeous. But although we had booked a five-night stay, we checked out after one day and moved to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (which was heaven -- check out my review of this property if you want).We did complain about the room, but it was clear from the response of the front desk that they really didn't care. The employees and management of the revered Pink Palace have become complacent. Until they change their tune, our advice is STAY AWAY.

taxi does not come here as it is the busiest place, so walk with luggage for 10 min at least to reach the place. than the rooms are so small and bathroom is as good as one in the aircraft. try something else instead if you value your stay and money we left the place next day. again when u leave walk a while with luggage on busy roads to get taxi isnt that terrible.

My colleagues and I found this hotel to be shockingly substandard, with no "lobby" to speak of, which makes me wonder why the follow-up email even asks people to rate it. The front entrance looks like an ugly old warehouse. Inside, the moldy smells which permeate hallways and rooms are offensive. When I had to cover my nose while stepping off the elevator I knew I was in trouble. To tell you the truth, I would have returned home before sleeping in this hotel. The four of us tried to leave graciously but to no avail. So we were charged for rooms we never used. The New York Helmsley, however, was a wonderful place to stay.

Worst stay ever. I do a lot of travel and this is by far the worse hotel I have stayed at. Nothing worked including phone, internet etc. I ordered room service and when I called 1.5 hours later they said for me to come down and get it. Then were nice enough to tell me that they would waive the room service charge sicne I had to come get it. The only good thing about this place is the location. The manager was very short and seemed not to care.

This was the worst luxury hotel I've ever stayed at. Its a horrible value for the money. There is no breakfast included. I've never stayed at a hotel that didn't serve at least cold cereal. There is room service from the Dragonfish restaurant downstairs, but its very overpriced and of poor quality food. The heater in our room was horrible, once turned on the room was filled with the odour of urine, making the room impossible to breath in. The walls are thin and noise travels very easily. The staff was unfriendly save for person who checked us in. The person who checked us out didn't even ask how our stay was. By the time I got my bill and saw they charged for parking, I was fed up. What incredible rip off!

We are here on our honeymoon. The Hyatt hotels on Kauai and Oahu were amazing. The Maui Hyatt is not. We leave during the day just to get away from here. We've filed a formal complaint with the hotel, but they said a refund needs to come from our travel agent because it was pre-paid. 1. The Maui Hyatt is under major construction. The lobby construction was apparently planned, but they found cracks around the outside of the building which needed emergency repair. We hear the construction during the day. There is a penguin exhibit under scaffolding. The penguins are hiding in a corner shaking. It's very sad!!!! We were never warned of the construction. 2. Pool chairs are pushed together in rows, like sardines. It's really odd. You can't slide between chairs to lay down...you have to get on from the front of the chair and inch back. 3. They have turned the back service entrance into the lobby entrance because of the lobby construction. 4. We have to park in a self park area which has parking spots the size of golf carts...because that's what they're for. 5. Self parking lot is dark and dangerous. Employee told me that's where they park and they've been requesting lighting for years, but management has done nothing. He also says there have been car thefts because of the lighting. 6. The view from our hotel room is of a cemetery. 7. There is a crazy amount of birds that fly into the breakfast restaurant. I'm talking hundreds. They sit watching you and fly under your table to get crumbs. If you leave your seat for a second, they swarm your food. They have green fake owls as a lame attempt to keep them away, but the birds actually land on them. 8. Rooms are outdated. 9. Low water pressure. 10. There is no beach. 11. Internet is slow at all hotels, but at this one the connectivity is intermittent. Best thing about the hotel is the pool bar and the waterslide. We leave Maui on Thursday. If we were staying any longer, we would have checked into another hotel.

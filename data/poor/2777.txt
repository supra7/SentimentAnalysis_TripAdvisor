I booked the hotel thru priceline and stayed in a room on the 15th floor. Horrible is the simplest way to put it. The room is very small and not safe (electrical is not stable, faucet keeps dripping). It looks like the hotel added these rooms to give to priceline buyers with no regard to safety. This hotel should be rated zero stars

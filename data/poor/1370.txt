Not Finished As of this writing, this hotel is not yet complete. Not even close really. Our room seemed fine at first, but then stuff stopped working. We had no hot water in our jacuzzi, the safe malfunctioned, and then the light fixture over the toilet started leaking water all night ?!?!? There are exposed electrical wires, and we were awakened at 8:30 to the sounds of continuing construction. Not all of the restaurants are open, and the ones that are are not that great. If you are planning to stay here within the next few months, I would strongly recommend finding somewhere else. Thats what we are trying to do less than 24 hours after checking in.

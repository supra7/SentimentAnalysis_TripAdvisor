I made a hotel reservation online, and received a Confirmed Reservation for an Ocean Front Suite, described as and "Ocean front suite with full view of the Pacific Ocean from the guest room". I then made plane reservations and other plans based on the room's promised availability. When I arrived they told me that, despite my Confirmed Reservation, they had given away my room to someone else, and gave me a room with a view of the opposite building and a concrete pool area. I told them this was completely unacceptable. They just said "I'm sorry" and did nothing to correct the problem. No manager ever returned my call or contacted me. They were completely non-responsive. To add insult to injury, upon returning home I find they have charged my credit card $5,000

We have just arrived from las Vegas. If you are travelling for visit never stay here. First it is really like 4 blocks from the strip. Street is lonely, near low category hotels and many solicitors. I have stayed in many marriotts (fort laud. aruba, cancun, miami, orlando etc.) This is the worth. We stayed for 7 nights and our room was not clean up three times. The first time I called they said the privacy card was outside, (not true) We went out about 11:30 am. The second time it was very late, I called the manager. He was so rude. So next day I called customer service at marriott and they talked with the manager who call us to talk with us. We explain this lady what happened. You wont believe it that night when we came back (our last night) the didnt clean the room. AMAZING!!!!! The pool is really smalll, we never use it. At night when the dinning room was close.It is near the elevators it really smells bad like food or grease. Only one person at reception,No bell man This hotel really was a disaster for us!!!!!

I don't know where to begin! First of all, I do want to give props and say that Hotel Felix is very clean and a classy place. However, customer service does not exist here and the rooms are only made to fit the bed, and that is it. We booked our 2 night 3 day stay through Priceline, first mistake. We received a 1 queen size bed for 4 people. When we arrived, luckily they had a King size bed open for the night, but for 2 queens it was going to be an additional $65/night. We had agreed that the next day we would move to a queen size bed room. The next day, they call and tell us that we need to leave and re-priceline to get the same rate. After discussing we had already paid for two nights they realized this was their issue, and had us move out promptly, put our bags in bag check and wait a few hours before our queen size bed room was ready. What if we needed to be in our room, what if someone was sick? This didn't occur to them. We get into the room later that afternoon. The next day we're about to check out and realize we had forgotten a purse in the previous room. Instead of hospitality letting us know that, we called to the front desk and they told me I would have to file a claim to lost and found. Then all of a sudden, I was put on hold, and told it would be right up. It was soon brought up with a few things missing. Clearly, they were going to keep it, until someone claimed it. In conclusion, this is a nice place for 1-2 people, and do not ask for any upgrades, and do not expect an organized hotel, nor nice customer service/hospitality.

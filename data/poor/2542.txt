Regrettably, in its class it falls way short of what we expected. What were the problems? In order of our experience: inoperative internet; no hot water in sinks or tub; very lame recommendations from the concierge which did not comport to our express preferences (we wound up resorting to our guide book which was much better); muffed room service orders two out of three meals; inability to soft boil an egg in their restaurant after two tries;inattentive if not surly service at the bar; and an inability to provide a breakfast prior to our 7 am departure for the airport. When a facility proudly holds itself out as world class, there is much room for disappointment, and that is the room we found at this hotel

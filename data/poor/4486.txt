we stayed there fortunatelly only for a night on our way to canary islands. it is a dark place!the rooms are from the 70's,there was not enough lighting in the corridors,breakfast was the worst i have ever eaten in a crowded undergound restaurant. even the locals don't have good opinion about this hotel and certainly they are right! the only good think about this property is the very good location and that's all!keep away!

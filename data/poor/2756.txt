Ok folks, after reading the reviews I was prepared for basic accomodations, etc. I have got to tell you I was deeply disappointed. The lobby is decieving, it's the only clean place in the hotel. This place is filfthy!! Run the air conditioner if you dare, it looked like the filter hadn't been changed in years. Obviously the management does not take any pride in this property anymore. There were so many layers of dirt on the carpets (in the corners) and the shared bathrooms are run down; cracked tile and the toilet had feces stains down the front that stayed for a number of days. I really don't know what the housekeeping staff does here. Also there are some type of bugs because we kept waking up with bites all over. I will admit the staff was more friendly than I anticipated, however it does not make up for the deplorable conditions. The only plus is the price (you get what you paid for) and the location which is amazing. Bottom line is this place is a dump.

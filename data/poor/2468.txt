We were not impressed with this hotel at all. The rooms were nothing special and the service was terrible. There was a $25.00 a day resort fee which I am not opposed to if there was something we could have used at the 'resort'. Everything was extra. Even the steam room. Not sure what the $25.00 extra charge was actually for. I would never stay here again.

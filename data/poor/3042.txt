Our family has loved going to Phoenix for 9 years. We have stayed at this resort every year! This is our last. NEVER STAY HERE unless you want to have horrible service, no chairs, to get hit in the face with footballs with parents saying that if there kids meant to kit you that they would have hit you harder. We work hard for vacations and want to enjoy it. We did not expect the Phoenician but we weren't expecting less that Motel 6! (Sorry for the insult Motel 6!) Next time we will stay there or at lest somewhere that advertises themselves as a 4 star resort....Have never been more disappointed and are trying to get a flight home early from a much disappointing vacation....

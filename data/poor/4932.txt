Stayed at Summer Bay in Vegas for 8 nights as part of a wedding/vacation trip. Should have listened to the negative reviews. The place is under construction which we didn't have a problem with, although in the 9 days we were there, there was no construction taking place. We were traveling with my daughter who has food allergies and a place to stay with a kitchen sounded ideal so we could monitor her food. We landed early, did our grocery shopping and checked in. The setup looked really nice. However after being in the room for a while we were able to tell how dirty the room was. The kitchen counters were discolored from not being cleaned, the ice maker didn't work, the hot water faucet in the shower didn't work, bulbs burnt out in the kitchen and a leak under the garbage disposal in the kitchen. All were fixed except the burnt out lights in the kitchen and the cleaning of the room. Housekeeping did a really lousy job cleaning. They didn't even make the beds, we did! The rug in the living area was filthy. The bottoms of my wife's socks were black after walking around for 10 minutes. The rollout couch was a joke. My daughter usually sleeps on a rollout queen when we travel together but this sleeper was a joke. We complained, our complaints were written down, but nothing was done. We explored the grounds one day with some friends looking for a gas grill that worked. Three out of the four we tried, didn't work. Walking over to the office one morning we overheard the people in front of us with some of the same complaints we had. They have stayed there the past few years and said his was the last time they would stay there. If we had not gone grocery shopping for the week we were there, we would have checked out and moved to a hotel on the strip. So if your feeling lucky, and your draw building 9 room 210, craps you lose.

Avoid staying here. Bliss bath products and great bed cannot make up for the tremendous street noise. Even 15 stories up in a room billed as "spectacular," we were woken by seven (7!!) different fire engine runs blaring down Lexington at different times of the night. With the windows firmly latched, every bang and honk of the street fills the rooms --- almost all of the rooms face a busy street. This place is like sleeping on the sidewalk.

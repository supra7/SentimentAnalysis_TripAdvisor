Please spend your money elsewhere. My experience here was horrible. I noticed when trying to book my room through the Wynn/Encore website that it didn't give you an option of 1K or 2Q beds. So before booking the room through the website, I called the front desk at Encore and asked them how I can specify that I want 2Q beds. I was told to put a note under the comments that I want 2Qs. I even called the morning I was leaving for Vegas and the representative confirmed I will be getting a room with 2Q beds. I got to the hotel and was told they do not have a 2Q room available to me but a complimentary roll away bed will be sent to our room within the next few minutes. We waited for over an hour until we decided to call housekeeping and they told us they will be bringing one over within the next half hour. 30 min later...nothing. We called again and housekeeping would not pick up, so we called guest services and were told we would get the roll away soon. Since we were going out that evening, we told them they can enter the room and leave the bed there. We came back at 2am and there was still no extra bed! We called housekeeping and they finally fessed up that they have no more roll aways available. That was all the explanation we got from them. So we spoke with one of the hotel managers (probably an assistant manager) and all he kept offering us was a $50 resort credit for the inconvenience. After he got the point that we were still very upset and would much rather get our second bed, SUDDENLY there just happened to be an available room with 2Q's at 4am! The fact that it took that much work to get our well deserved 2nd bed is ridiculous. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS HOTEL! I have NEVER had such a problem at the Venetian and Palazzo.

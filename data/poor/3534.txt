Let me add to the Fall 2006 criticisms. Fresh paint throughout the hotel was nauseating and gave me a sore throat. The desk crew did not say one word about the paint upon check-in. My room was stark and dismal. The only light was from the ceiling fan - no lamps on the nightstands. There was no television. The window air conditioner was a tiny consumer model that went on the fritz in the middle of the night and made horrible noise, forcing me to turn it off. (It was unusually warm this night) The bathroom had 2 towels, both bath-sized. There were no washcloths or hand towels. They had been laundered in detergent that smelled strongly of pine. The bed linens smelled similarly. And the mattress was hard as wood. Bottom line: I'm glad I was only here overnight. The $124 Travelocity price was the big draw here, but I will now be much more willing to pay more for a decent NYC hotel room.

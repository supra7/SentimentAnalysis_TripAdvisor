Booked this hotel and requested double beds and when i went to check in no double beds. A queen room is way too small for a cot even. The hotel staff was unaccomidating in every way possible and not friendly at all. When you call the hotel the staff is not even pleasant. This is a stuck up hotel and it is not all that by any means. PLEANTY of other FABULOUS boutique Hotels near by for great prices!! THINK TWICE before you book!!!!!!

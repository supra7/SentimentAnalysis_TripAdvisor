Attended a conference. Service was awful. Meeting room was moldy. Pool has little/no service. Children running wild. You have to get your own towels. The food and drinks are double the price of the Westin Kierland. Our room was in the main building. The terrace outside our room had meetings held. Imagine my surprise to walk outside my room in the morning to have a man standing outside it smoking. We asked to move to the Ocatilla our last few nights. We were told we would be called when the room was ready (they had told us specifically what room we would have). We arrived at the hotel and were told that we had been moved to the Paradise wing because there were no rooms in Ocatilla. We asked to speak to the manager several times, but were told she was too busy. With MUCH ADO, after 30 minutes they miraculously found the room. We were told it was a sales room, and by giving it to us, it would be costing them sales. My husband asked that a manager call us, but that never happened. The rooms in the Ocatilla were nicer, much more modern. Again, NO SERVICE at the pool, except for 1 morning. Towels never picked up or replaced at the pool. All rooms are a long walk. Self parking has very few spaces. We have stayed at the Royal Palms, Phoenician, and Westin Kierland, and this hotel doesn't even compare. The Adobe Golf course was like a poor public course, no elevations, no trees, etc. Unfortunately, our conference is here again next year. We wil not spend any extra time here.

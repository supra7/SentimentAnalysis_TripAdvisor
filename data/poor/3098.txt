Booded this "Junior Suite" one month in advance, called the morning of our stay to make sure all was well and "Juan" said, "Yes, you have an oceon front Junior Suite!"! I was happy and picked up my daughters and headed down to the beach, we checked in at 4 and he didn't say a word, got into my one bed dinky crummy room. Called the desk and said "This is NOT a suite by any means", they said "Oh, tomorrow you can have one, and we'll give ;you a discount for today". The worst part is that the second day, when we DID move to the nice Junior suite, in a Big Hurry, my 9 year old left her 200.00 Nintendo with games in a drawer. We called about it, the maid knew nothing, the next resident who was a scary Black haired woman with a daughter said nothing was there, so, some adult STOLE my daughter's Nintendo. Totally sucked. The beach is fun of course.. Lesson learned is when you get down to this area, trust no-one and everyone is after your money and your stuff, even your children's stuff. Sad but true. Lock up.

I would never stay here again for the price paid, $120 plus tax. Apparentely prices were jacked up for a parade downtown, since all other weekends seem to be around $89. The place is OLD. It smells like cigarettes. We requested a non-smoking room, we ended up with a smoking room with no way to change it. There was no hair dryer and we called down for one, the guy said he'd 'try' to find us one. We ended up having to call back when no one showed up with it after 30 minutes, he thought we needed it for morning. Bad customer service. The place is just really old and disappointing for that amount of money. I truly felt the need to wash my hands after touching anything in the room. It needs a gutting and remodel BAD. I really don't feel the 2 star rating was correct for this establishment. =

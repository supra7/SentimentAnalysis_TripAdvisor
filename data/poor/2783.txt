My husband and I were in town to see a Broadway show, and stayed in a room on the 3rd floor on a Saturday night. All we heard until 3 am was the bass from the nightclub/lounge on the 2nd floor. We had the bathroom fan, the heater fan, and a white noise machine all running, but they weren't able to drown out the sound. The room itself was fine, but old. There was mold in the bathroom, and the carpet clearly hadn't been shampooed in years. The staff member who checked us out the next morning didn't bother to ask us how our stay was, probably because he knew we wouldn't have good things to say.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in early-March of 2007. I was eight months pregnant and it was our last chance to travel for a while so we thought we would get away to New Orleans for the weekend. I have family there so we go several times a year, so we aren't traditional tourists...we know our way around pretty well. The location of this hotel was wonderful, just a couple of blocks from the market and Cafe Du Monde. Unfortunately that was the only thing it had going for it. There were two men who alternated the front desk position, and neither of them were friendly. Trying to get our car out of the garage was a huge hassle, even though we asked their policy when we checked in, and called and gave them plenty of notice they were very rude about it. Our room was very disappointing. Run down and the only window was in the door, and the blinds didn't fully cover it so you felt like anyone could look in at any minute. However, the worst part would be the roaches; we killed several huge ones. I woke up to find one on my pillow! When my husband went to talk to the man at the front desk, he basically said it's a historic property and to get over it..there was nothing they could do. I feel like they use this "historic property" excuse to tourists but I don't buy it. That's why you should have a pest service. Needless to say we won't be going back.

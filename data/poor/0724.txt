Unfortunately, the Hyatt came up extremely short with their property in Maui. My husband and I were excited to be in Hawaii for our honeymoon and really looking forward to our stay at the Hyatt, which is generally a name you can trust. After a rather confusing check in (we were told our reservation was cancelled when it had been confirmed 2 days earlier) we were on our way to our room. The lobby was a little dated and felt more old Hawaiian but we were just excited to see the ocean, pool and check out the restaurants the hyatt website raved about. Upon entering the room, it seemed nice. We had an ocean deluxe room. As we got into the room and looking around, suddenly the age of this hotel came through. Not only were the bathrooms mildew ridden, but the walls were covered with water stains and peeling wallpaper. The deck looked as if though it had never been cleaned...the deck floor felt like sticky movie theater floors. To our horror we then saw a bug on the bed pillow...which as you can imagine lead to more bugs in the bed as we took the linens down. The headboard was full of dust. It was just gross! We called the front desk and were only offered a comparable room, but that housekeeping would come up right away to check out our room....housekeeping never came, management never showed a sign they cared about our sad experience even after showing them the bugs. We had a really nice hotel check in woman apologize but she was the only one. We never stayed at the hotel bc of the horrible service and lack of care. We told the hotel we were going to another hotel. They called us a cab and left us with the 30 dollar cab bill. Way to stick it to us hyatt! We ended up staying at the Ritz in kapalua and quickly realized THAT is what a honeymoon should be and surprisingly the cost wasn't that much more. I have always loved every hyatt I stay in with this location obviously being the exception. Don't waste your time and money here until they give the hotel a facelift.

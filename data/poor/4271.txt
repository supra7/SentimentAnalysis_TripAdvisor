Dirty. I got an upgraded room and it was filthy, the phone did not work, the minibar was not working, one television was not working. I requested nonsmoking and got a smoking room. We had to leave the windows open. Housekeeping had to be called to bring coffee, even though they saw that we had used the one in the room when we arrived. I told the person at the desk and they offered nothing. NEVER AGAIN!!!

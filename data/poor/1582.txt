The price was right - $79, but it cost us alot more in the long run. And the property is adjacent to the highway - NOISY!!! Our truck was broken into - even though we parked under lights and in front of the rooms. Security cameras in the parking lot are ill positioned and only covered a small portion of the lot. The staff was indifferent - Habib was on duty and really didn't care. The Dallas PD took four hours to provide a "telephone" report. It would have taken 4 days to get the crime scene team out to take evidence. We could have stayed at a five star hotel for what this experience cost us........

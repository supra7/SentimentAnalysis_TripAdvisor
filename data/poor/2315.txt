Where do I start? 25 dollars a day for compulsory parking, no free refills of water in fridge, no free bottles of water in the gym, charging for beach umbrellas, rude reception staff, rude valet staff, rip off prices in all eating establishments, non plussed managers - I could go on. I would class myself as a seasoned traveller and I would never recommend this hotel at all. The Four Seasons down the road was far superior, and quite rightly is top of the trip advisor listings. I'm not too sure why I am paying 500 dollars a night here, but I am here on a family holiday, that I did not book. It's about Motel 6 standard.

Hotel desk person argumentative. Had one traveler in tears. Room had queen sheets on king bed, didn't stay tucked in. Found trash on the floor from previous guest. Bathroom tiles moldy. Checking out, desk attendant was arguing with another person who was having trouble. Room was across from laundry/maid service and at 6am, the maids were visiting, loudly. Advertised continental breakfast, which was very very minimal. Advertised coffee pot in room. Was none. At least the TV worked!

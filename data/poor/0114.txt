This was absolutely the WORST hotel we have ever stayed at! We found it through Seattle Bed and Breakfast web site (http://www.seattlebedandbreakfast.com/012.shtml), and were fooled by the pictures of a Victorian house, a garden, and a nice breakfast. Here is what we got in reality for our $136 ($105 per night+tax+$15 parking fee): -extremely noisy place: construction site right in front of the hotel -no breakfast at all -old, run down building outside and inside -smelly hallways and stairwells -no elevator (we don't care about this, but it may be important for some people) -badly peeling paint in the bathroom (see pictures) -refrigerator that made frequent loud noises, which was a lot of fun at night -cracked and clogged bathroom sink -when we tried to open the windows, the one in the kitchen did not stay open, the other one did, but did not have a window screen, so we ended up with a swarm of flies in the first 10 minutes. -uncomfortable bed -WI-FI Internet that hardly worked (takes 10 minutes for pages to load) On the plus side, the hotel is very conveniently located close to the Space Needle and the front desk staff are all very nice. But overall, you get a hugely overpriced motel experience.

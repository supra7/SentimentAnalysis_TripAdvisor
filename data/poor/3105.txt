This is not a place for families with kids! Pacific Beach is a college age party beach. Alcohol is allowed on the beach and the twenty-somethings take full advantage of it. This is a beach for locals, not visitors. (There's also a really bad rip tide). I didn't like exposing my kids to the drunkeness, smoking, cursing and other rowdy behavior and checked out after one day. NO A/C was a big problem. The nice ocean breeze was ruined by cigarette smoke from our neighbors, delivery trucks out back, and young people yelling at each other all night long somehow creatively working the "F" word into every sentence. And did I mention they charged $300/night for this??? (Should be under $100) We checked out and went to The Hotel Del for $335/night and had an absolutely fabulous stay (as usual, we've been there before). Forget trying new things, you just can't do better than The Del.

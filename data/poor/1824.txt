I was very much looking forward to staying at this property. I work in the business, so I understand how hotels operate. Check in was very nice, the staff was friendly and helpful to me and my guests. The room was fine, nothing more or less than expected. The hotel was under construction, but still was kept neat. My problem came later on in the evening. The hotel reservation was in my name only, so you would think that I would be the only once accessible to room keys (for security reasons.) I went out for the night with a few friends, and came back to someone else sleeping in my bed! (The person was a friend of mine who knew I was staying at the hotel, but I was not planning on them staying. It wasnt even a friend that I went out with, or knew my room number!) I went to the front desk and asked why someone besides me was given keys to the room and they said they had security bring them up. Regardless, I was very unhappy that this whole thing happened (for obvious safety reasons!!!) I was given no apology while I was expressing my concern.

My husband and I booked 10 nights here for a relaxing holiday. It was sold to us as a 4.5 star hotel, ideal for relaxing. What they failed to mention was the fact the hotel were building a new restaurant right next to the beach and pool which meant rather than being able to read our books in peace we were forced to listen to either the building work (while at the beach) or the music they put on to drown out the building work (while at the pool). They were also carrying out repair work (which the hotel desperately needs) which mainly consisted of banging (again not relaxing) and building a new block of rooms (which involved using a JCB on our last few days there. Unfortunately this was not our only complaint, others include: 2) Service in restaurants - served under cooked fish in Asian restaurant, often waiting 15mins before even got menu, drinks frequently didn't appear, ordered water without ice and fish, got water with ice and chicken! 3) Cleanliness of room - cigarette butt was missed on every clean, dead insects in canopy. 4) General state of repair on room - back door broken, rust in bathroom, aircon broke on 2nd day, bathroom scales not working, bedside light and light on balcony not working 5) Toiletries in bathroom were not re-stocked you had to ask each time you ran out of something. 6) My note of all things wrong with the hotel disappeared 7) Never received voice messages from holiday rep who was dealing with our complaints. I could go on but I feel I have already wasted two weeks of my life by going there and do not want to waste any more.

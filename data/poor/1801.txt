I stayed one night while attending the American Legion's Department of Maryland Convention. My advanced reservation listed, but didn't guarantee, a second floor room in the main building. I was assigned a ground floor room in the annex building at check-in. There were several "vacancy" signs at some of the chain motels, so I'm sure I could have found a more modern one for the same amount of money or slightly more. The website pictures don't show the outdated bathroom and fixtures. My bathroom was a green color with very old fixutures, including a slightly rocking toilet. There was only a small shelf space above the non-vanity sink for holding toilet articles. The mattress was fair. The check-in gentleman was very friendly, but the check-out man wasn't too friendy. I was gone during the day, so never used the pool or saw any of the cleaning staff. I would never stay there again. I am normally easy to please and not a complainer, but I was very disappointed with the old motel room. My only positive comment is: "it was a place to sleep and shower, for one night."

Let me start out by saying that the hotel is beautiful, but the staff and the neighborhood ruin it. I stayed at this hotel for five nights for a business function held in the hotel. Early in the week some of our business supplies were stolen out of the room assigned to us by the hotel staff. We made management aware of the problem. What happened? More expensive things were stolen later in the week. About the same time we were dealing with this, a couple of men were caught having sex in the lobby bathroom. Then we find out that this is an ongoing problem in the hotel!!!! Do they put an attendant in the bathroom to discourage this behavior? No. Now, when you walk out on the street be prepared to be greeted with drug dealers from the numerous subway entrances and homeless people from the SEVERAL homeless shelter near the hotel. If you are planning on spending the money I would say move closer to quincy market and farther from Boston commons.

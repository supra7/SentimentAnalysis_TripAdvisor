I would never stay here again. I can't believe I paid almost $100 for this hotel. My main problem with the room was you can not change the thermostat manually and the room was really cold. My kids didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. The room was small and the beds were hard. The hotel did not have an elevator. My room did not have a remote and you can not change the channels manually on the TV. I called the front desk and they said they would send one right up. Two hours later I did receive a remote that didn't work. I was told the hotel had a catered breakfast. The catered breakfast consisted of cold cereal, bananas, small pasteries (not the good ones with filling)... It was very basic. Some people reviewing this hotel stated they had a fridge and microwave in their room, mine did not.

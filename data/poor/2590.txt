I'm 48 years old, and have been going to New Orleans, off and on, since I was a child. The lobby is beautiful, but other than that . . . the valet had no idea what was what, all young kids, lost as snow geese in a cotton field. Our room had absolutely no soap of any kind, and it took 45 minutes to get any. All the staff acted like they had better things to do. The decor mixes a Hilton Garden Inn with a Holiday Inn, from the hallways to the rooms, no romance at all. It's all hullabaloo and holler, I'll never go back! When we checked out, on a Sunday morning, we were three deep waiting to talk to someone, finally leaving after 30 minutes. The management of this place needs to send a spy to Le Pavillion to see how it's done properlike!

Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at. So bad that I really don't feel like writing much becuase it was disgusting. I would have rather stayed at a motel 6 because at least my expectations would be on par. The rooms are filthy and old and moldy and embarassingly small. I wish someone would have been this honest before I booked it. Do yourself a favor and pick another hotel.

Trying too hard to be cool The once glorious Clift is now another attempt from the Morgan's group at being cool.Outrageously expensive from the mini-bar to the room rates, the rooms feature walls that are about 70 percent mirrored. This ultra-glassed-in feature is most unappealing in earthquake-prone San Francisco. Staff has major attitude and there are no irons, ironing boards or coffee pots in rooms.The beds are ok but the other furniture is uncomfortable and uninviting - if you are into Feng Shui, forget it - with mirrors and shars everywhere you will suffer nightmares as I did.There are scores of better deals for your 300 dollars a night in San Francisco than this dreary replay of a Morgan's group jail cell.

I had been a frequent and happy guest. for many years. I would often bring family and friends. I really liked this place. Now it has a new manager. The new staff was extremely rude. I tried to communicate this to the manager and the owner, but never received a response form the owner, the manager defended her rude employee. Over the years many people came to this property because of my praise. I now regret this. It has become a more popular destination. I was made to feel, if not told in so many words that my business was not only not appreciated but not needed. Carlos the previous mjanager had a great feel for the HOSPITALITY BUSINESS. Ah well, I guess all good things come to an end.

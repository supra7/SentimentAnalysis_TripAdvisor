Never Stay at the Marseilles The hotel is reasonable in comparison to the others in the area, but don't be fooled by it. I booked a suite, which was very nice. Unfortunately, the room did not have air conditioning and room temp remained between 75  78 degrees. I called front desk on 3 occassions and they were unable to address the problem. I asked for another room and was accomodated, but the room was extremely dirty and had a very strange odor. Besides it being extremely dirty the room it self looks like it wasn't updated in years. Luckily, I was able to book a room at another hotel and salvaged my stay. Other than the room, the hotel seems to attract a younger type of crowd. I'd certainly would like to bring that to the attention of people traveling as a family.Also, the hotel staff is awful. When I was discussing the AC issue with the front desk the guy running the desk had a hissy fit and acted like a 2 year old. He literally stamped his feet, threw his radio to the floor and claimed that he was going to have a nervous break down.Just simply stay away and book else where. You won't regret it. Stay away from the Marseilles.

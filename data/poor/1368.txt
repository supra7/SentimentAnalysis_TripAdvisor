Find another place to go. This is by far the worst vacation we have ever had. The hotel should not even be open. Not one guest we talked to had a good time. The food is Cafeteria at best. None of the rooms are complete. Wires hanging, phones don't work, no hot water. Mosquitoes in rooms had to buy bug spray. Management is a Joke.It took 3 days to get my room changed. God forbide if there was a fire nor one fire extingishire on the property, no fire hoses in the boxes. The sprinkler in my room was inside the dry wall with a hole showing.Buyer beware, stay away, far away.

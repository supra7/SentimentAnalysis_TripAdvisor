Now to start I was originally supposed to stay at the Flamingo which is a sister property but they over booked and had to put me at Harrah's. They were supposed to upgrade my room and refund and comp my room for the screw up. I get to Harrah's my room is upgraded but not comp'd I end up having to pay MORE for their room. I ak to soak with a manager the guy at the desk tries to act like he is until I call him on his lie. Then miraculously all the managers are on break. I've been traveling all day and just want to eat and relax so I leave it alone til later. Get to my non smoking room that reeks of smoke and had a dirty ash tray in it change clothes and head out for dinner turning on the air conditioning as I leave. Get back from dinner and it is even hotter on the room than before I left. It is literally cooler outside. To cool down I hop in the shower and when I get out the water will not turn completely off. There is a steady stream that comes from the shower head. I call the front desk to report it they tell me they will put in a ticket but can't switch me rooms and basically blow me off. The next morning after being kept up by heat, running water, and the hotels loud crowd as I check out I mention all my problems again and the desk clerk replies with the same putting in a ticket managers on break line. Also might I add being in a suite there is no mini fridge so don't expect one. I am a frequent traveler as well as active duty military and I have stayed in some dumps and I have stayed with harrah's at other locations with no issue but this ruins it for me. This company will never get another dime of my money and I plan to tell everyone about this. I would have been better off to pitch a tent on the strip and sleep. Will be filing an official complaint with corporate Harrah's and reporting them to the BBB.

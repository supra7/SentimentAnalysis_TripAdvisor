If not for the view I would give this hotel zero stars. First issue was the smell. Noticed it first in the hallways and when we entered the room we couldn't believe the stench. I have no idea what was causing it. We had to keep the door to the balcony open to air out the room. We complained on our way out to the boardwalk and when we came back the stench was replaced by another, at least more pleasant, smell which unfortunately did not last. Second issue was with the bed. I could barely sleep the first night because the bed felt wet to me. My husband didn't notice so I thought it was just me. The next night he noticed it also. It was right after Hurricane Irene, maybe the rooms got wet? The carpet also felt damp. Parking is also an issue. Parking on site is limited and the second night we had to park at a deserted lot a few blocks away. Also, as a previous reviewer stated, there was a free-standing clothes closet with no hangars - what's the point of that? And the bedding had definitely seen better days. I could go on and on but I think you get the point. This is the first review I have ever left for a hotel because considering the price it should have been so much better. I have been going to Ocean City for over 20 years and this hotel has been the worst. I can't believe the people who have left good reviews. Maybe it depends what room you are in? I have noticed that great views get mentioned the most which is probably the only reason this place is still in business.

Demolition may be its only cure. Rude staff. Lazy maids. Pealing wallpaper. Stained carpet. Stained bedcovers. Mold in baths. Dingy paint. Broken safe. Broken iron. Inoperable air conditioning. Green scum in "vase" breakfast flower came in. Doorman refused to place the luggage in the taxi; "not his job." Don't stay at this dump, at the bottom of the heap. You'd do better on a park bench.

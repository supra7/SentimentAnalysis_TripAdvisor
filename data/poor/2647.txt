I was shocked when we got to our room.This place must be a hundred years old,and it smells like it.The room smelled like your grandfather's old cedar chest.We had to wash our clean clothes because of the smell on them when we got home.The bed was not nice ,the shower had low pressure,the coffee maker did not work,and there were pennies on the floor.They still use keys and the door could easily be opened even if locked.Use the deadbolt when in the room.We had windows,thank god it probably is aired out sometimes.The courtyard rooms may be nicer,it was pretty back there.I feel like I threw my money in the garbage.Two very nice hotels a short cab ride from the Quarter are the Loews and the Renaissance Arts Hotel,you will be very happy.

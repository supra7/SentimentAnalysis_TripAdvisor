We checked into this hotel for a 4 night stay to see Boston and go to TD Garden to see the Boston Bruins Hockey... Upon checking in to the hotel we were told most services were closed for the day due to the holiday which was fine since we were tired. Then we had been told there was a 99Percent chance to have a new renovated room which fell through for whatever reason.. So up to the 35 floor to a very actual nice room we settled down and had to call housekeeping for towels and bathrobes and we should have just wiped with wet one's there was no water pressure at all and lukewarm water.The next day we were gone mostly and upon coming back to our room we ordered room service which is what broke our back... We ordered Scrod not Scrod with 10 hairs in the lemon juice when I called down to room service the waiter was non caring and when I requested a F&B supervisor I was told one was not on duty... We ended up fighting our bill and left that hotel.. I will never return to that hotel I should have stayed @ Long wharf and never used this hotel.... The only good thing was the checkIn clerk Angela who gave us a great room view despite being a old room and the checkout clerk who was also great. But that is no way to run a hotel and am sure they didn't care because I work for Marriott... Horrible stay.

I stayed here for one night because I saw good reviews for this place on trip advisor....First let me start off by saying, you get what you pay for. . The room had the most horrible musky smell and the AC was off so it was hot and muggy. The AC never worked well and the smell never left the room. Then I realized there is no security latch on the door (every hotel we have ever stayed at has a security latch). The manager said none of the rooms has one....Nice. I didn't sleep at all well that night. I pushed furniture up against the door because there is one lock that anyone can open the door with a key (basically anyone). There was no blow dryer in the room. Oh! I almost forgot to mention the dead cockroach in the room the size of a small cat. As I said, its really cheap so you get what you pay for.

The good things first: The apartments are OK, cleaning OK and the pool and pool area is wonderful. But - the place is in the middle of nowhere and there is abolutely nothing to do. Even the taxis could not find it. We (couple in their late fifties) did not have a car, did not want to, so we felt completely trapped. The "breakfast" was awful sweet, corn flakes, white bread with jam, orange juice and sweet cakes, things we never eat. The hotel shop did not have anything that could pass for bread or fiber cereals so we could make our own breakfast. People at the reception desk were nice, except for the day we left. We had to check out at 11 a.m., our flight to Europe was scheduled for 10 p.m. and I had the flue with fever so we asked if we could keep the room a little longer that day. They said they were fully booked and we had to pay for cleaning "overtime" if we kept the room longer. To us it looked like they had a lot of free apartments, but I cannot know for sure.

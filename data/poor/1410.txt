We were happy with things at first and had left the hotel leaving money hidden behind. When we returned the money was gone. Called and talked to GM, and he said that he would look into it and never heard from him again. We called and left several messages and never recieved a call back. Do you're self a favor and find a trust worthy hotel! One that doesn't steal from you and then ignore you're concerns.

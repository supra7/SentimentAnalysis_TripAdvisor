I was so excited to go to Mexico for 7 days for my honeymoon. We decided to take my husband's children along with us with is why we decided to go to Azul Fives. The children are 11 and 13 and were bored except when they actually found other kids to play with. The activities listed on the calendar didn't alway happen either. We had one hot shower a day - then it was cold water. Our room had a hot tub which obviously we couldn't use either. And even the hot tob in the spa was cold so we should've just purchased a massage on the beach for about a 1/4 the price. The restaurants had such terrible service we walked out a few times...and there were times we would wait up to 20 minutes to get a drink at the pool bar as well as the restaurants. I could go on about the issues but the list was too long after 7 days. I would not suggest this resort for anyone unless they fixed the service issues which would have to start with the management because they didn't seem to care we were unhappy at all. It was a disappointing way to spend my honeymoon.

This hotel had listed at one rate only to find out at the last day that they had charged me a much higher rate - twice as high. I had booked this because of the attractive advertised rate, but when I checked out, turns out it wasn't so attractive at all. I also think the W is way overhyped. It looks fancy but you will get the same quality at any other downtown hotel. Not worth the money in any case. Business Center was not open on weekends even though they told me to come down in the morning on Sat and print what i needed. Don't stay here!

I initially booked the hotel through Hotels.com at a fair rate of 720 Euros/4 nights. Hotels.com made a mistake and booked two junior suites for me and I only needed one suite. Hotels.com asked me to call the hotel directly and change the reservation to one suite. By doing that, the hotel decided to cancel my reservation through Hotels.com and instead made the reservation directly through their own reservation group. They also decided to raise the rate to 820 and did not mention the raise in rate until check out. I pleaded with the manager, Jordi Parente at check out but he was not helpful and quite rude. He was determined to make me pay the higher rate even though I showed him the emails confirming the changes with Hotels.com. Any other four star hotel would have been more accommodating. We tipped their housekeeping and service crew on a daily basis. So, beware and insure your rate before you check in.

this hotel is absolutely CRAP!!..Having travelled to many countries all over the world, i can honestly say this is probably the worst hotel i have stayed in. Staff were rude, unhelpful and majority couldn't understand english. Rooms were appaling interms of what u book is not whast u get, poor A/C and the cleaning is beyond satisfactory. Take my advice, if u want a hassle free time during your visit to turkey, don't stay at this hotel..i made that mistake!

We spent 3 nights at The Time at the end of a 2 week touring holiday.This place is awful and we were upgraded to a suite!Unfortunately we had paid upfront or we would have moved to a different hotel.Our room 8-12 was dingy,tatty and grubby.In fact after my husband found a toenail clipping in the drawer we did not dare look too closely!The furniture was worn and chipped,and the carpet looked in need of a good clean.There was very little storage space and overall the room was depressing!There is no way this is a boutique hotel-I have stayed in better youth hostels.The Time was the sixth hotel of our holiday and the other 5 were excellent.There is no way we would ever stay here again!Please avoid this place!

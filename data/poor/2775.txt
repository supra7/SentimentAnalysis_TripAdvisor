Except for the location, there isn't one redeeming factor to The Time. My room had a "wonderful" view of two huge metal pipes right in front of the window. And the tiny sink in the bathroom was all but clogged still. Plus my AC broke at around 8:30pm causing the room to reach a sweltering 79.7 degrees - the service guy took one look at it and told me that he had to change the whole unit before it would work properly. I called the front desk to get a different room and was told that they were all sold out. After a few strong words on my part, miraculously an available room was located. Of course, there had to be something wrong with the new room too. Another "wonderful" view of a dirty brick wall a few feet away from the window, and a TV that didn't work. I was so tired by the end of the night, that a non-functioning TV was the least of my concerns. Another person in my party had a suite - the couch in the suite had visible shoe prints, as if someone had stood on the couch with shoes on and housekeeping neglected to dust off the prints. Definitely not acceptable. My advice to Trip Advisor visitors - pay $20 more and stay at The W nearby. The Time really isn't worth the minor amount of saving.

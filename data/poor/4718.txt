This place looks nice when you first walk in, and the staff was nice at first. When we walked up to our room and entered, it was like entering a very small bedroom with two beds..The room was like 75-80 degrees when we walked in and the staff came up and "fixed" it, but said if it doesn't kick on he will bring us a fan! What??? I didn't pay this money to stay in a room that has no windows or air!!! this is rediculous!! Luckily we won't be in the room too much since we are here for buisness, but I highly do NOT recommend anyone stay here!!!! EVER!!!

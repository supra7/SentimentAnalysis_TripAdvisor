Room was very stink from smoking. Staff at the Paradise Cafe were very unfriendly and seem that they did not care about guest, food was terrible. More than 7 slots machines were locked down due to guest having them locked. It was hard trying to find a cocktail waitress to order drinks. Floor attendants were not friendly at all.

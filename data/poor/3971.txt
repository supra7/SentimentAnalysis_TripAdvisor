I don't know where to begin. First, the Expedia map shows the hotel as being right downtown. No one knew where it was and when we finally managed to get an address, we realized we had to take a taxi to get there. A fifteen minute ride. The place was well out of town. The ride was fifty pesos. But when you want to get back to town, you have to go through the hotel and the charge is 120 pesos. Strange, isn't it. For me, it's not the amount, Seventy pesos is not much. it's the fact that they aren't being honest. OK. The rooms. First room. I sit on the bed. The bed breaks. Back to the reception. We ask for a new room. They don't have one just right now. Maybe in two hours or so. It's lunch time, so why don't you go for lunch and come back after. We go to the See Olive, their beach side restaurant. Bad food. Then back to the reception. They give us a new room. We get there and it's half clean. We stay there and take a nap. Two people come into the room saying they were just given this room. I try to take a shower, I can't work their strange shower and I end up taking a cool shower. When we try to get some sleep at night, the ceiling fan light starts to do funny things. It turns on and off by itself. We call reception and they send someone. The man has to open the ceiling fan and to work on it for some time while we wait sitting on the beds. Finally, 45 minutes after our initial bed time, we get to turn the lights off for a second time. Bad hotel, location, service and food.

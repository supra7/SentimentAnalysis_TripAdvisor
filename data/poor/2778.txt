We travel to NYC at least twice a year, almost always staying at 4-5 star hotels. This is a four star hotel were housekeeping comes in your room at anytime, things come up missing and we also kept wondering why our radio station was changed every time we came back to our room. Also, when making the bed housekeeping left the pillows laying on the floor?! There are cameras everywhere, yet when we reported our missing items to the concierge, they indicated an investigation would be initiated and were still waiting for a response. The toilet was constantly backed-up. My husband had to wash his hair with shower gel as toiletries were not replaced for our second night stay. At the bar, my husband was in romantic mode and gave me one of the flowers from the small vases. A few minutes later a bar tender rudely asked me were I got the flower from and asked me to return it! (I guess it was my husbands fault for not purchasing one for me off the street!) An $18 charge for the lily (1) was in our bill and then taken off as a refund.) At check in staff indicated there would be a $100 hold in our card, but it actually was a $300 (which was no problem) but accurate information should have been provided. Shoppers Alert! If you come back with your hands full of bags, no doorman on call on Saturdays! The public restroom for the restaurant/ bar area did not have toilet or towel paper. Comment cards not available. Hotel manager informed of our list of complaints, however these were cordially disregarded. If you want to receive the service you deserve whether on business or pleasure stay at W, Intercontinental or even the Holiday Inn! There are lots of hotels within the area that would definitely live up to their star rating!

I stayed at the Biltmore a couple of weeks ago for 4 nights during a conference. I have to say that I had high hopes that this would be a great place to stay due to it's five star status and the Biltmore name. First, plesae note that you should definitely NOT stay in the section of the hotel at the back of the property called "Terrace Court". I have attached pictures of this area and all is can say is I felt like I was staying at a Holiday Inn! You have this nice facade, but then once you get into the inner courtyard you realize all the rooms have outside entrances and the hallways are very dark....not at all what one would expect from a "Biltmore"! This is an old, outdated building that should be torn down....they should not even be putting guests in these rooms. The other issue I have is with the prices of the food and beverages here. A starbucks coffee costs double what you would pay in a regular coffee shop! I understand that this is a "resort" but the prices were really ridiculous. One night I got all the way to my room and found that the key to my room would not work. Rather than walk all the way back to the lobby, I called the front desk. They said they would send someone to me with a new key, which they did. When I checked out I saw that I had a $10.00 charge on my bill for this service! I just think this is ridiculous!! On a more positive note, I thought the staff at the hotel were very nice and I have no complaints about the service that I received from any of them. Also, the landscaping here was beautiful and well tended to. Bottom line....I would not recommend this hotel to anyone...there are better hotels in Phoenix that offer more than you will get here.

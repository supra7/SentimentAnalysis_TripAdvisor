Excited about a trip to Vegas, well don't pick this hotel the WORST! Stay in your car if you have to, at least you know if it's clean or not. We swtiched rooms four times, I was exhausted from packing and unpacking so many times. Once we got settled into our room # 4, we realized we had bed bugs. The room was already paid for, so nothing we could do except spend more money to stay somewhere else. They offered us free drinks at the BAR, LA DEE DAH! The staff is horrible and so rude. The only people that were even friendly at all were the Bellhops and the Guy who puts you into a cab. What does that say?

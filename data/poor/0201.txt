Was a horrible experience! Our family of four booked this hotel on hotwire so we had no idea what we were getting before we agreed. When I saw it was the Radisson I was sort of thinking I got a great deal for $60. Was I ever wrong. There were water stains on the ceiling, musty smell in the room. The glasses were dirty with lipstick marks on them and it wasnt too modern. I thought to myself Well for $60 what do you expect? What I didnt expect was for my 12 year old to sit on the bed and say what's wrong wtih the bed mom Me going over there to discover the bed was broken. The frame was all twisted up and it was rigged to somewhat try to work. We called management who came up and took a look, apologize and give us another room. The next room, same thing. I went to sit on the edge of the bed and the whole bed collapsed!! It too was broken. We called management who came up and said he was sorry again and moved us one more time! This next place was much nicer. They had sleep number beds in them and it seemed more updated then the other horrible rooms we were in. I made a guess that they saved these horrible rooms for hotwire customers and the people paying full price got the nice beds and nice rooms. I called up hotwire who did an investigation and refunded my money!

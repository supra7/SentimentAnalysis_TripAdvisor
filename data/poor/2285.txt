there is one nice thing i have to say about the residence inn they have a good front desk staff. I am outraged with the way i have been treated at this location i advise anyone who is thinking of staying here to either go to the courtyard which is next door they share the same front lot its that close! or... anywhere else! we stayed for 1 week the first 2 nights were good the front desk asked everytime how our stay was remembered our faces it was great until we came home one night and saw that our luggage was gone through half of our leftover pizza was gone as well as some beef jerkey and who knows what else happned when we were gone. we put in a complaint with the fount desk that evening and recieved the answer "i'll tell the manager in the morning" i was upset so the next morning rolled around and i talked with the house keeping manager and she told me "well we give the staff a free lunch so there is no reason why they would do such a thing" 3 days later we have not heard back from them... not a single word. i have called customer service on this issue nothing has been done as of yet so im writting here to save everyone some heart ache and to leave you with the very simple conclusion... if you want to stay in a hotel that is dirty, steals from your room and doesnt do anything about it... please by all means stay here... but at your own risk!

Once upon a time, when this was the flagship Westin (the corporate headquarters were just across the street) this was a classy, cool hotel: It had a excellent dining room, a coffee shop, two bars (one a Trader Vics!) and a full-service health club. Now everything about this place seems to be "on the cheap": no nice dining room, a banal "cafe" for breakfast, only one vapid bar (and that's in the lobby - very airport-ish), and a dirty workout space with no good locker facilities or even attendants. The good thing about this hotel is the views: The guest rooms definitely have the best views in town. But the furnishings are tired and worn. It's OK for conventions, if you get a good rate, but it really is just a ghost of its former self.

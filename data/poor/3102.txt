The hotel room was in-fact clean, which I guess is most important - but we never had a full set of towels. We stayed 6 nights and one day we had 1 wash cloth, next day we were short hand towels, next, bath mat...and never received extra towels when requested. The Jr. suite is the size of any double hotel room, perhaps smaller, when we pulled out the queen couch it touched wall to wall and we had to climb over our children to get to the bathroom. The mattresses were absolutely atrocious! We didn't have pillow-top and you sunk into the bed half- way down. We did receive clean sheets, probably because we stripped the beds ourselves and requested the service. It had a pedestal sink and one tiny shelf in the bathroom and the top of the toilet was covered with extra decorative stuff - so there was no room for your personal belongings. I would have liked a hair blower and a full- length mirror. Very small room, TV remote batteries died and we never received new ones, pool heater was out for entire week - had to use Best Western pool. Because the hotel allows smoking and dogs, we had to listen to barking and breath-in cigarette smoke instead of fresh ocean air - if we wanted our windows open. Also, there was noise from the biker-bar two doors down until 2am. when we tried to make other hotel plans, we were told it would cost us 30% of remaining reservation. $11 per day for parking to boot. I guess it's a bit of my fault about smoking, parking and reservation small print. Nonetheless, No, wouldn't stay there again.

My family and I arrived on Sunday July 29 at 2 pm and told our room was not ready(1 hour before check in was expected) and they would call us on our cell by 4:30 they still did not call us but the room was in fact ready. We had added an additional day to our trip back in May and we were told we could stay and would not have to move, only to find out they gave our room to someone else and we would have to change to a smoking room. I have 2 children and would never put them in a smoking room, I also have asthma they said nothing they could do so we cancelled the last night. It turned into a blessing in disguise. The room smelled like smoke we had to leave the door open to air it out. The hallways were never clean and smelled like mold. The ocean view was the only good thing I can say about this hotel. I had planned on doing some light cooking but did not want to use anything in the kitchen so we had to eat out which I was trying to avoid with an extremely picky eater and the reason for the kitchen. My coffee maker was broken and after telling the front desk twice I had to leave my room every morning for my coffee. The pools were very dirty and I cringed everytime my children wanted to swim, but had to say yes because the ocean was very rough , I chose this hotel the indoor and outdoor pool. The swim up bar was almost impossible to use because of the drunks that were apparently glued to the seats. I would have left the minute we checked in but the other hotels were booked(believe me I checked every one) and I drove 5 1/2 hours to get there. I know it is not a five star hotel but we paid alot for the room and I expected so much more. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again!!!!!!

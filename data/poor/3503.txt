There is no point in rehashing all the negatives about this dump. The only thing you need to know is that the hotel is infested with bedbugs! Don't stay here. I only stayed one night and came home to discover myself covered with insect bites - arms, legs, torso and neck. I contacted the management and they confirmed that the room showed signs of infestation. I was asked to sign a form waiving all rights to further legal action in exchange for a refund of the cost of my stay. I have discarded my suitcase and some other personal items that might have been contaminated - in order to avoid infesting my home. I googled Marakech and bedbugs and found that this problem is rather widely reported - wish I'd done this before staying there.

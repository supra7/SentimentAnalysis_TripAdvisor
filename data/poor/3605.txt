booked a standard room via travel republic. This was my third visit to San Francisco in 2 years. Hotel is in a good location across the road from the Ferry Buidling, friendly staff but I absolutely hated the room. booked in for 6 nights, checked out after 4 nights. The room was dark & claustrophobic. Do not book room 201, the 2 small windows in the room look out onto what appears to be a wall/window shaft. This made the room extremely dark not helped by the room lighting. Even with all the lamps on the room was dark. Had to go down to the hotel entrance to work out what the weather was like outside. the bathroom was functional but after staying in the Hilton at Burlingham & the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas I was extremely disappointed. I didn't like the room arrangement where the bathroom sink is situated in the bedroom. Housekeeping were extremely stingy with the complementary toiletries - one sample of body lotion, which was not replenished even though it was empty. On day one housekeeping didn't provide a clean bath mat, on day two I didn't receive coffee or creamers - sloppy service. Also this room appeared to be serviced after all other rooms, returned to the hotel at 1pm on one of the days & the room still had not been serviced even though I had gone out at 7.30am & the cleaners were already at work. Would definitely not book a Greystone Hotel again.

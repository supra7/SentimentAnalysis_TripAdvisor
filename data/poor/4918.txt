I choose Castle Rock Resort And Water Park because I knew it was new and had a water park for my 5 year old son. So we planned a weekend trip. I used the website to make all reservations (big mistake), but I knew it was new so what could go wrong. When we arrived a 9pm Thursday night they informed us the hotel was full we would be in the ajacement builting 3 parking lots over from the waterpark. In the Autrium hotel this hotel had to be about 30 years old it smell, it was dirt, and the beds are like rocks. So we check out the next morning we did get use of the waterpark until 9pm the next day. But that was a big let down to, l never seen the arcade and most of the waterpark wasn't working. I know I will never go there again.

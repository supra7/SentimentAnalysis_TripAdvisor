Stayed there for two nights 16th and 17th. Checked in late- no welcome or hello, just a simple list of everything I would be charged for as an extra. Prerequested a non-smoking King, but received a smoking double. On querying was told the only other option was a fold out bed??? ( for 249 bucks a night!!) This was the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. Getting to sit on the bowl required being double jointed. Gave up on room service after 1 hour wait. Told guest services to cancel the order, but then got a knock on my door, 2 1/2 hours later with the food. I kept taking an elevator that refused to stop on 6th floor but deposited me on the 5th or 7th. On check out, the computers were down, so they could not tel me my final charges. When I asked them to email me the folio, they claimed they had no means to do so, so I requested a fax. I'm still waiting for it... This is hotel way past its prime, charging top dollar for tired service and facilities. Ther must be better, less expensive places in Chicago. Oh.....steer clear of the breakfast. Overpriced, congealed, long service delays at atrocious prices.

Firstly, let me say that the staff were unfailingly pleasant and accommodating. The problem with this hotel is the dilapidated state of the building. The carpets are stained, a/c grills are filthy, lampshades dingy and crooked, paint chipped, etc. These things aren't necessarily deal-breakers by themselves, but overall they end up making you wonder about the cleanliness of the bedding, etc. I neglected to ask for a non-smoking room at check-in, as I've become complacent, assuming that all hotels these days are non-smoking throughout. The 3rd floor is a smoking floor, and the corridor REEKS of smoke, so avoid that floor is you mind. I switched to the 4th floor after my first night, and it's smoke-odor free. Both rooms I had have the same problems: VERY thin walls (you can hear which song your neighbor's clock radio is playing when his alarm goes off at 5am), and VERY, VERY loud plumbing! I mean, when someone else turns on the shower, or flushes their loo, the abrupt torrent of water noise will wake you from a dead sleep. This noise is so loud that it makes conversation difficult in the room, and requires you to turn up the TV! I'm seriously not a very picky person about hotel rooms (I'm a pilot, I stay in hundreds), but trust me, this is not a restful experience. Oh, and the thin walls? Well, this is an AIRPORT hotel, and you may mind airplane noise a bit more than I do! :) Other, more minor issues: the wifi was sometimes very slow, and the showers are quite weak, and if the hotel is in "heating" mode, rather than "a/c" mode, your only option to keep your room cool for the night will be to open your window (see above re: airport hotel).. I got a pretty cheap price on this hotel, and it was no bargain.

My stay started off pleasantly enough, but at 6:30am on Saturday morning I was awoken by loud construction that did not abate. The staff at the hotel was not only unapologetic but they refused to do anything to alleviate the situation -- this includes moving me to another room, offering me a discounted rate, etc. What proceeded was a run-around by the management that dampened my stay. While I was excited by the fact that the hotel was new and a small boutique establishment rather than a chain, I quickly realized the lack competence and integrity. There are plenty of better places to stay in Chicago where you can be assured that the management will safeguard your need for a good night's sleep.

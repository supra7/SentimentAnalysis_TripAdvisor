I stayed here to save money on a 3 day campus visit at the University of Washington. When I arrived, I was told I was too early to check in so I asked if they could check my bags while I went for a walk to the UW. They agreed and just put them behind the front desk without taking my name or giving me a check tag, which might've been okay if there was a person there too, but when you walk into the office, there's just an empty front desk area while the staff hide away in a back room. In other words, it would take about 5 seconds for someone to reach over and steal my bags. I asked them to store my luggage which contained a camcorder and my laptop in the backroom like any normal hotel would but they refused. When it came time to check into my room I was horrified. Both of my chairs were badly stained as was the bedskirt. I had to lay towels down on the chairs to feel comfortable sitting on them. My lampshade was also stained with what was either coffee or blood. I'm not sure which and didn't care to find out. At night you could either choose to freeze your butt off or turn on the ridiculously loud heater. The pipes and shower head had a lot of visible rust and the bathroom just didn't seem clean. This was one of the worst motel/hotels I've ever stayed in. I know you have to lower your standards when you go budget but this was just intolerable.

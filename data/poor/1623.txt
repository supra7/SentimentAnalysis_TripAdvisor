Our initial impression of this hotel was that the lobby was beautiful, although not very inviting as the reception desk is behind large columns. It took several minutes to convince the woman behind the counter that we had confirmed a late checkout time of 4pm (for an extra $50 charge) by phone earlier in the week, she initially said she could accommodate 1pm, then 2pm, then finally agreed that 4pm would be available. Once we reached our room we were pleasantly surprised at the size, but after a few minutes several problems began to come to our attention. The dinning table had pink crusty spots (like dried sauce of some kind), the stove had a dead and cooked on bug, the carpet had cigarette burns (in a non-smoking room), and there was ash and part of a cigar in the *fake* potted plant. The thing that bothered us most however, was the towels had assorted brown stains. We requested new towels from the front desk and were sent another set of towels with yellow stains. We again requested fresh towels and received more with brown stains. It appeared that about 1/2 of the towels we received had some kind of staining, but we had accumulated enough for our use, so we did not complain further as we were hungry and wanted to go out to eat. Our room was cave-like and faced the other side of the building's courtyard, which allowed for minimal natural light even though the weather was clear and sunny. Street noise was still very disruptive with the courtyard room and we were serenaded by drunks and sirens all night long. Finally, the hotel seems to need overall general repairs and updates. The security latch on the door was loose and there was no in-room safe to use. The walls and doors were scuffed and there was a nail hammered into the linoleum floor in the kitchen.

this place sucks we had to wait over 3 hours to get into the lounge upstairs and when we were there they had some gay dude with a g string DJing super loud music. horrible atmosphere they had alot of workers but yet we found ourselves waiting around 20 minutes a time when we needed our server who then over charged us and we didnt find out until the next day. this place blows they try to hard to be a "cool" place to be. overrated and a waste of a good friday night.

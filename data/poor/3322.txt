The location is 'central' but the neighborhood is ugly, period. It's a dump really. Rooms are small. Extremely noisy. Last call at the club is 2.45 am so don't expect to sleep earlier than that. There is no housekeeping as such, just one person working as a bell man, room service, house keeping so dont expect to have anything done in timely manner. Bring your own shower cap, slippers etc because you need to ask for them. I asked for a blanket but it looks so dirty. I usually stay at the best hotels in the world so perhaps my standard is high. This is probably one of the worst hotel I have stayed at. Saff is nice but that was it. HORRIBLE!

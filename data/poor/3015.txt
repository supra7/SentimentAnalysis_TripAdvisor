I realize that this is an old hotel, and since I live in a home that is even older, I can appreciate some "quirkiness". However, this so called hotel is the worst place I have ever stayed in. The first room (yes, we moved as soon as possible) had a bathroom that was so narrow that when you bent over to wash your face, you bumped your head on the mirror. There was only a shower, and that had a drain which had collapsed into the tile floor. The tiles in the bathroom were chipped, cracked or missing all together. The bedspread was stained and the carpet was filthy. The 2nd room was not much better, although at least it had a tub, but the paint was peeling and, the tiles had the same issues. Each room offered 2 horrible pillows, no extra blankets and the towels felt like they were original to the hotel. We could hear the person in the next room coughing during the night, and his early morning phone call. The icing on the cake is when we were checking out, we passed an exterminator in the halls! My husband described the place quite simply - " a cruddy place". I have pictures if you need more convincing to not spend one minute in this place.

Just returned from a spring break stay at the Chateau Hotel in the french quarter located at 1001 Chartres. Reserved a two room suite for $450 a night. One room was downstairs and the other was a loft bedroom with a bathroom. Very large in size and spacious. Kitchen has refrigerator and microwave oven. Stove was not working and we were told they don't want people cooking in the room. Suite was right across the street from an irish pub. The pub had music blaring straight into our suite until 4-5am every morning. Needless to say we got no sleep. In addition, the buggies with horses carrying people trot by nonstop throughout the day and night. One of the drivers told us that this building was the first morgue in New Orleans. The floors were extremely dirty. We wore socks and they were black after five minutes walking around. The amenities were not what you would expect when paying $450 a night. The toilet paper and tissue were like sand paper. The towels were hard. The housekeeping staff didn't show up until we called. Even then we were told that they were too busy doing check outs and couldn't come until after 4pm. The contitnental breakfast that was included wasn't too great either. It's a bread item and orange juice. The danish tasted stale. The pool looks inviting but is not heated. My family froze in the pool. It's close to things in the quarter but it's extremely noisy all night long and not clean. I don't recommend this one.

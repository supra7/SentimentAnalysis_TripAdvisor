If you plan on taking a vacation in San Diego please avoid the Balboa Park Inn at all costs. While the people that run the place seem like nice folks, the inn just does not cut it. I agree with all of the points made by alliefromlongbeach and will add that the wireless internet is crap. We actually left after our first night. If we would have not been able to leave I was about to begin a series of "honeymooners held hostage" updates on tripadvisor. If the manger/owner reads tripadvisor I would like to let him know that we did not appreciate him waiting until the next morning to decide whether or not to let us have our money back for the rest of the stay .This created an extremely restless night for us. Very dissapointing.

Dont Waste Your Money on the Mandira After spending 4 glorious nights at the Watergarden Hotel in Candidasa we arrived at the Mandira and found ourselves (I was travelling with my mum who is 70, but very fit) totally dismayed with the Delux room they had given us. A tiny cramped brick block (cell) with no windows; our tiny little verandah, which had no shade at all, faced directly onto the red brick wall at the back of reception, affording us absolutely no view. The room had an overpowering smell of some kind of perfume, which after visiting several public toilets I realised was toilet freshener.We were moved to another room (it was actually a downgrade) which had a window and seemed a bit nicer. But again we had, from our verandah, a view of another brick wall. I am quite sensitive to strong perfumes and found this room had the same completely overpowering toilet freshener smell. I washed the tile floor down with wet towels but couldnt get rid of it, the entire room was soaked in the stink. We were forced to spend the night there as we had arrived quite late in teh afternoon and I was on the verge of being physically ill all night as I couldnt escape the smell.The room was absolutely full of mozzies. The breakfast was awful. The pool area was like Disneyland in peak season. The staff werent even all that helpful when I asked them about the smell in the room. Even the woman who checked us in appeared to be full of her own managerial self importance. Not impressed, I contacted our tour organiser and got us moved the next day. Horrible!

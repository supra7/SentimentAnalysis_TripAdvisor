This hotel is in a beautiful building, unfortunately the interior is very modern, nothing wrong with that but it seems like all the effort has gone into looks and not whether things work. The first room we had, had a rainfall shower but the drain( a narrow gap close to the floor) was blocked so the bathroom flooded. We complained and were 'upgraded' to a junior suite, this time the shower was in a cubicle but the door didn't fit and the bathroom flooded again. When we told the receptionist just smiled and shrugged his shoulders. The junior suite was a duplex, so the bed was up a flight of stairs, amongst the rafters of the hotel. Unfortunately the rafters were also the home of Mosquitos, my wife and I left with at least 50 bites. When we checked in we were just showed to our room, when we checked out the couple in front of us (who were checking in) were asked whether they had been to Venice before, when they said 'no' the receptionist produced a map and talked the couple through all sorts of details, e.g. where to catch the river taxi from, times it ran, what to do if they missed the last boat, where the shopping areas were, places of interest etc. We got none of this, we were walking round Venice almost blind. My wife and I are fortunate enough to travel extensively, and this is the first 5* hotel we have stopped in that doesn't even offer complimentary bottles of drinking water in the room. I'm afraid that this Hotel does not come up to the required standard to have a 5* rating. One last point, although nothing to with the hotel is that Venice was a disappointment, we expected high prices, but many of the buildings are covered in graffiti and the place is littered with cigarette ends. Venice needs a good polish! Incidentally,we travelled with Expedia and have logged the same review with them, surprisingly they have chosen not to publish it. Read into that what you will.

We stayed at this resort for 4 nights and they were the worse our our 16 day holiday in Hawaii. How they can call themselves a resport I don't know, they have a drinks vending machine and thats it, no snack, no restaurant, no bar. The air-con is like being in a tank, you cannot sleep with it on. The walls are paper thin, we werwe kept up 3 nights by a loud talking japanses couple thill 4 in the morning, we had to call down to send security up to ask then to keep it down. As soon as you check in, they make you sign waivers saying they will charge you if you smoke, lose your key and if you want coffee after the first free packet was also a dollar. they also charge to use the safe (even though it is nominal, this should be complimentary). The closest shop is over a mile away, the closest non-sushi restaurant is over a mile away. The rooms also needed updating, when I pulled the light switch, it came off in my hand, the taps in the bathroom were very stiff. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.

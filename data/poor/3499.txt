I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel under any circumstances. We got charged more for two nights stay than our flights to NY and I was infested by bed bugs all over my body. They were so bad I had to take two days off work and take high dosage anti-hystamines. The hotel accepted no responsibility but after 3 months I got a full refund via the travel agent. This is worse than a hovel!

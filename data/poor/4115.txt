My boyfriend and I planned on staying there last week. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk staff said that they had our reservation in the computer but since we booked thru hotwire, they didn't have a room available to us; they only had rooms for "full paying" guests. They tried to send us to a Best Wester in Evanston, a half hour away. We had plans down town that night. They said they would pay for a cab to the hotel but it was on us to get back down town and then back again to Evanston that night. The front desk staff was very rude and unapologetic. I would never attempt to stay here again. This is the first time that I have had this problem and 100% blame the hotel. And it looks like I am not the first one to have this problem.

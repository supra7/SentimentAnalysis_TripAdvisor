As a Hilton Honors diamond member, we were extremenly disappointed in everything about this hotel. First, the rooms suck. They are in need of some major TLC and look like they havent been cleaned in forever. The carpets had so much sand in them and when we arrived at our room the closet door was completly broken. The furniture in this hotel is very outdated and they still have box TVs from the 90s. We had a constant issue with not being given more than like one clean towel a day which defintly doesnt work for a family of 4. Also, we really wish they had an actualy balcony that you could sit on. We were also disappointed that there wasnt a fridge in the room. From our room in this hotel, we had sooo much walking to get anywhere. Having to haul beach toys back and forth was such a hassle. The pools in this hotel were also extremenly bad. Having only 2 pools for such a big hotel shocks me. The 2 pools they do have are very disappointed. They were so dirty and looked like the sand hadnt been cleaned out of them in weeks. We found that the pool on the 5th floor was almost always out of clean towels and we saw dirty towels sit there for days. Also, the hot tub had broken jets and so much sand in it. Overall, these pools are horrible. The resturant inside this hotel is good however extremenly pricey. The food at the resturant was defintly the best thing about this hotel. The parking situation is horrible. Having an unattented lot across the street simply made us way too nervous so we opted for valet parking. However, every time we called to get our car we would show up when they said it would be there and we would have to wait another 5-10 minutes for it to get there. Overall, the Daytona Beach area is extremenly run down. It looks very trashy and has so many boarded up businesses that are such an eye sore. The beach is nice though. I suggest not coming here until there is some very major TLC done to this hotel.

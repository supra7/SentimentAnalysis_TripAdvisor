We were very excited about our trip to Chicago and chose the Swissotel based on our research. We were in for a surprise! While the location and rooms were good, the hotel staff was unfriendly and rude but most of all my husband and I were extremely upset to find all the extra costs required for use of hotel amenities such as the internet (extra $10), pool and fitness facility (extra $15 per person per day -- yikes!). As individuals who have had the opportunity to stay at some of the world's finest Relais & Chateaux properties, it is expected that when choosing to stay at a luxury hotel of a higher price than others that these amenities would be included in the price. If you're looking for a nice luxurious getaway with exceptional service in downtown Chicago, don't choose the Swissotel -- keep looking!

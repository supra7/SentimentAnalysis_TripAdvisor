Booked for a conference at this hotel back in September and arrived last week expectant given good reviews. Called the week before to confirm my stay. Arrived hot and tired only to be told by the desk that they were full and that I would have to walk 2 blocks down the road to different and inferior hotel. They didn't try and call me before I arrived despite having all my contact details. They didn't offer to upgrade me. On the plus side they offered to reimburse me for 1 nights accommodation (small hand clap for their recognition of poor service) But seriously, they can't take conference bookings if they can't keep conference bookings. Also the manager still has not replied to my email. I guess they don't care. So, it may be a nice hotel, but I will never book there again if they are this unreliable. Andrew

I choose this hotel because of the photos online and the price for a package through Priceline. While I generally trust the site and I always double check with Trip Advisor obvisouly this slipped by me. I was greeted in the Lobby by a drunken guest, andf super loud doorman. I told the counter agent that my flight was 10 hours late, that I had a early morning meeting and she then put me on a floor with a girls night out party facing the street! The temparature in Chicago right now is 60 and my room is freezing cold. I called for a blanket and they told me that they do not have any more???? Huh? There are no amenities here and my dinner was a bag of Hot Fries from the 7-11\ and if you park your car you are going to pay $39.00 to park. Are you kidding? Okay, I thought I had a deal but this is a dud...

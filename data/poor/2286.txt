Stayed there 3 days. The air condtioner did not work at all. They missed cleaning my room 1 day. When the maid came to clean after I complained, she complained to me that I was making her job difficult like she was the victim. You know just friken clean my room and provide your customers with service!!!!! Maybe she would rather unemployed instead!!!! Also the table was in need of maint. was wobbleing. And...... the lobby COFEE WAS POOR!!!!!! I was not too impressed with the casino next door either. The location is great walking distance to the strip.

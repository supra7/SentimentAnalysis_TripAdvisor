Mislead by their website Having perused the internet pictures, we thought the Cartwright looked like a charming rustic hotel in a nice location. Unfortunately, the pictures did not convey that the hotel was under construction, the rooms were tiny, the bathroom barely left you room to stand, the walls were sadly in need of new paint in the rooms and the hallways, and worst of all, the elevator was not operational [and apparently had been that way for months and will not be repaired for several more months]. After climbing the treacherous stairs five flights with our suitcases, we didn't need to go the gym. However, just so you know, the claim that you can get a discount at the gym one block away is false. The gym charges the same amount per day as the hotel's discounted rate. Walking down the hallway reminded me more of a ghetto than a fine hotel. Good luck if you plan to stay there, I'll bet the good reviews are made up by the hotel management.

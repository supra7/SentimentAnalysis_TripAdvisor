My family and I stayed here at the end of November. I almost always take my own soap and if I forget I go and buy it. This hotel claims they are 4 stars and their bath products are supposed to be from a well known spa so I thought "hey how bad can it be?". REAL BAD!!! My skin had an allergic reaction to this horrible soap and lotion and I scratched NON stop day and night for 2 weeks and am still itchy. I have been to 5 different doctors which included an allergist, a dermatologist and the ER!!! I was told my skin has severely reacted to something I have used which has caused my psoriasis to flare up like never before. AND The ONLY thing I have done different is use the bath products at this so called "4 star" hotel. In almost 35 years i have NEVER experienced skin problems even half as bad as i have since staying at the hotel. The staff was not helpful, parking was outrageous, security questioned us like we were trying to steal something, for the first time ever at a 4+star hotel I was charged for milk for my baby, the call button on the intercom from the parking Garage was not functioning so i had to Walk back into the hotel. I'm sure there is more but I can't think with the burning sensation around my eyes!!! Overall a HORRIBLE experience! Guess we should just stick with The Sheraton. Irritated beyond belief!

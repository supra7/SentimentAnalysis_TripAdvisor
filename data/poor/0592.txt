I booked a room for a friend and called to ask that they bill my credit card. When he showed up, they wouldn't use my card and he didn't have enough money, he had to go sleep in the airport. Then the hotel USED MY CARD to bill for a no-show!!!! Seriously unbelievable. And I can't get them to refund. On to disputing the charge with my credit card company. I will not be staying at any Marriott soon, and NEVER this one!

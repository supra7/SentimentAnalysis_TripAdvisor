This is a dressed up mess! This place doesn't understand the importance of the basics; a comfortable bed, bathtub and a nice staff. They fail on all levels. If you really want to remodel this place start with the management, front desk, housekeeping and keep going. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else.

On October 11, 2011, after checking in at the front desk I was sent to a room that was occupied, and as I entered the man in the bed quickly covered himself. Humiliation! I went back down to the front desk, and the lady looked up the room I had been sent to and said "oh, it does look like someone is in that room!" Really? So she quickly sent me to another room, but forgot to change my key card, so I had to return to the desk again. I had a terrible couple of nights sleep because outside my window the garbage trucks were dumping dumpsters of garbage from the entire building across the street. All night long. The only consolation was that I was given a small reduction on one nights stay, but had to remind them of the humiliation I had upon check-in to get that. I will never stay here again.

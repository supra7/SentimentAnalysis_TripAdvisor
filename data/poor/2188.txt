I travel often to Dallas Texas on business and pleasure. This was the first time I have stayed at the Sheraton downtown Dallas and I will NEVER stay here again. When I checked in and was taken to my room by the bellman the door to the room was latched from the inside. This should have been a clue. The bellman had to call maintenance to literally break-in to the room. Once inside the junior suite is was apparent from the condition of the room  why the door was latched from the inside. It room was filthy and apparently had not been used in months. The hotel was undergoing renovation  however, all advertisements, including the Web site stated that renovations were complete. Well, renovations were NOT complete in the South Tower where they had placed me. The bellman (a nice and hardworking person) went back down stairs to the front desk to change the room for me. When the bellman returned, he led me to another room. The next room was not as dirty  but this time there was no working latch on the door. In fact, the latch was lying on the floor just inside the door. In addition, this was a MUCH smaller room. Again, I called down stairs and again the bellman went down stairs to get another key to another room. After moving to the third room, in the same South Tower  again, which was NOT renovated, there were no towels, no soap, and I had to wait 2 hours to have these items brought up to the room by housekeeping. No one, at anytime, offered to move me to one of the renovated Towers. No one offered to upgrade my reservation. I was nice to everyone. I tried to understand that everyone was busy. I never lost my cool or made a scene  perhaps I should have. Further, the front desk was rude and acted as if I was an imposition. When I visited the Concierge to make a dinner reservation, she stayed on the phone talking to a relative for 15 - 20 minutes. Needless to write  I will NEVER go back to the Sheraton in downtown Dallas.

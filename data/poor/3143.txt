NO HOT WATER!!!!!!!!!! WARNING! This hotel regularly runs out of hot water! Only stay here if you don't want to take a shower. Also, the rooms are very, very small. I mean small, as in closet with windows. When I stayed in one of the king rooms, the sink was in my lap when I sat on the toilet. There are many other (better) choices in this neighborhood, like the Metropolis or the Cosmo even.

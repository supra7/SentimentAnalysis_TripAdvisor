While the hotel advertises that it is a "historical boutique hotel", it is... but it is also just plain... "old." Everything in the hotel, including the hallway decorations, elevators, beds, bedding, and showers are all in need of major renovation. The front desk staff is nice and courteous but understand and say "it's not for everyone." If you are used to the quality and predictability of a standard hotel chain... don't stay here. While they have free wireless internet access for guests... it's not a hotel for the standard business traveler.

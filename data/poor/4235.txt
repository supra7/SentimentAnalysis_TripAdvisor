My husband had his computer stolen from our room. On the second night we left our room for about 2 1/2 hours to have dinner. The next morning when my husband opened his bag to set up computer it was not there. I had locked the door that night when we went to bed with dead bolt and extra lock, so computer must have been stolen while we were at dinner. Spoke to hotel security and risk management who assured me no one had entered our room according to information on door lock. Very unsettling that someone could enter our room and not leave a trace. Our door was closed when we left for dinner. Wanted others to be cautious if you choose to stay here. Rooms were tired, but cheap- at least with the group rate.

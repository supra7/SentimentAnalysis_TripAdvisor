We were somewhat disappointed in the Inn at Harbor Steps in Seattle. We are well traveled B&B lovers and thought that this inn would have a little more warmth than the other massive hotels in the area. It was very modern and the furniture in the room was sparse. It was definately missing something - no ottoman, lots of empty space. The reception area was OK, but again, very cold. The location was just OK, but not safe to walk around after dark, which again was disappointing. I took a shower at night & found there to be no COLD water - which meant a very uncomfortable, scalding hot shower! When I brought it up with the front desk, another guest overheard & she said that she had the same thing happen to her - their response was "wow, that's wierd, usually it's the opposite & there's nor Hot water" - nice. AQlso, the cheapest sheet that I have ever seen in a hotel room, they were nearly see through! The breakfast was nothing to write home about - it was just OK. Mostly a continental fare. There was also very limited seating - not enough for everyone & so we had to leave then come back in order to sit down. After traveling to this inn I would not return again, nor would I reccommend them to others. I would prefer to stay in a nicer, warmer, even if larger, hotel. I don't mind spending more on quality!

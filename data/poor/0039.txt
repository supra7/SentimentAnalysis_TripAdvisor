My husband and I decided to stay at Hotel Seattle because of the price and the location. But in the end, it probably would have been cheaper for us to stay at one of the nicer hotels a block over. There's no parking at this hotel, which meant we had to spend 30 bucks at a parking garage. Also, there's no internet in the rooms and our T.V. didn't work. Definitely a BIG disappointment.

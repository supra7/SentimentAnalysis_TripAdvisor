The resort neglected to tell us that the resort was under construction, so it took us 30 mins longer to walk around the contruction area. The maids NEVER came during our visit, internet was not working half the time when we needed it, and the shuttle never came to pick us up, and the walk to the strip takes 40 minutes.

Our room had an airconditioner that didn't work. It said the temp.was 32 and would turn on and say that its off. The carpet was wet and the safe didn't work. There was no remote in the room. After calling the front desk twice. I finally went to them and told them I wanted another room. The room they gave us was nice and there was not a problem with it. The outside and pool area was very nice but the rooms are in need of new carpet and some TLC. We spoke to 4 different guests and they said that they as well had to switch rooms for some reason or another as well. We were told one price for parking and internet and the priced was doulbe at check out time.

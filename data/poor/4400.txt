If you want to be in the middle of the action on the strip, DO NOT stay at this place. If you do you will be walking many blocks back and forth to the action on the strip, or you can ride the DEUCE bus back and forth or take a taxi. The double room I was in was very small and the sink smelled like the sewer. I overheard other people with the same complaint. Another colleagues room had never been cleaned when she returned to it at 3 a.m., even though she had the placard on the door asking that it be cleaned. If you are on a strict budget I know these rooms can be found on hotwire for $27, probably cheaper on priceline, but I still wouldnt stay here. The breakfast provided was not good either, although the fruit was very sweet and fresh.

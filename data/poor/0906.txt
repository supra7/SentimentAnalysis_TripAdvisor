I read the reviews too late! I had already "won" on priceline. I thought "how bad can a five star hotel be?" The answer is simple, THIS ISN'T A FIVE STAR HOTEL!!! Just because you put in a Sub-Zero fridge and give feather pillows doesn't make it five star. You will not sleep if you stay here. The window design is flawed so you here everything from outside, even on the 54th floor. The train comes by frequently and blows a LOUD horn. The air conditioning doesn't cool your room. I like the temperature at about 74 which isn't very cold and it couldn't do it. The staff is nice enough, but obviously overworked. They never turned down the beds, fixed the TV, made the sofa bed, or brought our "trump kids" ammenities. You can read about the plain, boring pool, small workout room and RIDICULOUS $15/NIGHT service charge in other reviews. Bottomline is, there are way better hotels offering way more for less money when you figure in the food, gaming and show credits offered at other hotels that you do not get here. BTW the food is bad too!! They gave us Sara lee cheescake, no joke!!

Disgusting! Sent by another hotel b/c they had problems. 10th floor stunk so bad, the carpet all down the hallway looked liked it had been bleached out on the sides, paint was coming off the walls. Our room had big stain spots everywhere, bed sheets had rust and when we pulled off the fitted sheet it looked like big pee spots were everywhere. We slept in our clothes! When I asked the employee how much the room was she said 235.00. What a joke! Wouldn't even eat the free breakfast. To scared!! Would have been better off sleeping under the bridge!

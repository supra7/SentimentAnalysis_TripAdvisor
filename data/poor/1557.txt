It's been quite some time since I stayed here, and still feel like I was scarred for life!!! I had to laugh at these other bad reviews on this hotel, because I know they're true!!! After staying here I felt like going home and taking a bath in lysol for a full week to get all of the filth off!!!! (NO JOKE!!!!!!) On a scale of 1-5, this hotel would be a NEGATIVE 10! The rooms, floors, elevators and even the luggage carts were filthy. There were even rumors of a swingers room on another floor! I was with a group for a conference, and one person's room had bloody sheets and towels and had to change rooms. Another person's had a broken toilet and massive hole in the wall and had to change rooms. My room had filthy carpet, a broken ac, broken tv cabinet, and a misterious handprint on the wall next to the bed. There appeared to be a gang in the parking lot at night, and there were very shady people walking around. I don't even want to talk about the restaurant!!!! I just remember praying that no one would have food poisoning after such a horrible breakfast!!!! I do not suggest this place for my worst enemy!!! It was truly an unforgettable experience that I never plan to repeat, but somehow always tops everyone' else's worst hotel stories!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

We checked in for a weekend getaway by booking our reservation through a 3rd part website. Once we arrived, they stated our booking had been lost and we would need to check in to another hotel 3 miles from the existing location. This was all done with a big smile with absolutely no concern for inconvenience we would have to endure. After speaking with 2 different managers, we were able to get a "wait one minute while I check with our General Manger" response. After waiting 30 minutes in the lobby, she came back and stated we were lucky and we would get a room even though they weren't obligated to honor our reservation since it was made through a 3rd party website. Never in my life have I ever met a hotel manager that was so rude, callous, and void of managerial competance. The view was spectacular and the rooms were sufficient but the service received by the woman front office manager with blonde hair and glasses will never be forgotten. I would never stay here ever again even if it was free.

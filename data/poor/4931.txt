First view of the place was a fenced off construction zone. The entire place was a disaster area. The view outside of the resort was a desolate wasteland filled with homeless people and criminals. It may be close to the strip, but walking to the strip is like walking through a minefield, "Do at your own risk." Upon arrival, we were hit with a $70 cleaning fee and the room was not cleaned once. We also requested a room near a pool. The nearest functioning pool was 300 yards away and we had a nice view of a parking lot. Of course, the desk clerks were useless and astounded that we were not satisfied. There is no place within two miles to get anything to drink. I paid a homeless man to go to the gas station for me and he delivered a six pack to my room. Apparently he did not require security clearance. I also informed the front desk of this as I checked out after my twenty four hours of torture at this place. They said nothing.

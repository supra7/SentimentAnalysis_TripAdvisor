When we arrived, the lobby seemed nice and the lady working at the front desk was great. We took the outdated elevator up to our room where we discoved hair in the beds...Yuck! They switched us to another room where everything was dirty (floors, pillowcases, bedding). They switched us to another room that was less dirty, but not clean. They did a poor job remodeling all of the guests rooms, and the beds were very uncomfortable. I have traveled all over the world, and this hotel is NOT a four star hotel. I think a 2 1/2 star rating is more appropriate. If you are looking for a nice place to stay near the Galleria in Dallas, find somewhere else!

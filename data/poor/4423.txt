We stayed at the Stratosphere in Feb 2008. I had read a review on this website before we went and I'm glad I did. On the second night I noticed a bug in the bed and I looked carefully and there were not one but two bed bugs in the bed. We called to complain and were given an 'executive suite'. no apologies, no comps. The staff was pleasant, but not spectacular, also it was strange that they did not seem the least bit surprised that we found bugs in the room.

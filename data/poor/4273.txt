The room " non-smoking" was well appointed, and my sister & I were excited about our weekend get-a-way. The employees from valet on up were freindly and helpful, the Starbucks at the bottom of our elevator was a plus for that early morning coffee run. Than 3:00 a.m. we were awakend by the smell of marijuana and sounds of people leaving a party next door. Security was called and 5 officers arrived, the smoke was so heavy when the door opened the officers were chocking, id's were taken and they were given a warning to keep it down. Thats it!!! I understand warnings about keeping the noise down but illegal drug use, give me a break. The night sift manager was called at our request and he offered to move us, we were checking out in less than 8 hrs. If drugs are your thing Harrah's may just be what your looking for. If like us you want to unwind and feel like the mangement cares about your well being this isn't the place for you. In Vegas the option's are limitless. Stay some place else.

The halls were mildewy with peeling wallpaper, filthy carpet and the rooms weren't much better. The only way to make it liveable is to leave the doors open (the air speads the stinky mold smell) The carpet needs to be torn out along with the apolstery and the curtains. The beds are old and uncomfortable. While the staff was very friendly and accomodating the service was terrible and physical accomodations stunk. I was even served a moldy hamberger. Maybe it will be better when they renovate next year but for now - AVOID this propery.

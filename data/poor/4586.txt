So I booked this hotel through priceline. The price.. about 225.00 a night. A lot ? yes! Especially when I stayed at a hotel for that price nearby with a huge suite. The room was so small, I was nauseated. I felt completely ripped off. The bathroom had a stupid curtain not a door, and the sink was this little tiny thing with low flow. The place was extremely loud. The room would either get hot or cold, and I could hear elevators going up and down. Somebody tried to enter my room on more than one occasion. Thank god for the other locks. I would never stay here again and I warn everyone else looking for a hotel to stay at to stay clear from this disaster.

I am so surprised just how bad my stay here was. I will note at the outset that the staff was very nice and helpful. As for the accomodations .. . unspeakable. The first room that I had a pungent and awful smell. In addition, the bathroom smelled like mildew. It was sickening. In response to my complaint, I was promptly moved to a new room, which did not smell but had its own issues. The carpeting was worn and stained. One of the pillowcases had a dirty handprint on it. The blinds on the window were completely mangled on the edges. Overall, it is obvious that these rooms desperately need upkeep and updating. I have stayed in many hotels - - in Manhattan as well as other major cities throughout the world. This was the most disappointing experience I have had. I expected so much more from the "W" brand.

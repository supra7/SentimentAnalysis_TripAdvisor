Yes, the room is cheap but you get what you pay for. There are no irons, no hair dryers, NO ICE MACHINES, no fridge...no bells or whistles. With only vertical blinds on the windows and no curtains, there is no such thing as dark in these rooms. It is broad daylight at 2 am. We were on the front corner just above the GOLD SPIKE sign which lit up the room like the 4th of July. After the first night, I asked to be moved to another room away from the sign. We packed our belongings and lugged from one end of a floor to the other end of another floor. I looked out the window and guess what...we were right above the SAME SIGN on the opposite end of the bldg. I called back and asked for a room on the other side of the bldg. Reluctantly, the desk clerk sent us packing to a third room. This one was back on the original floor, but in the middle of the floor and away from the signs...Thank God! Again I say, yes the room is CHEAP - but you get what you pay for!! Equal or below a Super 8 or Motel 6. Stay at your own risk!!

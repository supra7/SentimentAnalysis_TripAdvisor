Although recently renovated, this hotel does not live up to the expensive redo. Staff is smug and non responsive to guests' needs. Telephone operator is not always available to answer your calls (the hotel itself sometimes will not answer),and sometimes your wake up calls will be forgotten. Rooms are inadequately furnished (my room did not have shelfing for my clothes in the closet), although the bed is indeed very confortable. Door staff is more for show than help, since they are always busy either talking to each other or checking out passing people on the street. As a whole, I would not recommend this hotel, it was a very disappointing stay.

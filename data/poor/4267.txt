The last night of our stay after we went out for my sister's bachelorette party, we came home to find that our room had been ROBBED. Over $6000 was charged on the credit and debit cards stolen, $200 cash, and several ipods were also taken. We immediately reported this to hotel security. We made "statements" to them, and they assured us that they would handle the investigation and get back to us with the findings. When we reported everything, we were told offhandedly by the staff members around that some of the doors do not lock properly at the hotel and can be opened by simply pushing on the door. 3 months and 25 non returned phone calls later, they respond by saying that they have determined that they are not responsible for what happened. They won't tell us what happened, only that its not there fault and please bugger off. THEN they told us we aren't allowed to file a police report!!!! Bottom line, this is a shady place. I would not get involved with this casino. I would not feel safe staying at any of their hotels or casinos. They clearly do not take responsibility for the safety and well being of their guests. The rooms are also pretty mediocre, and the casino itself is just so-so. I say, go for the MGM or Belaggio or something. Forget Harrah's!! Shady, shady, shady!!!!

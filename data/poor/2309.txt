Just got back from a week at the Grand Wailea. We have stayed here many times in the past, and always had a great time. Sadly to say, not so on this occasion. From the 'tepid' reception, to the listless registration,...it was then downhill. For $750 night you expect more. We had lunch at the Bistro Molikini, and I have to say I have had better service at a Denny's, and cardboard had more taste. We decided to 'sit around' the pool and 'chat' with our family, and we were 'chased away' by the pool girl, who said that if we were to sit in a chair, we had to have a 'pool id bracelot'... Seriously? I explained that I had 2 rooms rented, which rooms they were, and that all we wanted to do is sit, talk,, drink a drink, and enjoy. We were told that we had to leave. There were plenty of pool side seats available, it was 3pm in the afternoon. Sadly, this will be our last trip to the Grand Wailea.

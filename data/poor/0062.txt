I've never had a worse experience at a hotel, and I travel a lot for business. The place is a dive...old, dirty and grungy. Not to mention, they charge for services not rendered, and refuse to issue a credit, even in the case of an innocent mistake. Don't waste your time here, not even for their cheap rate!

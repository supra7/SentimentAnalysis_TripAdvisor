Confirmed reservation & Airport pick up before leaving home from California. Told to call and hotel 24hr shuttle would pick us up from Airport. Called upon arrival at midnight, but no telephones at Hotel were ever answered upon calling. Paid for Taxi to hotel and upon arrival were told the Hotel was very oversold , they could not accommodate us with our Confirmed Reservation, and acted like they did not care. Being 2 woman alone, after midnight in an unknown area, we located a last minute different hotel on our own, but very uncomfortable doing so.

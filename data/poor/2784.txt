This hotel is an absolute hole and was really disappointing after it was recommended to us by our travel agent. The rooms are incredibly small, the bathrooms are extremely filthy, the service as a whole was terrible (except when we checked out), the air conditioners are so noisy you need earplugs to sleep, my wife has been bitten to death by bedbugs, the shower curtain and tiles were mouldy and black, the room smelt mouldy, the bed was not made up in two days, the towels are small and so old you can see through, the power sockets were falling out the walls, the mini bar sucked, you have to wait on average 2 mins for a lift, the staff walk around with loud blearing walkie talkies which wake you up in the night (unless you wear earplugs), the bed was radiating heat all night (PROBABLY THE BED BUGS), the thermostat in the aircon didnt work, the TV reception and sound was dismal, the front desk is chaotic all the time, no one offered to help with our luggage, the Internet service didnt work (thank god for StarBucks), our toilet was broken and did not flush, we found cockroaches in the bathroom over two consecutive days and experienced cold showers. Overall this ruined our arrival to New York and we found cheaper accomodation with far better service and facilities at a cheaper price 4 streets away.

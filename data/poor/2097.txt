THE GOOD: The lobby and a few of the ballrooms are as old town Chicago as you can get. The sense of history in the lobby alone is magnificant. It's a busy lobby area with lots of casual drinking throughout much of the late afternoon until late evening. It is next to an L stop. It is adjacent to Grant Park and walking distance to De Paul, Solider Field, several museams, the Chicago Theater and the Lake. I flew into Midway at rush hour and it was very convenient to get to without much traffic. My window actually opened to let in the outside air. The hotel staff, when available, were very helpful and courteous. THE BAD: The rooms were small. There was a very crummy hotel store. The bathrooms could not have been smaller. The shower curtain clung to my body. The TV was not a flat panel. The cable options were very limited. THERE WAS NO IN-ROOM COFFEE!!!!! It was too far away from the Mag Mile to walk. There were a few nice restaurants nearby, but not the amount you would find closer to the Mag Mile. The concierge desk was constantly crawling with people and had a large line. The elevators were very slow (2-8 minute waits each time).

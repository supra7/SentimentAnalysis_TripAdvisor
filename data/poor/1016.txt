My partner and I booked this via the internet - the photo looked fine. We were not looking for 5 star accomodation just a clean, comfortable room with bathroom facilities ( which we requested) On arrival I couldn't believe my eyes!! The hotel was extremely tired and wasn't even clean!! The carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks!! The first room they showed us too was nothing short of disgusting. When I said this was not what we had asked for the lady apologised and went to find the manager who then proceeded to tell us we had been shown to the wrong room. The next room we were shown was slightly better but honestly, the thought of sleeping in the bed appalled me!! We said this was not what we had expected nor what was represented, and we would like to cancel. They retained a nights accomodation. Good score for the Hotel and I imagine we wouldn't have been the first. I would not recommend the Holiday Lodge at all. The customer service was average at a pinch and the accomodation "simply awful" I really hope the owners take note of the comments as the location truly is a good one. As I said previously, not looking for 5 star but clean, tidy and comfortable would be good!!

I was so disappointed to find a 2.5 star experience in a so called 4 star hotel! As a weekend getaway I got this room for $120 through priceline. As you enter the lobby, you will find it to be almost bare. Large "ballrooms" with outdated decor, creepy would best describe the feeling of the entry and lobby. The check in was slow, when requesting a mini fridge to keep one item in, they tried to charge an additional $15 before finally admitting the mini bar/fridge in the room would store our item. No need for an additional fridge or $15. Do not try to call the front desk, the phone rings forever and when finally answered, you will be put on hold for another very long hold. Two people at the front desk with only the nice lady working, the guy was playing on the computer and of no help at all. The room....as we quickly entered the room to drop our belongings before heading out for the night, we noticed it very hot in the room. We turned the ac on and left thinking it would be ok when we returned. Upon our return, we again turned it down cooler hoping it would cool off. Needless to say, at 5:50 am I was on the phone with the front desk telling them we were in a room with no AC!! The carpet was dirty, bed was uncomfortable and just felt like a motel. We will never stay here again, there are many options of nice, affordable and NEW places within a block ot two! I am sure they probably have working ac too!

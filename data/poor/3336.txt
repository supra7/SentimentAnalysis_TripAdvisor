I had made reservations 3 weeks in advance. I purposely arrived later ~7pm to allow for extra time for the room to be ready. When I arrived the front desk stated that several guests had wanted to extend their stay and that did not have a room for me. I had traveled cross country and NO attempt had been made to contact me via phone, email, etc. They refused to pay for a hotel in the area stating that they were too expensive. They did call and find me a room at a VERY shady part of town located about 15 miles away from the convention center right off I5. The main reason that I choose to stay at The Baroness was due to it's close proximity to downtown. The desk clerk was had not be trained to deal with this type of situation and the manager basically left her on her own to deal with me and the other guests that were being turned away. You may be lured in by the more moderate pricing compare to hotels in the area but it will not be worth the difference in cost for the potential hassle.

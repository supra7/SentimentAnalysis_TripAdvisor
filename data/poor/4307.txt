So we arrived at Harrah's on Friday and checked out on Sunday. The people were nice at the front desk, but the hotel is definitely not somewhere I would like to stay again. The rooms do not have a safe and we mysteriously had $140 missing from my room. I'm assuming it was either somebody on the staff or the room next to us. The door between the rooms was not locked upon our arrival and we didn't realize it until the money was missing. While searching our room, we found a used condom, stains in the carpet that were probably semen, and lots of dust. We let hotel security know that there was money missing from our room, but it was one of those things where they took a report and told us to call back in three days. Why are we going to call back? Is something going to magically appear? I'm definitely not pleased with the hotel and would tell others to avoid this hotel!

I have stayed at this property many times over the past sixteen years. The past ten years have been with children. I specifically told them when making the reservations that my wife and I were travelling with kids and needed adjoining rooms. The first e-mail reservation confirmation did not include the second room. I immediately corrected that. A day later I was informed that to guarantee adjoining rooms they would charge me an extra $100 per night. The hotel has been getting a bit tattered in recent years and now they are punting on the last attribute they had going for them... being family friendly.

Never again I was looking for a budget-priced room in Waikiki for 2 nights (mainly to sleep in after partying into the early morning hours). Didn't expect it to be this hopeless.If you have a car, make sure you're not traveling alone. There is no porte-cochere or even a small area to pull off to the side of Kuhio Ave. to check in. The parking garage is accessible only by gate code, which you receive after you check in and pay $18/day. (Note: Pay for only 1 night of parking! The gate code didn't change, nor did the check the dates on the reciept).You receive 2 keys, one for the door, one for the safe.Got a room on the 9th floor. Apparently, my friend who was in a room on the 12th floor, claims his room was nicer than mine.The central AC isn't working, so the window units were put in, which kept the room very cold. Pulled off the bedspread, which revealed an old, orange wool blanket. Luckily, the sheets were clean!The bathroom is okay. No place to cleanly store the soap bar. Water pressure was strong and the drain wasn't clogged (very surprised). Basin area is very small. Shampoo, conditioner and lotion provided.Drawer which stores the phone books was dirty and had left over food particles inside. The phone looked totally disgusting. The lights over the desk wasn't working.Tried to cash a check. They don't do it.I've stayed at some Motel 6's in the mainland, which were half the price of the Aqua Continental and were so much cleaner.If you're on a budget and don't care about a clean, fresh-feeling type of room, this place is for you. I'm going to do my homework a little bit better next time!

My room: ten feet from the front desk (on the same faux marble floor as the lobby), six inches from the stairwell, four feet from the elevator, three stairs up and four steps from the front door, and about seven feet above the sidewalk. In other words, as loud as a room could possibly be. When I went back to the front desk to get another I was shown the only other nonsmoking rooms they had, which were five feet across from the front desk, again on the same faux marble floor. From in there I can only imagine you could hear the desk clerk breathing. And, of course, every single footstep from every single person coming or going. In the end, I went with a smoking room on the third floor, two floors directly above the first room I was given. I was still stuck next to the road, the elevator, and the stairwell, but at least I wasn't right on the lobby. Not surprisingly, people coming and going still kept me awake all night long, despite ear plugs (and a pillow over my head). In the morning, trying to recover from that horrible night's sleep, I was treated to a shower of knocking pipes. Cold water worked fine. Hot not so much. There must be rooms in the place that aren't so totally uninhabitable, but I didn't see them. The four I was offered were each worse than any other hotel room I've ever seen. And I'm not accustomed to luxury.

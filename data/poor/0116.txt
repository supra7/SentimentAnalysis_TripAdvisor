My boyfriend and I stayed there solely for its location to a festival that was near by. That was the only benefit of this hotel and that it had a table in the room, but i think all do these days? We arrived early and there was not any rooms available to check in early, they did hold our luggage for us. When we returned we were given the key to 104, immediately when we walked into the room there was an extreme odor of Indian food. After sitting in the room for a few minutes and getting headaches we decided to complain. Luckily they font desk was able to place us in a room on the other side of the hotel. Our new room 108 only smelt like musty old clothes. The hotel was old and wasn't in the best shape but I have to admit I never saw any bugs. Another thing that bothered me is that on their website they still advertise that they have grab and go breakfast, that is untrue, they provide nothing. The parking that they charge you $15 for is a block and a half away. Lastly, the bath and body products they provide had a bad smell and the shampoo was really runny. For how expensive the place is it is not worth the money, Next year I will be paying a little more for some quality.

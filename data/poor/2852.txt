Recently was laid to rest at this W as it was a disaster. They had a renovation, but must of only been in the lobby (only area that appears "W" like). Once you get in the room you realize you have been suckered into a dump. Paint is peeling off areas, dirty caulk around bathroom, and worst of all, I had a "methane" scent that filled the room for hours everytime you flushed the toilet. You could tell there were major plumbing issues as the pipes emitted weird sounds all night and that odor.... When I mentioned this to the staff they said "sorry" and just kept walking. Even the bell hop laughed when I asked if this was a "W" and he then agreed it was going down the tubes here. I stay in LOTS of W's and I am even getting married next year at one; so I love the brand. I must say stay in Times Square (although the location is a bit too busy) as the rooms are up to W standards.

Worst hotel ever. No elevator, so I had to walk up 3 flights of stairs with my luggage. I didn't get an iron. Nor was one available. I complained. Staff were not proactive in getting me an iron. I was simply told "all the irons are taken", and they took no further action. I asked the front desk to book me a cab to the airport. I went for a walk, returned in an hour and nothing had been done. Very ordinary.

We got to the hotel,first off the doors were locked,the hotel doesn't look like the internet at all.There is no air condition,they would bring you up a fan if you need it.No screens on the windows.The bathroom is even worse,old dirty,all the windows are dirty.We left we didn't even stay there.The area outside has many people begging for money,we even saw a woman sitting on the side walk holding a rat.Just avoid the down town area of San Francisco all together or go to a well known hotel.

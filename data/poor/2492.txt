This is the absolute worst hotel I have ever visited in my life. My flight was canceled and I needed a close hotel to the airport to catch my rescheduled early morning flight. Upon entering the room I was appalled at the dirty and unsanitary conditions. I immediately asked for another room when I saw roaches crawling up the wall. Not to my surprise the second room was not any better. There were dead cockroaches on the floor and I immediately asked for a refund and left the hotel. I would never even look in this hotel's direction or recommend this disgusting establishment to anyone. This hotel needs to be condemned and the owner should be ashamed of him/herself for running such a horrible establishment.

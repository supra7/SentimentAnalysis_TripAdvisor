Had a short stop over at madrid airport and decided to try this hotel - mistake!! Arrived in Madrid at 10pm and had to wait 50 mins for the shuttle bus. Rang the hotel only to be told it was nearly there - but it wasn't. Arrived at hotel eventually and queued to check in. The surly receptionist asked to see my daughters passport and told us that as she was 13 (it was her bithday the day before) we would have to pay for her to be in our room. When we booked we were not told this so refused to pay. After much messing around she reluctantly agreed to waiver the charge but was obviously not happy. By this time there was a large queue behind us so it was all a bit embarissing to say the least. Eventually got to the 'suite' and it was horrid. Basic with paper thin walls, it just looked awful. The kitchen didnt have a single plate, cup, or glass - whats the point in having a kitchen ! Bedroom was small with a teeny window and the most vile bed I have slept on in a while. Limp and lumply pillow which didnt smell very clean and the bedding consisted of a sheet and a horrid manky looking blanket with a thin and unattractive cover on top. My daughters bed was shoved up a corner in the lounge and was equally horrrid. Would have complained but by this time we only had about 5 hours to get some sleep so decided to get on with it. However next doors TV could be heard through the walls and ny husband and I were constanly itching - maybe the blankets?? Ended up hardly sleeping. I am not a constant complainer, if you look at my other reviews you will see that but I would say only go to this hotel if there are no other options, we hated it and it spoilt the end of our holiday. Only paid 60 euro but dont think it was even worth that. Stay away, much nicer options nearby

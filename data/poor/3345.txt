First of all, the people at the front desk act like you are checking into a Ritz Carlton. They are rude and snobby. Secondly, we packed a cooler for a picnic on the ride down and were told we couldn't take it in the hotel room. In order to make a few extra dollars, you are only allowed to have alcohol form the bar at the hotel. There is sign on the front desk telling you that if beer or wine is found without the hotel label on it, you will be asked to leave the premesis. Crazy!!!! Then when we checked in our room was dirty! I understand there are rools for summer beach hotels....but we were all adults in the party and they treated us like 18 year olds at senior week.

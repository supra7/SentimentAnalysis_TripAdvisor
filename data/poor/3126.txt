My husband and I had planned a kid free trip to San Francisco. Unfortunately, we had to change to a more expensive hotel after only one night. We booked the Diva months before our trip, but they put us in a horrible room on the second floor directly above the air conditioning units. The room was damp, the bed was small, and they were stains on the wall. As I have extreme mold allergies we asked to move. They informed us that they only had rooms at the front. My husband and I did not sleep the entire night, even after the front desk provided us with earplugs. The street noise was unbearable. We had planned to sleep in, but men were working on the front of the hotel early in the morning and that made sleeping impossible. We were not informed by either Travelocity or the Diva that the hotel would be undergoing reservations. The second room was nicer than the first, but the beds were uncomfortable and too small for the surrounding frame/bedside tables. We ended up calling around and moving to another hotel. We are hoping that our refund goes through. I cannot express enough how disappointing the Diva was, we spent the rest of our visit trying to recoup the sleep that we didn't get for that entire first night. I would not recommend the Diva to anyone - if you must stay there please request rooms at the back of the hotel. My husband and I are forty - our days of loud hotels and sleepless nights are hopefully behind us.

VVVV BAD I went to this hotel for Valantine's Day weekend. The hotel has a nice cool entrance. Its in a very busy and nice part of SFO called Union Sqaure. The are ahs a lto fo good shops and places to eat. However, this hotel, has a small entrance that makes it look like a boutique hotel. But it really isnt, the lobby are is very loud because of the club/bar opposite the entrance. I was first booked for a junior suite, and I didnt like it at all. It was real small and for those of you who like to watch a little TV. The TV in the Junior Suite has a 15inch screen. Then I upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which wasnt that much fun either, the room was bigger, but not comfortable at all, the bathroom is clean but very small. I moved out and went to the Palace the same night, which is more like a five star hotel. If any of you want any suggestions, please dont go there...save money and you might as well stay at the Four Seasons.

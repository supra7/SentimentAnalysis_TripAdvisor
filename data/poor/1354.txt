We had a room reservation booked directly with the hotel by phone. We made the reservation 3 weeks before going there and "re"confirmed 3 days before. They send us a confirmation email for our room. When we arrived there THEY HAD NO ROOM FOR US!!!!! They had a huge pile of dossier of person with reservation and no room. We had to spend the night in the train station. We saw a family of 5 person with elder and child having to go on the streets of London at 11:30 PM to find a room (impossible task in London in July!!) This family had already paid for the room... so... NO COMMENT... Last but not least, the person attending during this night seemed to find it funny that they had so many person with reservation and having paid a room! We have no words to say how outraged we were. They should be ashamed.

Ended up staying here as we orignally booked a room at Norfolk hotel few doors away (could be a scam as ive noticed a few people have said the same). Entered the building to an awful smell that i cant even describe and a man walking around looking like he just left a mental home!!!!!!! As you walk up the stairs you get the smell of a sewage and in every corner of the hallway there are bags of rubbish!!!! We had a family room for 4 people, there were 4 beds, a tv (which didnt work). The carpet was not hoovered with tissue on the floor. The curtain rail was hanging off the wall and the net curtain half falling off and looked like it had NEVER been cleaned!!! The toilet and shower was brown and had limescale all over it, We moved the bed side cabinet to hold the toilet door closed to keep the smell of sewage out of the room. We even had to run over to mcdonalds to use there toilet as we didnt want to use the one in the room. After our nite out we returned to the hotel and slept in our clothes as didnt want to touch the bed sheets. Insted of using the pillows which had stains on we used our coats. We had a family room which supposed to be for 4 people but we couldnt even all stand up at the same time as it was so small. Overall it was a terrible experience and in future we will be booking into well known hotels.

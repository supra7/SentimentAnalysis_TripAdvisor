The staff actually denied one of my companions entry into the elevators. They demanded her ID and when she said it was in the room they wouldn't go with her to get it. She slept on the lobby couch and the manager thought that it was funny. She was a registered guest. This was the single worst experience I have ever had and I stay at alot of hotels. Never the Marriott again.

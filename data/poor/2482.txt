I stayed at this hotel for my honeymoon and it was a true disappointment. Our room wasn't ready on arrival and we have to settle for a two full-beds instead of a king size one. They change us to a king bed for our second day, so we couldn't really unpack and unwind on our first night. The hallway was quite run down and the carpet must be at least 10 yrs old. The room was infested with roaches and after complaining with the front desk, I was told that Hawaii is a tropical island and that I should expect to see roaches. On the third night the roaches were crawling on the bed. The front desk offered to change rooms, but could not guarantee the new room would be roach free and it would mean a third different room to pack an unpack for, so we declined. In the end they comped us a meal and one of the seven nights we stayed there, but only after speaking to two different managers and them being quite condescending even making a big deal of how much that one night costs an we were getting credit for. And that is my point, no one should pay $350+ a night to sleep with roaches and get an attitude from the front desk.

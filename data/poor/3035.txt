We booked our stay at this place since we thought it was a reasonable price for lodging with a kitchen and living area, especially during a popular time to visit central Phoenix. We had to find lodging immediately and read a review that praised this location. We were immediately disappointed with the smoky halls, elevator, and awful smell of air freshener that permeated our room. The room was small and a lot of the amenities were missing--we had no bath mat, no washcloths, kleenex, soap, shampoo. We had no idea that the maid service was only once a week and were disgusted to find that patrons were simply placing their trash bags in the halls. We also did not like the shady characters that were hanging out in the halls and apparently living there long term. The only positive was the location but nothing else. Our price was $140/night but in retrospect we would have been willing to pay much more to stay somewhere else. We would not recommend this place to anyone.

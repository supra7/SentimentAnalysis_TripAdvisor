We were suppose to stay at this hotel for five nights using points for two of the five nights. The first night they put us in a room right by the elevator and all night long we heard the elevator going up and down. The room smelled like a 20 year old smoky hotel room. The customer service is horrible. We received no welcome Leigh at time of check-in. Was moved the second night to another room that also smelled and the pillow case was stained with rust spots.

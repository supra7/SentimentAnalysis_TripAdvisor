Service can't be rated because there simply isn't any. Rooms have kitchen with NO COOKING EQUIPMENT which makes the concept pretty pointless. We couldn't even geg a teaspoon to stir our complimentary coffee (they don't provide tea) and the tv didn't work. This is crap! the lobby is impressive , after that it looks like it was decorated by the sand man who designs motorway service stations. Give it a wide berth!

I was supposed to stay at Hotel Newtown for 5 days in January, however, my daughter became ill and we got stuck in Buenos Aires. As I had booked the hotel through an external site, I contacted the Hotel to let them know I would be unable to stay, and to see if I could cancel my reservation, however, the hotel answered that it was impossible, so I contacted the travel agent, who told me I was unable to cancel my booking without charge, unless the hotel allowed it. I was charged for the full booking, and when I contacted the travel agency to complain, they told me Hotel Newtown claimed to 'have never heard from me', which is simply untrue, which I have the email exchanges to prove. I am a single mother with mounting medical bills for an ill toddler in Argentina and lost flights to the states which I was unable to use, and am outraged that I could be treated so badly by the hotel staff, and director, who demonstrated a complete lack of compassion for my situation. BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BOOKING WITH THIS HOTEL.

Horrible....Save Your Money And Run!!!! The Ambassador was the most horrible hotel that I have ever been to. The people were not friendly nor helpful, the building was old, run down, and peeling...literally seen low end hotels for $30 bucks a night better. Not close to the beach like they claim, noisey surroundings, unsanatary bathroom the day we checked in, a hazard bucket under the leaking, rusting swamp cooler, and the first night there was a drunk guy banging on our door at 1am for about a half hour. Save your money!!!

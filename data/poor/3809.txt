Won't be back Coffs Harbour AustraliaDATE: 8/10/2008-24/10/2008Won't be BackWe will not be staying here again. The room was not cleaned very well and the bin in the kitchen was only empteed every 2nd day. Room was very small and when you oened the door you had to push on it with your hip and then when it did open you fell straight onto the bed. There was a connecting door between our room and another room and everytime somebody stayed in the other room they tried to open the door. A sign on the interconnecting door would have been a good idea. The air-con from above leaked all night onto ours and this was very anoying. The mini fridge made weird and wonderful noises and we thought it was going to blow up..We stayed here for 15 days. The room across the hall had a leek and in the hall it was all wet. To dry it out they put a blower on for 3 days which really was anoying. Bathroom very small and lights not in a good place. Staff were nice. Lift did ot work properly on some occasions and stopped at different floors for no reason and then wouod not move. Walls very thin. Bathroom looked liked it had been patched up with silicon. Rang our agent when we arrived back to Australia and told him not to recommend this hotel to anyone. Room for lots of improvement.

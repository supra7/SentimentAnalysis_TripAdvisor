Our experience at this resort was dissapointing. The first room they tried to put us in had no view of the beach or ocean (they advertise that all rooms do). We asked to be moved and ended up in a room with a partial view of the beach. After a heavy rain that night we woke up to water running down the walls and a flooded floor. After realizing that there was no poolside (community) hot tub and a leaky room they said we could upgrade to the newer building with a room that had a jacuzzi tub,so we moved again (for an extra 60 dollars a night). The new room was very spacious with a great view but we quickly discovered that the toilet didnt flush and the phone and dvd player didnt work. After a few phone calls (from the bathroom phone) those problems were fixed. We then discovered what I felt was the biggest annoyance of all, THIS RESORT IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!!! Right next to the large pool and the only restaurant where you can eat breakfast and lunch they are building the Presidential Suites building.From 7am to 5pm it was constant construction noise. All of the balconies in the new building overlook this area. It was impossible to nap or read or just relax unless you were in your room with the patio door closed. The pool is very cold (we never saw anyone in it) with a max depth of 3.5 feet ! The food was not very good ,room service food was beyond bad. I would stay away from this place at least untill the construction is completed

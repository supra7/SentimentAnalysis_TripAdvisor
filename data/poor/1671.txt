The hotel is very gross, very small, and has a musty smell to it. There is not free parking. You either pay for someone else to park it or you find your own parking space by a parking meter. The place smells. You cannot sleep, because the light is let in by the cracks in the door, and the walls are thin, so you can hear people walking, snoring, talking, etc. There is nothing to do at the hotel, except count bugs crawling in your room. When i stayed there, there was only one elevator and it was very small and super slow. The beds are very uncomfortable. The bathroom, shower, bathtub..... disgusting. Helpful tip! Don't stay there!

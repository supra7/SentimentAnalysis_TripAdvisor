Good location but that is it. Upon our arrival from a long trip, we were informed that we had got an upgrade. We were pleased to hear that after many hours in a plane. When we got to our suite, what a disappointment. Old furniture missing doors, the blinds in the bathroom were all twisted, hair in the bathroom walls and floor, a piece of human nail on the floor, mold odor all over. My girlfriend refused to take a shower in the bath tub. Filthy place. When I complained to the Front Desk Manager (Veronica Maldonado), she said that she would report the problem to the Housekeeping manager and the Hotel Manager. I received an not apologetic e-mail saying that my complaints would be "investigated". I work in the hotel business and know that it was not the kind of this answer that a guest would expect to hear. I felt robbed by the price that i paid for staying in this filthy place. I've stayed in hotels all over the world. Beekman place was the worst place I ever stayed at. Do not be fooled by the pictures on their website.

This is a great location, right on the beach but there are several motels right on the beach in the same area. I was offended by the staff and security guard and the maid service leaved a lot to be desired. It was very expensive for what you got. I frequent San Diego and will never stay in this motel again. Watch out for room cleanliness and staff rudeness.

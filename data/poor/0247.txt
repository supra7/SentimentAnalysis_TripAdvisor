Drapes looked like there had been a massacre in our room, balcony area (for smokers) was directly outside our room and had people partying and carrying on ALL NIGHT, bathroom was still dirty (spiderwebs under the sink), interupted by maintanence the next morning because my shower was leaking into the room beneath us, breakfast buffet resembled prison food with NOWHERE to sit...will never stay there again!!!! Was close to everything but we were afraid to move our car for fear of losing what few parking spots they had....were forced to take cabs at huge prices to go a few blocks. So much for giving my kids a nice getaway birthday weekend...the only good thing was Disney Princess Wishes on Ice at Key Arena.

The hotel itself if nice, but the room service is terrible. One night they took almost 30 minutes after we ordered to call us back to say they were out of our choice of entree. The next morning they did not pick up the breakfast card we hung on the door. When we called down, they said they would "rush it". After almost an hour of waiting we called again, and "it was on its way". We cancelled the order and left our room hungry (and cranky). But the worst was the next morning when my girlfriend felt something under the covers and then jumped out of bed screaming. I have no idea what the "thing" was (see pictures below) but it is the most disgusting and revolting thing I have ever seen. I do not want to share a bed with this!!!! We called the cleaning staff manager and she just looked at it, and said "I don't know what this is...I'll have them change your linens". Change our linens??? For the price of this hotel, I expect my linens to be changed before I check in! and for the room to be clean. Spotlessly clean. When we checked out and got the usual "how was your stay", the staff member (Indira) was very nice and seemed a bit more concerned about our bad experience, and promised to send us a complimentary stay, etc., etc. I got an email asking for our address, which I sent them almost a month ago, and have not heard a peep since. I don't mind paying top dollar for a hotel, but I do expect to get top dollar service and cleanliness in exchange!

Stay elsewhere We booked a room for a wedding at the end of September, and planned to stay from September 28 to October 2. We didn't.We arrived and checked in, and were handed a stack of receipts, brochures, and the like. We went to our room, and all seemed well enough. Until I received a phone call from a friend whose mother was staying at the Waikiki Parc. He asked whether I had read the memo from management. I hadn't even known there was one.Slipped in with the brochures and receipts, sure enough, there was a memo that said that, from 10 pm until 6 am, there would be no hot water, no cold water, and no air conditioning because of maintenance on the hotel's water system. Sure, a hotel may need to do maintenance, but, although they admitted knowing about it for several weeks, they did not contact us before we arrived. More appallingly, however, they didn't tell us about the problem when we checked--instead slipping the note in with other materials, apparently hoping that we wouldn't notice until it was too late.When we asked what their plans were for guests who might want to--oh, I dunno--use the bathroom or brush their teeth before going to sleep (to say nothing of taking a shower), they had nothing. They would not even offer us bottled water to brush our teeth.We checked out, will never stay at this hotel, and will never recommend it to anyone. Not because of the water issue--admittedly, maintenance work just sometimes needs to be done. Instead, the hotel's appallingly bad customer service makes this a hotel you really should skip.

I am not the pickiest traveler but I do enjoy a nice hotel. This was listed as a 3 star and it couldn't have been further from that. It was a complete no-frills hotel if I have ever seen one before. Everything was old and there really wasn't one nice thing I can say about it after I left or while I was there. They try to impress you with putting old actors/actresses names on doors who supposedly stayed in those rooms but the problem is the rooms are probably exactly the way they were 60 years ago without a thing being done to them. There are loud pool parties on the weekends which to me draws a thuggy type crowd and you could smell the smoke all throughout the hallway. I was there on a wekend to see a baseball game and let me tell you for a Saturday night there wasn't a thing open in sight. You also have to park your car in a desolated parking garage which you don't feel real safe about leaving your car in. Another bad thing is that there are vents above the door which do nothing but allow you to hear everything that is going on. Overall horrible hotel and would never go back again. Bathrooms were a joke!!

While I am a fan of the W Hotel chain, this one is simply AWFUL! There is no one to help you with your bags when you check in, the line to check in was far too long and they had only one person working who seemed indifferent to everyone she was assisting - and worst of all, one of the friends I went with was eaten up by bed bugs! She had bites all over her legs and back and all the hotel offered to do was move her into another room. She had to ask to have someone clean her clothes and they never offered to comp her room. There was mold on the ceiling, the shower door in my room didn't have a handle, and the elevators require a key to get to any floor - which is good security if the security actually worked! Everyone seemed to have issues getting to their floors. Finally, two other friends of mine came back to their room only to find them OPEN - and they weren't being cleaned. When they complained, what did they get? Free drinks. Great - thanks for nothing. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.

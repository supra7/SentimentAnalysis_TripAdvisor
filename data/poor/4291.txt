This was my WORST experience in regards to as Harrahs property! Was offered a COMPED Premium Executive Suite but when I got to the hotel was told this was not available, and was told I would be given a premium room. This was unexceptable and eventually after a half hour of complaining and dealing with hotel managers was given the suite. Suite was OK but by now I was very frustrated. Ate at Toby Keiths Bar and Grill and was VERY disappointed, way overpriced and not that great! Cafe was also not very good and very overpriced for a cafe. The topper was when I got home I noticed a $98.10 charge on my credit card for a room I didn't stay in, and to this day they will not refund my money. I'm in the process of getting the money back and will pursue it until it's refunded. I will NEVER stay at this or any other Harrahs property ever again and that's unfortunate becuase we stay at the HArrahs in Reno and have always been treated good, this Harrahs was a HUGE disappointment!!!!!!! I would never recommend this place.

My husband and I stayed at this pathetic hotel for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon, which was quite a shame since we had wanted to relax for the first part of our trip. However, we were so disgusted with the Maui Prince that we tried to be around as little as possible. Our room was clean, contrary to other reports, but that is about the only good thing I can say about our stay. Upon check-in, we found our ocean view room had very little view of the ocean, and instead overlooked the tiny pool and a big field which was empty during the day and had an obnoxious "luau" in the evenings with a pathetic lounge singer. Do NOT stay here if you want to relax on your lanai without listening to this lounge singer for 3 hours!! Since we had $100 credit as part of the "Romance Package", we planned to have a nice dinner on Saturday night at the restaurant with an ocean view, and we looked forward to watching the sunset as we ate dinner. However, we were rudely told that the large section of the restaurant with the only good views of the ocean was closed for dinner on Sat. night because it was reserved for the Sunday brunch. Are you joking??!! That was what we thought a lot of the time, when staff were constantly telling us "no" to normal requests. I was even told that they didn't have bread at the restaurant pool to have with my salad. This hotel is far from anything, so not only are you in a crappy hotel, but you are far from anything decent. If you can help it, do NOT stay at the Maui Prince! I would recommend renting a condo, camping, or sleeping in a cardboard box (just kidding about that part!!) before staying at this hotel.

We stayed our first few nights in Vegas at a different place, and then moved to Motel 6 for the final 2 nights of our visit. I've never had a bad stay at a Motel 6. Not looking for the Taj Mahal, just a quiet clean bed to sleep in. At check-in, we had a hard time speaking to the desk clerk who spoke really heavily accented English and didn't seem to care about anything but getting back to his personal conversation with his co-worker. We were shoved in the very back building where all the big rigs park. The room smelled heavily of smoke, we had to leave the door open. Even my husband who smokes couldn't stand the smell. The carpet was filthy and burned. I went into the restroom and my first step in found a sticky spot of ???? on the floor. GROSS!!!!! The wall where the doorknob touches inside the bathroom was black from people's dirty hands on the doorknob that then touched the wall when the door opened and there was a big black greasy handprint on the shower curtain where someone with greasy hands had pulled the curtain shut. At least they took a shower, I guess. The first morning we were awakend repeatedly between 4 and 6 am by the trucks starting and the dreaded back up beepers. The second night, some security guard with big heavy boots started pounding on the door next to ours. I think I gathered the lady next door might have left a dog in her car? Couldn't quite make out the fuss, with his radio squawking and him loudly talking to her and her talking to him. By the time I got back to sleep, it was time for the trucks to leave again. All in all, the worst stay I've ever had anywhere in my life, but I must say, it made me appreciate going home all that much more.

Needing a last minute place to stay, I tried the Rodeway Inn for $125 (after taxes, fees). Without restating everything everyone else wrote the place is a dump. Also, I have never written a negative review about a hotel prior to this- so it is not as if i have unreasonalby high standards and commonly complain about hotels. As a plus the bathroom was not horrible, it is in the middle of downtown and they did have breakfast (bagels...) in the morning- However, the floor, the bed, the walls... were nasty, no cable, no working elevator... I could not wait to leave in the morning I considered leaving in the middle of night to find anywhere and take a shower.

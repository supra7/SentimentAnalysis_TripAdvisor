First time in Las Vegas. I booked 4 nights with Harrah's because of the price and good reviews. After my $35 cab ride from airport to the hotel, I stood in line for about an half an hour to check-in. The check-in lady was nice and the rooms were nice for the price. Everything went well there until after the 3rd night. When waking in the morning after the 3rd night, I was horrified when I saw that there was what looked like brown dried stuff and blood about the size of a small dinner plate in the middle of my bottom sheet. I established that there is NO way I did that!! I was the only one who slept in the bed. Why didn't I see the mess before? Was the stain there the entre 3 nights I slept there? And why didn't the cleaning lady see it and change the sheets? I called the manager and the housekeeping manager came and looked at it. I told him the story and he said "that's unacceptable, what do you want me to do"? I said you can start by giving me new sheets! That is all that was said. I figured at the least they would send me a apology message or give me a free dinner or something. I went to check out the next day. The check-out lady was so rude to me for no reason and told me there was no shuttle service going to airport (I found out later there was and took it). After that I brought up the incident of my dirty bedding. The manager came over and I explained to him what happened and how disgusting it was. He asked me why I never saw it the 3 days before. I told him that I didn't know why. Nothing else was said and the 2 of them looked at me like I was crazy. I have lived in Asia and have traveled extensively and have never seen this and have never been treated like this by a hotel.

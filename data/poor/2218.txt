First of all it is located on the beach, the pool is very nice and the area is good. However, once you get past the door be prepared for a huge disappointment. The rooms are completely outdated. The bathrooms are depressingly dark. Our first room we found a roach and asked to be moved. Our second room the refrigerator died and there was water all over the floor. The rugs are groady, the furniture saw better days, the air conditioners are so old they run all night - very loudly.....the only nice thing was the partial view of the ocean.

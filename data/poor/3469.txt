The website of this hotel is beautiful. We were exciting about staying there. The location is pretty good and it seemed like our stay would be wonderful. Ummm....no. There are no elevators anywhere. The entrance basically is a three story stairway straight up. The rooms were small and if one person sat at the desk, then the other guest has to sit on the window sill or bed. Now the beds, they are terrible! Scratchy sheets, lumpy/springy beds that if I wasn't concerned about bugs, I would have slept on the floor. It has been 24 hours since I slept in that bed and I am still sore. These comments are only for starters, but definitely reason enough to not ever book there again!!

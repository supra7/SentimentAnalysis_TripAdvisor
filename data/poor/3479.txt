My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel with two friends last weekend. First of all, parking was very far away. The woman behind the desk was so rude I almost decided to leave as soon as we got there. We booked a room with two beds so we could all get ready together but when we got to the hotel they had changed our rooms and given us two. The size of the rooms was laughable. From the doorway, I could touch the other side of the bed. To get into the bathroom, a lot of manuevering had to be done. I could put my foot onto the toilet from the beds end. After our night out in NYC we returned to our hotel to find the stairwell and lobby so packed with people that we could not move. The people theat were in the stairwell and lobby were scary off the street kind of people. THUGS! I was scared to sleep that night.

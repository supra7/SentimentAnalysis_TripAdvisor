My husband and I travelled with our two children (2&8) and my mother. We arrived on Nov11 and Departed on the the 14-long weekend stay. This is our 7th time to Mexico and have travelled to Costa Rica, Dominican, Chile, Europe etc...... In all our travels, not once have we ever been worried about giving our credit card to the front reception to pay for our stay at a five star resort. What I have to say, out weighs any good experience we had for the long weekend. My husband's credit card number was taken and several purchases were made long after we arrived back home and until the month of December. Beware with the front desk and how they handle your credit card. I do not enjoy writing this post but I feel obligated to warn fellow travellers. Hopefully the owner of Karisma will see to it that their employees at the front desk are checked on and the bad ones are removed. It is pretty sad that in today's time when jobs are difficult to come by, that one would jeopardize this opportunity to be employed. When I called the hotel to inform them about the incident, I was told, " that can't be possible". This is not an appropriate way to handle a customer's concern. I for one will never return to Azul fives and nor will I recommend this hotel. I will say this for the remainder of the employees, the staff in the restaurant, pool area etc.. were very helpful and nice.

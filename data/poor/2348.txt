Our stay at the Grand Wailea was awful for many of the reasons that others have already posted. Our room smelled foul; the rank odor would not dissipate even when we put the central and ceiling fans on their highest levels. The pools are poorly maintained and dirty. They are infested with teens and teeny boppers and perhaps rightly so because the many slides, water elevator etc seem designed precisely for them. The poolside experience is tolerable if you want a deep tan or sunburn -- you won't get shade for less than $ 55.00 and a cabana is in the $ 200.00 range. The poolside chairs are jammed together like seats at a theater. The hotel's service leaves much to be desired. On four separate occasions I tried to call the front desk no one picked up even after several minutes. The concierge seemed flustered when I asked her to recommend a restaurant that didn't have seafood as its main attraction -- she said that she never ventured out of Keihe. That's an unacceptable answer. The spa was great. I got the best massage of my life there -- ask for Miriam. The hydrotherapy pools are relaxing, but I don't know how hygienic they are. You get a free hour in the pools when you pay for a massage. Before my appointment they had me sit on a terrace with a spectacular view of the ocean and the pools (the pools look much better from a distance) -- very nice. But, all this being said, the spa needs to be rennovated. It's fifteen years old and the wear shows. If you can, stay at the Four Seasons and use the spa at the Grand Wailea. The Four Seasons' service, ambience and poolside set up is far superior to the Grand Wailea's. Their grounds and rooms are also much better and more modern. The Grand Wailea, as its name might suggest, tries to be a spectacle. But it is just oversized, overstated and overrated. This is a hotel on the decline -- a themepark at best. Save your money for a better place.

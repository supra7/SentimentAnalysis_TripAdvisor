Being an SPG Gold member, I have stayed at Westins in 8 different countries. We decided on impulse to go to Montreal for the weekend. The hotel is impressive when you pull in. I went to the SPG Gold and Platinum counter, and had to wait 20 minutes before being served. It was 2:00 PM, and we were told that our rooms weren't ready. I asked for a specific time when the rooms would be ready, only to be told to check back every hour or so, Wow - talsk about obnoxious Montreal service. We finally got one room at 3:45, and were told that the second room would be ready in "a few minutes". I don't know what their definition of "a few minutes" is, but the second room took another hour to be ready. Undoubtedly, the rooms were spectacular. Huge for an urban centre, nicely appointed. Try asking for some extra coffee packets !!!! Had to call 3 times, and it took them 50 minutes to bring 2 coffee packets to the room. In all other Westins around the world, any staff that you encounter while in the hotel politely greet you. Not so at this hotel. They go the extra mile to avoid eye contact. Overall, a gorgeous hotel, as long as you don't have to talk to any staff member. What amazes me is the difference in service levels between this Westin, and say the ones in Vegas, Orlando, Miami, Paris, Rome, and New York. Everywhere else, the staff are friendly. Avoid this hotel if you can. There is a W just round the corner (if you insist on Starwood), or else an Inter-Continental right next door. Or better yet, the Hotel Le St. James a block away (if you want ultimate luxury and beautiful FRETTE linen).

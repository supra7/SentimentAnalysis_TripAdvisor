This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I am a very well traveled individual and I have to say the staff were non-compliant, un-helpful and just plain rude. The elevators did not work the entire time we were there...our room was on the 9th floor. There was nobody to help us at anytime. The housekeepers were yelling every morning waking us up. The general manager was very rude and did not care to help us in any way. They overcharged me and would not reimburse me for any of it. I went through corporate and they did not do anything about it! Do not stay there...the worst and most unprofessional experience I have ever had with a hotel. Trust me on this!!

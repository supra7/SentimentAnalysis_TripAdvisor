The second we walked into the lobby I knew it was a mistake!!!!! THE SMELL OF MILDEW was overpowering,,,,, we got to our room old very dated smelly...... The veiw was ok but the noise was annoying ,ppl lettin their kids scream off the balcony just not what I was looking for. I thought we could listen to the ocean noises not ppl yelling and kids screaming....we had to close our door to block out the noise...The kitchen not enough stuff to cook with no silverware drawer it was in the cabinet.. When WE GOT HOME WE HAD TO WASH EVERYTHING IT SMELLED!!!!! We called for towels and have our trash picked up so we could leave it took them an hour to come up...They said I will send them up right away NOT TRUE I worked in hotels all my life and this was quite an experience....So you read this and see if you want to stay.....

Having spent many nights in low-end hotels during business trips to remote locations, I am used to spartan accomodations. However, this place was a dump. Truthfully, the rooms are no where near the quality of even a Best Western or Red Roof Inn -- let alone a Holiday Inn. Yes, the lobby is fancy. Don't let this deceive you. The mattress in my room felt like it had been picked from the garbage. The other furniture was in awful shape as well -- similar to what you would find in a thrift store. The showers were too small for an adult. I am a little surprise that the major travel sites haven't stopped selling rooms for this hotel. Don't get ripped off. If you wind up unwittingly staying here, complain to management, the authorities, and the BBB. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

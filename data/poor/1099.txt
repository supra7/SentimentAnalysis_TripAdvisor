Horrible place to stay and should be given a quality rating of a half star. First, customer service at the front desk was poor quality the front desk and manager did not seem to be very helpful for early arrivals and were not very knowledgible regarding on line booking entities and procedures. I had to wait 20 minutes to speak with a manager to be checked in as an early arrival and hotel staff refused to hold bags behind the front desk. Cleaniness of the room after fighting to get into my room with a manual door key from the 1970's, appeared to have some debris on the floor and the room setup appeared to be dingy and cheesey. Upon returning from an event 2 AM in the morning. The front desk attendant was no where to be found because it closes after 11 PM. Unfortunately, I forgot my room number and attempted to use the emergency phone line to speak to available staff member who never pick up the phone. It took an additional 20 minutes to locate an on site security guard to locate a staff member who then told me that my reservation was canceled. The following day was check out and the hotel attempted to charge me additional fees that were not negotiated when I booked on line through a travel site. I would not Extend My Stay for another second and I would not have my worst enemy or ex-girlfriend stay there!

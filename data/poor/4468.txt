After our car broke down, we decided to stay at this Motel 6. We had a remodeled room and it was nice. A nice flat screen TV and hard wood floors. The bed was so-so, the shower was super small, and there were crickets in the room. I had also noticed a couple of roaches as well. Anyway, after staying at this motel for 2 weeks, I was a little late paying for 1 more night and they kicked us out! I had not had any problems before. MANAGEMENT WAS RUDE AND HUNG UP THE PHONE ON US WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO TALK TO THEM!!!! The housekeepers speak very weak English, which can be a problem. Maintenance was rude as well! Do yourself a favor! Stay somewhere else. The 2.99/day internet is a joke. It hardly ever worked. My hotspot on my droid was 10 times better than their wi-fi! STAY AWAY!! STAY AWAY!!

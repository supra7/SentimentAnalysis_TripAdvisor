We booked this hotel for one weekend in Philadelphia, with specific requirements of twin beds. They confirm us saying that they didnt have twin beds so we will have a queen size bed. Two days before our trip, they contact us saying that it was overbooked and they reallocated us in other hotel, more expensive. They suppose to pay the difference but we are still waiting for our $50. Moreover, we are the ones that have to deal with all that, complainning to one hotel and the other. The worst management ever.

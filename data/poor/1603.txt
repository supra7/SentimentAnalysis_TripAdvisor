I used Priceline and got a pretty good rate for 3 nights. We had 3 adults and one teenager. The room was nice, but very small. The beds were the major problem. They were hard and tiny. Motel 6 has better quality beds! After the second night of next to no sleep, we checked out. My 16 year old daughter who is in great shape began walking like a 90 year old woman, complaining that her back and hips were killing her. I thought it was just us adults in pain, after I saw her walking like that we ate our 3rd and final night. We did not care that we wasted more than $100 on that last night, we just needed a soft place to sleep!!!! We opted for Radisson in Ft. Worth for our last night there.

I stay in many hotels. Most of time Motel 6. I had asked for a quiet room. I disliked my room as soon as I checked in. It stunk, was old looking & I knew it was not going to be quiet. I had drove all day from Reno to Vegas. Had a bad headache, stomachache & extremely tired. I used the bathroom & then called front desk to see if I could switch to another room. I had not brought any of my luggage in & the room was still clean. Front desk said no I could not switch because I had used the bathroom. They could easily have looked @ room to see that it was still clean. All night long, my upstairs neighbour walked across the floor. Very noisy. I complained to front desk but they Hung up phone on me & did nothing. I do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.

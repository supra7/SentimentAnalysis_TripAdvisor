I booked this hotel because the location was going to be very convenient to the event I was attending. I really should have checked Trip Advisor first. This place is bad. Stay away! I am normally a pretty easy-going traveler. Read my other reviews. However, this hotel disappointed in almost every way. The front desk staff was rude and unhelpful. The room was in very poor condition. The door lock looked like a last minute improvisation. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable that I have ever experienced. The grounds of the hotel were in disrepair. The highlights of my stay were that I was only there for one night, and my car was still in the parking lot in the morning.

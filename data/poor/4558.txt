I booked through priceline and according to the reviews I found here, I was to contact the hotel to book a room with 2 beds as priceline only will reserve a queen bed. I contacted Kathy at Hotel Felix and requested two double beds as there will be four of us, she didn't even check to see if available for this Thursday, instead she said since you booked with priceline you will only have a queen I can put a request in for 2 doubles but you won't know until you get here. Please tell me why can't she reserve it for us if she sees it is available, instead we have to drive to Chicago and walk in with our two children to find out if we can stay. If you face this same issue, don't bother calling Priceline as they will not be of any help, nor will they change your reservation for another hotel. I will never book with Priceline again, maybe I will have better luck with Hotwire. Why would Priceline give the option of a hotel with very few double bed rooms?

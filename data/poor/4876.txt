Service: staff seem unprofessional!! Little things that make a difference were missing. Eg: ask them to get u a taxi for the airport, they'll charge u 75lira! Do it urself, it costs u 30lira! Breakfast: terrible, terrible, terrible!! It's a joke! No fruit, bad yogurt, not even omellete!! Bread is old!! I was shocked!! For any1 considering this!! Pls Dnt!! U'll waste money for bad service and only eaT olives for breakfast!!!

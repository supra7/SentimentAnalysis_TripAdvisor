The facilities are very not nice but that's all with this resort. Also, if you're not a member of the resort (time share), you're treated like a 2nd class citizen. FOOD - 1 Star One word HORRIBLE. It would have been better had I brought some canned food on the trip, seriously. There wasn't one meal that tasted really good. The chef needs to be fired or revamp the entire menu. My wife and I stayed at Secrets Capri last year and the food was so much better. One Tip: specialize on one type of cuisine (like mexican) rather than doing a poor job with Italian and Asian dishes. FACILITIES - 4 Stars The resort is well maintained and looks very beautiful. The suites are large and very clean. BEACH - 1 Star Because of the mangroves, the beach is black and smells like rotten eggs. SERVICE - 1 Star None of the waiters know how to take orders and some are RUDE, especially at the Hacienda Grill. Almost every order came back wrong and the service is extremely SLOOOW.

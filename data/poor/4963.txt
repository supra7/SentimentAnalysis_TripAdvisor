Our trip started out on the wrong foot from the start because our flight was late in arriving, so we were all extremely tired while squinting in the dark to find the address from the road-which we had troubles with and ended up passing it a few times. Once we found it, getting our car into the very tight parking area was a serious challenge. We were given very handy directions well in advance, but the access code was wrong. After getting the correct access code we entered a fairly 'tired' duplex with sticky counter tops, thick dust on the ceiling fan, no linen for the sofa beds, an old blood stain on one of the sofa bed's mattress (which was NOT comfortable at all), and missing mirrors on the bathroom cabinet. The hot tub that was right outside our suite was out of order, it was not a very new sign indicating that, and we saw no service person come to do anything with it at all. The caretaker suggested we use another hot tub two duplexes down, which we did but felt like we were intruding on other people's space. I sent an email to the owner 2 weeks after the trip and I received no reply at all. The fact that this place was right on the water was absolutely spectacular. The rest was downright skid row. The caretaker said we got that place for much less than what it normally goes for...I find it shocking that people will pay that kind of money for such lack of quality. Not us, ever again.

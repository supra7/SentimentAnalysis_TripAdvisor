A huge disappointment. Upon check-in, it's obvious the hotel is nothing but smoke and mirrors--it's glitzy, glamerous, fashionable but that's where the compliments end. And, I was actually stupid enough to fall for the phone message that said if my stay wasn't what I was expecting, to call the manager at ext 66. "The manager is not available, but will call you back as soon he returns." I'm still waiting for the phone call. . . . . Had numerous problems w/our room: it was not what was requested, had to call (after 5:00 p.m.) twice to have the room cleaned, the robe was taken, I was erroneously charged for the munchie bar, the heating/ac was not working properly--it was just a disaster. Have stayed at other W Hotels and have never had problem. The manager probably should be practicing the phrase, "would you like fries with that order?" He's clearly out of his element. PS: And, not only will I not recommend this hotel to a friend, I am recommending this hotel be removed from our corporate list.

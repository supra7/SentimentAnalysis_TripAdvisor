I made reservations 5 months in advance for a week-long business trip, had to be within walking distance of the Dallas Convention Center. The Magnolia sounded great from the reviews posted here. Three days before my arrival, the Magnolia emailed me to say that they could not accommodate me for the first 3 nights, and had placed me in an alternate hotel 15 miles away in Duncanville. Yes, 15 miles!! I responded to their email saying that was too far away, and wanted them to find something much closer. I called the hotel manager and left voicemail -- no response. I contacted the sales manager, who said she would forward the issue to management. The next day I received another email from Magnolia in which they cancelled my entire stay!! Note that I had never requested cancellation, they apparently decided this was the best way to deal with the issue. I've NEVER been treated this way by any hotel in the US. If you overbook, you find your customers equal or better accommodations nearby, not 15 miles away. I called other hotels within a few blocks and confirmed that they had rooms available, but at a higher price, so the Magnolia management obviously made a choice here. My advice: make your reservations elsewhere, or you will be scrambling at the last minute.

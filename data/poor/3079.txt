After reading all the great reviews, I was really excited about staying her. Until I arrived. The staff was not helpful and pleasant the whole time I was there. In fact they seemed bored, yet acted put out if you asked them a question. The rooms were very DARK and dated. - valet service is pitiful, extremely slow - front desk attitude is unapproachable - couldn' t use the laundry facility because from 11pm - 4 am the one of the staff members tied up all of the washer and dryers doing his family's laundry. I made the wrong assumption that the paying guests should come before an employee doing his family's laundry. - the fitness room is in the creepy underground parking garage which the homeless seem to visit often and scared me to death - security is non existant here. Any one off the street can walk up to your room. The door keys are turned off. - I felt so very unsafe for the first time at a hotel - breakfast was such low quality and felt like a cafeteria. I would never stay here again!

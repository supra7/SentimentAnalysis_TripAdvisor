Rudest Service Ever All I can say is we've never been treated so rudely. If you have no problems, I'm sure they'd be great. But if you do, watch out. We had made reservations via Expedia a week before our arrival date requesting a non-smoking room for 3 people. When we arrived they acknowledged we requested a non-smoking room but only had smoking rooms available or non-smoking one bed rooms. All they could offer us was a rollaway bed for the non-smoking room. They rudely told us to speak to the manager the next morning. The next morning they told us to come back, that there was nothing they could do until they spoke to the only manager that evening. Eventually they did give us another 2 bed, non-smoking room with a huge discount of $20.00 for the inconvenience. We were never able to speak to a manager because he was only in from 11pm-before 9am. The only manager we could speak to was the accounting manager who was again the rudest person ever. And I even had my calm husband take care of this because I knew he wouldn't speak to them rudely and we were still treated horribly. The rooms were nice and the restaurant was great, but if you want service, go somewhere else.

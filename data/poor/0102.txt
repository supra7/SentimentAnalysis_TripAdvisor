We chose the Crowne Plaza because of its history and location. Check in listed at 4pm...room was not ready until 5pm. Room advertised as a suite with a pullout sofa bed, free bottled water. No sofa bed and no bottled water. Many other negative details concerning our stay...however there are many choices for overnight accommodations in downtown Seattle...the Crowne Plaza should not be high on your list.

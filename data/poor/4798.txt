Let me start off with the good point: Location. It's a minutes walk away from the ocean, restaurants and nightlife. Now to the bad: The water faucet had a really hard to operate, stuck lever. The sheets were dirty, and it was disgusting to sleep in them. It's near all the bars, so don't expect a very quiet night in your room with cars driving by and people yelling around from time to time. I didn't mind too much though. They advertise free wireless internet for their guests. The connection in my room was extremely weak, so I wasn't able to work on my time-sensitive projects. I complained, and they gave me a key to another room where it should be a lot better. So I packed and lugged all my luggage over, trusting them they knew what they were saying was right. There the wireless turned out to be even worse. When I got home the next day and I walked into the room in the afternoon, I was greeted with water splashing out of a completely soaked carpet with every step. Ok, admittedly there was a strong downpour which did cause a lot of flooding around the area, but apparently that happens yearly. Besides making sure that those rooms don't end up being flooded every year, they should have had their room service check the flooded rooms to make sure that no guests left sensitive items on the floor  e.g. clothing, documents, laptops, ... They also should have offered a new room immediately, without me actually having to ask for one. I ended up getting so fed up that I checked out of the hotel at 11PM at night, lugging my luggage over to the (now relocated) Bed & Bay Residence Inn nearby which turned out to be an excellent choice  even closer to the beach, nicer, cheaper & friendlier. I've never had to experience anything as bad as this yet  this was really a first for me.

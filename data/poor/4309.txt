1.Never replaced shampoo or Lotion 2.Never refilled mini bar(I called 3 times) 3.Coffee shop food and service terrible 4.At their new property,Caesars staff was incompetant and rude. I believe they are unable to handle the new larger Harrahs and are forgetting how they got so many loyal customers.I have e-mailed and faxed in much greater detail the problems I encountered.They have yet to respond.They spend an awful lot of money in mailings to get and keep a customer,when sometimes just a quick phone call will do. Maybe they read this?

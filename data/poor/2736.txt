This hotel is exactly what it is billed to be - a two star hotel. I don't stay in two star hotels, but the great reviews here led me to try it, plus the close proximity to Columbia. Not quite sure why there are all these great reviews. For a little more $$, one can stay in a much nicer hotel in a safer area. I stayed for one night for a quick visit to Columbia with my teenage sons and would not return. We had two rooms, one was billed as a suite. Really tiny. The hotel is very old, the decor is really old, the rooms are small and dark. The air conditioner (which is attached to the window and old) made so much noise it was difficult to sleep. The view out of the windows is into a dark alley and an ugly buidling next door. I will say that the rooms are clean and the staff was nice. The bathrooms have been updated. However, I felt uncomfortable and unsafe during my stay. It has a very "seedy" feel to it. I saw one of the staff very thoroughly check out my as yet undeveloped 13 year old daughter. If you have young girls in your party beware, Yuk.

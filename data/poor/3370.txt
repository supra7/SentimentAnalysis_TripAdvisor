We booked the direct oceanfront room for one night as our last night in Maryland. Check in was smooth and people were friendly. That is about the only positive comments I have about this hotel. The hotel is in poor shape. It is dirty and outdated. The carpets in the rooms and hallway smell and are dirty. The room had old appliances and furniture. The moldy smell bothered my whole family. The bathroom was small and in run-down condition. The elevators are old and a little scary! The whole place just made you feel unclean. I am not a picky person at all. This hotel is just horrible. We will never stay here again!

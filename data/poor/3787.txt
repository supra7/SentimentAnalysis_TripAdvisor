Which is worse? The Hotel or the City? On a return trip from Bangkok, made mistake of stopping over in Honolulu to take a break from travel. What a huge let down. My disclaimer - I've never particularly longed to visit Hawaii - so many beaches, so little time - but my brother went this year and loved it. So, as I was passing by, as it were, thought I'd give it a try. Ugh. I'm sure there are parts of Hawaii that are gorgeous, magical, paradisical because too many people wax eloquent about them. But they're not in Honolulu. This is the Las Vegas/ Coney Island of the Polynesian world. Hotel is shabby, featureless, and smells stale. (Having to pay for an a.m. cup of coffee in the room only added insult to injury.) View fabulous - if you fancy the tops of other buildings. Beaches grand - if you like them overcrowded. Shopping terrific - particularly if your tastes run to 24/7 opportunities to buy overpriced junk. The Don Ho show personified my 3 days there: I left after 30 minutes, despite waiting in line for more than an hour, because I couldn't stand listening to an addled drunk who could neither remember lyrics nor why he was up on stage. Everything is hype, hustle, and awful. Do yourself a favor - don't stay in this shabby, smoky, smelly hotel and don't leave the Honolulu airport - stay put and either hop on a plane to another island or head on to the mainland and start planning a vacation on the shores of Africa, or the Caribbean, or Europe.

This hotel badly needs to be gutted and brought from the dark ages to modernity. The only redeeming feature is the fact that it is quite convenient for the Hospital at the University of Pennsslvania which is accessed by a walkway. Al the porter is the other redeeming feature. Advice: Use only if you need access to the hospital, and make the stay as short as possible!

After a long and hard research process, I thought that this hotel was going to be a true 4 star...boy was I wrong. Way tooooo over priced....Front desk service sucks.... We were on our honeymoon and they gave us a "special terrace" view. Well, that just means a parking lot view. We asked to be upgraded since it was our honeymoon and they just gave us an attitude like we had done something wrong. For $200 a night we would expect a little more. The pool is nice but you pay a nice $25 resort fee per day. Much better choices out there. Keep looking

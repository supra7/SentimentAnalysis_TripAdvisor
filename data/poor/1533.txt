Stayed at hotel while my grandfather was in the hospital and later died. The manager BRYAN didn't respond to calls to the ofc. reguarding ants in our room and getting the room cleaned. It was a hard enough week for us dealing with the loss of my Grandpa, I shouldnt have to deal with a manager who ignores our calls, puts us in a dirty room and hangs up on us during a phone conversation. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere that the management cares about their customers. Very rude and will never stay there again!!!

I reserved the room through Apple Core Hotels. While the location is good for theater events and the rooms are decent, customer service is terrible. My room was reserved in my name with my credit card - in my maiden name. My husband was able to check in, no questions asked. When I attempted to check in they refused to give me a key until his return, changed the rate, and proceeded to quote corporate policy - all for a $15 dollar increase. I walked out to wait for my husband and when we both re-entered a woman was talking to the employee. All she was interested in was getting us to initial the $15 increase. I sent an online complaint to their corporate site and the the GM answered my complaint in a manner that indicated where the employee gets his arrogance and ignorance. Guess what...it was the woman. This GM did not bother to introduce herself or ask us any questions that night. All she wanted just our initials. In addition, my husband asked this same employee for directions to the theater. An 'I don't know' would have sufficed. He sent us two avenues and four blocks out of our way. The theater was literally around the corner from the hotel. We lost 20 minutes and had to rush back to make it before the 8:00 PM start. Don't bother! There are plenty of great hotels at a low price in the area.

That's right, hourly rates. Prostitutes going in and out of hotel all day and night. Shady men. AC broke and started shooting water. Didn't matter, because we weren't sleeping from the sound of the club next door. One of the worst hotels I've ever been to. I love the neighborhood (oh that food!), but stay someplace else--really, for $5 more you can stay someplace quite elegant.

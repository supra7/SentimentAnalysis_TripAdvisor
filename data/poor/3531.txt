This is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in! We arrived in mid-December & were put in an unheated room. When we complained, the front desk kept insisting that the heat was on. Finally, we were told nothing could be done because it was out of hours. We were given a couple of blankets. The following morning other people on our corridor said they had also had no heat. 2 days later we were transferred to a smaller, more basic room on the pretext that the corridor was going to be painted. We spent the next 7 nights in a tiny room with no closet, no hanging space, no drawers, no hairdryer & no phone. We had to live out of our suitcases. We were directly under a heating or ventilation duct which made a loud noise & kept us awake all night. The water was often lukewarm, but on the day before Christmas it was ice cold. When we complained, we were told that there were boiler problems & that we were "about the fourth people" to complain. In the meantime another person was complaining that his room had no heat! All our complaints were met with rude indifference by the front desk staff. The bar was supposed to close at half past midnight but when we tried to order drinks at midnight one night, we were told disapprovingly that the bar was closed & that it was "very late". When we pointed out that closing time was half past midnight, we were informed that this depended on how many customers there were. When we checked out we requested a partial refund for the lack of heating & hot water. We were simply blanked out & told that no refund had been authorised. In summary, stay at this dump at your peril!

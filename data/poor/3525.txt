I was confused by the mixed reviews of this hotel. But after having stayed there I actually understand why. Half of the hotel is habitable the other half is dire. I know this because on arrival I was put in a double room which was awful and then later was given a deluxe twin double room which was bearable. On arrival I was told that the room I actually booked had been given to another guest due to internet overbooking! So on the 1st night I was given a campbed to sleep on. The staff retorted there was nothing I could do as I'd already paid for the room. It also has very narrow staircases and a plywood feel to it. They cannot use vacuum cleaners due to the thin walls so it feels dirty and the carpets on the stairs are taped down. The bar was closed the last 2 days of my stay and no reason was given. Various heated conversations were overheard whilst at the reception desk, so I wasn't the only dissatified customer. My advice stay away. Go elsewhere!

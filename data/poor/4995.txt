We booked the hotel knowing it was budget but didn't quite realise how budget. The room consists of a built in bed base with a matteress on, TV on the wall and 2 hanging hooks. The bathroom didn't even have a shelf so that you could unpack your toiletries. We paid the extra 5 for 24hrs of TV in order to get the news and sports update during our stay We arrived at 2pm and after booking in had to leave straight away for an appointment and did not return until 1130pm. Having climbed the strairs, 3 floors up, we got in the room and started to get ready for bed. At this point we found that most of the advertised TV channels were not available, only channels 1-5. The next morning we woke, showered and went to book out. I explained to the reception that i was not happy that having paid the money we could not access all the TV channels, all he could say was that we should have reported it at 11.30 at night, even explaining that we were in our night clothes and there was no phone in the room to call reception and i was not prepared to either get dressed again or walk through a hotel in my night wear didn't work. He still insisted i should have told them at 11.30pm. i asked for a refund and still he said the same and so i then left without a refund very infuriated. I certainly will not be staying at one of these hotels again.

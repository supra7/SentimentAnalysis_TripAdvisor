Where of WHERE do I start? Oh, let's start with the filthy carpet and the fact that they don't have refrigerators or microwaves. Oh and the small, crampy room with marble bathroom floors that you can break your neck on if you happen to fall in the bathroom.They indicate that you can request a refrigerator, but what they FAIL to tell you is that they will charge you $15 per day. Went to the buffet on Christmas, stood in a long line, paid $54 for what was INDEED the WORST meal I have ever eaten. No steak, just rare prime rib, and I had to request that my almost RAW prime rib be thrown on the grill because I despise anything that isn't cooked well. One guy refused to put the prime rib on the grill but thanks to Teodoro, I was at least able to consume something worth the half hour wait Salvatore, you can go kick rocks, your attitude was HORRID! Most of the wait staff were friendly, but serving school cafeteria spaghetti at a buffet that costs $24.99 per person plus tax is a DEALBREAKER. Oh, and you guessed it, I couldn't use the crappy coupon that they gave me. I'd say to anyone planning a trip, do your research, a lot of the low budget hotels have better amenities than the hotels on the strip, and of course they're (strip hotels) collecting so much money that they could care less, but guess what, little things count when it comes to service, and charging people for refrigerators when the other hotels offer them for free is just bad business. Businesses aren't going out of business because of the recession, they're going out of business because most human beings are tired of paying money and being treated like garbage. Did I forget to mention the ancient televisions. I had to go to the sports bar down the street to watch the game because the tv is terrible. Oh, and HARRAH's if you don't remember anything else, remember this, customers only need one casino channel, not 3. Harrah's tv is not what I want to see when I turn on the television, get some real channels.

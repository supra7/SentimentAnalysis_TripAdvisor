My wife booked this trip and hotel for my 40th birthday. Upon returning from our first 'day' out on The Strip we found the dirty glasses from the night before still on the bar, no fresh glasses provided, no bottle opener for wine and BLOOD on one of our pillows!! After having to complete security forms and speak to the Assistant Manager of the hotel, we were passed off to 'Guest Claims'. We weren't claiming anything rather simply looking for an explanation and for the hotel to make things right. We received a phone call tonight after returning home from the trip. Barbara Turner from 'Guest Claims' informed us that after their 'investigation' our claim was denied. She stated that the hotel does checks and re-checks of rooms once housekeeping completes the servicing of the room to ensure quality, so the BLOOD on the pillow must of come from us....... Really? Is that how The Encore treats its patrons? Neither my wife nor I had any scratch or lesion anywhere on our bodies to transfer blood on the bedding, let alone on the end of the actual pillow (not the pillow case). If the hotel's QC is so stringent post room servicing, why were the dirty glasses still in the room; why were no clean glasses provided; why was there no corkscrew; and how did they miss the BLOOD on the pillow if the room is checked an re-checked post cleaning??? Needless to say we are pursuing legal action. Not because we want anything, simply because of how this entire ordeal was handled. In two words: Very Poorly!

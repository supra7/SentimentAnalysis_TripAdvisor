Uninvited ants in the kitchen everyday, bathroom very unsanitary,rugs dirty and bad odor. The odor was comming from the rugs. I will never stay at this resort again. My wife got an asthma attack because of the heavy odor. The quality of this resort is equal to a truck driver quick stop motel not for family with small childrens. The staff at the front desk were excellent (*****).

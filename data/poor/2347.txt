I cant believe I paid $700.00 per night for a deluxe ocean view room and was given rooms twice with nothing but palm trees. They refused to give us a room anywhere above the 6th floor for a better view of the ocean (which we had paid for) and said if we wanted to be above that floor, we would have to PAY MORE! The hotel is completely run down and needs an overhaul. No ambiance whatsoever. Pool area is DISCUSTING! Poor upkeep and if you don't reserve chairs for yourself by 7 a.m. you won't have a seat anywhere all day. Absolutely ridiculous not to be able to get a chair when you are paying that kind of money @ a hotel. Food and service is grotesque at best. People @ the front desk paid much more attention and hovered around a woman next to me who was carrying a Black Centurion Amex card, while they made me wait next to her for over an hour just to change my room to another "palm tree view" room (but then again I'm only a Platinum Amex card member, what would they care!) Spa needs a redo. The place smells of mold, and there are WAY too many obnoxious teenagers running around, smoking in the elevators, yelling and screaming. It was not romantic and had no ambiance whatsoever! What I will tell you is for you to take your hard earned money, drive 2 mins past the Grand Wailea and go stay @ The Four Seasons. I stayed there last time and it was a dream come true. They will treat you the was you should be treated when you spend money like that and it is just more quaint, beautiful and everyone is pleasant and remembers your name. Dont give this place your money and certainly don't join the stupid club they try to get you to join (what a farce).

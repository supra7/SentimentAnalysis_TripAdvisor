I'm at this hotel right now as I write this review on my iPad. Mind you, I'm using my 3G connection because they charge up to $4.95 per hour for Wifi. Ridiculous. If you want their "environmentally" shampoo in the room, you pay an extra 25 bucks. Ridiculous. The entry way was not welcoming. The architect was either incredibly inexperienced, had no budget, or the land must be mysteriously misshapen or something, because this place is laid out terribly. The hallways are LONG and dank. A friend made the comment as we walked the long corridor that it reminded her of the "Shining". Creepy. This place is overpriced. Perhaps my expectations are too high. If I pay a fair few bucks for a room, I expect a welcoming, comfortable room and layout. I think they went for a log cabin/western theme, but it feels old and stale. On top of all this, they still want to nickel-dime you with this other nonsense. We won't be returning.

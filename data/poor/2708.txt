Due to a family situation I had to cancel my reservation. The manager, Rajni Rikh, refused to give me a cancellation number. Even after I expressed concerns about having proof of cancellation, she became very irritated. I called the main Comfort Inn number and they too refused to provide a cancellation number. If you have to cancel at this hotel monitor your credit card carefully since you won't have proof you cancelled.

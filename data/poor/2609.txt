We arrived at the hotel and handed our luggage to the bellman. He apparently left it unattended long enough for a bag to be stolen. Then, when we reported the lost bag, the management intially insinuated that this was some sort of plot to bilk money out of the hotel. They asked for a list of the contents and then mockingly questioned the values assigned. They did capture the theft on security video. The New Orleans police were much more tactful than the young hotel staff. Hotel management has an attitude problem and could not have handled this any worse than they did. When I tried to register a complaint online at their website, they limit the comment to 500 characters, so it did not post. This situation would have been bad enough, but hotel management made it much worse. If this is allegedly a 4 star hotel, it apparently hasn't been evaluated recently. The room was actually nice, but the food was horrible and the wait staff was surly. All in all, this was a horrible experience.

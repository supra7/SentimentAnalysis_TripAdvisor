This hotel is a safety risk and is seedy. After checking in, I noticed the hotel door locks were broken, screws were stripped. Needless to say, we did not feel safe -- we did not stay the night. Unless you feel like sitting by the door all night waiting for intruders, do not stay here. Mascara and strange-looking hairs covered the bed. The management did not offer us a refund, instead literally blaming us for not contacting the hotel engineer at 9pm to fix whatever issues there were. How it is our fault that the hotel was not safe is beyond me. We stayed elsewhere, and had to eat the cost of booking at the Beekman. I am an easy-to-please traveler, and this is the first time that I have even written a review, because I think that other travelers should absolutely find somewhere else to stay in NYC when visiting. You may get lucky and have an enjoyable stay, but you may also have a stay like ours, with safety issues and unhelpful management.

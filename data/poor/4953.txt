DON'T STAY HERE! If you want a resort go somewhere else. This place is worst than the reviews. We spent one week April 28-May 5 in a two bedroom "renovated" rooms. It was horrible. The place looks like government housing projects. the place is surrounded by boarded up, broken glass buildings. We had one small pool that wasn't even heated. Our refrigerator leaked, my son fixed the broken microwave, only one bathtub for a two bedroom. It had mold, drained slow, and someone else's hair stuck in the drain. It was horrible. It had cheap 70's furniture. A very small kitchen. This place is not safe. We had to park in the alley next to a dumpster, or in the street surrounded by the boarded up buildings. We were the first one to report a burglary in the laundry room. We were promised one of the rooms that had a whirlpool bathtub. We got ourselves packed, went to the front desk immediately and was told that the room with the whirlpool bathtub was taken. I spoke to the Manager as well as the Maintenance man. They have two rooms in the whole resort that have the whirlpool bathtub, and they don't work. Apparently, they don't know whether to fix the tubs or tear down the buildings. The tubs are located in the "Villas". Don't let the name fool you. The place is a dump like the rest of the resort. The "Villas" have a bedroom view of people coming up and down from the monorail, and an alley. Bottom Line, don't stay here.

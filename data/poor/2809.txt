Dirty. Tiny. Worn. Just some of the kinder things I have to say about The Time. I was not able to check in until almost 4:00 pm (3:00 pm check in). The suite I had reserved made me jealous for the spaciousness of my college dorm room from years ago. Of course, my college dorm room had fewer cigarette burns, and also smelled better. For the price, there are so many better options in Manhattan than The Time.

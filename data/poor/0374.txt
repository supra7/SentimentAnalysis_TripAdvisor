We stayed at the Westin Hotel Seattle for one night on Saturday 19th March 2005.We had a room on the 40th floor (nice view)BUT during the night a storm blew up and the room swayed and creaked in the wind.At 4am there was a young woman screaming and crying down her mobile phone outside our door then at 6am there was someone knocking on the door trying to wake up friend who was in the next room.Thank goodness it was only for one night.

This is really not a five star hotel. After my arrival I had to carry all my luggage to front desk, the porters were just looking at me and nobody helped. The level of english is poor, they can speak only at front desk. For example, I ordered a room service, grilled meat platter with ketchup and they brought me after one hour of waiting only ketchup. They knock at the door even if the light no disturbing is on. Room was really small, not enough space for the things. Housekeeping on a low level, they allways left the dirty dishes without changing, if you did not put them on a visible place and sometimes I had to wait up to three hours until somebody came. Bathroom is really small as well and also my door from the shower was broken so after showering I had small swimming pool on a floor. After departure and payment of all bills they charged me more, without explanation. Internet is really slow in the rooms, but for free.I would never recommend this hotel to anybody.

I may be exaggerating on the title because I haven't stayed at EVERY hotel on Maui, but as a frequent visitor this has been the worst of over a dozen. Certainly, this is the worst hotel in Kihei. The staff refused to give me a military rate despite being on active duty orders to attend a conference -- how patriotic. There are NO amenities here (despite the $10/day charge) and the continental breakfast requires a presentation on local businesses (like a time-share presentation payed for by the businesses I'm sure). The room was filthy (not just dirty). I would avoid this hotel like the plague (which you might catch if you stay there).

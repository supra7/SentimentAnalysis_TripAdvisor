If you like trouble.. The room was quite expensive, the bed was rotten (didn't sleep a wink), the water in the tub didn't go away, the ac didn't work and the tv was snowy. Also the elevator didn't work properly. When I checked out (thank God!) I informed the receptionist and all I got was a: Oh....Don't go to this hotel unless you like to complaint all the time...

It was over priced I could have stayed in a hotel at the center. It was by a highway! Middle of nowhere needed a taxi to get there. or walk 15 minutes to public transport. The building was falling apart. The reception Staff was eating Curry on all the documents and it stunk horribly. The room ceiling was peeling off and had cobwebs in the corners. the shower tiles were falling and on the ground, the shower curtain had mold on it, I was told it was a non smoking room but it stunk like smoke. breakfast was a cup of coffee!! I was so disgusted that camping seemed much more hygienic than this place!

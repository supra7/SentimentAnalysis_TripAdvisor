Booked a 5 night package through Expedia 9 months ago to go to the Jazz Festival (celebrating my big 40th birthday) leaving for New Orleans on 4/27/12. The package was paid in full 9 months ago. 5 hours prior to my flight departure, I was notified via email that the Roosevelt had moved my husband and I to the Hilton. I spent 2 hours talking to Expedia and the Roosevelt. One of the mangers at the Roosevelt, Mark, told me that there was "an electrical issue at the hotel" then proceeded to tell me that they had simply overbooked. Mark assured me that my stay at the Hilton would only be for the weekend (Sat and Sun) and that I would be moved back to the Roosevelt on Mon, 4/30. Those were the facts. Following are my observations: 1) If I can't secure a room 9 months in advance (paid in full, although through a 3rd party) how much further in advance would I have to pay to secure a room at a Waldorf Astoria hotel? 2) Why would a customer who intend on staying at a Waldorf Astoria hotel want to be moved from one hotel to another in the middle of a vacation? 3) The Hilton, although not a motor inn, has an inferior star rating compared to the Roosevelt. 4) Why should ANY customer be subjected to this kind of undue distress on her 40th birthday, and at the beginning of a holiday, no less? The reason for why we were bumped is obvious. Frankly, my list of complaints can go on but you get the picture. After 2 hours of being transferred, Expedia did the right thing. Can't say that about the Roosevelt. Thank you Trip Advisor for allowing me to opportunity to share my experience.

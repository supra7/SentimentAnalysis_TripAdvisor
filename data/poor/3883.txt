Where to I begin? The room was smelly, the carpet was disgusting, the bathroom was horrible. We of course complained and was given an 'upgraded' room. Admittantly, this was a much better room. Apparantly, there is an old building (where our first room was) and a newer building (where the 'upgrade' was). Be sure to get the upgraded room if you have to stay here. personally, I wouldn't recommend it for my dog. The oceanview rooms located right on the beach were much nicer though.

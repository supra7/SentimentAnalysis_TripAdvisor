We were obligted to stay at this hotel as a part of the holiday for 'On-the-Go Tours'. Quite simply I cannot recall anything that was done well. The rooms where so small that two people cannot walk around at the same time. Every shower in the hotel seems to flood the bathroom. The shower head in my room came off completely (just as well because it helped to minimise the flooding). It was impossible to get extra towels - forget about a smile from the receptionist! Rooms on the first floor are very noisy. Quite honestly I would not stay there again.

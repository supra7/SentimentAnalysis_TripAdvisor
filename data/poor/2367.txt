My wife and I were advised by our travel agent and be other reviews on Trip Advisor to stay at this resort. Upon arrival, the grounds looked average and the facility lacked that "resort" look. The staff was VERY NICE! We were upgraded to the full ocean view room, which they advised us was their nicest room level. Upon walking into the room, I was immediately bummed. The room was no better than a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn. Neither of those hotels are bad, but when you are expecting a resort, and are paying resort prices, you expect fantastic. I travel literally every week for work, so I have a good feeling for what to expect out of hotels, this one was a huge let down. When I went to take a shower, the cold water faucet didn't work. My wife was afraid to walk around the hotel room barefoot. The main atrium had bushes that were overgrown (not a big deal, but indicitive of the dramatic lack of pride at this "resort"). I was told the hotel has been bought out by a very high class resort operator, however, it is obvious that updates have yet to be made. The pools were far from resort quality. They were two simple round pools with no frills at all. Aside from the friendly staff, the beach was beautiful! This resort is the closest and only (I think) with direct access to Makena Beach. All of this being said, I was so offended by this hotel, that within an hour of my arrival, we had arranged a refund of our remaining nights at the hotel and were booking the remainder of our trip at the Marriott Wailea (unbelievable resort that was very similar price to Makena Beach, definitely should look into the Marriott if interested in that part of Maui).

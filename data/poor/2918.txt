Just returned from a one night stay at this hotel for a meeting. It was the smallest room I have stayed in since college. I'm used to small hotel rooms in New York but this one was ridiculus. It had one queen bed as a king bed would not fit in the room. The view was of a parking lot. The furniture was old and worn. The desk chair was almost like a metal folding chair with worn out fabric on the back. The bed was uncomfortable and not heavenly for sure. The bathroom was tiny with a half tub as a full size tub would not fit and no water pressure. The air conditioning was noisy and would wake you up each time it came on. You could also hear every body in the hall way and each time a door would open it was as if it were in your room. The sheets and towels were of low quality and very worn. On a positive note the lobby area was nice and hip but the music was very loud. The food at the meeting was pretty nice and the hotel is close to Ess-A-Bagel which has the best bagels in the city. This is the second W hotel I have stayed and and so far both have been terrible. (Atlanta was the other) I was so happy I had only one night at this place. Every one at the meeting had similar complaints about their room. It seems the W tries to make the lobbies and hallways hip and cool but they forget about making the rooms nice and inviting. Avoid this hotel no matter what price you can get for a room!

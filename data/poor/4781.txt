The Royal Park Hotel is a nightmare, I mean if you are going to charge people $60.00 a night for a room at least give them a half-way decent, clean, comfortable room. I came by the Hotel to check it out before I book a room. I was shown a model room, I should of known better. I checked in on January 9, 2011 for two nights. I arrive early I was told I had to wait for two hours before a room is ready. When I got checked in and paid I got a key to a room. The room was very tiny there was no closet, and it was freezing cold. I came downstairs and asked to be moved. I was given another room that was not even half-way decent. It was filty the TV did not work, and the bed was so low to the floor. The electricity kept going off I was without electricty and cold. They did not offer any options or anything instead the front desk asct as if this was the first time someone has ever complained about their Hotel. There are people who are living there that are crack addicts, perverts, and convicts. The Royal Park was a half way house before it became a hotel. I know that some people on here have posted some comments coveying that the Royal Park was a nice, clean, place to them I say you must either live just like that, becasue if you think that the Royal Park Hotel is a great place then you do not value who you are or what you consider acceptable accommodations. The other dilemma I had was that there was no wireless of course there is no wireless its because they have convicts living in the buildings and they cannot havd access to e-mails. I have stayed at several Hostels in New York this by far was the worse one ever. It's a dump I would rather pay more money for a half way decent, clean, comfortable room because I value where I put my head to rest at the end of the night.

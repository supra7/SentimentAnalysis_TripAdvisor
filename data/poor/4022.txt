We are presidents club members and to date this was by far our worst experience!!!!!!! We stayed gold level and Jacqui the concierge who was working Thurs.Friday and Saturday was horrible.She is not concierge material,she messed up our boat tour and dinner reservation.She never apologized!!!! Anybody and everybody was having breakfast in the lounge because rooms were not being verified and half the time the concierge was not at the desk!!! We had just spent a week at the Fairmont in Scottsdale and we will absolutely go back there!!! Chicago Fairmont you really need to get rid of the gold floors because you guys obviously don't really care so much about the people staying with you!!! We will not return to Chicago but if we do it will NOT be with Fairmont!!! Shame on you!!!!!!!!!!!

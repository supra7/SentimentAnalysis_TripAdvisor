Tried it twice - will not be back Stayed there last year, had an ok stay. Upgraded from garden view room to ocean view small suite in historic section. Stayed in January 2004 and was very mediocre. I think that my expectations for this expensive property must just be unrealistic. Originally given very small ocean view room with furniture that looked like it might fall apart if you sneezed - very worn furniture/bathroom/carpeting. Staff changed rooms for me to a larger corner ocean view room but fabric headboard had absolutely disgusting stains, bedskirt had bleach stains, carpeting was stained and worn out, curtains/sheers all had only about half of the hooks intact. Beautiful grounds, great location, particularly for ocean use (minimal coral). Food is better at Moana than Royal Hawaiian. There is more coral in the ocean in front of the Moana than at the Royal Hawaiian.The general manager and the rooms manager each responded relatively quickly to me. One thing that I didn't post before is that this trip was booked because of promises to make up for a very poor prior stay at this hotel. I sent the following pictures to the general manager and rooms manager. The rooms manager stated that ...we will use this as a training and a refurbishment point for our operations... I also found it amusing that he asked me to visit the Sheraton Waikiki while the refurbishment is occurring.The general manager's response was simply an apology for the experience and The Royal truly is a special property that turns 77 years old this year.These rooms are supposedly in the $445 -$1500 per night category.For a Platinum SPG member, on an awards stay, booked directly with the rooms manager due to a poor previous experience.....I guess that I need to take the hint.Here's the link to the pictures. Pay particular attention to the headboard shots.http://www.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=67b0de21b34ac827e41bag=1

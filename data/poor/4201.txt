All week I looked forward to attending the NBA Conference with my husband and celebrating my birthday tomorrow and our 21st wedding anniversary on Thursday while staying at the Hilton. We arrive tired but looking forward to heading to our room and then going out to dinner. Upon arrival we were told not only was our room still not ready at 6:30 pm but they were unable to let us know what time our room would be available. Unbelievable! So my husband and I wait outside while our luggage lingers in the lobby and an hour later we receive a call that our room is ready. We collect our keys head upstairs open the door and our room has two double beds. We're a married couple celebrating an anniversary. My husband calls the front desk they forward our call to the managers Voicemail I express my frustration with the service we've received thus far and requested that he calls us back. No response. This quality of service from a Hilton Hotel is unacceptable.

the only review i would give of this total dump is to warn anyone thinking of staying there to GO ELSEWHERE....and the guy on the reception who likes to throw his rubbish and aim it at the bin on the other side of the room whilst talking to you...says it all really...oh not forgetting the down and outs who stay there..no disrespect to people who are on social security but it was bloody awful....there was a problem with my booking so i went elsewhere ....i wouldnt have stayed there anyway....i have complained to my travel agent about it....the only reason i gave it a rating was so i could post this review....

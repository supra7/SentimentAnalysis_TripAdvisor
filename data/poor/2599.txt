So pissed. I booked a room with double beds and they gave me a room with a King bed. Don't know how this happened. They told me they were fully booked and they could not accomidate me with a disireable room. The person who made the reservations should be fired and the hotel should accommodate me with an additional room free of charge or 1 night free for their careless mistake

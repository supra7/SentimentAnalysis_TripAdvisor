My stay was awful. The Hotel San Carlos was listed as an overflow for a conference I was going to at the Hyatt down the street. The rooms were dirty and small and accomodations overall were dingy and dark. I guess this is what they mean by "historic". The worst part of the hotel was the lack of hot water. My room was on the 4th floor and taking a shower at 7AM resulted in little to no hot water. Occasionally luke-warm water would flow out of the shower head that was the height of my eyeballs (I'm only 5'8''). The rest of the time the water was not even luke-warm. Finally, on my checkout day, the hotel had **NO WATER AT ALL** due to "city construction at a building next door". There was no warning to guests. I have a hard time believing that the water would be shut off without letting the hotel know about it. Response by the hotel was inconsistent at best. I got $100 off of my night, while travelling partners received respectively $50 off and a free yogurt parfait. We were also instructed that we would not be charged the $3 for the bottles of water in our room so that we could wash up, which was laughable. Anyway, in summary, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!

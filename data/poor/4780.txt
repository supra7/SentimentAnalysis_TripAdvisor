I would NOT recomend Royal Park Hotel and Hostel World booking website. We made a reservation and payed 45 days in advance. 6 days before our arrival, we received an email telling us that our reservation would not be honoured. That is absolutely outrageous! In 6 days everything is full in NYC, we ended up having to chose between a terrible and old hotel or a very, very expensive one. This really spoilled our hoiday, YOU CANNOT TRUST HOSTEL WORLD an ROYAL PARK HOTEL.

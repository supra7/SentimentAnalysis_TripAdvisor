I booked this place through expedia and when I arived there they wanted cash which made a bad start to this stay. The room was not what i call good, rather dirty carpets and a shoddy look to the rooms. The free breakfast was a dainish bun with coffee, def not what I expect from a USA hotel. More surprising was that the TV station had the Playboy chanel on which might upset these with children . To be honest I def would not book into this hotel again and rather spend a few extra buck on a decent place. Sorry guys

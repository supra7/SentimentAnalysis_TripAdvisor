we stayed at the trump. nice room (or would have been had the staff bothered to empty the bin full of half eaten pizza and bananas that we were greated to on opening the door) no crockery, no cutlery no way to make coffee, no robes, no toiletries no nothing really! i phoned down to reception who promised to 'correct this immediately sir' it took 24 (thats TWENTY FOUR MR TRUMP ) hours and at least they had shifted the trash (i learned the staff do not understand 'bin' only 'trash can' sorry for being a retard MR TRUMP) we managed without the rest of the refinements, at the end of the day the trump hotel is a travelodge style motel, nice view and nice bath but no personal care and really nothing special. staff are obviously completely lacking motivation, organisation, and direction. for heavens sake donald get a grip on this place! and the internet which you are forced to pay approx 20 bucks a day for is virtually unusable and the tv in the bathroom didnt work neither. all in all a pretty poor show! in essence.. rip off!!

Our experience at the Beekman was terrible. As per other reviews, the pictures on the internet in no way represent the actual rooms (with exception of the curtains). The room we had was very hot and when we turned on the airconditioning, it actually blew out hot air. My husband and I woke up at 4am because we were scratching constantly due to severe itchiness. Once we turned on the lights and pulled the covers back, we found there were little black bugs in our bed. When we went to the front desk to ask them to change rooms immediately, they told us to go back upstairs, back to bed, and they would accomodate a room change for us the next morning. But honestly, how can you go back to bed when you know there are bugs in it? We had booked to stay three nights but left at 4am (the internet provider from which we booked was very helpful in helping us get out of our reservation). The cost of the hotel is very expensive. You'd be better off staying at a 2 star Day's Inn than at this supposed 3.5 star Beekman Towers Hotel.

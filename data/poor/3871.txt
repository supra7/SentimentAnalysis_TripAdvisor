I set my standards pretty low when it comes to accommodations. I don't spend a lot of time in the room, so my criteria are that the place is clean, comfortable, and proportionately-priced. It's extremely rare that I leave anyplace with a negative comment. The description I read about Maui Lu sounded nice. And as some other reviewers indicated, it probably was quite the place...once. From what I'm reading, I think there must be a range of the types of rooms that are offered. The place is situated nicely. The small beach across the highway is lovely. Maybe the rooms on the ocean side are better than the one I had. I was in what was apparently one of the oldest buildings in the complex. The building that paralleled the one I was in looked like a newer version, but with sliding doors and a different roof line. I certainly don't care that my room was in an older building, but for the price, it was dirty. Some pretty big cobwebs, and thick dust on the higher surfaces. The pieces of motel art on the walls were so faded you couldn't tell what colors they once were. The top of the dormitory-size refrigerator was sticky and stained. Tears and burns in the blankets. The room smelled like public bathroom disinfectant. The hanging light over the table flickered, and when I touched the cord, a flash came out of the plug and the bulb burned out. In the middle of the night (not a fault of the hotel) I awoke to a screaming match in another room. Walking past another room the smell of pot was clearly discernable. A prominent building on the grounds that was probably once a restaurant or lounge is now being used by a church. That's fine, but at 7:30 in the morning the very loud country-rock church music started blasting across the gounds like a wake up call. If you choose the Maui Lu Resort (not sure where the "resort" part comes in), don't do what I did. BE SURE to ask to see a choice of rooms before you drag your luggage in!

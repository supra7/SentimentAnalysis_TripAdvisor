Tuesday, November, 15, 2011, was the worst meal that I have experienced in 30 years. If the meal had not been free, as we had two free buffett' s presented to us that evening by Ms Terri Lorenzen, casino host, it could only have been worse if we would have had to pay for the mess. This is the fourth trip to the Fremont area in the last two years, and have eaten the f Fremont Seafood buffett, on two previous trips, and found the dinner good, something has happened about the quality which is terrible, the best thing about the meal was the ice cream, do not try this, and I will not eat anything from the Fremont until this has been corrected, even saw a floor manager, correct a waiter in front of four hundred people, I felt sorry for the waiter, however this shows me, not only is the food horrible, the staff as well is bad.

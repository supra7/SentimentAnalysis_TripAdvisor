Save yourself a hassel and do not stay at this place. We asked if we could view a room before making a decision. The Asian man behind the counter told us we could but we needed to give him a credit card to hold while we did. We came back disqusted and said we were surely not going to stay there. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The outdoor elevator didn't seem as though it had the power to make it to the third floor (probably because there were a few hundred cigarettes on the floor of the elveator). The paint on the walls of the room was coming off in more than a few places. Over the phone they told us that parking was free. When we arrived they told us it was 15 dollars a night to park at the hotel. They advertised the room as a suite. Really, it had a bed, tiny bathroom, and a small beat up microwave was on the floor. When we arrived back at the counter to ask for our card back, he told us he thought we intended on staying and he said he already ran the credit card for a full weeks stay. We were furious and demanded he reverse the charges. He told us it was too late and that our conversation was upsetting possilbe customers so he called the police. When the police arrived, they were confused at why he was charging us. The asked him when it could be reversed and he said in the morning. The best thing he did all night was call the police on us because the police ended up being on our side completely. We still ended up being charged 5 percent of a weeks stay. ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS LOOK INSIDE A ROOM BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF SLEEPING IN A DUMPSTER THAN PAYING TO DEAL WITH THE PLACE. I WISH I HAD READ THIS BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE. We ended up staying a couple blocks away at Summersfiled suites. I highly recommend Summerfields suites. They said that they get upset customers who just came from Kings Inn all the time and that they actually keep numbers on how many people complain about Kings Inn every week.

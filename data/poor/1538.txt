The room smelled of dog urine and the carpet was greasy feeling. We had to stay during a move for several weeks. The other guests were very undesirable and scary. It was like a ghetto. There were people using bbq grills under the stairs and against the walls and management did not take any actions on it. Lots of loud kids and adults. There seemed to be no control of the guests.

We had booked 3 separate rooms, for 2 nights each, with written confirmations. After landing, we picked up our rental car, and stopped at the hotel to drop off our bags. Our rooms weren't ready, but they gladly stored our bags. We went to our trade show, then to dinner, and got back to the hotel at 9:40pm. They still had our bags, but had given away our rooms. They "walked" us, to another hotel owned by the same company, but 20 minutes further away...and not as nice. The folks behind the desk continued to check in others, as we were being sent away. We were told that the manager only works 8-5, and that there was no one in the hotel who could help us.

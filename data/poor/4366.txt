The hotel was kept clean, but the room looked much nicer in the web pics. What they call a "Strat Select" room is not very different from any other standard hotel room. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful. They would be the biggest positive about the place. The biggest negative would be the location. It is just off of the strip and more to the north end, which is the older, more rundown part of the city. Therefore you have to walk thru a pretty scary part of town to get back to the hotel after walking around the strip. We drove our car out to park in other hotels before we went sightseeing, just to feel safe upon our return in the evening.

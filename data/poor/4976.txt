This is by far the worst hotel i've ever stayed at. The hotel security are stalkers and will find any reason to evict you. On our way back from being out that night we were greeted at our door by security informing us to pack our stuff because we were being evicted. The creepo security guard wouldnt even let us shut the door to get changed. He stood in the doorway and watched every move we made. They accused us of trespassing and had the police come to escort us out. The police felt so bad for us that they helped us carry our bags out!!!!! They admitted this happens all the time. So here we are 4 girls in their 20's with no where to sleepat 3AM!!!!. These people should be assamed of themselves. I hope this doesnt happen to anyone else. It was a waste of money and ruined our vacation.

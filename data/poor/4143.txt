I booked three weeks early to stay here after finding it to be one of the only places downtown without bedbugs reported. Upon arrival, I and a colleague were both informed that they were overbooked and we were sent to other hotels. From other colleagues, it became apparent that they do this quite often. At least they gave me a few bucks for a cab.

Very disapppointed During 2 weeks in March we stayed in Las Vegas, Yosemite National Park, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and Santa Monica. The only disappointment we had in our accommodation choices was this hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is run down and in need of a complete upgrade. Housekeeping is of a mediocre standard (carpets hoovered in the middle but not at the edges, mildew in the bathroom, poor standard of decoration etc.) and breakfast served was more hostel than hotel. This has the potential to be an excellent hotel but it is not.

I attended a conference and was required to stay at this property. I was very disappointed with the accomodations for the price of the room and the location. The property has been updated but the quality of the bedding and the taste of the decor is odd. Many of the rooms have no views at all facing air conditioning units or office buildings. The location is an unusual neighborhood with no nice restaurants, bars or shopping nearby. The property also charged me $5 to RECEIVE a fedex package in addition the the outrageous $51 for valet parking. On a positive note the gym-spa is really nice with great equipment in a large space. For $219 per night there are much nicer hotels in much nicer neighborhoods in Chicago.

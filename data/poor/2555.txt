i am a contractor who frequently stays in budget hotels in the london area and over the last 10 yrs i think i have seen the best and the worst of of a massive band of similarly priced accommodation . then i found the continental at paddington . this hotel is advertised daily in the london metro and as i was working in the area i decided to book over the phone and took a twin room at the advertised rate , myself and a workmate checked in and were given a room with shared bathroom near reception . first thing i saw as i opened the door was a gaping hole in the wall by the window , moving the curtains aside to take a closer look i was genuinely taken aback at the dust and dirt on the sills and curtains . the blankets on the bed were ancient and looked as though they had been shredded by some feral beast , maybe they had as there was a rodent trap concealed between one of the beds and the crumbling wall . we walked straight out and asked for our money back as a rat trap in the room is surely good reason . a slimy character on reception at first refused us a refund as we had used the room , in fact we were in the room 5 mins at most , he relented after a lengthy exchange and we walked around the square and got a room in a much better establishment for a pound a night more . if you want to stay in this area and you have a little time i would advise to go door to door as we did - there are so many hotels in the area you will almost certainly find something to suit your standards and budget

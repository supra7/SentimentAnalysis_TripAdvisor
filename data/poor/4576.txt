Worst, most expensive Chicago hotel I've stayed at in several trips over past 20 years! I may never use Priceline again! This is not a 4star hotel! Rooms are size of closets. First room we were given was not made yet. Second room had a bug on the bed. Third room had an odor but we gave up and stayed. The room temp was irregular, stuufy & the AC was so loud we turned it off at night. Was Lollapalooza weekend & paid $240 on Priceline because my husband had a conference that weekend. Stay at Red Roof Inn instead!

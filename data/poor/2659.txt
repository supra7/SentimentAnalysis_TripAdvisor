Just returned from a 3 night stay for Jazz Fest '07. We were in a (I use the term loosely) "deluxe" room on the 1st floor. The room smelled terrible. The bed linens were worn and scratchy and the bedspread dirty. The bathroom floor was also dirty and there were slugs on the carpet. After a long day at jazzfest you just want to relax in your room before going out to dinner. I could barely stay in it to sleep (which we did very little of since the bed was so uncomfortable). All requests to do something about the room was met with indifference from the staff and didn't even bother to apologize. I stay in New Orleans several times a year. Always stay at the Windsor Court and will definitely never go anywhere but there again. The location is great but the place is a Motel 6 at best.

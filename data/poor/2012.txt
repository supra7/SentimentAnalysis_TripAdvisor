This was a shocking experience for a hyatt, or any other hotel for that matter. I had rude encounters with the staff on check in, checked into my room, the carpet was soaking wet, I changed rooms, the new room didn't have towels in it, there was a live cockroach in the bathroom, I had to wait longer than 30 minutes to have towels brought to my room, all this with no apologies from staff, I was exhausted from my travels, and to tolerate this at over 200.00 a night, I expected so much more from Hyatt, but I guess the name doesn;t really mean much, not like the Four Seasons name, etc. Unbelieveable experience.

We visited this hotel for the Indianapolis 500 weekend and spent $250 per night for our room. The first time we used the toilet paper holder, it fell apart. An easyfix with a small screw driver. Yet, despite 7 interactions with the staff and even a visit to their maintenance room to look for a screwdriver to fix it myself, it still has not been fixed as they did not have a screwdriver small enough and apparently are not willing to purchase one. The entire situation should have been quickly resolved. Their lack of attention to detail in getting this fixed is very unprofessional.

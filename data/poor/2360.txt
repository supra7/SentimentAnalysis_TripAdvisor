The reception we got from Rudy the front desk supervisor was awfull. He made us wait for a long time, because they had a double reservation. We were given a room where you could not sit on the balcony because of the noise from their laundrette. The pool area is tiny and offers no shade. No hospitality room to take a shower when you have a late flight: you may use the cold shower at the pool and carry your wet clothes with you or pay US$ 120 when you want to stay in your room a couple of hours longer than checkout time. We found this hotel definitely not worth the money.

Seattle PD, where were you on the night of my stay? My vehicle broke down in the downtown area early January on my way back to Vancouver. The Kings seemed like a life saver at the time, as it was 11:30 Pm on a wednesday night. The rate, (about $90) although pricey, was still cheaper then a tow truck. Upon checking in, I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman of dark complexion who kindly showed me to my room and assisted me in finding a quality pizza service. It seemed that all would be well as I retired to my room to grab some some sleep. I believe I was afforded an hour of sleep before the Nightmare started. Sometime around 2:00 AM the screaming, door slamming and other intense activities began. It wasnt untill I went outside for a cigarette that I realized how badly law enforcment was needed. I was first approached on the balcony by an african fellow who wondered if I had " that Creme" for him. This was only the first of many attempts to lure me into a room by many of the motels occupants. There was obvious drug use of the Crack Cocaine variety present as well as prostitution , violence and drug trafficing from room to room. I believe i had been mistaken as someone else because all night there were phone calls being routed to my room and people banging on my door asking if " I had It" for them. What happend to decency and safe clean nights sleep? I'll be sure to steer clear off the downtown area from now on. Seattle is so wonderful during the day, but don't ever let yourself be caught there at night. Dont let the Kings Inn fool you, it seems alright, but unless you feel like gambling with your morality and your decency stay as far away as you can from this Dark Dirty Drug Den.

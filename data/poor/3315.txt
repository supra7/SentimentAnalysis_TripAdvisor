What a miserable night. My "non-smoking" room reeked of smoke, the toilet would only flush if I held down the handle for close to a minute, the room was very dark, even with every light turned on, and when I tried to work out in the tiny fitness room, the treadmill was broken. Everything was kind of dingy and I was extremely relieved to check out! They did put out some Bath and Body Works products and a nice robe, but it didn't come close to offsetting the bleak environment.

An absolutely terrible hotel. Do Not Stay Here. It will ruin your vacation as it almost did for my wife and I. This is an RCI timeshare "resort". For a company and stature like RCI they should be ashamed and disgusted to even be affiliated with it which I can't belive that they are. I will ramble on here a little bit because we just got back from our trip and I still can't believe we stayed even one night in this hell hole. I had my doubts from the moment I booked the Summerbay because of the bad reviews that I read, which by the way are ALL true. I took a gamble though and it turned out very poorly. Our original room had stained, smelly rugs. Dirty floors, smelly and dirty shower drain and we had remenints of the previous guests (old shocks in dresser drawer) My wife and I stayed two nights before we complained. The front desk showed us two other rooms that were not a smidgent better. So we called RCI and comlained but they couldn't accomodate us in any other properties. They agreed to credit us the week and my wife and I packed up and went to the MGM for the remaider of the week. It was wonderful. I feel bad because I pay all this money for the timeshare and I had to go and pay for four nights and food at a hotel. To add insult to injury we found out that this property is being torn down at the end of the year to make way for a new Harrah's project. So you know they aren't sinking any money into upgrades. To be honest they should knock it down NOW!

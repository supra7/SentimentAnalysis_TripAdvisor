My husband and I stayed at Harrah's for three nights with a conference, and we were disappointed by the facilities. First, the room in the Mardi Gras Tower was small, dark, and noisy. The "view" consisted of other high-rises, rooftop A/C equipment, and construction. Also, the room was without amenities. The TV offered only a dozen (mostly local) channels, but plenty of advertisements for Harrah's facilities. The bedside clock radio was inoperable. Not only was the room without a micro/fridge, there was neither in-room coffee nor daily newspaper. Second, Harrah's food services were disappointing. The continental breakfast in the business center was attractive, but limited. Two meals (one breakfast, one lunch) were offered at The Range, both of which were far below expectations. The menu, presentation, and service were on par with typical cafeteria fare. The Chinese restaurant offered tasty dishes, however service was inexplicably slow, and the food chilled quickly after it was served. Third, the common areas of Harrah's were less than accommodating. There was no place to sit unless one was gambling, eating or drinking. There was no complementary coffee or paper, even at the front desk. Most disappointing was the lack of pool/spa facilities. I was shocked that a resort with the renown of Harrah's didn't have a year around pool. The only positive comment I have for Harrah's is its central location on the strip. This, however, wouldn't be reason enough for me to consider staying there again.

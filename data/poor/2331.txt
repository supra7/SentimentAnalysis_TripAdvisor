Took our own bags out of the car. No help with directions to the restaurant. Unsanitary spa. Force to look up at large cockroach during treatment, repeatedly requested a robe for my modest guest and repeatedly refused, be for warned to wear your own bathing suite or be in an area naked with women with them on, told we were in an exclusive area for women then lead into a co-ed patio. Poor service from spa & pool personnel. Pool employee looked into my private purse and asked for a cigarette. Insulted my appearance. Company attempted fraudulent charges on my credit card in the amount of $3333.33. I broke my cell phone when hotel blocked my account to use the phone over declined credit card which was declined by the credit card merchant over suspected fraud. Waken up with loud call from accounting at 0800 while a privacy please was on my door. No toilet paper in the bathroom. Rude management. I was offered the following apology while my regaling you explanations for some of the incidents you raised might make me feel better, it will have little if any effect on your last impression of the Grand Wailea. There was nothing to regale about the level of poor service we received. The Managing Directors response added insult to injury. My sister and I had to make many arrangements to be there. The Fours Seasons next door is 100 times better and the Marriott is great. I will NEVER stay at the Grand Wailea again even with a free (2) night offer from management, like asking someone to return to a horror show for a second viewing when they bought a ticket to a romance. They really put a great name like Hilton to shame! Aesthetics are beautiful but management leads by example which makes the service behind the scenes rude and unprofessional. Free to walk the shops.

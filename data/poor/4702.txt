We stayed at this hotel on May 16, 2011 for one night. In the morning we checked out and left for Disney Parks. Few hours later my wife start scratching - she had at least 20 bites all over her legs. I checked online and can positively say that was bed bugs bites. I hope they didn't get into my luggage or clothes. Do yourself a favor and find a different hotel. There are more reports for bed bugs infestation at this property - just search online. I'm sorry I didn't check before booking

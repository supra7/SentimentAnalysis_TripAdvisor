I recently stayed here, Feb. 2005. My room upon check in smelled bad, was very cold and damp feeling. Returning to the front desk I was told they were running at 100% and another room would not be available for a couple of days. I returned to the desk again at which time they moved me to a room that was at least dry feeling. The next day I was moved to another room which was tolerable. I had never stayed at this hotel before so I did not know what to expect, having stayed there once now I would never stay there again. The best thing I encountered was the staff at check in she worked very hard and I am sure she went out of here way to help me during my stay. I commend all of the staff, I just was not impressed with the rooms.

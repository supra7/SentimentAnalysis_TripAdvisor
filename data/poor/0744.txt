Our extended family of 7 (ages 8-80) spent a very disappointing week at the Hyatt Maui. The resort is old and the management aloof and unaccomodating. Booked 9 months in advance, we were given 1 king bed for a family of 4. They smiled when they said "sorry, we never guarantee beds". Of course they could find us 2 beds IF we paid an addl. $65/night, which was ludicrous when we had already paid over $400/night up front. We found that a tacky "bait & switch" for a supposed 4 * resort. They refused to allow us carry our own groceries upstairs, insisting we use/tip a bellboy. An hour and a half later our groceries were still not at our room, resulting in spoiled food, aggravation. Our travel agent booked a special whereas we got free bkfts for 2 each a.m. at Swan Court. The lines for bkft were so long that you could rarely use your prepaid coupons, and the food was awful. An addl. $15/day resort fee does Not include internet access. The magnetic mini-bar strip in the room will automatically charge your account if your children even Touch an item. Most irritating though was the hotel undergoing undisclosed renovation during our stay. The hallways were being stripped of old wallpaper, light fixtures, which resulted in a horrendous odor and a parade of workers t/o our stay. Our 8 year old child was quite sick and we requested a late check out, which was denied. We will Never stay at a Hyatt again after this awful experience. We saved up for 10 years for this vacation and were bitterly disappointed with the accomodations and aloof attitude of the staff. Please learn from our experience and go elsewhere.

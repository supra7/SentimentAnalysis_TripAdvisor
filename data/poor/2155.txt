The Palmer House offers a unique service; staff that break into your room after 11:00 pm and, despite the fact that your bag is in the middle of the room, proceed to make telephone calls from room, ostensiblly to see if someone is staying in your room (nothwithstanding your luggage in the middle of the room and belongings spread out on the table). By way of explanation, this room had a separate seating area and it was only when I was woken by the sound of someone on the telephone (I was asleep in the bed) that I realized someone else was in the room. I was told that he (the alleged employee) was looking to see if the room was unoccupied because another guest needed a larger room. Although I tried to contact the night manager twice, I hung up after several minutes on hold each time. The front desk did confirm that I was registered in the room and there was no confusion on their part. If you enjoy having your room entered (broken into) by alleged staff late at night, then this is the hotel for you. When I was called to follow up on my e-mailed complaint (I never received any kind of response or acknowledgement from management), it was apparent that the caller had not bothered to look at the security report. If you are a business traveler or a woman traveling alone or just someone who thinks you should be able to contact hotel management when your privacy is invaded, you should stay somewhere else.

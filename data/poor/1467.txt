Stayed overnight at the hotel as had early flight in the morning.I am a frequent business traveller and are top status at Hilton,spg and a platinum plus Ambassador at Intercontintal Hotels.I could not believe at this Crowne Plaza they dont upgrade you to the Club rooms or access to the lounge and they want to charge for internet when 50 metres away in the airport its free and fast. I can only recommend frequent travellers switch to Hilton and Starwood hotels where you do get looked after.

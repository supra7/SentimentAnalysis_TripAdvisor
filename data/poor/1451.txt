We were very disappointed with the size of the room and the cleanliness thereof. The room was only vacuumed after I asked it to be done, the cups and glasses are only rinsed in hot water - yuck! The neighbouring room kept having phone calls at 3am which was very disturbing. I would not recommend this hotel.

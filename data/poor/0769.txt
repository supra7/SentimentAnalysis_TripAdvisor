When you book a stay in Maui, you're expecting it all. We arrived at the hotel at 11:50 p.m. Flew more than 11 hours to get there from Ottawa. Upon arrival, there's one clerck at the desk, not the friendly type. We were tired and starving so we asked if we could get some food? The clerk tells us the kitchen closes at midnight, so we asked right away to ring them up to see what they could prepare. He then explains that the staff starts closing up the place at 11:45 p.m. Now most people would go out of their way to help us here, but no, not him...Not a single call. No help at all. We then ask if we can get fruit or anything at all, the answer was still no. We take our key and walk to the building where our room was. Stairs only to the third floor. The building is old, the carpet is old, and the room we're about to discover is old. Moreover, it looks like an Econo Lodge. I don't mind the Econo Lodge that much, but if paying 2500USD for it, I have a huge problem. The next morning, we're up early for breakfast(!). We had an invitation coupon to a special buffet. We get there, the place is dark and looks like an unfit congress center. The buffet is cold and the food not so good. The host tries to push us into buying package tours. We left early and walked on the beach to discover the Hyatt. Called our travel agent and cancelled our stay.

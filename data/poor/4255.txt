I am a seasoned vegas traveler, I have stayed at nice places (monte carlo, ny ny. etc) and not so nice places (boardwalk). I can honestly say Harrahs was by far the worst I have ever experienced. 1st. casino was so smoky from cigarettes that it burned your eyes to walk through, smoke was so bad you could smel lit on the 10th floor of the mardi gras tower 2nd HVAC diddnt work in room the temp would not go below 73 deg F, it was nicer outside than in the room, and the windows diddtn open. I called engineering and the lady on the phone was rude,and obviously diddnt care 3rd. had to pay for internet service. That is unheard of in 2011, I travel all over the country for my job.. and have never had to pay for internet service. internet service is like a utility, I half expected to get a bill for water, and electricty when I checked out. 4th. casino workers trying to sell you stuff, having people back by the checkin kiosk trying to sell you stuff. bugging you everytime you walked within 10 feet. I must say I have been coming to vegas at lease once per year for the last 12 years.. and I wont be coming back for a very very long time.

#1. location: 200 feet from rail road. woke me up 6 times during the night. switched room the next day to strip view, didn't help at all. #2. checked in, pillow still has lipstick and stains all over. #3. bathtub still has pubic hair in it #4. microwave was dirty, still has food all over. #5. TV has HDMI, but was disable, couldn't watch my DVD. Overall, I would never stay here again, even for FREE. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I probably had much more fun at CIRCUS CIRCUS, at least, there was a circus there.

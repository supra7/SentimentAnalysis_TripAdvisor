Worst hotel experience This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I stayed at this hotel for five days and each day just got worse. On the first day, they did not have the room that we've prepaid for available. So on the second day, they made all the guests change rooms, which was extremely inconvenient. A lot of the guests we spoke w/ agreed that the management and rooms were terrible. The rooms were small and dirty. The bedsheets and towels had stains on it as if they were never washed. Both rooms that I stayed in had tiny bugs crawling all over the tables and walls. I was scared to take off my shoes the entire time in the room b/c the carpets was so filthy. If you're looking for a nice stay in Hawaii, I would not recommend this hotel for you.

I stayed at the Westin and was extremely disappointed. I have never experienced such bad service in any hotel ever before. The staff was extremely rude and treated you with no respect. Everything is greatly overpriced and not worth the money. Breakfast will cost $25 per person. The elevators are very slow and there are only 2 in the main lobby-you can expect a wait. If this is for your honeymoon then be ready for a lot of children-it is nice that they have an adult only pool but beware children do sneak in and also when children want to go on the big slide they run by the adult pool where you may be sitting. Management has no response for problems. I wrote in about numerous complaints and was never contacted by anyone at all! Truthfully, this place is overrated and overpriced. The rooms are not that big and the bathrooms could use a lot of work on them. Beware that they will try and tell you that you are a special guestmeaning they want you to invest in their timeshares. We actually went on it because it was only to be 90 minutes yet was 2 hours and a waste of a beautiful Hawaiian day.

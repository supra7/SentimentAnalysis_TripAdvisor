Worst hotel experience we've had! My daughter and I had planned an 8-night stay at the Waikiki Parc, but we were so disgusted that we moved out after two nights. We were in a deluxe ocean view room, which we discovered was directly above the loading dock to a nearby hotel. Each morning at 6 or 7am we were awakened by the BEEP, BEEP, BEEP sound of trucks backing up. Despite advertisements about the bountiful breakfast buffet and room service, we found out that the restaurants are closed until further notice, and that room service consists of delivery of food from a local service (for 6.99) in a styrofoam container! Breakfast was some stale danish, hard fruit, and prepackaged ham and cheese sandwiches. The workout room equipment was not working, and the pool looked like it was in desperate need of updating. The room itself was not too bad, but it was not completely carpeted, so there was nothing to absorb the noise coming from the room above us. This hotel is billed as the sister to Halekulani - the fabulous hotel across the street that is ranked one of the best in the world (and it is -- I have stayed there!), but this is a farce. We moved over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is always fabulous! This was our third stay there and we were definitely not disappointed. Just be aware if you choose this hotel that you may not get any sleep or promised amenities. Also, there is construction going on all around the hotel for about a three block radius so even walking down the street is a dusty and noisy experience. For me, it's quieter at home!

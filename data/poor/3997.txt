It is a Motel 6 in a good location. Wallpaper coming off the walls. Dirty carpet, dusty curtins. Spider webs, Motel 6 beds, nice view of a brick wall, dark and a manager on duty Shawn must have just started working in the hotel business a week ago. All this a a four star price. Yes Boston is a great city you can do much better for the same price. If I could tell you something good about this hotel I would. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My wife and I stayed here for two nights and while the room was nice enough, it was tiny. Upon checking out we learned that someone (not us) ordered food and charged it to our room. We told the staff that there was a mistake, and we were told the charge would be removed. When we got home, we found out we were charged for the food. After calling the hotel, being put on hold, being ignored, forced to talk to several answering machines, basically being called a liar, and WEEKS of waiting, we were told our money would be refunded. But, it was never refunded!! Very unprofessional service..still trying to get through to someone who can help me out. Like I said, the hotel was nice enough, but definitely not worth the headache.

The Gold Spike has cheap room rates, but it's a case of "you get what you pay for". Our room was filthy and we were told no other rooms available. Like this other reviewer wrote the rooms at the Gold Spike have bed bugs! The last morning there I woke up to find drops of blood on the bed sheets and red bite marks that itch, thanks to these critters! On my next trip to Las Vegas I won't be so cheap. I'm going to spend the money and stay at a hotel where the maids do their jobs and clean the rooms, and hotel management makes sure the rooms are free of bed bugs.

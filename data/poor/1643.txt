I unfortunately had the experience of staying at this hotel on a weekend. My room was very noisy and I was woken up many times by people talking in the halls all through the night. The hotel actually sold a block of rooms to a fraternity, then put me in the middle of them. To add insult to injury the TV didn't work and the toilet wouldn't flush. After several noise complaints I ask to change rooms and they told me they were sold out. I spend about 150 nights a year in hotels and this was the worst experience I have had this year. I won't recommend this hotel to anyone unless you want to be the one up drunk and partying all night.

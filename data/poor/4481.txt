My husband & I were part of a tour group and stayed 4 nights in this hotel. This hotel caters mostly to tour groups and has no interest in serving the individual customer. The walls of our room were paper thin and we could hear all the comings and goings in the hallway as well as the happenings in our neighbor's bathroom. I was afraid to put my bare feet on the carpeting - it was stained and does not appear to have ever been cleaned. The front desk staff were aloof and uppity and pretended not to see you. The continental breakfast was pathetic - canned fruit cocktail, hard-boiled eggs, and toast - those were some of the edible items. Yes this hotel is close to the Metro station, but do yourself a favor - walk a couple blocks and stay somewhere else.

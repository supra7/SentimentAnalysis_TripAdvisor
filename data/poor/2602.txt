I made reservations directly on the IC website on August 2, 2009 for December 19 - the Saints/Cowboys game. They called today to say they were overbooked and were going to try to make arrangements for us elsewhere. I had picked the IC because of the great reviews and for the proximity to the Superdome. They were supposed to call back in 30 minutes to let me know about the new hotel. An hour went by - I started looking for hotels on my own. I finally found a hotel 3 hours later (still no call from IC) at the convention center location. The lady said they have trouble with their website, which resulted in the overbooking. It is the entire IC website because the Astor Crown Plaza (another IC hotel) showed they had availabilities. I called - of course, they did not. I will NOT use the Intercontinental Hotels again.

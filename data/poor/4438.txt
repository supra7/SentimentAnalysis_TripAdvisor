We were assured our litle dog was welcomed. Checked in with him in my arms. Was charged for 2 rooms.Not refunded ! Went to eat and gamble ,in same hotel .Return ,and we're locked out of our room . Have to get security to let us in ,and they tell me I have to find another place for my service dog, or move to another lodging. Found another place down town no problem . DON'T TRUST HOTEL.COM !!!

I though this hotel was terrible that was my first reaction and rude staff to boot. We arrive 5 minutes early and the receptionist was very offish. Matters not helped by our month old booking not being found even though it was through Hotels.com.(which is a huge company). So we were given the last room available which if you've traveled much means the worst room and that was next to the lift. The room was noisy and had a dreadful view of the run down building next door which was only 5m away, this creates a terrible view. Also if you are an asthmatic do not book this hotel as chintzy in this case means old and I became very unwell. I've included photos and the cupboard without the doors inlaid with that TV that you cant watch from bed is a nice touch. Ive traveled a great deal and this is a hotel living off old reviews. The only saving grace was the home made food, good cakes and the staff in the morning being very helpful but that is not enough for me to recommend this hotel.

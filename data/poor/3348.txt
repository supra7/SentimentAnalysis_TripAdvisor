We stayed at the Dunes Manor over President's Day weekend for one night. This hotel looks quite nice from the outside, and the location is fantastic - right at the end of the boardwalk. However, the rooms and housekeeping here leave much to be desired! We checked into our non-smoking room and the whole room smelled as if someone had just smoked a pack of cigarettes in there moments earlier. I pulled off the comforter on the bed, and the blanket/sheets definitely did not look as if they were cleaned - they were absolutely filthy with hairs (the kind you REALLY don't want to find in a bed) and who knows what else. I called the front desk for a whole new set of linens as well as a new blanket. So we made the bed ourselves, and in the process found a dirty hair curler on the floor next to the bed - gross! The hotel has only two elevators that service the entire 11 floors, so it must take forever to get around in the summer. The only good experience was the view from the room, and the breakfast in the restaurant was very good as well. Not recommended!

I have been in real hostels, even rome's 10euros per nite shared rooms are more comfy than this, this thing is not comparable to a hostel .... i am havin problems breathin for the room is the filthiest thing i've ever seen in my life, and i'm all bout a perfect householder. when i arrived i didn't even realize that they didn change the rubbish bag before givin me the room, i wish they had at least changed the towels and the sheets in the beds, and u cant bet i didn even open the beds once.. I WAS CHARGED 100 BUCKS PER NITE IN THIS S//////!!!!!!TTY PLACE. complaining wont help for they're gonna put u in another ugly room, it's july n its all fully booked..... just don't book, tell ur friends not to book and run away if they give u the h33 key at the check in. wth. i wanna cry. thx god im leaving in 2 days

We are 4 tourists from Thessaloniki-Greece and we visit Istanbul many times per year. At 18/1/09, we booked via internet 2 double-bed rooms in our names at Hotel Pera Tulip, at Mesrutiyet Cad., Istanbul. We have stayed at this hotel in Sept.2008 again, and at that period, the hotel gave us a spacius double-bed room. So, we booked the SAME type of room for the period 10/4 till 13/4/09. At 10/4, morning, we arrived at the above hotel and we gave to the reception all our necessary documents for the booking. They said to us that "it's ok, your rooms will be ready after 12.00 at midday", so we were forced to spend all our morning at the city and we returned back to the hotel at about 13.00, although we had travelled all night from Greece to Istanbul and it was immediate need for us to have the appropriate rooms. At 13.00, the reception finally gave to us 2 "half" rooms, that means 2 rooms that they were not "double" and they were VERY SMALL and NOT suitable for 2 persons. We were forced to go to another hotel...

We first stayed at the Joule in February 2009 for our 20th anniversary and had a wonderful stay. The hotel had opened recently, and the staff really went out of their way to ensure that we were happy and comfortable. Had I written this review then I would have given them five stars. We've stayed 3 times since then and every stay has gotten worse. It's a beautiful property that is very poorly managed, and the staff seems unable (and unwilling) to handle the hotel when it is crowded. The last time we stayed our room was never cleaned. We complained twice, and even left the room so housekeeping could come in and they still never came. Finally at 10:30 at night we spoke to the manager and sat in the lobby while they at least made the bed and gave us clean towels. Yesterday we tried to check in at 4:30 in the afternoon (check in is at 3:00) and were told that our room wasn't ready and had to wait an hour to get into our room, which forced us to cancel our dinner reservations. Once there, we found an ironing board, but no iron and when we asked to have one delivered we were told that they weren't sure when they would be able to locate one. The staff is indifferent at best, and they don't even pretend to try to solve your problem. Additionally, they have made their pool a "scene" for twenty-somethings who are not guests of the hotel, which means that guests get to ride in the elevator with drunk kids wearing nothing but wet swim suits, and there is never room for guests to enjoy the pool. Bottom line, I'm shocked that Starwood (we are very devoted members) allows this hotel to remain in their "Luxury Collection". While the property is lovely, we've received better service at hotels half the price of the Joule. If you want to stay downtown, you would do better at the Ritz Carlton or Hotel Zaza. If you are a loyal Starwood member, the W or even the Westin Galleria provides better service than the Joule.

I, like many others who've reviewed this hotel, am not a picky traveler. All I want is a decent room, where I can sleep comfortably, no frills. Here's what I got at Rodeway Inn: * Broken elevator that no one even made an attempt to fix during my 3 nights' stay there * Mysterious stains on the carpet in hallways and rooms * No temperature control in the room (you have to call the operator if you want your room cooled or heated) * Creepy neighbors who hang out in hallways and smoke pot even though smoking in the rooms is "strictly prohibited". * Key cards that only work once when you first get them. I actually had to run down 5 flights of stairs every time I wanted to get into my room to get a new key. I finally called downstairs for them to come up on the final day and the receptionist came huffing and puffing up to my room with a new key. Maybe that'll get the elevator working. * Mediocre breakfast, where they give you a choice of bagels or bagels and two kinds of cereal. Once the milk ran out, I had no idea where to find an attendant. * Never once did they offer to bring anything up to my room, replace it or reward me for being patient, I had to do all the work myself * Pretty nice shower though The management really doesn't give a damn about this dump and it shows. In a nice part of town though, so it's a shame.

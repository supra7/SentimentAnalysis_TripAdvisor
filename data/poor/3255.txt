I expect more from hotels like Encore which is highly rated. I was very very disappointed with our rooms because first of all....it's not a suite exactly even though the hotel advertised as a suite hotel. The room was slightly larger than regular hotel room but it is NOT a suite. Furthermore, my family stayed on 33rd floor but we can still hear music from the club downstairs. It is a bit ridiculous. When I called downstairs, there was no help at all. The people at the front desk pretty told us we are on our own. It was just so disappointing. I had good experience staying at Wynn but with this visit at Encore, I will not return...there are plenty of choices for hotels who value my family as customers.

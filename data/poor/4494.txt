Stayed at the Epic for a recent conference in Miami. A/C didn't work, and the plumbing sprung a leak so we had to move rooms. Staff had a severe attitude and was less than helpful. But most of all, one of the staff went through my wallet which I left in my room and made copies of all my credit and debit cards. What a nightmare to cancel all the accounts and put them on fraud watch, but not before they charged 4 times at the local Winn Dixie. I'm filing a police report and hope they catch the people involved. I won't be staying here again.

very bad service at the front desk. we so the hotel online in several sites and decided that it was for our budget for around 85$ per night and the reviews here were ok.We booked it by phone, we talked to the manager and ordered our rooms 2 month in advance, we just gave credit card number for safety, there was no down payment.When we came to check it, we were told the total for our stay, when we heard it we almost dropped from our feet, it was about 100 $ more than we were suppose to pay, we asked what has happen and apparently without asking me they naturally assumed i want the more expressive rooms which were about 40$ MORE than i was willing to pay.We talked to the receptionist tht was nice and gave us 10 $ discount, we were tiered after 7 hours of flight and oe more hour of train so we decided to stay for the night and the day after to ask for cheaper rooms or to leave.As we did with all hotels we payed cash up front for our stay, just in case all hotels are booked.the following morning we found out all 85$ rooms were booked and that we can't stay at that price, i checked the night before and found motor lodges that were willing to take us in for that price. So we wanted a refund, and Wow! magic! we can't get a refund, cause we payed cash up fron and the receptionist was not suppose to do that! only credit card could be refunded.To make the long story short, no matter how much we begged or threatened suing we didn't get our money back, the room is not so big and not worth the money i paid for, as i could get the same for 40$ less.It's a problem for me to sue as i'm not us citizen and wont do it remotely...If you can avoid paying this hotel and avoid paying cash, if u are not Americans, avoid this hotel, i have a scam feeling all around my story, i think they knew i wanted the cheaper rooms and booked the expansive ones on purpose, i think they had vacancy for cheaper rooms, but wanted my money and didn't want to give me the cheaper rooms, oi think they were willing to take cash up front even tough they are not allowed to cause they knew they could keep it.

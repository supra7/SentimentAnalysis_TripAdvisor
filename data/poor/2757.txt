The hotel looks quaint on the net and from the street, step inside however and it's hell. It smells of a combination of industrial strength disinfectant and urine. Along with the nursing home theme, the mattress has a plastic cover. The door to the room locked but the key would not withdraw. The air conditioner didn't work. The ceiling fan did but it wobbled at such a precarious angle I feared decapitation. The shared bathroom was more like an abandoned summer camp latrine than a place you would go to get clean. You would come out feeling dirtier than when you went in! The power points were behind a bookcase (that was near to collapsing) and the bed. You had to move the mattress to to plug in. The internet connection only worked in the lobby - apparently. It never worked in the few hours I was there, which made it hard to find another hotel, which is what I spent all my time doing. When I checked out they seemed shocked. "But you've just checked in!" I started to list the horrors but gave up and just said, "I'm not happy here."

Horrible Service My partner and I stayed in a suite, which wasn't the greatest, and the service was horrible. The people working at the front desk were mean and rude. I thought that it might just be one person who was having a bad day, but it was every person I came across. I didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary, just questions over the phone when I arrived, but they reacted like they really were inconvenienced if they helped me, so you know how that came across. The last straw was when I asked them to actually do something, which was to fix the fireplace, well they simply wouldn't. At that point I finally got upset over their service and confronted them on it, which is when they were apologetic and accomodating and immediately sent someone to fix the fireplace. So they knew they were in the wrong the whole time, but wasn't going to do anything about it until someone said something.As convenient as they are, I would rather stay somewhere further, than put up w/ them. I've never experienced anything like it before at any place I've stayed.

Enjoy being greeted by friendly staff upon arrival? We do, it sets the tone for the start of a getaway! After the hassles at the airport the last thing you want at your hotel is an unfriendly, rude front desk receptionist. That was "Vanessa" at the Encore! She was extremely unfriendly, didn't even look at me, and actually "sneered" at me. Be careful at Encore's nail salon; they'll "rob" you! You expect to pay more at a salon, but being charged $20 to removed "no-chip" polish is outrageous in addition to the $45 manicure and $85 pedicure! They don't tell you in advance about the extra charge. The cleaning lady was a gem, but watch out for Vanessa, with the "attitude" at the front desk if she's still around. Vanessa is a "force to be reckoned with!" Couldn't pay me to stay there again...for a new hotel they have lots to learn about customer service!

While the accomodations at Azul Fives - and the kids club - are outstanding, we had so many problems (which took too much effort on our part to resolve) that we switched resorts after the first night. Azul Fives is billed as being having so many great amenities for young kids - which is one big reason why we booked there. While some of this is true, it took us a hour to get a waiter's attention at dinner, were never asked for a drink order, had to beg for them to bring out bread or something for our 2 and 4 year olds to munch on and then they brought out entrees and appetizers in totally random order. With my 2 year old fed and ready for bed, I took him back to our room (before my entree was brought out), and figured I'd just call room service. Two hours and three phone calls later, my order arrived. Meanwhile, we had called because our air conditioning wasn't really cooling the suite properly. They sent someone out to fix it, and in the middle of the night, one of our rooms completely lost air. Again, it took hours and several phone calls to fix the problem. We were on a 10-day vacation, so after having all of these issues in the first 24 hours, we decided to move to Aventura Cove Palace. While it was nice, and the service was good, it was dated, rooms were small and it was not worth what we paid.

This hotel is in a terrific location -- 5 minutes to the Reading Market, across the street from the new Convention Center, and just a good central spot. Race Street at this section is a little sad, and the hotel is right next to a place that serves hungry people, nothing wrong with that! but a little depressing. Anyway, would have been okay but the room was as described in the headline there, one of the towels in the "clean" pile had a four-inch square rust-colored crust of blood? chocolate? UGH; and when I pulled back the bedspread to get in the sheets, they had multiple long and other hairs on them. The front desk guy first brought me 4 pillow cases; when I realized that, and returned, the front desk was empty for the next 15 minutes. Then he gave me a single sheet. I gave up, slept on that with a coat, was cold. The rooms have only a "window" to the interior hall/stairwell, with thin walls, it wasn't excessively loud since no one was next tome, but everytime anyone went to their room and talked, it was quite loud. The front desk day staff were great and helpful, but I absolutely cannot recommend it, it was only (with the AAA discount) 29 dollars less than the convention rate at the Hilton right next to the Reading Market, which was a VERY nice hotel.

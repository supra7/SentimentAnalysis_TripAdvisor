I normally stay at a specific business hotel in Chicago, but, due to conventions in town, I had no choice but the Blake ($450/night!). For that price, my expections were not met. Problems encountered incuded: 1. Grime on window frames discovered (on hands) when I had to shut a window that had been left open. Other areas in the room (e.g., closet) were also not clean. 2. Wireless internet connection did not work. When I called the "877" number for tech support as indicated, I was told that the tech support service no longer has a service contract with the hotel. I used the ethernet connection on the modem, which was on the nightstand - not the desk! 3. While signs in the elevators noted that breakfast was served in the restaurant associated with the hotel, it was, in fact, not open for breakfast. 4. Room was on second floor overlooking alley behind the hotel. Garbage service and deliveries late at night and early in the morning were quite noisy. 5. For a property that has been open for about a year, there appearred to be general maintenance issues. For example, the curtain hangers were loose; base moldings were broken and crown moldings had separated. 6. When I checked out, I asked for a check-out statement. I was told that, since I had no incidental charges (room was booked and paid for through hotels.com), such a statement was not available. Based upon the issues noted above, the Blake will be near the bottom, if not off the list, of my choice of hotels in Chicago.

I recently booked some clients in July 09. I picked them up at the airport and took them to the Grand Resort. When I checked them in I was hit with a $30.00 per person! per Day! fee that they refused to take off. This was not on the reservation and I had to fork up the money at check out. I picked this hotel because of the location to my business. we had no intenion of going on the waterslide. they told me that this fee is for passes to the waterslide. I advised them that we would not be using it and they rudely refused to take it off the bill. Watch out if you book this resort on Hotels.com or similar services, this fee does not show up on the booking price!

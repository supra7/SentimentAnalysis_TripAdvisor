The room was nice. Beds were too soft for me, but that's a personal preference. When my wife was looking over our bank statements, she noticed that they had charged $40 for a $3 hairbrush at the gift shop and also added charges for services we did not use. When we talked to them about it, we were ignored. Nice view of the beach though. But when a business like the Hilton tries to "steal" from their customers, they at least deserve the lowest rating, and probably an investigation.

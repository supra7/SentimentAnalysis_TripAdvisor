We had to pay a $25 a day resort fee to stay at a resort. You have to pay from $120 to $230 for umbrellas or any shade at the pool - that doesn't make sense. Room service sent us a bug in our salade, a brownie that was hard as a rock and under cooked chicken, and these are well reknowned chefs? No one called to see if we were alright. Both the children and adults became sick from the food. We had to eat at the shops next door every day. No one knows how to smile so the customer service was really sad and the food is bad. The only ones who showed they cared was the house keeping staff, dept manager and director. We informed the manager on duty the evening we were leaving (2/4/12) and showed him the four at the front desk that were not smiling, yet they all had someone with them. NEVER AGAIN. They nickle and dime you so bad, will not go back.

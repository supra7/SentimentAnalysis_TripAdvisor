This place is disgusting! We had a 2 night reservation made through expedia. We waited in line for over 30 minutes to check in. We got to our room and were grossed out by the mold in the bathroom, very rusty towel rack, hair on bathroom floor, and alot of dirt buildup in the bathroom. The internet wasn't working, the door handle for the sliding door going out onto the balcony was barely hanging on, literally with a single screw. The mattress pad was very small, like a twin size and the sheets were rough, We checked out within a couple of hours of checking in and after many phone calls and arguing with Expedia and the Manager, we were given a refund. Stay away! This place is so gross!

We booked this through Priceline, and when we arrived, we had to pay $40 to "upgrade" to 2 double beds. We ended up paying the going rate - no discount/benfit for using Priceline! The room was tiny (barely enough room to walk around the beds), and depressing (no pictures/decor). There was a flatscreen t.v. hung on a bare wall at the base of the two beds (no room for a dresser/table). The bathroom appeared to not have been cleaned - private hairs in the shower, on the floor and toilet! DISGUSTING! By the time we discovered this it was nearly 11pm. We just got in bed and prayed we wouldn'lt end up with bed bugs! Checked out first thing in the morning and informed the front desk. Said they'd let the manager know. NEVER AGAIN will I use Priceline for fear of ending up with this hotel again! Th

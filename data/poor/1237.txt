Check in is @ 3:00 but we were not able to get into our room until several hours later. When we arrived, the staff was not ready. The front desk manager and the owner lost all respect from us. The front desk manager even made a comment that was totally out of line. He said, "We get what we pay for". The owner sat in the lobby for the majority of the time and refused to admit that he was the owner but he would contact someone to assist us. The staff were still bringing in pillows, irons and ironing boards. They were still setting up rooms. We even found a bucket of paint in the hallway. We reserved a 3 room suite but ended up getting a suite with 3 full size beds. Honestly, it wasn't even a suite. It was a regular double bed room and a third bed was added to accomodate all of us. The hot and cold were mixed up on the shower so we were burned several times. There is no room service, bar or swimming pool on site. The hotel parking lot across the street. It was $14 a day but we weren't able to park there because it was at capacity. The lot is small so we ended up parking in a garage located behind the hotel for half the price. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they are looking for a place just to lay their head.

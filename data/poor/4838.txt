For the price go somewhere else. The pictures on the internet are cleaner than the rooms. The beds are hard, queen beds are really double beds. I found long black hairs in the sheets. Also, the rooms stink like a mix of perfume, incense & food. I felt like I needed a shower after being in the room for five minutes. I won't even talk about the breakfast they offer!!!! So I left and went to the Waterfront Marriott and it was great there especially clean!!!!! Only positive I have to say is the location is excellent.

As my boyfriend and I are sitting in the hallway after a full day of kayaking... He finally exclaimed that this is the worst hotel experience ever. I agree. This was my bday present to him as well so I feel really bad. I am writing this review while laying in bed at 11 pm at night on the 7th floor that feels like I am in the middle of a club from the pool party downstairs. Why were we in the hallway at 10:30pm? The cleaning lady didn't clean our room. Also our first night upon arrival... No glasses or cups in the room. First time ever this has happened. At breakfast, there was not a hostess and we sat ourselves waiting for five minutes. We left. This is a shame bc the hotel is part of a luxury hotel collection... We stayed at ojai resort last week which is the same group and we left exclaiming how wonderful the service was. I got this hotel on a travelzoo deal and at half the price, it was not worth it. If i paid the full $200+/night deal... I would even be more livid. This experience is pretty horrible and a waste of a weekend...and especially a special one at that. Pls stay away as far away as you can.

Well, let me start with the online pictures do not represent the interior of the hotel! The carpets were stained in the halls and rooms, our room had nails sticking out of the closet and my girl friend cut her self on it, we informed the desk and they said "oh". The bathroom door had fecal matter on it, the tub was dirty and had soap scum growing on it. There was construction going on out side and every car that went over those steel plates making a horrible boom sounded like it was right in our room. The walls are non-existent, you hear everyone and everything imaginable. Oh yeah, for breakfast we paid nearly 30 bucks for 3 bowls of cereal and toast, nothing else. We will NEVER RETURN again! It was extremely frustrating that we informed the front desk of our problems and they still had not a care in the world about them. NOT AS ADVERTISED - if it was remodeled in 02, must have been 1902!

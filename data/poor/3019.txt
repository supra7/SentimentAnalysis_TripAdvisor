I can't believe this Hotel qualifed for a 3 1/2 star rating on Priceline, yet brand new Marriots and Sheratons go in the 4 catagory. This Hotel should be 2. Very old, very noisey, unbelievably small, the bathroom is pretty bad, so small, the shower stall is ancient. I walked in, and walked out over to the Sheraton. Too bad I can't get my money back from Priceline, but that didn't stop me from leaving, I wouldn't stay a night let alone 5 nights in this Hotel.

Do not stay there! I was harassed by the night gourd, he came to my room 2 in one night trying to ask me out and as a small girl traveling alone I was afraid to go to sleep! The heater in the room was behind the curtains, major fire hazard!! The rooms were dirty and smelly, I slept in an overall with my socks tucked in! Did not want to touch the sheets! I'm just glad that the ferries weren't working so I only had to stay one night instead of the tow! Bottom line DO NOT GO THERE. I booked thorough hotels.com and e-mailed them to tell them about my experience and they did not give a sh** and the hotel is still listed on there site so I'd say DONT TRUST hotels.com!

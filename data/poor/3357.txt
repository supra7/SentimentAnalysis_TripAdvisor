I have stayed in many hotels and this is my first review ever written. I feel compelled to dissuade anyone from staying here. My family stayed here for 2 nights and that was too many nights for us. The smell of mildew in the room was interesting. The AC did not cool the room. There was mildew on the ceilings in the room and in the bathroom. There was rust on portions of any metal in the room. The carpet was torn and worn and old. Wallpaper falling off the wall. The pull-out couch was disgusting. Frankly, we were afraid of sleeping at night for fear of bed bugs. My husband checked all of the beds for bed bugs and we kept our luggages zipped shut. We plan to leave the luggages in our unattached garage when we get home. Hopefully we didn't take any "souvenirs" home with us from this hotel. Our family even wore our flip flops in the shower. This hotel has to be completely redone from top to bottom. Throw all furniture out., rip up carpets, paint, get a new AC overhaul. Maybe if your drunk and here to drink, you won't notice the uncleanliness. This I believe was the reason there are 4 and 5 stars from the above reviews. But any person of sound mind would not stay here. Normally I would have walked out after seeing the room, but a friend sent us here as a gift. We did not want to offend. But it was disgusting. My teen and I stayed up most of the night because we worried about possible bed bugs.and we slept full clothed to cover us completely. Kitchen? What kitchen? I guess it is technically a kitchen. Do your self a favor, go some place else. I can't believe that anyone would pay $269 a night to stay here or even $100 a night!

1 My check-in process was botched 2 My room, a jr suite at almost 500 a night, looked directly at a parking garage. No "city view" at all. No view at all period! 3 The bar staff on the first floor were rude and uninterested and told me that no restaurant in the hotel was serving food (it was 11pm). After going to my room to Google where in Miami I could get food at 11pm, I was directed to the sushi restaurant...inside the Epic. Sure enough they were still serving. Back down I went. And by the way, I had a great meal and great service. 4 The plug in my bathroom didn't work 5 The jets in my tub would turn on randomly.... while I was not in the tub 6 Did I mention how incredibly intolerable my view was????

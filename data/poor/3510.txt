First of all the pictures on the hotel main page are deceiving - they make it look like a nice, clean little boutique hotel. The hotel lobby was cute - which is why the pictures online mostly feature the little bar in the lobby. But as soon as you go down the dimly lit hallway with it's crusty dark carpeting and dark blue painted walls you start to realize you're not quite getting what you paid for here. After lugging my bags up two additional flights of stairs I see a community bathroom at the entrance to the hallway and realize ... holy moly ... I'm in a hostel. Now I have no problem with hostels, I've traveled all over Australia and Thailand and stayed in hostels the whole way. What I DO have a problem with is "hostels" that masquerade themselves as "hotels" and charge over $400 per night on the weekend! The rooms were brown, with cheap beds that felt like they had a plastic sheet on them. We were fortunate enough to book a room with a bathroom and it was so small it was almost impossible to move in ... and then came the bed bugs. Two of our friends found bugs, both had bites and one of them is currently having his room at home fumagated by an exterminator. We talked to some people in NYC who have had experiences with bed bugs and they said "It's like an STD for your apartment... it's almost impossible to get rid of them once they get into your stuff" ... pretty creepy. Now, I feel bad because the guy at the front desk was reasonable about the incident and comped the room. He acknowledged the problem and said they were dealing with it. I'm sorry guys - I stayed at the Hilton Millenium downtown for $269 a night earlier this year and it was heaven compared to this place - and cheaper. If you're a hostel you should advertise and maintain hostel rates - if you're a hotel then you should bring your establishment up to code. Sorry guys - but never, ever again.

My fiancee and I were going to a Sunday afternoon baseball game and we decided to head down to Baltimore the day before and make a day of it. We looked at hotels and we decided to go with the Hilton. The website looked great and c'mon, it was the Hilton! Well when we got there our room was not ready. So we waited a while and asked for the key to the pool as we were waiting. An hour and a half later, still no call that our room was ready. So we headed back to the front desk to see what was going on. The lady at the desk informed us that our room was not ready and she did not know when it would be ready. I said I would like to speak to the manager and she replied "I am the manager and i am telling you the room is not ready." As a manager also, I could never speak to my customers that way! I asked why couldn't they just send someone to clean the room so we could get in. She just kept saying they are working on it. She never made eye contact and not once did we receive an apology from anyone about our situation. We were to have a room with a view of the harbor, and we got put into a room where we saw the back side of the baseball stadium. I could not believe how every acted as though there was no emergency in getting a room cleaned for us and no apologies at all. I expected better from a Hilton. We will not return to this Hilton again.

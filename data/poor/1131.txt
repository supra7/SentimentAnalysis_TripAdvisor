My company booked me in at this hotel. O stayed for four nights in November 2011. This is of course a budget hotel (though my company paid over 100/night) and as such I was expecting clean-no frill bed and bath. I got the bed and the bath and I am afraid that's where it stops. 1st room has window into the side street through which all buses out of Euston station routed themselves. Talk about noise. I went straight back to the reception and they changed my room, this time quite and ok. Toilet seat was broken which I asked them to fix the next morning. Came back to the hotel 10:00 in the evening to fid that it was not fixed. I went back to the reception to ask why and the manageress began to argue that we have reported it and its really not up to us when the engineer will come to fix the seat. I protested that as paying guest I would expect more effort and her solution was to change my room (3rd room). The new room looked no better but hey I had given up by then. Got into the shower and in less than a minuet water was up to my ankle with the blockage in the shower basin. Back to reception and her solution, you guessed it, to change my room (4th room). Needless to say, all changes managed by myself, carrying cloths on hangers up and down the floors and through the corridors with no offer of help. The 4th room was the worth of them all. So much as that I suggest if you stay at this place you do not complain about anything. 1/5 of the duvet was out of the cover as the cover was to small. Duvet looked old and dirty. Mattress should have been replaced months ago. Bathroom could do with a complete revamp. Carpets were dirty in the corners. I am tired now. Avoid like plague.

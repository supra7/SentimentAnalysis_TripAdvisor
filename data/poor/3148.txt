Stay away from this hotel; Tourist trap. Date: Oct 21-Oct27,2006.Arrived at the hotel after being recommended this great place. Was shown into a room that was 6'x10'. Outside window opened into an external staircase connecting various floors. Only source of ventilation was a fan. After complaining loudly, was moved to a better room 12'x12'. Air con was probably from early 80s'. Windows seem never to have been cleaned. Tiles badly mismatched and toilet was in bad condition.Had no choice but to stick it out due to no other hotels being available due to conference taking place.If this is not much, you can hear what happens in the next bathroom and room. There is also a room to quote another fellow traveller - shower comes on for 2 mins only at a time.Staff is not at all friendly or helpful. Not impressed with my experience and do not recommended it.

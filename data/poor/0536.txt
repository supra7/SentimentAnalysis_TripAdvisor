This is by far the worse hotel I've ever stayed in. We booked a park and ride because our flight left a 5:30 AM, and we live an hour away. Didn't want to wake up too early, but I rather stay up all night than to sleep in that hole. The place is a filthy mess. We really did not expect much, but this was as bad as it gets. The sheets had stains on them, the bath was full of hair from the previous customer and the place smelled terrible. The only thing good was that we got out of there at 3:30 AM, so we didn't have to see the place in the daylight.

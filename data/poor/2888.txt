Stayed at the W on business because it was convenient to our morning meeting. Great location. Terrible hotel. The room was worn, noisy, and appeared to have been decorated by a color blind 10 year old. I do not find anything edgy or trendy in broken lampshades, dirty floors, or noisy rooms. The heating did not appear to be adjustable. One of my business associates who stayed a few floors below, ended up taking the cushions off of his sofa and placing them in the bathroom to sleep, the noise was truly unbearable. The restaraunt downstairs is very good, but the rooms upstairs are ready for refreshing.

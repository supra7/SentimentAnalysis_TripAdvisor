I booked this for the stay and park (one night stay and park your vehicle while you fly somewhere on vacation) We were flying to Hawaii for a week. First thing, this hotel is so hard to get to and then when we walked in the lobby we were hit with this horrible stench. She said their sewer had backed up, but that the rooms didn't smell bad. They did, but not as bad as the lobby. She told us where to park our car the next morning and we were off to eat. Had a terrible time getting someplace to eat and finding our way back to the hotel. Then slept in a tiny room. Skip the free breakfast. The scrambled eggs were actually slimy. Then we got chewed out by Oliver (the manager, strange guy) because we parked in the wrong place. I guess the clerk the night before didn't know what she was talking about. The shuttle service is a joke. When we got back to Dallas no one was there and I called three times and an hour and a half later finally some weird shuttle arrived. I will never ever stay there again.

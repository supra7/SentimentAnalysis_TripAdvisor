I dont know how these people sleep at night!!! This hotel takes advantage of the fact that loved ones are ill and you want to be close. I have just returned home from this hell hole, and never write reviews but I feel compelled to do so at this time. This hotel is filthy, the carpet was not vacuumed the linens are stained and grey, finger prints all over the mirrors that had not been cleaned off, doors do not work well had my card keyed several times. They charge $ 145.00 a night and that is the hospital rate I believe the regular rate is $ 179.00 a night. This hotel is gross at best. This place is not worth $ 30.00 a night. Go to the Hilton or Sheraton . The Hilton is really nice and less money. Unbelievable.

We stayed at the Westin on Maui for some 5 days in early December, 2010 after a week on the big island. Maui is much more into the tourist trade, but staying at this resort was a big mistake!! The first thing they did was to hit us with a $25 per day "resort" fee which my travel agent neglected to warn about and which I also missed, sad to say. Then we signed up for their luau at something over $200. What a waste of money!! The performers were a bunch of amateurs jumping around on in an attempt to impress us with natives ability to leap high into the air, apparently and the meal we paid good money for was almost inedible. We had 8 people at our table and the only one who could eat at least a small portion of the goop was myself. The others went without. Everyone was waiting for the dessert. That would be edible, right? Wrong. The dessert was the same. Luckily we had a bag of potato chips in the room. My advice is to go avoid this resort and go somewhere else. A major disappointment.

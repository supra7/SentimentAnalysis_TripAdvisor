CSI wasn't done yet? Our room had stab marks/stains in drywall and a blood stain on the carpet where someone had been stabbed. Couldn't they have cleaned up? Perhaps some spackle over the knife stab holes? Very noisy garbage trucks driving by in the morning was frustrating. Patio and main door locks substandard. Good thing it was just one night! Staff acted like they wished they were somewhere else. After one night, so did we.

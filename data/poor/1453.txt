I booked this hotel for my inlaws to have a weekend away. Unfortunately, there was an electrical storm in sydney and my inlaws could not make it there at all as their flights were cancelled. I called to see if they could offer a voucher for another time that i could organise flights again. However, i was told that they could not do such. It is terribly disappointing as I felt that the hotel could be more understanding of the situation.

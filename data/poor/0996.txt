I had a reservation and arrived right on time. I was told that there was no room left and I had to pay much more for - as I was told - a bigger room. What looked cheap became much more expensive. After complaining nobody was responsible, the boss had just left and the man at the reception got very aggressive. The room was dirty and noisy. Only breakfast was OK.

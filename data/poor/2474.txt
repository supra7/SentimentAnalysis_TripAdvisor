I checked into the hotel ready and excited. I thought that being a Starwood Perfered member I would have recieved better service. But I was wrong about the service. The service at the restaurant for breakfast was less than perfect. For example, I waited about 20 minutes for the waiter to bring the bill for my meal. When I finally recieved the bill it was the wrong bill. But the food was good, not great but good. When I returned to my room after breakfast I notice that the room had been cleaned, at least on the surface. I looked in the bathroom and saw that the bathtub was still dirty and the bottles of shampoo had not been replaced, in fact the house keeping had spilled some shampoo in the tub. This happened several time during my one week stay. Some of the staff was quite helpful. But the front desk staff were not as helpful. I had to ask the front desk about three or four time to change rooms because of noise outside of the room. When I changed rooms the hotel said it would be a $200 charge to change rooms. If it location you are looking for the you have found your place to stay. The pools were not bad, but just not very clean. There were many time when I had to ask a pool staff to pickup empty glasses and plates. Many rules in the pool area were not enforced. For example, childern under the age of 16 are not allowed in the hot tub. I saw many young childern in the hot tub. The day I was leaving I ask about four time for a late check out. On the fourth time I finally recieved a answer. The hotel wanted to charge me $200 if I checked out after 2pm, it was not even a busy time for the hotel. So I had to leave the hotel early and stay four plus hours in the airport. Needless to say I would not stay in the hotel again, not even on a bet.

This hotel was not at all what I expected. First of all the room keys became de-magnetized very easily, so each of us had to get new keys four different times. The walls in the rooms were very thin, so you could hear your neighbors very easily. Also, we could hear our upstairs neighbors whenever they walked around. I bought some ear plugs so that I could make it through my second night's stay. The beds were small and the mattresses slanted in towards the middle. The exterior and interior of the hotel looked old and not well cared for. The one nice thing was the free parking, but it didn't make up for a horrible night sleep. Comparable to staying at a Red Roof Inn, or some other 1 star motel. We stayed at a Candlewood suites hotel the night before, just a 2 star hotel, and it was so much better.

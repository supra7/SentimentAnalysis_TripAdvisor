We stayed for one week in October 2003. I was apprehensive after having read such mixed reviews, but since we were traveling with my in-laws we chose a lower budget hotel to keep costs down. When we arrived they gave us rooms in the back building facing a browning and patchy lawn. The room was dark and so depressing that we decided to upgrade to the partial ocean view - so much for a budget choice! Unfortunately, turned out the partial ocean view also included more than a partial view of the parking lot for one room. The reviews were right on - the place felt old and unkept, the paint was peeling, the linen old and dated, and although the lawns were mowed, the plants were overgrown and in desperate need of weeding. There was nothing within walking distance, the beach was not only too small and close to the road to be considered remote or private, but it was muddy and windy . The service was just ok, the rooms were cleaned ok, but bottom line - I had a pit in my stomach knowing that I could have chosen something better for my in laws for the priced we ended up paying.

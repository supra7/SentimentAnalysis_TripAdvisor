I was excited about staying here and imagine my surprise to discover how incredibly poor the hotel is in every respect. Customer service is laughable. The employees must hate their jobs here. They are rude and arrogant and unwilling to help. The smallest request is met with rudeness, arrogance and indifference. The hotel was probably great in its day, but now is old , dated and a run down. The rooms are stale, lifeless and musty. The hotel will nickel and dime you to death, their motto is soak the tourist. The wedding and catering department are mean and impossible to reach. Don't get married here!!!!! We did, and are very sorry we chose this hotle for our wedding. Avoid, avoid avoid. Go to a great hotel like the Four Seasons or Hale Kelani instead. Avoid getting robbed and having a disappointing vacation or wedding. This place needs to start providing a great experience again and quit resting on it's laurels and relying on the Waldorf-Astoria name.

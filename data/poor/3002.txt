We had no hot water, the TV was broken, the carpet has never (EVER) been cleaned. The Excercise room consisted of 3 machines, of which one was working. There was nowhere to get coffee before 7am. The manager: ANGELA HENTZ is the rudest person I have ever met. I would not go near this place with a ten foot pole. We were charged for a night that we did not even stay there and had to have our credit card company fight for our money back. Do yourself a favor and go to the Westin down the street, they have an amazing staff and a wonderful hotel.

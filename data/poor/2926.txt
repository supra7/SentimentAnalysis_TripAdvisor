I've stayed at W's all over the world. The service is always impeccable, but the W New York is horrible. The concierge assure us he set up our reservations for us at a restaurant , when we arrived there was no reservation, on 3 separate occasions we never received a wakeup call. Our room was so small that a full sized bed only had a 18 inches from the end of the bed to the wall. The shower was clogged, we called on 3 separate occasions to have it fixed and no one even attempted to fix it. We complained to management twice, only to have them tell us that the hotel was full and that the wasnt much they could do. DO NOT STAY at the W New York , all the other Ws in the city are great.

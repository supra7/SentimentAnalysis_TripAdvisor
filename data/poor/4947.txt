Nice lobby & helpful concierge. Nice pool shared by 12 rooms which made it pretty private. Too bad the suite was filthy and shabby and in desparate need of an overhaul. Carpeting and upholstery stained, tubs/showers dirty, air conditioning blew directly onto our beds which felt like we were sleeping in front of a window unit. The floors were so dirty, the bottom of our feet were black from walking barefoot. Even though we booked a year in advance, we couldn't get one of the nicer rooms in the main building. The other rooms are in separate buildings which are accessed by alley ways. A little scarey late at night.

I had the displeaure of staying 7 nights at this location for an event I was attending with one of my teen children. The Elevators are the slowest I have ever experienced and the maids and hotel staff kept tieing them up. the room keys constantly had to be rekeyed - I was on a high floor so it was a real pain to find this out after I wass on the high floor and the elevator was gone. Rooms are SMALL, SMALL!!!!. Housekeeping staff English was terrible and in some cases none. Had to call for a Bath mat almost every day and face and hand towels everyday. Why leave 3 bath towels and one hand towel???? The cups were never replaced in the rooms. Door would stick where I had to use all my body weight to get in the room. I don't mind buget hotels but this room for the price is not worth it. I won't be back to this locaiton

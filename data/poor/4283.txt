We had a confirmed reservation with Harrah's in Aug '09. To make a long story short, Harrah's was not accepting our reservation at check-in. We were stranded in Vegas, 2,000 miles from home and after HOURS of trying to get into a room to relax and start our vacation I called the MIRAGE across the street and they got us in. Within 10 minutes we were poolside and spending our money at MIRAGE. I should have known better not to stray from a hotel as nice as the MIRAGE...we even tacked on one more night there.

This hotel is totally at the end of the Strip and the rooms are large but very old! Service is really poor. Roomservice however is ok, but other restaurants are either under construction or very poor. Staff is unfriendly and I had to wait 30 minutes to check in. Although the rooms are cheap, next time I will stay at a hotel more on the Strip.

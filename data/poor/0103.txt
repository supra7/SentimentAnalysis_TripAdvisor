We booked 2 rooms for 1 night Dec 29-30, 2008 for a shopping trip and forced to pay $30 plus tax for valet parking. Our luggage was unloaded through the trunk of my SUV and all was fine with the trunk door. We decided not to take the car out again and to walk everywhere. When we left on Dec 30th, the valet got our car and to our amazement, the trunk door was broken. The trunk could not be opened by key or pull release and the handle was broken. Clearly it had been tampered with while in the parkade possibly an attempted break and enter. After 7 days on the phone with my insurance company and the hotel's, I am now out $300 deductible to fix this on my own plus the inconvenience. BEWARE, do not stay at this hotel and do not park your car with them as they will not accept responsibility. Just because they valet your car doesn't mean it will be safe. We received no compensation for our bad experience. BEWARE, stay here and take your chances!

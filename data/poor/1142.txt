Apart from its location plus the polite and friendly staff the stay at this property was terrible. The room was minute, noisy, with a broken air conditioning unit and a window that did not open. (forcing us to move another room at 11.00 p.m.) It was hugely overpriced at 90.70 for a one night stay and this included a pitiful breakfast of last years cardboard croissants and a sad array of cereal. Bad decision and unless you are desperate don't do it!!

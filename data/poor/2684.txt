Before I write a negative review, I want to say that this is a great location if you want to hear music on Frenchmen Street. Also, the price is extremely reasonable. We stayed here for one night; (we had reservations elsewhere for the rest of our trip. ) I really am not that hard to please, but I thought the room was horrible. Because everything was so old (NOT with antiques) it didn't look very clean, just extremely shabby. Also, the mattress was terrible--it sloped so that we both ended up in the middle of it. The front door to our room didn't work; we notified the office personnel and it was going to be fixed. When we returned, the door was wide open with all our belongings available to whoever would want them. We would never stay here again. However, a single male friend who was traveling with us stayed there for the week. He didn't mind it. (He is used to doing a lot of camping in the wilderness and going to festivals where he is in ankle deep mud.) What he enjoyed were the free bottles of water, coffee, and fruit available all day long. They also serve brandy in the late afternoon. He WOULD stay there again.

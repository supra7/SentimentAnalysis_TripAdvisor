I stayed at the Palmer House in August of 2005 for a Labor convention. I was impressed by the locations and excellent service so I decided to return for the 4th of July weekend this year (2009). I checked in Friday, early (noon) after paying an additional fee ($25). I was there with my son and family total 3 in the room. We were all on the reservation. Upon arrival in the room found only two bath towels, one soap and one shampoo. It took multiple calls to housekeeping to get additional towels, soap and shampoo. They gave us a total of three each. Problem was that that was it! Stayed 3 nights and got no additional soap or shampoo, nor towels. This is not an economy hotel. Complained to front desk and was told that all hotels are cutting back in the area. Stayed at the Sheridan just weeks earlier and got excellent service. Very disappointed. Will not return. Additionally, peeling wall paper and paint.

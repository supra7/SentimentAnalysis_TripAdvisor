Lowlights of this hotel 1) excessive wait to use the elevator (they only hold about 4 people) so there where usually line ups to go up 2) heater was stuck on, even after maintenance came by to "fix", made for a brutal time trying to sleep 3) long wait when calling front desk staff from your room 4) rooms so small that you can imagine what staying in a closet feels like 5) charged me for mini-bar items that I didn't use (had to call for a credit) Highlights 1) good bar and lobby 2) decent fitness area Bottom Line: too expensive and too small, stay elsewhere.

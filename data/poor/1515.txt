We stayed in the Comfort Suites near the intersection of Hwy 75 (Central Expressway) and 635 (LBJ) for about a week in early September 2008. Toward the end of our stay, we returned to our locked room only to find my husband's briefcase with his computer, credit cards, medical insurance cards, etc. stolen. I lost a large backpack that was full of my genealogy research, several software programs, various books and other items. A police report was filed and an insurance form provided by the hotel was submitted to the manager. We have heard nothing from the hotel or the insurance company since. Later, after contacting the manager, the owner, and the parent company separately, we received no response or communication regarding the insurance or loss. It has been over a month ago, with no reponse at all. The hotel room itself was adequate, with a fairly comfortable bed, but a totally worn out couch and chair with broken springs. We will never stay there again! Beware!

Don't do what I did....stay here with my family because it was the best price I could find. At 2am, with other occupants of the hotel screaming, drunk and in a terrible fight, I would have paid the $50 more, or $100, to NOT have been there. We got little sleep and had to call front desk to come and handle the people fighting right outside our door. I didn't really care that much that the room was run down and dirty. It was exposing my kids to what felt like a truly unsafe situation that caused my regret. This hotel is definitely the home to drug deals, prostitution, and all night hollering and brawls. I've never written a review before but I feel strongly about trying to help you avoid what we went through. When we checked in, there was a very unhappy looking couple checking out. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never checked in. Just suck it up and stay at the Paramount. You'll be glad you did.

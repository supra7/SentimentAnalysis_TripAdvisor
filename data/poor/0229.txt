In order to maintain my Hilton HHonors status I stayed as many weeks as I could stand before I just became too fed up. The building is old and outdated, the parking garage is a pain, the workout room a joke, service is lacking, staff are unskilled in their jobs, and nobody really seems to care. For example parking seemed to be handled differently every time I checked in, with the result that nearly every time I left the garage I had to go through the process of explaining that I was staying at the hotel and wait for someone to figure out if I had paid for parking. Billing errors occurred more than once, including a charge that showed up a week after I checked out. The most galling however was the total disinterest in making a frequent customer happy  the rooms I was given included some needing repair, some with spectacular views of a wall and puddles on a roof, two with barely functioning air conditioners, and a room designed for handicapped access that can best be described as barely functional  and they never gave me a room on, or access to, the executive floor. There are many fine hotels in Seattle, and this isnt one of them.

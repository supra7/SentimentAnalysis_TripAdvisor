Arrived at the hotel at 330 pm, which was 24 hours after leaving my home in Melbourne Australia. Was told I couldn't check in because the system was down. 3 hours later was able to check in, but couldn't get into my room because the access card was coded invorrectly. Had to go back down to reception to be recoded. When I got into the room the hot water wasn't working....grh.... Other problems were the WiFi constantly went down, couldn't make calls from my room because the phone was broken - sat,yed for 4 days but was never fixed. Called down to Valet to organize for car to be brought out, but no one was there...WTF. no doubt I had a combination of bad luck, but with so many other hotels on offer I suggest best to chose another one.

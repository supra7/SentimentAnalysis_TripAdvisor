This hotel is dirty and stinky. I believe a few of these reviews are fake to boost business so read further down the reviews. The internet constantly doesn't work and the staff always lies claiming it's temporary. Past reviews show the internet being screwed up since 2008 when guests were using the Super 8's wifi until the Super 8 password protected it. Last month the front desk was giving out the Super 8's password until it got changed. As bad as this is the train in the middle of the night. As by law, the train has to blow it horn before crossing Regal Row Rd and during crossing it. It happens 2 times in the middle of each night. Save yourself the bad experience and grief.

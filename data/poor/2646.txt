Booked this 5 months ago only to be found we were placed in a terrible room. Returned from a walk around town on first evening to find an infestation of flying termites. Had to complain hard to be moved to another hotel. Was told this was the second infestation in the last couple of days. Room had a terrible musty smell. Beware!

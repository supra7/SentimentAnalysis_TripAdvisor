I was very disappointed with this hotel. The reception staff are highly inefficient, one of them was exceptionally rude to us on arrival (after an overnight flight). Room service is slow or at the worst does not turn up; the breakfast is poor; the swimming pool does not really get the sun; housekeeping do not respond to requests; and we had to remind the chambermaids to bring up two towels instead of one (so very basic things). There are MUCH better hotels than this. Something is going wrong with the management of this hotel. Do not stay here.

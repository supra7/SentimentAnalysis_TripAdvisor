I planned to stay here out of desparation, as my original plans changed. I had no luck getting lodging nearby for the night and had a reservation here the following night. I decided to try this place. At 9:30 am, I was told I could check in now if I liked. My baggage was at the hotel I had stayed the night before. I was charged up front for two nights before even going to the room! I headed back to where I stayed the night before and checked on one more place (a nice major chain) they had a room for only $30 more. I returned to this place and told my change of plans. I was told I would not get a refund for the night as I had already checked in and it had been more than 30 mins. My reasons were: very small room, very outdated and worn furnishings, overwhelming smell of cleaning solution and portable space heaters! They would not listen and insisted I had checked in (I guess according to there computers). The offered me another room. When I went to that one, there was plaster chipping and falling off the wall at baseboard level. I decided it was not in my best interest to stay and they refunded the next night, which was $20 chaeper than the current night. The time lapsed from my charge and credit was 37mins/40 secs. I most likely spent 7 mins or so trying to get a refund and checking out the other disgusting room. The condition of this place should warrant $50 rooms. There are numerous affordable (some even cheaper)rooms nearby but they were not available. I guess this would explain why there were so many "Ready" rooms at 9:30 on a Saturday morning. Never pay up front and price is not everything!

I'm a physician who took some time off to visit LV to get people registered to vote. I booked a "premium" room and checked the King bed" request. Check out is 12 noon, check in is 3 pm. Arrived @ 5:30 pm (2.5 hours after check in) and they told me it was not ready. They did have a room with 2 smaller beds(queens) but not what I asked for. When I asked why almost 3 hours after the check in time, my room was not ready, the supervisor and the check in person looked quite puzzled and bothered as if my request was outragious. They were unwilling to call housekeeping to see if a room with a queen was ready, but just not in the system. They could not give me a break for a larger room, and quite honestly had no idea what the term Recovery meant. When I accepted the room and told them I would likly never book with them again, they just stared at me with a smirk and never apologized. Do they know we are in a recession and they cannot afford to lose any customers?? The superior room looked like something out of a bad airport motel 6. There was nothing Superior about this room or this Hotel. Don't waste your time on this hotel, there is much better out there.

My debit card was charged over 10 times for 1 room! caused a hold to be placed on my card, had to cancel my debit card and order a new one! im all the way in miami from SC and im worrying if i will be able to get my spending money out of my account! luckily i was able to. I paid the hotel in cash at this point...i was put in a room with 2 beds instead of the 1 king size which is what i booked months prior to arriving. my shower water was cold 3 of the 4 nights! we ran out of tissue paper 1 night. wash clothes were not replaced daily, we had to request them @ the front desk! They charge $28/ day for valet parking, i paid $112 to the valet service in the motor lobby and @ check out they tried to charge me for an additional 2 days for valet. I had a $0 balance @ check out...they actually owed me $1 back. They didnt have $1 at the particular check out drawer i was @, and the employee had the nerve to tell me to just tip them the $1, after all of the problems they caused with my bank and overdrafting my account, and a cold shower for our entire stay! one week after my arrival back home to SC...they charged me once again for $700!! causing most of my paycheck to be drafted out of my account! not to mention it was the 1st of the month, my rent is due, cell phone, and car insurance and i have no paycheck thanks to the hilton!! the only thing i was pleased about during my stay was the view and the beds were comfy...i personally wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone, even after all of the troubles they created for me...they made me feel as if i was an inconvience to them! not very helpful @ all. i was not the only one to have the same issues, i meet several people there for the same event that had the same issues...more than 35 people were charged more than once for one room! not to mention the 3 false fire drill alarms that caused people to run down 17 flights of stairs...there was an announcement 40 minutes later saying that it was only a drill!!!

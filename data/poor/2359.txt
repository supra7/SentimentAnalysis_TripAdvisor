I chose this hotel based on the reviews provided on trip advisor as well as their website. Website stated that every room was completely renovate. This was not the case, our bathroom was old and had black mold. The staff, though friendly were not helpful and not interested in solving problems (like the broken airconditioner). The list goes on. Basically it's way overpriced for a 3.5 start hotel and I should have cared more about the hotel rating than the reviews on trip advisor.

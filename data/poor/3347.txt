I normally stay at another hotel in Ocean City but was so impressed with how visually impressive the Dunes Manor was that I thought I would give it a try. This turned out to be a terrible idea. The pool was absolutely disgusting. The water was green and had a foul smell. Couple that with the nasty pool attendant who kept questioning everyone as to what room they were staying in. My question was who in their right mind would want to sneak into this pool? After finally checking into the room, another ordeal I will spare details too, I was greeted to a tiny room with a moldy smell. The toilet had a stain in it and the sheets looked like they hadn't been changed. I was already considering checking out when I tried to get a drink at the empty bar and the bartender made it seem like I was annoying her. I walked to the bar off the beach and was treated to the same rude treatment. I honestly was considering if I was on candid camera at this point. I couldn't wait to leave so I did and checked into another hotel. Try it if you want, but definitely cheaper hotels that are far superior nearby.

The first thing that chocked me when I got to the Hotel was the service. I understand if she doesn't speak English, but she has to know that you say "Hello" when you meet someone. She just gave me a piece of paper where I was to write my name. The room had not been cleaned and I thought the lamp, which was above the bed, was going to fall on my head! I know how the showers are in London but I had to wait 10mins to get hot water. And it was boiling hot. The walls where horrible, it felt like if I were in a haunted hotel.The breakfast was nasty and weirdly some of my stuff was missing! Then I decided to move to an other hotel. And when I asked for a cab she asked me to do it myself! I was not going to the nearest busy street with my heavy luggage! When the cap arrived she said I wasn't around. I was in the lounge....Unfortunately I had to go back to asked for my stuff but no one was there to help me. I have been to many hotels and I used to think that the only thing I needed was a bed. If you think like that, this is the hotel for you. Unfortunately I need more than a bed...I need hygiene and service

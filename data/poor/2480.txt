This hotel was the first stop on our honeymoon. First, the line to check in was the longest I had ever stood in, about 30 min. Then we get to the room and it is tiny, with no closet and the sink is technically in the room with a half wall between bed and sink. To accomodate for not having a closet, the hotel put an armoire in the room where the tv was located. Upon opening the armoire, was greeted with a mildew odor. Next we opened up the sliding glass door to look out at the view and realized our view was of the gravel roof top of the building next door, and the screen door to the slider had some kind of spray painted graffiti on it. Husband then decided maybe it was time for some Pringles after our 5 hour flight. He went to minibar and opened up the can of Pringles to find it was already opened and half eaten! We tried to grin and bear it at this point and went out to dinner. Came back to our room and found another couple trying to open our door with their room key. We tried to nicely explain that the room they were trying to access was ours, but they told us the hotel had assigned our room to them. When we opened our door to show them we were already settled in there first, they thought we were hiding their luggage and they barged in to look around. When I called the front desk to have them figure out the room assignment confusion, they were not too helpful. After one night there, we could not bear to spend another 2 nights and checked out early. We checked right into the Sheraton next door and had a great stay there.

We recently took 40 valued clients to this hotel for our first experience. All i can say is way over rated and way over priced. This hotel does not measure up to the tropicanna much less a premium experience. my personal room was not available for 4 hours after arriving (arrived at 2pm) a condition of our contract was to have the room ready. That was the beginning of disaster. Decore is bizarre, hard to get drinks at the bar much less on the floor. we have held over 200 events in vegas over 15 years and this one is now on the "do not go back" list. would highly recommend one of vegas' other premium offerings. Palazzo was a much better experience with superior rooms at half the price. now you know.

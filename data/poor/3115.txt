Looks like a jail, feels like a jail, furnished like a jail This is my second tine here and first time since they have fenced off the whole motel.What has not changed: staff attitude, cleanliness and noise...What has changed: now the property is all fenced off, in order to avoid gay cruising (you're in the heart of the gay San Francisco here...) ... Instead they are populated with speed freaks, drug addicts up all Night banging on the doors, screaming and slamming the metal gates...The property is poorly run. The staff refuses to address issues and when toilett backs up inside the shower, they say there is nothing they can about itWhen I told them i would write a review on tripadvisor, they said they don't care because they will counter it with an homemade one!Enjoy your stay!

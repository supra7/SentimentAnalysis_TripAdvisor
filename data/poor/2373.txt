I have no idea why this hotel has such great reviews. If it was billed as a 2 or 3 star, it might be more appropriate. But for a 4 star hotel to have MOLD growing in the bathrooms and carpet to the point that it made my friend sick....completely innapropriate. After spending one night in the hotel (my friend couldn't even sleep in the room, she went to the Marriott), we asked to be moved to a non-infested room. When they couldn't accomodate the request, we decided that it was worth the huge cancellation fee to change hotels. Don't even bother with this place, unless you are craving a respiratory infection.

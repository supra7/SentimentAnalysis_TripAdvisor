Check in was very nice, after being in the room for sometime, my elderly mother in law reached under the pillow to discover a used " prophylactic" . Housekeeping came up and changed out the sheets, but the vision never went away. Upon inspecting our room, my wife found used empty shampoo bottles in the shower. The next morning the hotel manager was "unavailable" to speak to us, but the gentleman at the counter said he would " refund our money " from the cruise package to us. As of today, we have not heard anything from the hotel or the cruise line to confirm this. Other than that, the hotel is very nice. I feel the housekeeping staff is totaly at fault, and needs better supervision.

Encore is a beautiful property, there is no question. But to me the first thing a hotel should offer is a good nights sleep, and the design of the adjoining room/door/wall allowed the noise from my neighbors travel to my room, barely muffled. It didn't help that they appeared to be cast members of Jersey Shore. Let me start out by saying I live in a condo in DC; I'm hardly over-sensitive to noise. But I was at the Encore to work 12+ hour days at a conference for work. Each of my four nights I was woken up at 2-2:30 am by shouting and music, that I could hear OVER my fairly good earplugs. On the VERY last night of my stay, after complaining each night, the front desk suggested moving my neighbors...why couldn't this have been suggested the FIRST night? Lack of sleep over my 5 days at the Encore ruined my stay. If that is taken out of the equation, the food was pretty good, the meeting facilities were nice, and the meeting room staff was very good. The furniture in the room was well designed and comfortable, and our room had a wonderful view, though the mirrors were excessive.

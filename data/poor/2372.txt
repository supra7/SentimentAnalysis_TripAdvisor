If you check out Maui Prince's website, you will find nice photos of their guest rooms, looking new and clean.. well.. don't be fooled like we did !! We were first checked into a room that had VERY DAMP carpets, and smelled like dirty public bathroom. So we asked for another room, and we got a slightly better room, the carpet was still damp, but not as bad as the other one, and the smell was there too but only in the area outside of the bathroom. I was paranoid to walk around in the room barefoot, paranoid that my feet might get contaminated by fungi !! The bathroom is old, and dusty and the hairdryer plug in didn't work, the sink blocker did not work too. And the Air Conditioning was not cold either. The hotel had a really old vibe.. their lobby is old, big and empty. their pool is small and looks VERY old. The only good thing about them is their beach. Maui prince is a 4-star hotel. It definitely does not represent it very well. We came from a 4-star Marriott at Waikoloa at the Big Island Hawaii, with their rate $100 cheaper, and it was a million times better than Maui Prince. Please don't go there. It made my maui trip a nightmare..

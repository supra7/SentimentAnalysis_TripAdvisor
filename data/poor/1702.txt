I am writing this review on behalf of my sister, who recently reserved a room - months ahead of time - to stay at the Pirate's Cove. She had all of the appropriate confirmation information regarding her trip. Her flight, however, was going to arrive in the evening on the date of her check-in. The front office here informed her that they close at 9pm. First of all, what kind of establishment located in Daytona Beach closes that early? The Motel 6 in Paris, Ohio is open for check-in all night, for crying out loud. Second of all, what kind of establishment closes that early in the height of tourist season? This reservation was set for mid-July, 2012. Magnanimously, the office agreed to keep someone there until 930pm, but if my sister arrived after that time, they would leave a key to her room. I am happy to report, they did, at least, do that much. However, when my sister went up to that room, there were two other women already settled in it. After much discussion and debate, the group was able to get ahold of the Pirate's Cove's owner, who, at that moment, informed my sister that 2 days prior she had taken that room's rental off the market. There was no contact, courteous or otherwise, which informed her of this. She found out WHEN SHE ARRIVED IN HER ROOM, and only after this little dispute forced a call to the owner. So, needless to say, you can make a reservation here. You may even get a confirmation of that reservation. However, they may decide to pull that rug out from under you at any time, even as little as 2 days before you're departing for your vacation, AND THEY MAY NOT EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT IT. This is NOT the way I would like to be treated if I'm planning a trip to Daytona, whether I were alone or with a family of six. Think about that before calling or clicking.

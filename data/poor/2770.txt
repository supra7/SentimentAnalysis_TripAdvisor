The tiny poorly maintained room would have been tolerable if not for the endless clanking noise of the heating system which sounded like 300 blacksmiths were working their way up to our room. The decor was pretentious and shabby at the same time. I particularly enjoyed how the shower door didn't close fully and the water poured into the bathroom floor. If you are hungry for a late night snack, 10:30pm, there is a Sabarro's up the street since their rude host recommended since they ran out of food!!!!

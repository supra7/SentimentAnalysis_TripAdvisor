We booked a 2 room suite with concierge access from the Marriott website Their site indicated the access was Sunday through Saturday. We checked into the room and was informed that they have no 2 room suites. So, we received a double bed regular room. The access also closes at noon on Fridays and closed Saturdays. The room smell was masked with a strong lemon cleaner scent. The bathroom door creaked St each opening and the clothes hook behind the door was ready to fall off. Their Internet site still charges unless you are a Gold Rewards or higher ; however, it was an older, slow network that took minutes just to refresh their own website. Stay somewhere else! Oh ya, we found trash under the curtains.

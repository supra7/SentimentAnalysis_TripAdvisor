Turned up to hear they had double booked any only had 1 room left which seemed to be in the middle of renovation. no shower, told to be careful with the sink as the bathroom floor leaked, no tv and no furtiture apart form a bedside locker not even curtains on the windows. After first day they moved me to a proper room which seemed ok. third night they had decided to repack my stuff and move me back to the room under renovation which meant after a day out in the heat of instanbul no shower and i got back to late to change hotels so had to stay. rebooked a new hotel online and left the next morning. Hotel seems interested only in making money off people and cares nothing for the customers which is a pity because its in a perfect location for lots of major attractions. Anyone giving this hotel 5/5 has never stayed there.

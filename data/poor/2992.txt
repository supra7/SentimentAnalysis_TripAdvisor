" You get what you pay for !" is rightly said. This place stank ! The carpet was smelling. Wanted to take a shower after a long flight from Canada....guess what :tub was clogged and somethings started to float up from the dark side ! Had it not been for the excitement and the adrenaline rush from all the activites in Disney we would have regretted this trip. BOTTOMlLINE : There are better places out there ! Hope my two cents are worth saving someone from the agony during out stay there. Srini - Ottawa -Canada

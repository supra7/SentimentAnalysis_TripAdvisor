we had a disgraceful experience with these agents. They were helpful at first and we were in contact with them on our arrival. When we arrived at the meeting point they specified.. there was no one there. When we tried to contact their numbers for the next hour and wait patiently there was no answer and they had switched their phones off. We were left stranded in Venice alone with no reasoning. Luckily we managed to find a kind gentlemen that let us stay in his hotel from 2.30am, otherwise we would have been sleeping in the street. Totally unacceptable. They even charged my credit card for the stay 6 days before hand also.

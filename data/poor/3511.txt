I booked a reservation on hotels. com. I arrived after midnight after 14 hours of travel only to discover a long flight of stairs to the lobby, then 3 more flights of stairs to my filthy, disgusting room. There was a dead cockroach on the bathroom floor, a bare bulb in the ceiling fan, yet the corners of the room were dark and dingy. I called the desk for a new room and they declined my request. Room/bathroom amenities were not as described. My room smelled like stale coffee by the morning due to the Starbucks below. The room was dirty and dusty. The halls were dark and dingy, and the carpet is filthy and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. I left in the morning and stayed with a friend. Hotels.com said they needed Hotel M to approve my refund, and they wouldn't. After two hours in several phone calls I indeed got my refund. The next night I noticed tiny bites on my legs - Bed Bugs. I don't think I brought them home, but I was itchy and uncomfortable for the rest of my trip. Even if you are willing to tolerate the above conditions, this room is not worth the listed price.

Decided on this resort after seeing all the great reviews here. Was very disappointed and switched resorts the day after arrival. Had to walk to building 9 from the lobby, was a long walk basically through parking lots. Suite looked decent except for the rip in the couch. Bed and pillow was very uncomfortable and was very loud at night. Almost like the plumbing in the wall was exploding. Ear plugs do not drown out noise that loud!

Location was the only advantage to staying here. For the rates charged, the hotel needs a complete renovation. The rooms felt dingy and dirty. The window AC unit barely worked. We had to use the service elevator, take the stairs, or wait twenty minutes for the one working elevator that felt like an amusement park ride. Extremely disappointing...pictures they have posted on travel sites are extremely generous!!!

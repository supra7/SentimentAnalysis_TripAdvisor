This place is horrendous - they pile their garbage up in an alley next to the building, so we were treated to huge rats running across the sidewalk everytime we returned to the hotel. We also learned from neighborhood residents that the hotel used to rent rooms to the City, to house homeless persons. The rooms were dingy, dark and cramped. Don't ever stay here.

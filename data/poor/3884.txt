My husband & I stayed here on our honeymoon trip. Checking in, the people were quite nice, the grounds at night looked beautiful. Hungy, we found that the restaurant was non-operational.In our itinerary we were told we would get an oceanview room. What we got instead was in the back of the complex. A large family stayed upstairs and the only thing that separated their feet from our view was probably a rug and plywood, because we were staring at raw exposed wood beams. Cobwebs were everywhere. Peeling paint & wallpaper, resplendent with penciled graffiti from some child no doubt. The bathroom was moldy, the toilets rusted, & the mirror had lost half of it's glazing.In love, we tried to make due, UNTIL, we pulled the very old & faded bedspread back to see the sheets were dirty!!! My husband immediately phoned Astin headquarters and secured us a room down Kehei Road in a nice 1 bedroom condo at the Kama'ole Sands. This was 14 years ago and reading the reviews it doesn't look like a lot has changed...unless you actually secure a beachfront room (the 400 Bldg?)....maybe. Here's a link to a picture of the place: Oh and watch out for the Kama'ole Sands. We stayed in a 2 bdr in '95 and the place was the pits & rundown. Since the condo's are owned individually it can be hit or miss whether you get a kept up place or not.

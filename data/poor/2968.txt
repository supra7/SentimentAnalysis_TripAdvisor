Was supposed to stay at this hotel for 5 days but after 1 night checked out and went to a much nicer hotel that was way cheaper.... the hotel is ok itself but the day staff is very rude to the point that they were laughing in our faces and being so horrible..... the were very unhelpful and just blantantly rude and due to their behaviour we left after one night..

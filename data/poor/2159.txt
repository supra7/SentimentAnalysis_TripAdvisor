Last week, 4/06/2005, I spent a night at The Palmer House Hotel in downtown Chicago. It is a nice old and elegant hotel when you are in the lobby or one of the restaurants. However, I was exhausted, arriving late at night for a job interview the next day, and really needed some decent food and sleep. My room was on the eigth floor, and I was first directed to the wrong set of elevators due to unclear instructions given at the front desk. When I did arrive at the correct elevator bank, I rode to the eighth floor, and found the signs to be utterly confusing. It took me fifteen minutes of wandering around to finally locate my room. (The next morning, I encountered another guest who complained bitterly, after a morning workout, that he could not relocate his room.) I entered the room, only to find that the air was stifling and hot. I also discovered the interior of the room could be viewed by those at the indoor swimming pool, as I was changing clothes and noticed movement. I went to eat at the Trader Vic restaurant in the complex, and was told, even though it was ten minutes before closing, that they would not serve any more meals. After finding an altrernative for dinner, I returned to a hot and musty room, despite the fact that I had left the AC running while I was out. After finally getting into bed, I discovered that the mattress sunk down to the level of the box spring, and that it was lopsided regardless of any efforts to get it to be level. Considering that this room was about $160.00 for the night (with taxes), and the reputation of Hilton Hotels, I would have expected much better than what I got. The bed of my truck is certainly more comfortable than their "bed" and I did not get much sleep thanks to their apparent unwillingness to replace old mattresses.

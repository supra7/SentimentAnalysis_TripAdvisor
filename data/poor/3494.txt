My wife and I stayed here for a few days while attending a conference. Although the location of the hotel is nice and the price may seem attractive, everything else was terrible and it was honestly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Most of the hotels I've been to in developing countries have had better service than this one. 1. Since the hotel was overbooked, we were downgraded to a smaller room with a smaller bed, and never received any kind of rebate or reimbursement, even after asking the manager (who was also very impolite and rude). 2. Hotel rooms look nothing like they do on the Marrakech website. Rooms are small (not in a cozy way) with cheap amenities. We were there during the March and the room was very cold and musty. Make sure you bring warm clothes if you actually do go to this hotel in the winter. 3. Internet connection (wired) in our room did not work. 4. Hotel staff did not know the password to the wireless internet router. 5. Hotel staff did not know how to restart the super-slow computers in the lobby that actually had an internet connection (I had to do it for them). (in short, if you need an internet connection, this might not be the hotel to stay at). 6. No working elevator. Just to get in the hotel you must walk up a flight of stairs. 7. Construction was occurring on our floor starting at 8am in the morning, meaning we could not sleep in at all.

We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Kapaula for 6 days (August 21-27) for our honeymoon. We had arrived there from a 6-day stay at the Hyatt Regency in Kauai, where we had a fabulous stay. Unfortunately, from the minute we checked into the Ritz, we knew there were going to be problems. When we opened the door to our room, it smelled like a combination of dirty socks, urine, mold and mildew. The carpets were wet as if they had just been cleaned. When we called to complain, neither phone in the room worked, so my husband went to the front desk where he was reassured that someone would be there "immediately" to move our bags to a new room. 30 minutes later, nobody showed and since we couldn't use the phone, my husband had to go to the lobby, stand in line and re-check in all over. No assistance was offered in relocating us, nor were any concessions offered. As other reviewers have said, everything in the room was outdated -- the t.v. was small and old; the furniture was old; our lamps didn't work; housecleaning rolled up our bedspread and set it to the side of the nightstand for our entire 6 day stay, presumably so they didn't have to actually make the bed; housecleaning never once cleaned the glass shelf over the sinks in the bathroom. Finally, the carpets in the extremely outdated elevator were filthy and coming up in the corners and there were scuff marks all over the hallway leading to our room. For a hotel chain that prides itself on customer service and everything being "their pleasure," we were highly disappoined and will never return to this property.

Wouldn't 'touchstone' with a 10' pole! We booked a weekend with the Touchstone (not my first visit to the hotel) as it had always been a nice, inexpensive, clean hotel. This trip, turned my mind around. We tried to check in, and the front desk was abandoned, but when we got our key (from the deli cashier next door) the elevator smelled like urine and our room was tiny, cold and despite our request for an upper floor room we were on the second floor- considering the smell of the elevator, we were grateful. The staff, used to be friendly and helpful, now were as surley as they could be. We ended up changing hotels that afternoon, forfitted one night's charge to get out-- we stayed at the Hotel Monaco across the street, paid twice as much but were happy-- all that we wanted for the weekend. Find anywhere else to stay-- the $ isn't worth ruining your vacation for.

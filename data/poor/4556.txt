Under no circumstances would I use priceline or Hotel Felix in the future. I just purchased a hotel on priceline and was told directly from Hotel Felix after the fact that the hotel room is for a queen size bed only. There are 3 people traveling & I was told the hotel would not accomodate us. I then called priceline & was told there was nothing they could do. I have used priceline for many years and have always been able to get a room with 2 double beds. I will never use their service again. Karen - Omaha, NE

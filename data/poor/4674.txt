Based on the reviews we booked a 4 night stay at this place. It ruined our stay in beautiful Istanbul. On arrival, no rooms were available, so we got a "garden room" in the basement for 1 night with a 10 Euro pice reduction, and a promise that we will be transfered upstairs to a " nice room" the following day. The garden room had a bathroom and a toilet in the same space, the showerhead placed above the toilet so while we showered the toilet got cleaned as well. The room had a bed and nothing more. No table, no night stand, no lamps. The hotel, the rooms need a major cleaning. We were hopeful that our nice room will be nice. Wrong. The paint was peeling off the ceiling falling on the bed and on our clothes. The breakfast was the same every morning. No juices or fruit. Bread with some small packages of butter, jam, cream cheese and a miserable coffee. After this review I am erasing this experience from my memory.

Don't waste your money. Very old, dirty hotel with horrible customer service. Only one elevator was working which caused a long, frustrating wait each time you needed to go up to the room or down to the lobby. Wasn't able to check in until hours after the check-in time. Room smelled like smoke and the bathroom wasn't clean. Valet parking service was very slow and staff was unfriendly. The hotel is in a great location (across the street from the Four Seasons) but is not worth staying in. Spend your money elsewhere.

During our entire trip I was harrassed and berated by hotel staff over fees. First I desided to use a pre-paid debit card instaedof travelers checks for obvious reasons. And since the hotel charges an additional $30.00 plus a day that they tell you about after your check in for the use of the pool ??? plus $50.00 a day for incidentals you need to be flush when you arrive. So i used the pre-paid card and a security feature required the hotel to enter a validation code which they had the entire time they thought they were not getting paid so every morning i spent 2-3 hours on the phone being told I needed to pay my bill. mind you they had my card and were ppaid if they simply validated the purchases. Then they screwed up several activities like horse back riding which they failed to get us to and later had a cab driver drop us off at an empty parking garage miles from nowhere at the "wild horse casino", apparently if there is a horse on the sign you can ride it. Then when we called to complain about the missed activities all they would discuss is payment which they ....of corse...already had saying quote" all we are concerned about is payment". never refunded a dollar or even comped a taxi ride to make it up. so we moved to a hotel in scottsdale. Now did i mention even after we were paid in full and were no longer staying there the hotel charged our card 2 more tomes for $150.00 each. i have a pre-paid debit card that is negative $110.00. They had so much trouble using them and getting their money they managed to exceed the limit after we left. Stay away from this resort if you are away to destrees. rooms are dated, $6 dollares for bottled water, Pool was filthy and packed, service was the worst I have experienced in my life, $19.95 a day for internet ??? a very poor resort who's main focus is to grab every dollar they can and try to sell you a dated unit, not to mention commiting fraud with you cash. pay cash there or run.

Checked into a very busy hotel with a long wait. But that was okay. Went to the room it spelled like mold and carpet was damp. So we requested a new room. The second room was still musty but not wet. Woke up the next day feeling congested and we requested a new room. Shannon the manager said I will take care of it enjoy the day. We did great pool, beach, slides etc. However the busiest hotel in Maui. At 5 I went to get the new room it also smelled like mold I told Shannon we need a room that is clean he took me to a newlt remodled tower which was better but then insisited on an additional 250.00 when we were already paying 500.00 a night. At this point I told him to cancel the rest of my stay and we went to the Key Lani which is down the street and had large suites ocean front for the same price very clean nice staff. Grand Waleia also charges you for everything. For example If you want a refigerator 25.00. The hotel is very old so if you are interested in a great pool, musty rooms this is the place. During my 3 week stay we went to three other resorts that were awesome. Grand Waleia was the Grand Dump.

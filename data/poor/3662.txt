Kahala is a Hawaiian word that means"very overrated" Where do I begin to express my disappoinment? Should I start with my dark, out dated, moldy room (which was a $600+ per night suite of the Dolphin Lagoon), or should I begin with the pool which was on a par with a Motel 6? The signature restauraunt, Hoku's, is touted as one of Honolullu's top 5 restaurants. The sushi tasted like it came out of a bait bucket. Kahala is on the list of Leading Hotel's of the World. I've been lucky enough to stay at a number of hotels on this list and can say with a great deal of certainty that Kahala has no place on this list. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui prior to arriving at the Kahala. There, we expereinced a true 5 star experience and property. Had I paid $250 a night and had the Kahala been billed as a 3 to 4 star resort, I wouldn't complain. But Kahala seeks to compare itself to those other properties and this is a gross and flagarant misrepresentation. This property needs a complete overhaul, the rooms desperately need updating and the pool (which was closed our last day there) must be redone. The staff tries to do what they can. They are courteous and the service is prompt. But in the final analysis, they cannot ressurect this dying old man of a hotel. Please don't make the same mistake I did and waste your money.

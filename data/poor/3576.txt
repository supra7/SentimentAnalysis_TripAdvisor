The staff in this hotel are horrible, the manager is racist and the morale is low. They treat their staff horribly and maybe this is why the staff is angry. I will never stay in this hotel again. The rooms are smelly and sheets were dirty. The food is all processed pre-made and just heated before serving. The food is also very over priced. The location sucks since it's far away from the beach and basically all you have is Dadeland mall around. Save your money and go somewhere else. Good luck!

My husband and I checked in around 8 p.m. and as we were getting situated, we saw a huge roach scurry across the room towards the bed. When I called the receptionist for assistance, she was dumbfounded. There were no other rooms available. I called neighboring hotels for availability but their prices were too high. We slept that night hoping the roach wouldn't crawl into our bed. Other issues: you could hear footsteps from the floor above, as well as their TV. The housekeeping showed up late, the towel bar on the bathroom door was broken, and the room generally felt dirty.

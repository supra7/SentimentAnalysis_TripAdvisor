My husband and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights because a good friend of mine was getting married. When we walked in, the lobby looked very modern and classy. We were given room 204 and it looked nice, but horrible lighting. We began unpacking and found a roach in the bathroom the size of a pinky nail. We had no choice but to stay at the hotel since we had a wedding the next night. In the 2 day stay, we killed about 5 roaches mainly in the bathroom but also in the bedroom. Upon checkout, I told them about our experience since the stay was horrible. Although they provided me with a small discount, I called to complain about our experience. They told me they had exterminators come into the room and all they could find was humidity bugs!? I looked up humidity bugs and what we were killing all weekend was not that.....they were roaches. The wedding was beautiful....the hotel was HORRIBLE!!! Needless to say I will never be staying at the hotel again and I am traumatized from the disgusting experience. If you have a choice, do not stay there but if you have to.....don't stay in room 204!!!

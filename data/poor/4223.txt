I stayed there Jan. 5-9, 2012, the rooms are old an stale. I found dried fecies on the back of the toilet while taking a bath. This was really awful. they moved us to another room, but we had been there 3 day already. the first night I woke up with hives on my arm. told the manager about this. barley got an apology. Had to go to the doctor get medication to clear. I will never stay at Harrah's Las Vegas again, they have the worst managers I have ever seen.

DO NOT EVEN THINK OF STAYING HERE!!!! the lobby was great and very deceiving! When we checked in the gentleman behind the counter was rude and dressed in street clothes. I wasn't even sure he worked there. When we got off the elevator the hall ways smelled like sewage...(.Each floor). We went into our first room...Yes the first room...My hubby went to use the restroom and the toilet wouldn't flush...The tv's are small and the bed was sunken in the middle. We were only in this room for about 10 minutes before we switched. The second room was not much better. The fron door had the interior lock broken and you literallly had to slam the door to get it to shut. The bathroom doo didn't shut at all!!! The restroom door was dirty with hair and dirt. We requested a non-smoking room but it smelled like an ashtray...The blankets on the bed had cigarette burns in them. Another 19 inch tv also. we were only there for one night thank god or we would have changed again. Also we only paid 69.00 a night ...Not the 140.00 reg price thank god!!! RUN AWAY DON'T STAY HERE THERE ARE TO MANY HOTLES ON THE SAME STREET THAT ARE WAY BETTER!!!!

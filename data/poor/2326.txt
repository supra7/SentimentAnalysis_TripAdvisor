We have stayed at many nice hotels around the globe. Grand Wailea was unfortunatley the worst experience we have ever had (thankfully, we have always been pleased with the hotels we have chosen). This is the only time that I have EVER gone out of my way to write a review. We had heard many nice things about the hotel in the past, but we believe ever since Hilton has acquired the hotel it has really gone down hill. If you choose to stay at this hotel be prepared: to walk a lot-everything is spread way out, there is no easy access to anyplace, pay a lot, swim in a dirty, but fun pool, eat mediocre food, deal with a less than friendly front desk who will not honor what you booked (in our case we booked over a year in advance), wake up at 6:00 to get in line by 6:30 to be standing in line to get a chair from the stand that opens at 7 (no matter what, the whole process takes at least about an hour and a half and much more if you're late...), also when you get your chairs be prepared to defend them with your life-angry vacationers that did not wake up as early as you will constantly be preying on your space-cabana, chairs by the pool, or chairs on the beach because of their lack of chairs and space for all the guests. BTW, the hotel is overcrowded because they sold membership to the locals and other neighboring properties during the economic downturn. There seems to be aggressive tension by the pool. Wonder why. If you are looking to relax, you won't. If you are looking for the best food, go next door (the four seasons). And if you are expecting at the least good if not great service then don't make the same mistake we made. Staying anywhere else I'm sure would be better. Also, if you leave anything on your beach chair, they will tell you they take it and keep it until you come, they just keep it, and tell you a guest took it. Ha!

I stayed at Hotel 91 last year and was pleased. However, I just returned from there and found that the cleanliness left much to be desired. I was traveling with my students and stayed there because we were exploring the Lower East Side. One of my students noticed a mouse in his room. After checking under the bed, we noticed mouse traps and found them under our bed as well. We reported this to the main desk and they switched the student's room but they are obviously aware they have mice and do not have the problem under control. Do not stay there.

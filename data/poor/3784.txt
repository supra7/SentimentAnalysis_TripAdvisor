Hated this dump This place is in need of some major work. Rooms are in terrible shape, hotel staff couldn't care less about customer service. Food is bad, pool is small. The only thing good about this place is the location.We booked a non-smoking room but they gave us a smoking room because they did not have any non-smoking left. In other words, reservations don't mean too much to them. We asked to be changed and they said this was not possible. When we called our travel agency, they and only they were able to get us moved to a non-smoking room. Didn't do much good though. Room was still very uncomfortable and smelly. The beds are HORRIBLE. I almost decided to sleep on the floor. Oh, and I love the fact that they charge you an $8.95 daily fee to use the in-room safe so you can protect your own belongings from theft by the hotels employees...The staff was amazingly uninterested in customer service. It was a very strange experience. The front desk girls were short of rude. The breakfast staff was the same. As was the parking lot cashier, etc., etc. If you go here on your vacation, I feel sorry for you. There are much better hotels in Waikiki for the $$$$. Avoid this place.

DEFINTELY NOT GOING TO GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH AT THIS HOTEL!!! I do NOT recommened. Give your money to a smaller hotel that needs it and you will get the value and service you are expecting.No wireless, just a high speed port, that you must pay for. Bathroom chemcials were not fully cleaned so bathroom smelt horrible the entire stay.Shower head was probably 10years old.Rooms are not updated. Bix box TV;s, not a flat screen like there room descriptions say. Inside pool area was disgusting. Chewing gum plastered on the decor rocks, rust on the floor by the handrails, dirty towels in with the clean pool towels. Spa only has one person working there so you can not get a couples massage. Outside apperance is awful. Sign is not fully alluminated, windows were heavily caked with dirt, rust, stained walkways, gum everywhere. Legends sports bar and doc bailes share the same kitchen, save your money and go to legends, same food, slightly cheaper but still outrageous. Billing was a nightmare. Charged me for valet all 6 nights, I did self parking. Got it "fixed" at check out, was checking bill on my way out and it was done inaccurate again! Credit card company called 2 days later, I had 2 charges from Hilton, almost doubling what my invoice said. Called to compain and the account payable staff had left for the day, at 1PM?!?! Totally aggrivating!!!!

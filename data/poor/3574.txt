Two things to note regarding my stay: 1. Check your baths towels before you start using them when you get out of the shower, two of the four towels had long strands of brown hair folded into them - disgusting is right! 2. Beware of having your vehicle valet'd at the hotel ... my vehicle returned with significant front end damage. It might be worthwhile parking on the street.

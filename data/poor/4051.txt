The directions to the hotel were wrong. When we did arrive there the hotel looked nice. We were on the 5th floor. The hallway stunk like mildew. We got to our room which looked nice at first. There was a hole in our wall, and the down filled matress cover, (which will doubles as your only comforter/blanket,) had body fluid stains all over. I can not express how badly it needed cleaned, and obviously, it isn't cleaned often. The seriously dissappointing part was for two mornings in a row we were not able to shower. On the first morning, my birthday, the front desk informed us they were experiencing boiler issues . They told us we would have to wait at least 2 hours for hot water. We made the best of the circumstances and went to the Sears tower unbathed. The hot water worked that afternoon. The next morning we had no hot water again. At that time, we were told to wait a half an hour until the water heated up. We did, and still had no hot water. We got tired of waiting and left for home with no shower again. If you expect no morning shower or appoligies from the front desk, go to Hotel Blake. If not, choose somewhere else!! We never recieved any compensation for the hassel, not even the phone call we were promised from the "boss" who handles complaints. Convieniently, that "boss" doesn't work weekends, so all weekend complaints are not dealt with until Monday. As for the restaurant, we spent $40.00 on two cheese omelets, two cups of coffee, and two orders of whole wheat toast. Very fancy, and not so very good. Not reccommending the breakfast.

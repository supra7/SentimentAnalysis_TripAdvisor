I booked this hotel through my company's travel website. The rate was about $225 a night. When I got to the front desk they told me that they only had a room with double beds left. I said that I would prefer a room wiht a one king size or at least a queen size bed. They said they were totaly booked for the night. Are they are told to say this? We are in a rescession and no hotel is fully booked for the night. They did not even have a r0om key for me. i checked in at 6:30 pm. Then when I got to the room the bed was literally 5 1/2 feet long. I am over six feet tall. I called to the front desk and against asked if they could please see if anoter room was available. "No sir I am sorry you will have to sleep with your feet hanging over the bed." was what I was told. REALLY? In addition, I ordered late night room service at 10:30 pm. They had a very limited menu - grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu. However, they didn't even have any one of the 3 items on the list. My only choice was a cold and soggy tuna sandwhich which was clearly over a day old. I ate it anyway and immiediatley began to get sick at both ends. My room was drafty and the noise easily wafted through the glass. The hotel gym is the size of a broom closet. The owner's should really close this hotel if they are not interested in running it properly. I am ashamed for this rat hole!

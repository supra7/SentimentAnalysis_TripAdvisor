I'm not sure where to start but I'll try. The first thing I noticed was that the elevator was extremely slow. The room smelled disgusting and looked very depressing. The carpet very old. The airconditioning although made a lot of noise througout the night, did not really work well. My father was itching all night from something that none of us could figure out besides maybe the fact that the sheets didnt look especially clean. Judging from a review on this sight, I think he might have been bitten by bed bugs as well. I can't think of one positive aspect about this hotel besides that it was the cheapest place at the time. Do yourself and your family a favor and stay away. Its just gross.

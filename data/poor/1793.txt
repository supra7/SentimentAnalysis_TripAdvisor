We arrived at the hotel, checked in with wotif reservation, prepaid. $110 for two nights. Upon arriving we checked in at reception, and were given the key to 701. The hotel in general is pretty small, rundown, that's fine though, its just a place to sleep while exploring Singapore and the local markets are supposed to be good. So we take the lift, get to our room and put our bags down on the floor and look at the room. Small, poor repair, no blankets, just a sheet on the mattress. Fine. Whatever. I sit on the bed and we start to plan our day...then I notice the headboard above the bed is moving, the room is infested with either bedbugs or lice, transparent things about half the size of a pin. We quickly get out things and head back to reception to ask for a new room, we tell her about the bugs (I think she already knew from her reaction) and were given 702. This room had pubic hair on the bed. clearly had not been changed between guests.Back to reception. This time we were given 801, and the lady from reception came up with us, we looked around the room, no lice/bedbugs, no pubic hair, then with her asking if this room was ok I lifted the toilet seat, liquid feces spots across the seat. We asked for a refund. She started to tell us no until we told her we will call the bank (visa) and then she agreed. While processing the refund, she checked a couple into 701.

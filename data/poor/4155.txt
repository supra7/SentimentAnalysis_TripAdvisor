I have stayed at this hotel twice and I will never go back. The rooms are tiny and there is very little room is provided to unpack your clothes and place your luggage. Amenities are scarce and it took housekeeping 5 hours to bring extra towels. During my first visit, I received a room with a king bed, yet the tv was placed on the side wall, so it was nearly impossible to relax in bed and watch tv without having to contort my body sideways. During my next visit, I received a room with a queen bed. The room was so small that when we opened the door, the valet could not even get our luggage inside and he suggested we call the front desk to request a larger room. We did and, in fairness, they did move us to a slightly larger room witha queen bed. I was also upset that they charged me the same price for the queen bed as they did for the king bed during my first visit. I opted for the the valet parking service with the understanding that we needed to phone the front desk 15 minutes ahead of time in order to have it brought out. I called for the car on two different occasion, and one tim eit ook 35 minutes, and the next time it took 45 minutes, thus making me late for my appointments. They do serve a continental breakfast, however the lady that maintains it starts closing it down 15 minutes before she is supposed to.

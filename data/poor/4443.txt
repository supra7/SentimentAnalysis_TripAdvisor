I recently stayed at the gold spike. I was a bit leery about staying there but, weighing the $12 room rate, I decided to give them a try. We took a drive around the building first only to find that there was no covered parking. You have to hope that you don't get harassed by one of the many "beggars" surrounding the area as you walk to the hotel after parking. I was quite impressed with the recently done renovation. Inside was very clean and nicely remodeled. The room was a bit small but comfortable. My friend and I decided to stroll down to the Cal. We left the do not disturb sign up (so the maid wouldn't enter) and left for a few hours. Upon arrival back to our room, we noticed the the do not disturb sign was removed. We entered to find the room cleaned and a carton of cigarettes missing. We notified management only to have him tell us that his maid said she didn't take anything (duh) and that perhaps I misplaced them. I can't believe that the "manager" actually was accusing me for losing them! I left a written statement with "Mike the manager" and still haven't heard any response from him. Simply said, if you're looking for a place to stay and you aren't carrying any valuables, stay at the Spike! It's hard to find good workers nowadays.

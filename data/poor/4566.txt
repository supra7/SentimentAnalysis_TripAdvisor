After reviewing several hotels my friend and I decided to book through Priceline - big mistake! We drew the short stick and wound up with Hotel Felix. We were taking a last minute girl's trip to Chicago for a long weekend. I knew Felix was a boutique hotel - no big deal, just needed two beds. I contacted Denise -- (head of reservations) weeks in advance and she was not only rude, but the least bit helpful. We were crammed in the worst room with one queen bed on a floor with a view of neighboring parking lot. The ONLY positive was that the bed was very comfortable, then again I was sharing it with my friend so it wasn't even worth enjoying! If hotels do not wish to accommodate customers who book through third party sites, they should not list their extra rooms through partners like Priceline, Orbitz, Expedia.... I will do my very best to avoid this hotel and the inconsiderate staff in the future. Be warned!

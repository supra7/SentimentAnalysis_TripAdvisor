I had a luxury view room and there was nothing luxury about it. Room #2637 Had a view of the Mirage volcano but the windows were so dirty you couldn't see out of them. The TV was old and cut off any news going across the bottom of the screen like CNN, the phone only worked if you held it just right, had so much static it was almost unusable, and the carpet was just gross. Wore slippers and never let my feet touch the carpet. With all the nice places to stay center strip I wouldn't stay here again.

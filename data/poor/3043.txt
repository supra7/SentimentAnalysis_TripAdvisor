Booked this hotel because Expedia recommended it. It is not a resort in the winter - its just a dated hotel with a $30 parking fee. The biggest disappointment was that there is no mention that the resort ammenities are closed in January and even at check-in, we were told that the fee included the water park! There are many excellent hotels with excellent staff in the Phoenix area. Please don't get fooled like me into thinking this is one of them. The staff had no interest in my issues, nor did they reply to my emails.

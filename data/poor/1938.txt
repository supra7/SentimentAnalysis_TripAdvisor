I'm not a picky busines traveler - just looking for a clean, comfortable, quiet place to sleep. (And I'm 0 for 3 with this hotel.) I also travel frequently (every week), so I know when something is decent and when it's not! The positives: building looks nice from the outside, lobby is beautiful. You should take a walk thru. Just keep walking! My complaints: A/C barely worked, rooms are in DESPERATE need of renovations, and fire alarm went off for 10-15 minutes in the middle of the night. I stayed here on June 27, 2006 - one of those humid nights in Boston when you're cold but still sweating ... so not having decent (as in better than the subway) A/C is inconceivable. Even clean, the rooms are just old and dingy. And the fire alarm ... well that could be a one day event, yes ... but would you want to go back? Now my initial reaction was - it was just my room. However, the other person I was traveling with had the same issues, so I feel compelled to post my experience (especially at $300/night).

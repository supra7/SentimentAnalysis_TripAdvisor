This hotel has to be the worst hotel I stayed in. i was on line checking in, and there was two guets complaining about bed bugs!!! I was a little concerned, but decided to check into the hotel anyway... MISTAKE!!! When I arrived to the room, someone had used the bathroom already, and left the evidence, and there were dirty socks in between the sheets. I spoke to a manager by the name of Maria, and she was very RUDE!!! Will never stay here again, as a matter of fact I will tell everyone I know to never stay at another W again.....

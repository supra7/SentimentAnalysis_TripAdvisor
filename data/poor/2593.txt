Quite old hotel, very bad service for a really expensive stay. Parking costs 32$ per day and you should wait the car for half an hour (minimun) A bottle of water costs 6$ During the staywe cannot use the room an entire morning due to cabling works, totally unacceptable! After the works the room was dirty Services too low for the price paid

We stayed one night on September 2008, mostly because we got a great deal online. It was Saturday night, many hotels were booked and those with free rooms didn't fit our budget. I had read not-so-good reviews about this hotel before and we knew that it wasn't what we were looking for, but the location was good for us and the room was reasonably priced, so we decided to give it a go. At first we walked long way through casino gambling machines to get to reception, just to found out that the check in was kind of a nightmare (and the check out took almost as long as the check in). We had to wait in a long line for a time that felt like an eternity, at least when you are tired and hungry. After checking in we dragged our luggage through the casino (again), until we got to the elevators, which were always so full we couldn't fit in. When we finally got our room, we were very disappointed. The room was located on the fourth floor and was very shabby with a terrible smell. Window was small and all you could see was some kind of backyard with garbage cans. Bathroom was okay, although shower curtain was very unclean and disgusting. Luckily the room was quiet, so we slept well in a surprisingly comfortable bed.

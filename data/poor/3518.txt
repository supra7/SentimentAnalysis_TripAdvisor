I was like many who read a ton of reviews and still didn't know if people were just being picky....THEY ARE NOT! Let me just say two words....BED BUGSSSSS!!!! I had to stay here during some work related business for about 10 days, and I shared a room with two other women. It was one of them who acutally chose the hotel. When we first got there, I do admit I thought the lobby was cute. Dark...yes, but cute. However the bell man was nothing but nasty and didn't crack a smile. I carried half of my luggage up the two flights to the lobby, set them down for a second, to which he proceeded to yell that I was creating a hazard in the lobby. (Later in my stay I was made to feel uncomfortable again by the same man when I spent some time in the lobby bar). When we first got to our room (on the 5th floor, no elevators) I actually thought it was small, yet cute and clean. Boy was I wrong. I had to make a trip upstate during the weekend and on Sunday night the ladies I stayed with called to let me know they changed rooms due to newly dicovered bed bug bites! When confronting the front desk they were not suprised and just offered to pay for the laundy that needed to be done. The second room they moved us to was abs horrible! In the hallway the celling was falling in, walls dirty, rug ripped up around the edges. I believe they are in the middle of refurb the hotel. Needless to say I was out of there! Check in and out were long and frustrating. They had 3 women at the desk who couldn't handle the people plus phones. When I finally got to talk to one of them....I was informed my questions would have to be answered by the other woman. Which was another 10 minute wait. I'm not sure about you, and I know NY has problems with bed bugs, but I highly doubt this was the first or last time they had this problem. I would just be scared that you would stay...not get bit...and then take them home to live in your bed/furniture/clothing. BEWARE.

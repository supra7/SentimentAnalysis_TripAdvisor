Never in my life have I bothered to write a review (good or bad) about anything in my life, but I'm going out of my way this time to make sure I do my part to try to save someone from having my experience at POCH. This place is a filthy mess. I literally almost died on one of their shaky elevators. They have ZERO ethical standards....they rented what seemed to be the entire hotel to children that were parentless from the ages of 13-17. They were all running around completely drunk running up and down the halls, packing the elevator to go up and down to ever different party'. It was like a jungle. And let me tell you this, I am a 31 year old who LOVES to party. I'm not some old grumpy guy!! What I was seeing made me blush!! The young little drunk parentless girls were dressed in the smallest/tightest clothes I've ever seen. It was all just indescribable. Obviously the party went on through the night when they got home from whatever trashy club Daytona offers right next door. I'm not sure how they could knowing let all of this go on. JUST DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!!!!!

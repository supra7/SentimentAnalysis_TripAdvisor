Rooms looked very worn. First suite we were given the sofa was stained, the pillows on the sofa and bed were stained. There were black hand prints on the wall.The floors in the bathroom & kitchen looked filthy. We requested another suite, and the second one was better...........but still looked very worn..........The hotel needs some serious upgrading, especially for the price! We will not stay at this hotel again!

Musty Marseilles The worst Martini I have ever been served in America - dirty glass, unatmospheric bar, poor mix. This hotel has so much potential but it needs a generous benefactor to restore it to former glories. Just visit the nearby Raleigh - it can be done. Loved the ocean front view we were given but the poor decor, cracked tiles and creaking beds gave the impression of a very run down bed and breakfast. The interior needs a thorough clean - grease smears on fixtures and fittings not what you expect. The so called banqueting room smells like a greasy spoon. Service indifferent. Despite my stay in the musty Marseilles we loved South Beach - next time we will pay a little more to avoid staying at something that resembles a rooming house.

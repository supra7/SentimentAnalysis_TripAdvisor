Initially we were suppose to stay at Terrace Guest House(owner Dogan) but problems with the bathroom made us to change. As i mentioned on the Terrace Guest House review Hotel Park belongs to Dogan's father. Shall we say we jumped out of the frying pan into the fire!!! This place is the shabbiest accomodation we have ever stayed at... We were first put in room no3 which is a poxy double room that reeked of cigarette smoke and the window wouldn't close...so we complained!!!were shown room no4, a triple room with the most disgusting bathroom...several tiles missing, shower was really manky and rusty! Finally we were taken all the way to the top floor and shown a smallish double room(no22) with a decent, newish looking shower room. But the only view from the window was the fire staircase. Also the main ventilation system outlet was right on top of the roof just above our room rattling away constantly! On several occassions we had to call reception because there was no water coming from either the basin tap nor the shower itself. Radiator wasn't fully working, when complained to receptionist he told us that the room was warm enough for him!!! what a joke! Breakfast area is in the basement,kitted out with plastic garden furniture(originally white now grey with dirt!!!) which they use in the summer on the roof terrace. Very tacky!!! Breakfast itself is very basic, white bread, jam, hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, olives. No juice and no fresh fruit on offer! If we would have had more time we wouldn't have stayed at this hotel but would have gone to find somewhere else.

Rude staff, misleading hotel I and my friend booked a room for this hotel under the impression that we would be sleeping in a double bed bedroom and instead walked into a hotel room with a king size bed. Upon arrival at the front desk there were problems with other customers complaining of rooms not being what they booked...When asked about the room and why it was not what we booked, Patty, the so called hotel manager gave an attitude and said thats what they had and thats what we are going to get and to basically deal with it. After much going back and forth and me putting her in her place we had to end up switching hotels to the Riande, which I made the Marseilles book at the lowest rate possible, which was not that much better looks wise but staff wise they were wonderful and we had a MUCH bigger room with DOUBLE BEDS. Warning to others, DO NOT EVER STAY AT THE MARSEILLES. The staff was very rude, with the exception of a guy named Julian and a manager named Peter. The staff also claims that when you book the hotel room through the call center, that they don't have anything to do with the room that you were told you would receive. Which did not make any sense. The hotel room was very tiny and the bathroom was nasty and small as well. When you walked into the lobby it smelled as old as dust. I should have just went ahead and booked a room at the Park Central on Ocean as I had planned. Next time I KNOW better and if you are smart, you would take heed to this warning. DON'T STAY AT THE MARSEILLES.

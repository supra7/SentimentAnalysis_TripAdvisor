The rooms were old, run down and small. One of the two elevators didn't work so the small one that held 6 people was usually full when it stopped on your floor. The televisions are small picture tube Ziniths from the 90's. The location is great but the hotel is disgusting. Parking is $45 per day. You pay $10 a day for internet service and it is as slow as dial up.

We were extremely unhappy with our stay at the Park Plaza. The level of service was embarassing; I waited for 30 minutes on hold for the concierge twice during our one-night stay, once in the evening and again in the morning, it took over 20 minutes to check in, and the hotel bar staff was disgruntled and far from accomodating. I will never return to the Park Plaza and encourage everyone else to explore the many other hotels in Boston that far exceed the Park Plaza in quality and level of service.

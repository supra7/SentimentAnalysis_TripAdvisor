Look elsewhere Shabby large hotel with absolutely no room service except for breakfast. Old tv, refrigerator didn't work. Only nice part is the pretty good location (near international marketplace and waikiki beach) and a meeting point for tours to meet etc. Being on top of Macy's is so so, look elsewhere unless you get a really good price here.

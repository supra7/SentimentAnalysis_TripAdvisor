We needed a hotel room at the last minute, so being a Hilton Honors member, I called the 800 line to find this hotel and book a reservation. No double rooms were available, just a king room/study with a couch/fold-out bed, which was acceptable. When my son went to go to bed, the sheets on the couch were dirty, and there was trash in the bed. It was after midnight, so he ended up sleeping on the couch. The next morning, I informed the front desk, who laughed and told me they would tell housekeeping because that was unacceptable. The room was changed, but the couch was still not cleaned and my son didn't want to sleep on it. Upon packing our items to leave, I discovered a bag of our dirty laundry was missing. I contacted the front desk to see if Housekeeping had picked it up by mistake, thinking it was laundry, and they said they would leave a note for them the following morning. The morning manager had not been appraised of the situation and Housekeeping was unaware of our items, so they are now lost. I called 1-800-Hampton to inform them of our unsatisfactory stay, and was told to wait 72 hours for someone to contact me. I reminded them of the 100% satisfaction guarantee and was again told to wait, and give them 3 days to contact me. I told them there was nothing that could change my opinion of the stay, but was again told to wait 72 hours to let them resolve the matter. I'm not quite sure how this will be "resolved," but I am disappointed that Hampton is not honoring their 100% satisfaction guarantee.

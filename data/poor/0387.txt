My family and I where taking a vacation to seattle and decided to stay here because it close to the space needle. We arrived Friday. The rooms where not than nice. They seem to let alot of prostitutes stay there wearing practicly nothing, I was apauled. At night the street right in front is full of drug addicts and prostitutes and they just let it go on.I 'm very upset my children saw this. I contacted the police and they did nothing. I even saw them driving next to loads of prostitutes walking all around the area and they did nothing!! I immediately checked out the next day, after a night of my children and wife and I hearing prostitutes have sex al lnight in the room next to us!! The police never returned my complaint call. the prostitues and pimps and drug atticts are around this whole area where other hotels are located also. I'm apauled they let this happen there, my family will never return to this city again!

we were surprised by bed bugs in the middle of the night. we decided to leave the motel and the receptionists wondered if we might have brought the bugs! They were not cooperating and were rude, almost annoyed by the fact we told them about bugs. When we asked about not charging my credit card, since we were going to leave the hotel, one receptionist said that she could not do anything about it. Next day we spoke with the general manager, who charged my money back and seemed being understanding about our situation. even if it was cheap, we were happier for paying more and getting a cleaner and safer place!

In our room, there was mold growing in the bathroom and one of the window fixtures did not work. Also, there were several holes in the ceiling by the window. At check out, the woman working did not make me feel as though I was welcomed back and the valet was more interested in the bacheloret party than assisting my husband and I. I was EXTREAMLY disappointed in this stay.

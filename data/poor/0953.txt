We were persuaded to book their timeshare presentation special before I did my usual tripadvisor perusal of the reviews. Needless to say we were quite concerned after reading other travelers reviews and decided to change our destination. I called 3 weeks from our travel date and requested a refund or even a partial refund and was told that was not possible. To their credit they said we could rebook any time between now and the end of the year - but after reading the overwhelming number of negative reviews we just won't risk our vacation time by going there. All inclusives are always a risk - but this one seems particularly worth avoinding.

This hotel is not even worth the 3 star rating is given . The Good Good location, just opposite major shopping mall, restautants and Palace, gran via. 25 minutes to airport. porter service. reasonable hotel shop for souvenirs ets. telephone booths in hotel. (you will know why later!) decent room size. Clean bed sheets. decent size bathrooms. THE BAD Decor leaves much to be desired , 70's style hunter green and brown, garrish. Rude British accented receptionist man! There was no AC operating till 7 pm at night (we were told it was conserving energy). Room phones did not work very old phones. I was in a second floor room, my view was that of a apartment complex''s behind so i saw into other peoples homes and laundry lines and backyards. Toilet was unclean leftover hairs from previous tourist. The room reeked of high turnover tourists. Dirty bed spread. OH!! teh best part was when i looked under the sink there was foliage growing (yes! real weeds or roots - i cannot say for sure i am not a botanist) but i am sure it was a growth. Breakfast is not good watered down milk, soupy eggs, old cured meats, hot chocolate only when requested. bad tempered staff. do try and get another hotel, i understand this place is cheap but there must be a better option, it was the worst place i stayed in my whole trip which consisted of 4 hotels around spain.

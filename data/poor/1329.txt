We stayed at this hotel and we were bitten all over bodies by the bed bugs in the mattress. They changed the room and same thing happen in the second room. We talk to other guest at the hotel and they had the same problem. The entire hotel has bed bugs. Do not stay, unless you want to be a victim of the bed bugs. There are many problems with this hotel: 1) They are very far from tourist attractions. Every time you want to go somewhere, you have to pay a lot of taxi money to get to places and when you want to come back to the hotel, the taxi driver dont know the hotel or the address. Even when you show them the actual address of the hotel, they dont know where it is and they get lost going back to the hotel and you end up paying the high taxi far. The hotel does not offer any transportation services and when they feel like driving you somewhere with their van, the want a lot of money. Like we paid them $100 the first day, to take us to the shopping mall and we found later that the yellow taxi in the street was only $40. 2) There front desk customer service is horrible. I dont know who made this hotel a four star hotel, they are horrible and they should have no star. When you arrive, they tell you that their door key is not working and that every time you want your door open, you have to stop by the front desk. You could only have one towel per person per day. If you call the front desk and ask for a towel, they tell you that you cannot have more than one towel per day. There wireless internet service doesnt work and if you want to use their hotel lobby computer, is $25 per hour. Thats just a rip off. They having construction in their hotel, so be ready to wake up from the sound at 7 am. So, over all the hotel is terrible and on top of that, they have bed bugs, so dont waste your money on this hotel. I have included the bed bugs bites picture, so you could see what happen to me.

When we initially were running a seach on Trip Advisor the only negative review I read was that the Reception staff were not friendly, other than that the Hotel was great! WRONG INFORMATION! The staff STILL ARE DEFENTELY NOT FRIENDLY - and have no customer support skills whatsoever - BUT the Hotel was Bad bad bad as well NOT WORTH THE MONEY PAID at all. If you are a family with young KIDS - LOOK ELSE WHERE!!!!!!

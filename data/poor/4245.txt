This has got to be the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. First of all they gave us a faulty door that didn't even lock properly. The door made a click when you close it but it wasn't even locked. This caused us to get robbed but the hotel didn't care. They did nothing for us. Also when we realized the door didn't work we were very careful about closing it but their housekeeping people went through out room and couldn't even close it properly and yet again the hotel did nothing about it. After switching to a different room, they locked us out of the new room. It took 6 trips to the hotel lobby for them to realize what they had done. Their security was also terrible. They made people wait 40 minutes just to talk to them.. I mean I could have been dying but they wouldn't have cared. Overall worse hotel, worse service. The rooms were dirty and disgusting. Don't stay here. Definitely not worth it.

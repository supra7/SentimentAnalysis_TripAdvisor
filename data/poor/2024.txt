When i first walked in the hotel i thought it look really nice and i felt as if i was getting my moneys worth when i got to my room around 4:30 all i wanted to do was to eat something and just go to sleep since i had to drive all the way from New York City so i order room service it took for ever to be connected to teh room service department and when i finally did i was put on hol for about 5mins carmen the guy that answer the phone was rude even though i was beign really nice i felt as if i was ordering from burger king, when i made my order he said that itwould be in my room in 30mins well 50mins past and i called him and he said that he was sorry but he had forgotten to take my room number so my order was being held and he said that eh would send it right up. i asked him if it was going to take another 30 mins and he said that it wasn't because they had the foos made. At this moment i got really upset because i knew they were going to send me the dinner that had been sitting for a good 20 mins. i told him that i didn't want food that was sitting there for that long and he said that it wasnt so i believed him and i told him that it was fine when mark the server arrived with my food he was really nice and presented the food to me but i was dissapointed so when he left i called room service and carmen answer again really rudly, he didnt even bother to greet me he just said carmen speaking so i told him that i didn't want the food anymore because it look like it had been seating there for way too long so i wanted to cancel my order very rudly he said that if i didn't wanted in the 1st palce i shouln't have asked him to send the food up to my room, then he said that he need it to see the food and to make sure that i hadn't eaten it and i told him to come get it and he said fine and hung up he didnt;t ven give me the time to ask him if the charges were going to be taken off. when i went to check out the next day the room service charge was charged to my room... with people like carmen are the kind of people that make a good experience a terrible one would i stay at the hotel probably but no way would i recomend anyone to order room service because the terrible service of the guy answering the phone.

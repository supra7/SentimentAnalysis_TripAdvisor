This hotel is way down the beach from the much nicer hotels in Wailea. We selected it because we thought it was less expensive. When we selected our room on the hotel site, a little box popped up with a "Total" amount. In the price breakdown, fees are listed as zero. Beware: elsewhere on the site is a statement that there is a $25/night "Resort Fee." Plus, if you want internet access, you will pay an additional $15.57/day. The room and bathroom were dingy. And the acoustics were such that when we were in our room with the glass doors open, we could hear people on nearby balconies as clearly as if they were in the room with us - every word. One woman was dictating a book or an article - not very relaxing.

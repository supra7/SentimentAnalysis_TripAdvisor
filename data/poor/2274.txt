I have been going to Vegas for fourteen years and I have never been treated so badly when it came to getting my comps at the end of the week. We ran about twenty thousand dollars through the machines during our five day stay, and they refused to comp. a $97.00 dollar food bill. I went from the player's club, to a host, to a customer service specialist and got nothing but a runaround. They actually felt they gave me a deal because they comped our five night stay. They should have, because that was the smallest room I have ever been in. Our cash back total at the end of the week was $23.00 for the two of us. What a joke. We earned more than that in comps when we went over to Binion's and played for four hours.

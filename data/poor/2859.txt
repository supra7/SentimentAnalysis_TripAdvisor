The W New York has no understanding of hospitality. Never have I felt so mistreated and stressed by a hotel. I was there recently on a business trip with my company. We had 7 rooms for 5 nights (spending over $12,000). The employees were rude and uncaring. The housekeepers woke our entire team up around 7:30AM every morning with their excessive and unnecessary noise in the hallways. The barbaric yells over the fully blasted volume on their walkie talkies was an awful way to start every day. The staff on the phone lines (who rarely answered the phones) was bad mannered and disrespectful. We were not even allowed to hold a work meeting in the lobby. The marketing department solved this issue by asking for more money to use the public area. They followed this pitch by saying, "You are not valued clients because you booked through Expedia and not the W sales directly". If you'd like to save yourself from hardship and tension, I'd suggest steering clear of The W Hotel New York- 541 Lexington Avenue New York, New York 10022.

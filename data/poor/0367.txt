Go elsewhere. Rooms need to be renovated. AC unit needs to be overhauled. This was the second time I have stayed here and there will not be a third! Stayed here a year or so ago. Met my needs for a quick overnight business trip but certainly nothing special. Booked the hotel again this August for family celebration. Stay was so bad that we checked out after first night. Problems galore, which management chose to ignore. My biggest problem, far and away, was that they assigned my mother to a non-smoking room which stunk of cigarette smoke. Yes, all the rooms are now non-smoking but that does not mean that the hotel went to any effort to cleanse the former smoking rooms. Management moved my mother to another room, but guess what? It stunk too. It took a third move (at midnight) to finally resolve the matter. Lost in the shuffle was a northwest facing room (our primary reason for booking this hotel) and the connection to our own room (important b/c early-to-bed toddlers traveling along). Did management offer me a credit or refund? No. Did they adjust my rate to the non-view room rate? No. Did the apologize profusely? No, they didn't even attempt this most basic courtesy. Regardless, I have to say that even managment had handled my issues appropriately, there is no getting past the fact that you are paying a very full price to stay at a hotel that is many years past needing an update. Go elsewhere. We moved to the Edgewater and also spent some time at the Silver Cloud--Lake Union. You are getting your money's worth at these place.

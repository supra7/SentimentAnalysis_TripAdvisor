We stayed at the Adolphus because it is near the Cotton Bowl. We were told that there is a 3PM check-in so we delayed our arrival until 5:30PM. At this time our room was not clean so we were told to leave and that they would call us when our room was available. At 8PM we were finally contacted for our room. Because it was a bowl game atmosphere there were a lot of young college students and rowdy fans. This would not be a problem if the hotel management would have worked to keep the noise level down. But as it was I could not get any help in getting our hallway and nearby rooms to kept the noise down and we had to listen to the party goers from Midnight until 5AM - we literally could not rest or sleep until after 5AM. The hotel also requires valet parking - which is $24 per night. When they brought my car around to me at 8AM the next morning it was covered in bird droppings. I asked if they could clean my vehicle and they told me to pull to the curb and they would wipe it off. I pulled over and waited 15 minutes and no one ever showed up. So - my experience was just like the Adolphus - Lousy, Noisy and Crappy ...

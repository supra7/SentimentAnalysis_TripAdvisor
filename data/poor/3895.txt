Hey Folks, not sure how I should begin this.... Assuming that there are people out there paying about $ 1,500 for a night at Sheraton in Maui, we could assume a restaurant with an above average quality of food, and Hawaiian inspired love for details, but none of all these...Just paid $250 for two adults and one kid ending eating Spaghetti for Christmas eve. Firstly the food was cold, and not tasty at all, the service was of low average (next guest please..). This is not real Maui, and will never be!!!! Eat a Burger at any corner, this is much more fun!!!!!! Honest rater

Had been looking forward to staying here having looked at the reviews, reality was a little different. I think I have seen a smaller hotel room but after thinking for a week I cannot recall where. We had hoped for a twin rather than a double a request for this was dismissed out of hand with a retort that we should keep checking back to see if one became free. Staff came and removed the keyboard that was with the tv, no note was left to explain this so we thought intruders may have got in, but it was to do with wireless access points. We were out a lot during our six night stay but when we were in the room staff kept knocking on the door to ask if you were OK, when you said no they just stared at you, very strange !. Will not go again.

Hated it Very snobby staff, very small rooms (even if you get a suite), high room tax, expensive parking, the people in the room next to us were smoking pot all night and the gym consists of approximately three treadmills, three stairmasters and one weight machine. The only good thing about this hotel was checking out of it.

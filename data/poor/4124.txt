I often joke with friends about people who complain about hotels on Tripadvisor...but now I know how the cranky travelors feel. We booked the Whitehall hotel through Hotwire for Labor Day weekend. It was supposed to be 4 star, and I've never been as disappointed in a hotel. This place is a dump. It's under construction and the staff is rude. (We had to wake up the front desk person to check us in at midnight last night.) We routinely work from hotels. I knew that this hotel charges for internet, but they charge $10 for every laptop you want to use...so we are paying $30 a day for internet access in this hotel which is outrageous. The room isn't even worth $30. From a typically easy going travelor, take my advice and avoid the Whitehall Hotel. It's a dump.

We booked this hotel for a special "Girls Weekend" and birthday celebration as we were enticed by the advertisements such as: "newly renovated boutique hotel near downtown Chicago." We arrived at the hotel and immediately had the following issues: Their restaurant and bar were not working because of some electrical and licensure issue No room service was available One of the elevators was not working The bellman would not help us with our luggage One room had no A/C during the entire stay We understood that for about one day. However, this occurred during our entire, 3 night stay. We had three rooms booked at this hotel for 2-3 nights. We brought these issues up the hotel and to the hotel manager and they would not do anything about giving us a reduced rate. We brought up directly to the hotel manager that none of the amenities that they offered and/or advertised were available for our use. They did offer us one free ride in their hotel limousine within a 2 mile radius of the hotel for our troubles as well free beer/wine in a conference room and some free pastries for breakfast. However, these amenities were already offered with the hotel, so this was nothing extra! For $250-300 per night we could have stayed across the street at the Four Seasons Hotel AND had all of the amenities that go with such a hotel for that price per night. The Whitehall Hotel has now lost five guests for good, one of which was a travel agent!

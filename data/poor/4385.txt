Old, worn, dark, depressing, odorous are the overall adjectives that come to mind when I think of that hotel. The worst part for us was the small, inconvenient window in the room. When checking in we were asked if we would like to pay $20 extra a night for "60 square feet" more room and free entrance to the tower. We were told it would also put us on the 21st floor versus the 8th floor. We paid the extra. Upon arrival to our room we immediately called the front desk and asked to have our room changed. We were unhappy with the small window and extremely claustrophobic feel of the room and the bathroom. (the bathroom was so small that the sink was in the living area) We were told by the front desk that all of the windows in the hotel are that size so moving would not make a difference. The next day we found we were blatantly lied to as we passed open rooms on the 8th floor that had large windows and much larger bathrooms. Luckily we were only staying 2 nights. There is no coffee pot in the room. The extremely tiny bathroom floor was sloped downward from age so that you feel dizzy when you are sitting on the toilet. As frequent travelers looking to find a deal, we have never ever stayed in a hotel of such poor quality. We planned on spending an entire day at the spa but seeing the quality of the hotel we decided against it.

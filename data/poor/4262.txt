I recently stayed at Harrah's with my husband only to find that he was not the only one sharing my bed, there were bedbugs in it also. The Manager on Duty Christopher Wilbourn laughed at me when I told him there were bedbugs in my room. He told my that you find bedbugs in New York's 4 & 5 star hotel not in Vegas. Later on he told me they have had only one case of bedbugs. Well, what is it.... none or one??? Makes you wonder how many cases they actually have had if they have to hire a third party to take care of all their claims?? I had to ask for a new room he never offered to give me one. You would of thought I had asked for the Presentational suite all I wanted was a bug free room. Harrah's out sources these kinds of problems to a company called CCMSI. Margie from CCMSI called me today and offered me $200 but in order to get the $200 I have to sign a release. What if I brought them home or they are in my car, who would pay to hire an exterminator if I signed a release? The only thing I asked for was for them to reimbursed me my room, she said that she could not do that!! WHAT! Harrah's comps rooms all the time but they cannot reimburse me for my room that had bedbugs in???? Margie did tell me that Harrah's did find bedbugs in our room but yet they cannot reimburse me my room????? What is wrong with this whole picture? I had to go through all my clothes and clean them how do you know if I killed them and what do I do with my shoes? I had to leave our suitcase out in the garage how do I decontaminate them? I could even have them in our car. How do I know if I brought them in our home, wait until I get bit and now I have bedbugs that I have to get rid of. So if you find bugs in your bed at Harrah's do not expect them to comp your room they will probably charge you extra!!!

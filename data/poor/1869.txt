I recently booked a overnight stay at the Boston Park Place Towers, for one when we walked into the room it had a used condom in the trash in which my kids found and was grossed out, the bathrooms need to be updated, hotel room very dusty I used the telephone and it was so dusty my allergies started acting up. I call the manager on duty and she came to our room right away, She changed our room to a suite and that room was not a suite that room was bigger and dusty just like the room we transferred from. I was so upset I checked out of the hotel and went to the Marriott Copley. The pictures online are deceiving, they did not have a flat screen TV nor did it have the beautiful cherry pine desk with the beautiful arm chairs. This hotel should be shut down for renovations, this is not a 3 and half star hotel this a 1 star hotel.

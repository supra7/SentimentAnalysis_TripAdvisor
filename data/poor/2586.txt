I would not recommend this hotel. I had an item stolen from my room. No member of the staff was apologetic regarding the occurrence. I was given three different directions for what exactly to do by three different people. Despite being told I would be contacted, I still have not been received a call from the director of security. Even though the item was not of great expense, I didnt feel safe leaving my room unattended after it occurred. I will never stay at this establishment again.

The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. This was the worst place I have ever stayed, period. The cramped room was cold, the TV didn't work, the hair dryer was broken, it was unclean and the staff, as has been noted, was incredibly rude. What's worse, not only could I hear the people in the next room through the locked common door, but I could SMELL them when they used the bathroom. This place deserves to go out of business, and I am still kicking myself not checking out this site in advance of booking (I go out after one night).

I really enjoy going to Branson with my family & have stayed at numerous hotels. This is about the only truly negative experience with a hotel I have had there. We had to leave early due to an illness on an earlier trip. The hotel gave us a certificate to use for a future stay in lieu of not billing the remainder of stay that we didn't use. I am now having a very hard time getting them to honor the certificate. This is something we have paid full price for and hotel management is completely unwilling to allow us to redeem. Grand Country will definitely get our business.

Drive in with my attorney friend as a passenger to the valet in front of the resort. As the valet was opening my door I was moving my I-Touch to the center console of my car (just to be safe). Upon leaving Wrights restaurant, which was way overpriced for the quality of the food our group received, my friend and I want back to the valet to retrieve my vehicle. After tipping the valet a generously and getting ready to drive away, I opened my center console only to find my I-Touch and cash missing. After and hour of searching my vehicle and filling out a report with the valet manager, I was told that the hotel would make things right with me. After having to file a second claim from Hilton's fraud department, I was told that they would check into the claim and respond within 4-6 weeks. Again, as you could imagine, I was not pleased about their readiness to address the problem. 6 weeks to the date of the claim, I receive a form letter denying my claim, saying that Hilton Hotels is not responsible for any damages or theft . On my behalf, my attorney friend contacted the General Manager of the Biltmore. After another lengthy conversation with management, he was told that either he or I would be contacted the following business day to resolve this matter. That call never came. I feel that the Arizona Biltmore no longer cares about their valued guests. They have lost my future business!

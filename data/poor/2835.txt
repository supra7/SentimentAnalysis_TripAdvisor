I stayed here in December 2010, was really looking forward to my stay as id heard alot and read alot about this hotel!.....Firstly our flight landed at 6.30am...so when we booked this hotel in May we requested an early check in..we were told it was not gaurenteed...fair enough...so when we arrived at the hotel at 7.20 we were told our room wouldnt be ready untill 11.00 and told there was no other rooms available...so we waited(very very tired) in the hotel lobby ....11.10 we asked if it was ready we were told no, 11.45 asked again and the lady at the desk said "oh its been ready for hours"....i was soooo tired i just took the key and went up to my room no complaining....they gave us a room with the freezing air con on full blast and it would turn off...after 4 calls to front desk for help they finally sent a man up to try and fix it...which he didnt...after another 2 calls to the desk they gave us another room "no problem we can get you another room we are very quiet at the moment"the lady at the desk said...yet they kept us waiting in the lobby for nearly 5 hours....Anyway with that over the location was very good...the few more encounters we had with the staff were terrible, they are very stuck up unhelpfull and i felt because of my age (im 21) they just couldnt be bothered me..huffing when ever i asked for travelers cheques to be changed up......on our last night about 12.10am a very large group of teenagers checked in on our floor excitedly running and shouting between rooms we rang front desk and they said they would ask them to quiet down....they didnt....Alll in all was a horrific hotel too worried about looking "hip" and "cool" than looking after their guests...before we arrived in New York we had stayed at Vegas The Bellagio and LA The Beverly Hilton which were a total differnt class to this dump

I checked in, only to find out, their system cut the last day of my trip off, as well as the rate for the block of rooms the 1500 group I was with had settled on. For three days I checked to at the front desk to see if they corrected the rate, ($40 a day should have been removed) Each day I told them I was checking out on Sunday, not Saturday. I was told it was taken care of. On Saturday, I was told at noon, I had 20 minutes to get out of my room, it was booked the night before, and I had to leave. So 799.88 miles from home, with no where else to go at the last minute, I was kicked out of my room. I lucked out, and found space on someone's floor to sleep for a night, while I tried to find somewhere else to go. While there, I found out that 5 other rooms had the same issue, where as a groups we showed up on Wen, some on Thursday, and were all leaving Sunday and Monday, that the hotel started to cut people short, and kick them out of their room, to make room for people showing up for a football game. Locals were given our rooms, while people who traveled from Flordia, Kentucky, Ohio, New York and Washington were sent packing at the last minute with no where to go.

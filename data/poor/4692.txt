The first problem was that, instead of a double room, we were given a twin room with the two beds stuck together, which is quite uncomfortable. On the last day, there was some problem with the toilet, which caused it not work and make a lot of noise. I couldn't contact the owner about this, and so the problem persisted during the night. What struck me the most was the reaction of the owner when I told her about this the following morning. She took a very unfriendly, even aggressive stance, as if we were to blame, and only offered a very unsincere apology. Maybe I was just unlucky, looking at the other reviews. But if I went to Rome again, I would take my chances on one of the many other hotels or B&Bs in the area, which are about the same price.

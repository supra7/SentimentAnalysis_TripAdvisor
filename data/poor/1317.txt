I can not believe all the good ratings for this hotel. The hotel was nasty. The bathroom consist of a small standing shower, even for my father who is fairly skinny it was a tight squeeze. The toliet was right against the bathroom entrance door. Almost all of our towels was stained to a very gross degree. The sink was in the bedroom area, which was held up by two wooden boards. The bed sheets were stained, we ALL slept on top of the comforters. The room was run down and dirty. Not to mention I have never stayed in a hotel down in Ocean City where the seagulls were so loud. The stairs leading up to our room were dirty and there were dead bugs all over them. Honestly if all the other hotels in decent price range hadn't been booked solid, we would have left to another hotel. It was an okay hotel to grab a few z's and a quick shower that night, but I would never rent a room at this hotel again... You couldn't pay me enough to stay here again.The only positives I can list are I have worked at a hotel in my past, so I know what to look for when it comes to bed bugs, which I did once I saw how nasty our rooms were, I did NOT see any signs of bedbugs in the room we were in. Also, the front desk was polite.

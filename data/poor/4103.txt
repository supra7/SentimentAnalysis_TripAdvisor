My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights last week. The hotel is just screaming out for refurbishment. The suites are currently being sold to investors here in Ireland and perhaps the money generated from the sales will go towards a good clean up. The carpets in the reception area and our room were threadbare, badly stained and very, very shabby. The comforter on the bed had definitly seen better days - I would even question letting my dogs sleep on it. There were suspect stains and 'crusty' attachments in places - Awful! The room itself was very dark - although it was only a junior suite located at the back of the hotel. The windows were absolutely filthy. We found the room to be very depressing and it reminded us of a shabby country house of the 'olde Ireland' era of about 50 years ago - shabby, crumpled & best forgotten. No doubt from the other reviews many disagree but this was our experience. We had booked the hotel because we had held our wedding reception in Fitzpatricks Castle Hotel in Dublin a number of years ago - however this branch of the hotel was a very sad disappointment in comparison. On the plus side the location was excellent, the bathroom was small but clean and the towels were nice. The bar was also nicely decorated and had a nice atmosphere. Personally I can only say that I would not stay in this Hotel again, even if the room was for free.

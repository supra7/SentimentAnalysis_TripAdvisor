We believed those who said this hotel was a reasonable value for anyone who just wanted a place to stay. Do not believe it. If this hotel was in the USA mainland, it would be about $40 per night, and you would not stay there. It is in a nice setting, but NOT on the shoreline, as the pictures lead you to believe. There is a busy road between the hotel and the beaches. We found cockroaches right away. They were especially impressive when the ran across you while you were in bed. (Oh, yes, the small, hard musty bed,) We are not amused. We would never stay at this hotel again, under any circumstances.

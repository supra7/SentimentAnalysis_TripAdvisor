Stayed 1 night May 2007, selecting Super 8 Koval Lane based on some reviews on TA and I was desperate. I needed ease of access to the strip for some meetings  and had a place on the strip for the other nights booked  but could not get the first night because of a major conference being held in LV. I called the Super 8 but they told me they would only make a room available on the weekend if I booked 2 nights  so I kept searching and lo and behold, Travelworm had 1 night available at the same Super 8 so I booked it on Travelworm. I arrived early, left my bags and was told my room should be ready by noon. It was not  in fact, it was not ready until 4 pm. I was eventually given a room with queen bed for a price of $139.00 per night plus tax  prepaid on Travelworm. That was a steal for the weekend I was there! The room was basic and clean. Toiletries were of a low-end motel quality. The motel seemed to attract some interesting guests  like the woman who slept for hours outside my door early in the evening, then woke up and called someone on her cell. Same woman was thrown out of the motel at about 2 am; she was outside my door again pounding on the door across the hall screaming. Security told her that her husband had checked out early that day and she had to get out and she would not go as she had no money and no where to go. Needless this made an interesting one night stay  my first and last at this Super 8.

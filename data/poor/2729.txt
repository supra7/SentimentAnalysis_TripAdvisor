This hotel is a filthy dump. To start, online photos are ancient. The place is rundown and threadworn. It also is poorly maintained -- dirt around the floor, soiled furniture in the rooms. It looks like a 1970s hotel that never got an upgrade. With all the places to stay in NYC, look elsehwere. The Intercontinental up the street is very nice and often has rooms online for the same rate. Also, the lobby and front desk are itsy bitsy small, so they cannot accomodate peak periods of people checking in and out -- or all the luggage that must move through the area. And while I was there, they were totally unprepared to also handle another guest's complaints of rude employees while the rest of us waited in line for check in.

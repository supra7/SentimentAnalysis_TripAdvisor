I was very excited to stay at this hotel. I booked 2 nights through Priceline at $115 and $155 per night. Being 4th of July weekend that was pretty good for the city. When we arrived the staff seemed ok, asked to help with luggage. The front desk told us about the hotel restaurant and the morning coffee/tea hour. However, they couldn't even point us to the elevators. The elevators started the smallness of the trip. 4 people were all crammed in with small bags. Once we got to the room we realized how small that was and why they have to offer free coffee in the morning. The room had no coffee maker or even cups. It offered 1 small window without much light, a closet (if you can call that a closet) with a curtain as a door. The bed offered TINY pillows which my head fell off of all night. The air conditioner was very loud and the tv seemed to be hooked up wrong because it took forever to get it to turn on. The bathroom had only a shower with a curtain that barely covered the opening which let water spray all over the floor. the sink was so shallow water would splash out. I did enjoy the toiletries offered including makeup remover clothes and q-tips! Here's the kicker. We got home from a game and tried to get into our room and neither key card worked. I had to go back to the front desk and tell them and his first response, "well, were they by any credit cards?" Seriously, no I'm sorry or let take care of that for you?!?! Where has customer service gone? I want to be comfortable when I'm away from home and I was not at Hotel Felix. We will never stay there again!

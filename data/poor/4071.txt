A group of us stayed at the Best Western Grant Park Hotel because of its proximity to a concert we were attending. The rooms were clean enough. The pool was disgusting. The worst part however, was the service. After the concert, we returned to our room at 1:30am. At 4:45 am the smoke detector battery was dying and the detector was chirping. We called the front desk and were notified that there was nothing she could do until someone else got there at 7am! We were also told to try and dismantle the smoke detector ourselves. Now, none of us had screwdrivers or anything with us, and isn't that a safety/fire hazard????? We had to listen to the loud chirping until 7am when the maintenance staff came up. We paid over $235 for a room we couldn't even sleep in! To make matters worse, we asked for a manager at check out (at 11am) and were told that no one would be in until 2pm! I called the corporate office and was told that they would have someone get back to me. 8 days later, no one has called me back. Corporate said all they could do is suggest to the hotel to contact me. Unacceptable!

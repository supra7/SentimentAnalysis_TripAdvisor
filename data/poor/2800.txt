I had to pay 500 dollars for the room, and when the bellman opened the door, I asked where the room was! This hotel located near Times Square in NYC is so small you can touch the door from your bed (I did!) If you can live with a shoebox sized room for 500 dollars, then there's the bathroom. The sink is the size you would find in a recreational vehicle. There is NO shelf in the shower for soap, shampoo or other amenities, and in the room I stayed in the smell of MILDEW permiated the entire bathroom. Oh yes, I almost forgot there are no washcloths in the bathroom and the only soap from the shower is a shotglass sized bottle of bath gel that is left on the floor of the shower. Ok, you still are sold with the location and can deal with the bathroom and the room. Don't pick up anything in the honor bar you don't want to buy. The thing is rigged to charge you if you pick something up.

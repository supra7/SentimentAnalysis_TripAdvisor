The hotel is very close to a runway that is used all night by FedEx heavy freighters. The building shakes as the planes take off all night long. The hotel is worn and drab. The employees are bored and disinterested. The restaurant offerings are limited and poor quality. This is the worst experience I have had in over 40 years of traveling. This is where Delta lodges traveler whose travel has been disrupted.

I booked at Hotel Diva due to the good reviews at tripadvisor but I can not give this hotel a good review. I stayed there for 3 nights. The first night they put us on the 2nd floor, which was noisy and small. You can barely fit two people in the restroom. Plus, we were too close to the street. I asked if we can get a room at a higher level which they gave us for the rest of our stay. We stayed on the 5th floor. The room was bigger and away from the street. Thinking we would be noise free for our 2nd night stay, I was wrong. The whole night our ceiling was creeking from the floor above us, obviously the floors and walls were too thin. I can not recommend this hotel to anyone. When I got moved up to the 5th floor, I left my expensive facial soap in the first room we were booked in and when I went to see if the maids had returned it to lost and found, they did not. Also, the hotel charged me twice for the water bottle they put in the room. I tried contacting them twice and did not get an answer back, I am still waiting for them to charge back the water they mis-billed me for.

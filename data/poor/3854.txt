This hotel was awful. Luckily we stayed only one night, and then went to Napili for the remainder of our trip. It was so dirty, mildowy, bug ridden, old and falling apart I couldn't even fall asleep in this room. My girls swam in the murky pool and their hair turned instantly green! I am serious. They are both on the swim team and swim 4 days a week and never had green hair. Someone did not know how to manage the pool chemicals. It has taken a week to get the green out. Even my 9 year old was grossed out, and didn't like this hotel. It needs a TOTAL remodel. It has honestly run down, and nobody is investing in it's upkeep. The decor was out of 1981. THe TEENY tiny beach was non existent, and rocky. Wasn't even safe to swim in. Keep searching, there are a lot better places on Maui to stay. BEWARE!

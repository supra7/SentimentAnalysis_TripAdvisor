Well just returned from Vegas after staying at this Hotel. I'll keep this very simple. Great hotel, 5 star standards. Bar shuts at midnight that's ok Bit later Fri/Sat/Sun Pool nice! No Casino, which makes more peaceful BUT!!! For the life of me!! Why put this hotel next to the Train crossing where the train driver blasts the horn at all hours? 2am - 3am - 3:30am and so??? EVEN MORE!!! WHY DON'T YOU WARN YOUR CUSTOMERS ON THE WEBSITE BEFORE BOOKING? Hold don't answer that last question no need to! All in all if you like quality and train horns through the night, then stay here. Even the cab driver who picked us up from here asked how the train noise was! P.S I did bring this problem to the reception on check out, there answer was 'there is nothing they can to to control the trains'. I replied ' You could warn your customers before booking'. No answer! Just handed me the invoice!

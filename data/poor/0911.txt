It is by no means 5 stars. Sure it's one of the cheapest hotels for a 5 star hotel but I guarantee the service at the 4 star hotels would surpass this one by a long shot. First of all valet service took a lot of time even during early afternoon, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for our car. We could not even call down for our car earlier thus more wasted time. I asked for connecting rooms 2 months before my reservation, they said that would accomodate me and our 2 rooms ended up being on completely different floors. Our neighbors were loud college frat boys that had some keg party in their room. Seeing that it was past midnight and I had been stuck in traffic for six hours, I politely asked for a change in rooms which was not accomodated. They said I could make a noise complaint and that was it. I did order room service which was overpriced and I was given the wrong item. The server than proceeded to bring back the actual item that I ordered and expected a tip! HA. Laughable. The location was not too bad since it wasn't that far of a walk to the Wynn which is a much better hotel. My advice splurge for the Bellagio or the Wynn or even stay at the MGM grand. The stay will be much better there.

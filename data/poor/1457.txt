What a shock!!! Dropped off at the rear enterance of the hotel which had bins outside full of foul smelling rubbish and the place next door was boarded up with flyers on the wall. I'd had lovely hotels during my stay and my travel agent made the worst choice of his life. The hotel room was dirty (vomit between the bed and bedside cupboard) holes in the bedsheets, rest of the bedding rather grubby too dark dingy room extremely cramped. Bathroom left a lot to be desired. The main street to the front of the hotel was full of sex shops. Only good thing about this place was the location which made it really easy to get around the city and beyond. Food was terrible oh! And if you want a decentish breakfast try the backpackers hotel over the road.

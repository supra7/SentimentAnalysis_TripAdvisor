Do not stay here! This hotel is absolutely terrible. The first time I stayed here I was having dinner with my coworkers in the downstairs restaurant, and we saw a rat run across the floor. As I have no choice where I stay for work, I found myself at this hotel just over a month later. I wanted to give it a second chance, thinking perhaps they took some care to the issue. I got into my hotel room, and there were black hairs all over the bath tub. Not going to kill me, but it's still disgusting. Slept the night, and woke up in the afternoon and was sitting on my bed watching tv. I got a little bit of an wary feeling, looked down beside my bed and there was a MOUSE! Filthy! I wanted to vomit. I talked to other colleagues who also found rodents in their rooms. Don't waste your money staying here and risk getting sick.

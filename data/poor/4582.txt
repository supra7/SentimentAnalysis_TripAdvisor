Made a reservation for the hotel via priceline for two people (traveling with a friend). I called the hotel to make sure tow get a room with 2 bed (we're not that close friends :-) Besides being pretty rude, I was told that this would be an extra $40 (almost doubling the bill) and there may or may not be a room available. This makes planning ahead impossible since we will need a room with two beds. When I complained about that, the reservation agent got even more rude, referring to "company policy" (anybody who works in a large company knows what that means). Their blurb on the website about making customer service standards sounds pretty hollow. The bottom line is that after this kind a treatment I don't even want to stay there anymore - before I actually arrived. That must be record.

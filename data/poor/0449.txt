Do not stay at this hotel. Aside from the overall rundown condition, the room was filthy (dirty carpet and mold in bath surround). Management was uncooperative and combative when dealing with even the smallest issue such as an extra towel (only two being provided for a group of four guests). I witnessed several situations when guests were arguing with management. To add insult to injury, I was double-charged on my visa bill for the experience! Do not stay at this hotel.

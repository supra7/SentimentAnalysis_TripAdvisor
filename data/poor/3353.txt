This is the least family friendly facility I have ever stayed in. Room was not cleaned, entire facility dated. Lots of parties and noise on surrounding balconies and in the pool areas. I was stopped by hotel staff while getting in the pool with my four children and yelled at for not having wristbands (never mentioned at check in). We transferred after one night.

Total hype with bad service This is the worst hotel I have stayed in. I have enjoyed Schrager hotels in NYC and London, but the Clift SF completely fell short of my expectations. The lobby and interior was hip, but the staff needs training in hotel management and good manners. The staff provided nothing but bad service to the point that I cut my stay short. This hotel attracts an obnoxious 20-something crowd looking for a drama/nighmare scene. I love hip hotels, but in a city that has so many great hotels, do yourself a favor and stay someplace else.

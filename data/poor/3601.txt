Horrible Experience We have family memebers checking out of the Marina Inn tomorrow. Although the rooms are fine (think motel decor, clean enough), the service is atrocious. We are residents of San Francisco, and wanted our relatives to be close to us in the Marina. Making the reservation was a hassle, but finally we got a room with a queen size bed (although we had wanted 2 beds). On the first morning, our relatives were woken with a note and a knock on the door saying that they had to change rooms, there had been a mistake on the hotel's part. So, with no help, they re-packed and moved rooms. No compensation or discount of any kind was offered for their inconvenience. Saturday morning my relatives went on a day trip to Napa, and I received a call at home informing me that their things would be removed from their room because they had missed check-out. However, our reservations did not end until the following day. After a heated discussion I was finally told it would be fixed, and was promptly hung up on.Needless to say, with all the hotels in San Francisco, this Inn is run by incompetent and rude people who think nothing of disrupting their guests. The average rate of $125 is appalling. If you are staying in the Marina/Cow Hollow area, I would strongly (I cannot stress this enough) stay either at a downtown hotel or at the Hotel Del Sol just down the street from the Marina Inn. It's about $10 to $20 more a night, but clearly worth the money.As a local in the area, my bad experience with the Marina Inn does not stand alone - I wish I had listened and avoided this hotel.

very small room was tolerable but bathroom door wouldn't close, view was of fire escape and brick wall and loud plumbing sprayed water when other guests flushed! they finally changed us second night to more acceptable room but still would not recommend as tour agent for hotel spoke broken english and knew very little about area. Desk clerk seemed inconvenienced by our request for another room. They left window to fire escape open with our luggage in room, broke lock on window so anyone could have entered from that floor.

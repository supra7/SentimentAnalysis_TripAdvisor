I made a reservation for 6 nights and within 24 hours (barely after the confirmation hit my email in box) I had a family emergency I had to attend to and my secretary called to cancel the reservation. I obviously did not show up. Later I get a phone call stating that since I did not show up they were going to charge me over $12,000.00 for NOTHING, they say they were never contacted. I contacted American Express to dispute the charge and Auberge refused to compensate me for anything. I have contacted them again and asked for a reasonable response and I am waiting to hear back. I am expecting a class act response from a class act hotel but the jury is out. I will report back to the post with their comments. If that is the case I would not accept their cancelation policy or at least modify it so that you are protected as a consumer against this exorbitant penalty for their lack of ignoring the call my secretary made. Since the amount is so high, it may be worth a lawsuit in small claims court but I will hold on to my options until I see what they come up with.

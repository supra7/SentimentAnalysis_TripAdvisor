If I was bringing a hooker back to some seedy hotel, this is where I would go. The rooms are about 12'x12' and the bed squeaks every time you move. No water glasses, tin tiny soap bars, and a broken smoke detector, add to the ambience of this fine establishment. The bathroom is about the size of a closet. We found a smoked cigarette butt floating in the toilet, in our non-smoking room. Shows exactly how much the owners care about cleanliness. I ended up paying for parking, since the underground parking lot was full. This feat of manueverig only took 20 minutes of my time, since the idiot at the front desk obviously did not keep track of anything. The tv in the room got all 4 basic cable channels, so I guess thats a plus. Only stayed here because all other hotels were booked. How the owners get away with changing $100 is beyond me! The best part of staying here was getting out of the room. Avoid this dump at all costs, unless you have some kinky hooker fantasy going on, or want to experience how people in communist Europe used to live.

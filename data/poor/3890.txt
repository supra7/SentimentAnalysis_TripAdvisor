I've read all the bad reviews here and figured it was just from people who expected too much from a bargain hotel. Boy was I wrong. I recently stayed here for 4 nights. Upon arrival, I upgraded to the oceanfront rooms as recommended. I was on the ground floor and the hotel gave me this paper warning of possible thefts/attacks by keeping the door open. I also had to sign a form saying since I did not want to pay to use the safe the hotel was not responsible for any thefts that occurred. Not the best way to start out. I drove to the ocean building and had trouble fitting my midsize car in the parking spots. When I got to the room, I was in shock. The sliding door opened onto the ocean, but the door did not seal completely allowing both cockroaches and centipedes to crawl unobstructed into the room. I actually had to ask the housekeeper to remove the cockroches trapped between the screen and the door. When the centipede came into the room, I had to contact the front desk. They were accomodating and moved me to the next floor up. The doors sealed, and not as many bugs in the room. The bottoms of the furniture did look like they were rotting, and the wall paper was peeling off the walls. There was also mold in the shower area. I realize this is a tropical location, and these things are actually common place, but I take many business trips to Maui and they just seemed to really stand out at this hotel. I have stayed at other bargain hotels here without these types of warnings, or problems. While the price was definitely tempting, I know I will not stay here again, until they do some serious cleaning and renovation.

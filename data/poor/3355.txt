I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. After this experience, I would not recommend any Holiday Inn, Expedia, or even Ocean City to anyone. When we made our recommendation, we called what we thought was the holiday inn reservation line. When the Expedia representative answered the phone, he simply stated " reservation line". We were assured a non-smoking room and were put in a smoking room that smelled of smoke so severely, it was as if we were smoking. I think the rooms have adjoining vents. We complained to numerous staff members and were told repeatedly there was "nothing they could do". We were told we have to call Expedia with any complaints (about their hotel?). When I called Expedia, I was told there was "nothing they could do" and that I should have complained to the hotel staff while I was there. Long story short, neither place was helpful and my children with severe allergies were uncomfortable the entire stay. Please take my advice and do not stay at this hotel and DO NOT use Expedia/Hotel planner for reservations. The hotel itself is a 2 star at best. Very disappointed in the dishonesty and total lack of concern that both Holiday Inn and Expedia displayed. Promising a person non-smoking and then saying "there is nothing we can do" should be illegal. You are selling a product, knowing that product is not at all what is expected or promised to the customer, just to make a dollar.

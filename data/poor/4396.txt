When I booked this trip, I knew the Stratosphere was one of the older hotels and I expected to find it slightly outdated and possibly even shabby in a of couple ways; What I am trying to say is that I had modest expectations given the age, location, and price of the hotel. What I did not expect was a hotel room that looked more like it belonged in a flea bag freeway motel rather than on the Las Vegas strip. There were no pictures/art on the wall, but plenty of nail holes, the ceiling in the bathroom was stained with rust, the sink was mega old school and not mounted to a cabinet unit but rather freely to the wall with a tiny, tiny shelf next to it for your things which did not even fit a normal sized cosmetics bag let alone three as there were three of us travelling, the sink was loose from the wall, the walls were paper thin and we could hear everything above, below and beside, and, to top it all off, the room smelled like an ashtray even though there was a 'non-smoking' placard on the door. Even the smoker in our group was put off by the smell. It was one of our group's first time to Vegas and I was so embarassed having been the one who picked the hotel. Considering the cost of the taxi cabs to get to the rest of the strip, any other strip hotel would have been better and probably ended up being cheaper!

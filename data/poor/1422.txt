Hotel Aniene is a small, nice hotel but some of the staff are very rude and racist to my opinion. I stayed there for three weeks for business because it was 10 mn ride from my workplace. After the first week, the reception clerk called me and said that I should start paying my bill right now, because my credit card (Corporate Amex card by the way!) might not work on my last day! I didn't know what to think. But I went ahead and gave him the credit card and he charged it. I am black and I don't to think that people act toward me in a certain way because of my color, but in this case I believe that this guy was plain racist. It is sad that based on your color, people can make assumptions, and actually act upon those assumptions. I will not return to this hotel, I wish I paid almost 2,000 euros to another institution! So people do not encourage this behavior by staying at that place!

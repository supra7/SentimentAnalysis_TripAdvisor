the dolphins The sight of 6 beautiful Dolphins working 8 hrs a day to entertain tourists spoiled the whole experience for me. They are impossible to avoid, in the Hotel grounds .They are photographed kissing tourists and must perform tricks with food as a reward and I dont understand that anyone believes that tourists have a right to entrap and keep captive such wonderful creatures, just because they like to look at them and laugh at their antics. Very depressing .

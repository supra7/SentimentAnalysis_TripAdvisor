For all of you that steered us to this hotel... please say you are sorry! First of all, we arrived at the property which is at the end of the island in Makena, quite a ways from Wailea. Our room was not ready, so we walked out to the beach and to the bar. No one was there, except a woman who told us that the rooms were "not what I expected, our refrigerator was old and the room was dated". From that point we were a bit leary. We then checked in, only to find our our "oceanview" room was not that at all, if we moved to the end of our lanai, we could barely even see the ocean!! The room was quite old and there were bugs flying around. YUCK!!! We complained to the mgmt and after 3 hours on the phone with Expedia trying to change hotels, the night manager told us he would upgrade us to his "best" room. Well, it was basically the same old, dated, and dreary decor. NO! Expedia finally told us we could change hotels but they would not credit our act for 7 days, but we were so disappointed with the hotel, we stayed for one night and happily moved on up to the Ritz Carlton, a gorgeous hotel in Kapalua...for a higher price, of course. The night manager of the Prince tried to apologize by sending us a free botle of complimentary champagne. Too bad it was their "house", 2005 vintage.... it gave us a headache! Overall, the "Pauper" is a very poor hotel, with bad service, ugly rooms... what more is there to say?? Save your $300.00 per night and stay elsewhere... 4 stars it is NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

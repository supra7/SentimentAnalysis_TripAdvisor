I write this review whilst still in the hotel half way through my visit. 1 first night after a long international flight we went to our room and we found we needed an extra blanket I sent my daughter down to reception to get one she was told there were some in the room there was not, we were to tired to go down again turned up heating. Next morning on the way out again asked for a blanket we're told that we would get one also told reception about bedroom doors sqeaking in room was told this would be fixed came back that day no blanket and still queaky doors. Next morning went for shower no shampoo replacement, wet I searched through suitcase and found some. Later that day I came back to the room (still queaky door) and decided to have a sleep I put do not disturb sign on the door about one hour later I was awoken by the phone it was receptionist to tell me engineer was at the door to fix squeaks (it goes on I kid you not ) I rang to speak to general manager to complain I got man named cris I asked if I could speak with him (he did not offer to come up to me) he said he was in reception so I told him I would be right down, when I got to reception I was told he was on the phone after waiting a few minutes he came out and introduced himself and got my name wrong ( I only talked to five minutes before and I got his name right) . Conclusion so far Staff need retraining by competent management . Now I feel better

I cant believe they have the audacity to call this place a resort. The hotel is very old apartment buildings that look like the projects. The photos that are online are no where near what you get when you arrive. The rooms have a nasty stench to them that can not be covered up, and the furniture looks like they picked it up at a garage sale. For $150.00 a night I expect a lot more than they provided. Dont be fooled.. This place is a RIP OFF.

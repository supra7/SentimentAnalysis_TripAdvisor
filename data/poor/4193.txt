Stayed at the Sheraton June 21-27 for a local convention. Paid $149.00 a night room were cramped but clean. I was shocked to see the $12.95 internet charge to use internet in you room. As I deal with sensitive material, I did not feel that it would be safe to be in an open area. Most larger hotels now have free internet...No reason they should not here. My main complaint stems from the horrible service we had in the lounge. After consuming a few adult beverages some colleagues decided to head to across town 20 minutes away. I decided to remain at the lounge and grab a burger and another drink which did come in a relatively fast time. I asked for my check to be brought with my burger, but it was not. After finishing my drink and burger 30 minutes went by and still no check and no waitress. I found another and told her what was happening and she said she would get it fixed. Fifteen minutes later still no check. Mr friends had returned from their trip with a total time gone of over 1.5 hours while i ate and waited for my check...so I had enough and left. Next evening I went back to see about the check and they were having fits because I "skipped out" and wanted to add a "automatic gratuity" to the check. I have no problem paying my bills, but I really think staff should not abandon their patrons and I think I was in every bit of the right to leave after waiting 45 minutes for the bill after eating...My Server's name was Maggie and this occurred June 24,2010

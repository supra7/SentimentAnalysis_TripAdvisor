The Mama Shelter looks the part, although the surrounding streets do look a little run down, venture too far from the hotel and you can feel very uncomfortable very quickly if you choose the wrong direction. Anyway back to the hotel. It's new, with fresh styling and very helpful desk staff. The rooms are a little cramped (but they tell you this on the website) and the bar and restaurant look fantastic. As other reviews have said, the price of drinks and food in the hotel are high (higher than central Paris restaurants) but the food and service are excellent. The down-side, unfortunately while we were out the maid decided to help herself/himself to the contents of my wallet, you wouldn't expect to need to use a safe in a hotel where you need a room key to operate the lifts and have to use 2 lifts to get to the 7 floor. This was very disappointing. The desk staff were very helpful but the management just didn't care, after proving only myself and the maid had been in the room the managing director stated that no further action would be taken. The police weren't interested and gave me a crime report to register in the UK. Unfortunately this wasn't the only occurrence; other friends in the hotel had come back to their room to find their door open (fortunately only small amounts of cash missing). Why did I leave my wallet in the room - I was running the Paris marathon, it wasn't really practical to run with it. Lesson learned - just a shame that a hotel with the aspirations of the mama shelter has stooped this low. On a side note - there is a bouncer on the door in the evening - this may give you a hint to the type of area you are in. The bar/club across the road is very popular, but expect there to be a moderate amount of noise in the evening of the weekends.

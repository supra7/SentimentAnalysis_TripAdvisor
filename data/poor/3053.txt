I recently stayed at this resort to meet with friends and relax with the family. As part of the stay, I purchased an extra Oasis Access band for $30. The charge for the ban is per day for the length of your stay UNLESS you return the ban to the front desk. After a day at the pool, I returned the ban to make sure I would not be charged for the extra days and I was assured the charge would only be for the day of use. To make sure, I went by the next morning and I again was told everything was fine. On the day of checkout, the lines were long and I had to leave to catch a flight. I called to have my invoice sent to me and noticed that I was charged an extra day for the band. I called the front desk and was attacked by the customer service representative that I did not follow the rules. I've stayed at several Phoenix resort properties and it's sad to say that this is not one of them. If you have young children and need to relax and not be bothered with the hassle of being charged for everything under the sun and then questioned on your invoice, I would go to Hilton Squaw Peak. Check it out before you book your trip.

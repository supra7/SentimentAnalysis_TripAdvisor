When reading the glowing reviews I wondered if this was the same place, or if the hotel had done a quick-fast full renovation since we were there. No, looking at the photos, it seems to be same place. Sure, they didn't show the skankier rooms, like where we stayed, or the big glass barrier from behind which business is done. Or allude to the "regulars" who have been known to come and go from here. The hotel is on one of the loveliest streets in the West Village. The outside is quaint and old-school and gives the feeling of a serene but well-apointed smaller hotel. We asked to see a few rooms before we signed in. One had a window that faced an ally, but nothing in the way of even meager security on that window. One looked out at the back, also on first floor, also with minimal security. Single bed, with nubby white bedspread, broken dresser that surely was taken in from off the street, a large plastic garbage can, and something like a faux oil painting in a frame. Tiny room. Looked like where a pauper would live. Price: much higher than it should be. And yet... the kids and the 'dollar-conscious' keep coming here. I think they're being fooled. there's much better that you can get for the same price.

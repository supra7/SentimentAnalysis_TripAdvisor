If you're looking for a great time in New York, check THE TIMES off your list! For $315 a night (1 bedroom suite), this hotel was a major ichhhhhhh! During a January stay, our room registered at a balmy 82 degrees. Hotel maintenance came up to fix it while we went out to dinner. When we returned, we found that the door was left "propped" open with all of our belongings ready for the taking. The hotel management's response was, "Oh sorry. Maintenance was just up in your room a few minutes ago." To top it off, the room temperature was never correct during our 4-night stay. Then, as if this wasn't bad enough, our room did not get cleaned one night. When we came back to find a messy room, we were told that it was too late for Housekeeping to take care of things. Housekeeping missed our room the next day, too. After two calls, though, our room did get cleaned at about 5:30 p.m. From the moment we encountered the surly front desk clerk, I knew that prepaying my hotel stay was a BIG mistake!!

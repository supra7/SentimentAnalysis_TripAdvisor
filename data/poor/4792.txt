I was disgusted with this hotel. We booked our reservations online and they were offering $60 a night. We arrived at Doubletree and learned that they charge $14/day just to park there. What was horrible about this was that there is nothing you can do about it once you arrive! You have to pay it!! There is nowhere to park without being towed. Then we learned that to use their wi-fi, it's $12/day. Why not just make the room $86 and include these things in the price? I wanted my vacation to be paid for when I arrived so I didn't have to worry about such petty things. Breakfast was around $16-$19 per person. It would have been nice to have known in advance about these fees. The room I stayed in had one pathetic excuse for an air conditioning unit on the wall. This did not get the room cooled down at all. The lights needed to be changed and the drains were all very slow. The staff at the front desk were rude. They never said hello and didn't bother to thank us for staying there when we checked out. I wouldn't reccomend this place to my worst enemy. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

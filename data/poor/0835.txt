We stayed here in january 2011. Some reasons for not staying here: 1 kilometer dark bumpy road to get to the hotel from the main road between cancun and playa. took about 10 minutes to drive that kilometer. annoying when traveling back and forth the playa centrum beacuse the food was not impressive in the hotel. the quality of the building truly sucks in many ways. the shower, the balcony etc. the room was very humid when we stayed there beacuse the wind from the ocean went right tru the balcony doors so much that our clothes became damp and did smell bad beacuse of it. we changed to a suite but same problem but beacuse of the roof was made of some kind of hay. The beach was also a dissapointment beacuse you need to have shoes on when you enter the water. it was full of rocks on the bottom. i didnt see that in the pictures!!! The staff was not very nice some of them rude except for Jesus. He did his best! Thanks for that!! We changed hotel after four nights we should have stayed 10. We changed to Hotel Basico in playa center! We saved 1,5 hour in taxi trips each day and the beach was great just one block from the hotel and you didnt need shoes to take a dive into the ocean!!!!!

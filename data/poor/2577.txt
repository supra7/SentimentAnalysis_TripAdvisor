Beautifully decorated but that's where it ends. Elegant hotel in a urine-soaked neighborhood thinks it's better than it's own guests. It says it has 24-hour room service but you can't even get a danish with your coffee before 6am. We have an early departure due to flight. And they charge $15/day for WIFI when at every other hotel we've been to in New Orleans gave us FREE WIFI (no surprise fees!)...I'm getting a great deal of satisfaction using their WIFI to leave them this review right now!

I checked in for a recent 3 night stay. Had to wait on a line for 20 minutes to check in. The woman at the front desk assured me she would look up my Starwood preferred guest # and add it to my stay-she never did. The room was tiny, which I accept in NYC: it still had potential. I called the concierge to help with a dinner reservation and got voicemail-left a message and never heard back. Upon departure, I tried to call to have my car brought around by the valet-again no answer. I ultimately went downstairs to find 3 front desk personnel with one customer-not exactly swamped, yet I still had to wait as they pecked away at their computers. We then went out to pick up our car and 2 doormen basically ignored us-we loade our luggage ourselves. I have stayed at many hotels in NYC and this was by far the worst service I have seen. I believe there is a culture of poor service here. The final kicker-I called the manager 3 days ago to express my concern and still have not heard from them. Maybe I know where the culture begins.

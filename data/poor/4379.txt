I booked a romantic spa Suite in this hotel for better price. When i called them, i was assured that i will be given any floor above 15th floor with strip view. when i reached there i had a shock to see a backside room in 12th floor. The staff was rude and he wouldnt listen to me. Locationwise, this is way away from the strip. you cannot walk from the strip to here and you cannot drive either( because of the traffic). So please avoid and stay in some hotel in the strip.you would be better off to stay in Ballys or planet hollywood than this. Please avoid.

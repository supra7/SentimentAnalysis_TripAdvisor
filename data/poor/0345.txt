A recent trip to the Westin Seattle left me frustrated and angry. I was charged $12 to make a toll-free call. Should have used my cell. In the room across from me, my nephew opened the minibar, pulled out some M&Ms and asked his mom if he could have them. She told him no and he put them back. She was charged $7.00 for that. She was also charged another $7.00 for using the refrigerator. Adding insult to injury, neither of us could talk to anyone at the front desk about these charges. They only take inquiries by email for billing issues. Even LaQuinta treats us better than this.

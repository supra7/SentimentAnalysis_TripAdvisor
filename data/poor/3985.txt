We have stayed here before and previous stays were great. That is the reason why we came back again. However, we were disappointed this time. We reserved 'Superior Room' in previous stays and this time as well. However, the room turned out to be different from the past. It is a King Sized Bed in a 'Classic Room', about 270 ft'. We then questioned the front desk. He replied that 'this room is categorized as one of the "superior rooms". He was sorry but nothing can be done. We paid more for the 'Superior Room', but got the same space of "Classic Room". Another issue was with the house-keeping. Around 11AM in the morning, I left the room and saw the house-keeping cleanning next door. We had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign while my wife was still in the room. Not long after I left the room, my wife heard someone knocking on the door lightly. She ignored it since the sign was up. Next thing you know, the house-keeping came in. My wife was very upset because she was still in the bathroom getting ready. The house-keeping lady apologized and said she did not see the sign, then left. To us, that's unacceptable. It's their daily job. How can they not see the big pink sign on the door knob?? Later, we reported to the front desk. There are many hotels in the same area for the same cost. We feel that we overpaid and had no privacy. We will no longer stay here in the future.

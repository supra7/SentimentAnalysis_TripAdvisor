I made several bookings with easyHotel for this summer, and ended up having to cancel two of them. When I went online to cancel the bookings, I was told I would have to pay a cancellation fee. NOWHERE on that page did it say that no refunds were given - that my account would merely be credited. I will admit it mentioned in Terms and Conditions that in case of a cancellation, a refund would be given, but easyHotel never said that a refund would not be given under any circumstances. What a horrible policy - be advised!

very noisy hotel I am sitting in my hotel room at the Andrews Hotel at 7.30 am on a Saturday morning. I have had only 1 and a half hours sleep. I have to say this is the noisiest hotel and location I have ever stayed in. The walls are paper thin and I can hear the conversations the guys next door are having. The plumbing is noisy too. Last night the street noise was loud and a party seemed to start near by that didn't finish until 5.30. People started rising at 6 so as one source of noise ended another began. I am normally a very good sleeper and never stay awake all night. But I couldn't sleep at the Andrew's hotel. At 4.30 I spoke to the front desk about the noise outside and the concierge did check outside but couldn't locate the source of the 'party' noise. Staff are friendly here. You have to take your own bags to room. Breakfast is very basic muffins and croissants laid out in hallway so you have to eat in own room.Good restaurant on first floor Fino. Excellent value Italian. Had stayed here 6 years ago and didn't remember any noise problems.I'm going to be really tired today and we have a day planned. Its spoiled my weekend and I wouldn't ever choose this hotel again because of the noise.

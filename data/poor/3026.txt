Was in town for a convention and the Hyatt was full. So I tried the San Carlos. I thought that for $170+ a night (weekend), it would be OK. Well, if you are a business traveler, you may want to avoid it. The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The wireless internet connection (essential for business travelers) did not work well, to say the least. The only working connection was a cable in a small office room on the ground floor. The room was small, the bathroom decrepit (with paint peeling from the wall, worn out fixtures, etc.). They charged me $0.75 for 1-800 calls even when the book in the room explains that they would only charge for local calls, and refused to remove the charges. Try the Wyndham, which is just next to the Hyatt.

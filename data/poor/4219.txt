This hotel doesn't deserve the stars it has been given. The hotel is in serious need of an update. I heard there were some newer rooms but I stayed in an older room. The check in and check out takes forever. There was always a long wait at reception and to get in a lift. There was an awful (sewage like) smell in the lobby of the hotel that remained for the duration of my stay, which was one week. The rooms are seriously outdated and shabby. The beds are so hard- you may as well be sleeping on a brick wall. The smell in my room was unbearable- it was a combination of mould, decaying animal masked with room deodoriser. It was unbearable. I went to the effort to purchase a scented candle to mask the odour, but in fact it made it much worse. The hotel is attached to the conference centre- which is good if you are doing business there and it is also right by the ferry terminal. Those are the only redeeming qualities I was able to find in this place. It really was a miserable experience.

Folks, this place has seen its better days. My husband and I have been traveling to Chicago for more than 20 years and have stayed at the Swissotel many times. It used to be such a lovely hotel but it is really worn out now and it just seems to get worse every year. Fixtures in the bathrooms are rusted, furniture is old and banged up, the beds are uncomfortable, the pillows worn out, etc. And, they have raised the parking rates to $49 per day! We'll never go back. Such a shame...

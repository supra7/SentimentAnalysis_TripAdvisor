The worst dump. Don't be fooled. This is not really a hotel. It is part hotel and part hostel. It was so gross I could not even spend one night there. Most rooms have bunk beds and share a hall bath. We check out immediatly and went to the Super 8 in Midtown on 46th. Great hotel, great location for the same price.

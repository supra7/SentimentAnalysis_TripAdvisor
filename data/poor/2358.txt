I booked this hotel for a repeat trip. We stayed there a few years ago and it is a nice hotel in a good location. I booked the hotel through Expedia and got a package deal including a rental car. My receipt included free parking. Upon checkout, I was surprised to find a $17.50/day plus tax resort fee charged to my credit card. To begin with, this is not a resort. No golf course, private beach, tennis court or anything one would not expect in a nice Hampton Inn. I called Expedia and they "updated" my itinerary after I had paid by including a $15.00 resort fee. This seems like fraud to me as the original booking did not include it.

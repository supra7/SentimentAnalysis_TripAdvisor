i have stayed at the w in atlanta many times. the rooms there are fabulous. so i booked the w in new york for $500 per night. the room was ridiculous. the carpet was dirty, the bed horrible, and you had to stand to the side of the door to close the bathroom door. no joke - the combo room/bath is smaller than my bathroom at home. there was no place for your luggage, no storage space only a very tiny dark closet. the shower water did not drain properly - i could go on and on. my husband and i were so cramped that we were miserable. i called the desk for a larger room - none available the "wonderful room" is FAR from wonderful!!!!!

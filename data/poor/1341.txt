Unable to stay here due to flight disruption Kept them up to date as best i could via e.mail regarding possible disruption to travel due to ash from volcano. they never once responded to my mails as soon as easy jet cancelled the flight i contacted them again. they still charged me 330 euro never stay with here is my advise. cant say what the hotel was like...never got there, and never will now!

Stayed only one night (thank goodness) Reserved a junior suite. 4 adults Plumbers putty around bar tap to stop leak! Pulled out couch to sleep on only to discover dirty towels underneath. Bedding for couch on top shelf on closet not sure really if they were clean. Ugly, dark shower......refused to use in the morning. Should not have stayed or atleast asked for a better room if possible. Paid for the view I guess because it was not the room shown on the web pages!

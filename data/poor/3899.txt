We cut our stay short due to the incredibly rude, arrogant, and inconsiderate staff. From the start, we could tell this hotel excelled in poor service. At check-in the front desk person had poor skills and a lack of personality, and made it very clear they do not appreciate guests. When we went to our room, we found someone in it! Incompetency reigns! We called the front desk and they were baffled, and could not figure out what happened. Took forever for them to resolve this. Seemed to imply that this was somehow our fault?? Made us wait... (it was a simple solution - just deliver keys to us for the room next door). They sent security to check to the ID of the person in the room, who as a paying guest with room keys on her 4th night?? Really? Later, that same security person harassed my 11 year old son for resting his arm on fence while we tried to watch a whale. Really? Scolded for resting an arm on a fence? From there it went downhill. We tried to avoid the front desk at all costs, but when forced to interact, their insolence made it intolerable. We met only one person at the front desk who had a clue, the rest were untrained, rude and very unprofessional. The rooms have not been updated in a very long time, and we expected a higher level of cleanliness. After 4 days of poor service mediocre rooms, we left and went to the Hyatt, where the service was exceptional and we felt incredibly welcome! What an amazing difference. Professional, friendly, helpful. Not rude, curt, arrogant or unhelpful. The only redeeming quality of this property is that a few of the servers in the restaurant understand excellent service. They should kick the front desk workers to the curb, and bring the servers up to work on the desk, and to greet guests and create a welcoming environment. Would not recommend this property and advise against staying there. We will not return - ever.

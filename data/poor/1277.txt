Pictures in thier gallery is NOT what you get. What a DUMP!! When the door keys didn't work the first time we should have left. Yes it was a sign!!!! Lots of mold in both rooms, molded food left in molded refidge, dirty carpet, peeling wallpaper AND paint, bugs in bed, TV didn't work, afraid to turn lights out. VERY SCARY!!! Even after requesting different rooms, they ALSO were just as terrifying!!! IF YOU BOOK ONLINE, NO REFUNDS!!!! And that was the reason why we stayed. In retrospect we should have cut our losses and SCRAMMED!!! We were SCARED to bathe for fear of being attacked by mold or bugs or Catching some kind of disease!!! NO JOKE!!! DON'T BE ENTICED BY THE LOW RATE!!! YOU MAY NOT MAKE IT OUT ALIVE!!!

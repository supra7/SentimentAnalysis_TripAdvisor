We stayed here Easter Weekend, April 5-8, 2007. Booked here for what I was assured was a "two person Jacuzzi", which turned out to be a one person Jacuzzi. Hot breakfast is either microwaved or crock-pots, and limited seating. We did not receive fresh towel service (until we called and requested them) or have our beds made (though they did pick up soiled towels). About a half hour later the maid would have barged into our room if I hadn't had the door dead bolted (the door hit the end of the security bolt so hard it shook the entire room). Check out time is 11:00am, so my family and I went to eat breakfast elsewhere, and came back at 10:45 to finish packing - room was already being cleaned and our personal linens were already packed away in "storage". Other personal items (protable DVD player, camera, etc) were stacked off to the side (no one will explain to me why these were held back from storage).

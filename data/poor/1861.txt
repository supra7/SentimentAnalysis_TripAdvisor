I want to start by saying that my husband and I are not picky and we realize that things are not always perfect, however if we expect a hotel to be at least decent. We stayed here for my birthday and the location was great. We arrived back at our room on a sat night around 11pm to the night club bass jammin our room out. We were on the 5th floor just above the "Whisky Bar" - aka the nightclub of the hotel. Would not have been that bad if it weren't for the feeling of sitting at a concert, but wanting some peace and quiet. After 30 minutes we knew we couldn't last another 2 hours til the club closed. We called the front desk and they moved us. We didn't know they were moving us from a king room to a queen room. Ok, whatever, i was tired and we were on the 11th floor on the other side of the hotel - quiet?? Noooo. Fell asleep and was awoken at 2pm by a group of drunken people - in rooms on each side of us and it felt as though they were in our room. PAPER THIN WALLS. So we didn't want to complain AGAIN and just prayed they would go to bed soon. Well, once 4am came along - SILENCE - finally!!!! However, after 5 minutes, the guy to one side began throwing up like crazy!!! I will never forget that sound - I hope he was in the bathroon!! Sounded like he was in our room!!! My husband and I had to laugh. So needless to say, we got NO sleep that night. Next morning, we ate breakfast at Pairings and it wasHORRIBLE - the buffet was the smallest thing I've ever seen. The sign should have been someone leaving the restaurant and telling us "This place is horrible!". yup they were right. Too bad because we love Boston and stay a few times a year....NOT this hotel, that's for sure. The management of this hotel really needs to take a step back and see what they can do to make the customer experience better. Good luck here - we will certainly not be back and will not recommend this hotel to anyone.

I am a regular guest at the W NY for business purposes. It's location keeps me coming back rather than the hotel itself. Although the lobby is lively and hip, the rooms are truly showing their age. The carpet, bedding, wall coverings are in dire need of a refurb. Although the hotel itself is not really old, the amount of traffic through it has taken its toll. I also repeatedly have had bug problems- from spiders to a black fly infestion- these issues are not deemed worthy to be addressed when calling the "Whatever" number. Literally one night I had 6 huge black flies in my room, called 3x, and no one ever showed up to kill them. Also, rooms are the smallest among the NY hotels in which I regularly stay. Turn down service/ chocolates are infrequent. Rarely get any sort of benefit/upgrade from being a Starwood Platinum member. 2x they have given me a room with a twin bed b/c they have run out of others- even though I'm a Starwood Platinum. Also, the elevators are excrutiatingly slow. Allow yourself 10 mintues to exit the hotel between 7:30-8:00 am. The Doubletree Metropolitan next door has much larger, brighter, cleaner rooms with recently refurbed bathrooms.

Vacation from hell will be a vacation from heaven in 2 - 4 months Ok our vacation started out horribly !! Resort opened on the 21st of November -- we arrived 22nd. No rooms were ready - wires everywhere. Nothing worked in room -- not even key cards. We spent first day with workmen getting everything working. TV hooked up , fan working, ac working. No hot water -- that came 2 days later. Suppose to have 7 restaurants -- 2 opened --10 bars -- 4 open. But little by little as days went forward -- more things started to open. Their steakhouse if phenominal -- meat would melt in your mouth. All workers -- maintenance,maids, busboys, waiters, bartenders, entertainment were great -- can't say enough good things about them. Management left a little to be desired. I would recommend this resort highly in 2 -4 months when everything is complete and opened. We were allowed to use sister property-Colonial -- But I didn't pay for sister property I wanted the Elegance finished. This will be the great resort it is hyped up to be in the future. Beach is beautiful -- water awesome -- pool great. If you have chance in future -- go there. Just don't go NOW !!!

Terrible experience. We booked 11 rooms and requested double queens. Most of us were booked into single queens. It took over 1 hour for the front desk to get my sister with her 4 young grandchildren into the 3 rooms she had reserved. A family of 4 finally got into a room with one bed, a rollaway, and one had to sleep on the couch. Some of our double rooms remained a single and had a rollaway bed. So, if we had 4 in that room, the kids had to double up or sleep on the floor. The ice machine did not work on the 25th floor so you had to go to the basement. While I was there, I called and asked to speak to Jude...the Mgr on duty. He never called me back....at least he did not leave a message. I called Juan Morales on Monday at 1pm, the General Manager, and left a detailed message of my unpleasant experience. It is Friday and I have still not heard from him. The hotel is beautiful and for the most part comfortable; but the Reservations, Management, and Front Desk are horrible.

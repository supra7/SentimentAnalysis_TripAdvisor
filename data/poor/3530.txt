SCUM OF THE EARTH. NOISY BANGING DOORS. WALLS WERE SO THIN YOU CAN HEAR A PIN DROP. OUTRAGEOUS RATES FOR SUCH [--] ACCOMODATIONS!!! They charged us $179/night for a deluxe room(++hotel tax) by misleading us through their website photos. We could've stayed somewhere else for that rate. IF WE ONLY KNEW!!! It is a horrible hoStel, not a hotel at all. Our room smelled like insecticide everyday! Gross! NO FLATSCREEN TV. Just a tiny matchbox of a screen. Pathetic..and NO CABLE!!!! Staff was very indifferent...and unhelpful. I will sic the Better Business Bureau on you SCUM hoteliers!!!

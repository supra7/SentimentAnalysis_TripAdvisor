Stratosphere is the Walmart of Vegas. We have stayed there on two occasions and the last time ended my cheapness. I will from now on pay more to get a decent room. In Aug. 2006 we went for a short weekend to see my nephew get married. We arrived late Friday night and went to bed, Saturday morning when I woke up, I noticed something crawling next to my face on the pillow. I jumped up and my husband squished it between the sheets. It was a bed bug. Luckily, neither of us had any bites. We did the "Dateline NBC" test and pulled the headboard off of the wall where we found many bed bugs. When we called guest services, they offered to move us to a new room, but tried to insist that we clean all of our clothing at a laundramat before moving. Since we had to be at a wedding in a few hours, and I really felt it unfair for them to ask me to go do my laundry as though I had brought the bugs in with me, I said they should do our laundry. They refused, we were moved to another room and took our luggage and clothing with us without washing it. No apologies, no comps, they just moved us. My sister stayed in a room just down the hall from us, her sink in her bathroom smelled like the sewer. It's safe to say, we will never stay there again.

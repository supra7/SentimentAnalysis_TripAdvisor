Don't do it!!!!!! We arrived at the hotel at about 11pm on a sat. night, checked in and was upgraded to a Junior Suite. We were very happy and couldn't wait to see the room. Well, it wasn't anything special. The hallways had wallpaper peeling off, paint was chipping everywhere. The tiled floor in the room was cracked. We tried to fall asleep numerous times and was awakened about every 20 minutes by a door slaming or people yelling. We call down to the front desk and was finally moved to another room after the 5th complaint. This room was a little better, not so scary looking, although still not in good shape. During our first full day at the hotel we were unable to take a shower b/c the water stopped working. We complained and were told it would be up an running in 15 mins. ( which did not happen) Luckily the water was working that night so we were able to shower before bed. The following day we woke up sweating and thought that we just didn't have the air on high enough in the room, but come to find out that the a/c wasn't working in the entire hotel. We were also unable to shower that morning b/c the water wasn't working..AGAIN! Valet is $25 a day to park and takes about 30 min to get your car once you request it from the hotel next door. The pool area was nice and there is direct access to the beach from the hotel. Although there were problems...the hotel didn't give us a hard time once we complained at check-out and we were given the 2 nights that we stayed for free. If you are looking to stay in even just an average hotel with basic things like running water and a/c, the Hotel Marseilles is not for you.

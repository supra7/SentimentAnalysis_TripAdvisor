It seems great on the face of it - nice pool, slides for the kids/water park. However, we had some issues here. They put us on the 5th floor, Camelback bldg - nice location. But the only elevator within 100 yards of the place was broken ALL WEEKEND. I have a bad foot and was forced to lug 6 bags up (and down) 5 flight of stairs - I'm sure the other guests all felt the same way I did. Called the front desk to find out when the elevator was going to be fixed, got nothing but lip service and a shallow "I'm sorry for your troubles." Are you kidding me? ANY other hotel would have had a guy there in the middle of the night fixing the elevator. Not the Arizona Grand. Next, the hair dryer in the room started smoking and sparking and almost blew up right in my wife's hand. Nice. We ordered room service, the empty tray remained outside our door for over 24 hours. Our balcony had a pigeon that had set up it's nest directly on the ledge on our balcony - with its corresponding bird droppings which had never been cleaned up for months. Finally, at 5:30 AM our first morning there, the fire alarm (a very LOUD shreak) went off for over 45 seconds, of course waking everyone. Never did find out what that was all about. Finally, in a world with data everything, they charge $14.95 a night for WIFI? HA! HA! This place is really the stone ages, almost all 4 star hotels give WIFI now complimentary. We will NEVER stay here again. No way, no how. Take my advice traveler's, stay away from the Arizona Grand.

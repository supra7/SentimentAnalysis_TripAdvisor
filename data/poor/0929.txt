Dont bother to go here unless you love being ripped off!! Lets start at the beginning. They are not completed with construction so plan on hearing noise. They dont have a website so you cannot book online. I have travelled all over the world to many 5 star resorts and this will never get one star. The place has gone bankrupt three times. The spa is built but they have no money to furnish it or install the elvators. The beach on the property at the hotel is a rock beach with beautiful sand beaches all over the island but not here. They do have a beach but you cannot walk from you rroom to it. The room air conditioning does not work. There are 183 rooms built but they can only occupy 40 or so since they cannot finish the others. The restaurants (they claim they wil have 8 when finished but only 3 are built). And these are a joke. You are in the Dominican Republic and they build a French restaurant? We were the only customers in both restaurants and they had a wait staff of 15 at each restaurant looking for something to do. And if you want lunch or breakfast plan on spending over $150 dollars per person.. My 6 friends ordered three paella dinners and they charged fthem for 6!!! Said it was their policy. If you want to go water skiing (free anywhere else) they want to charge you $50 dollars. The place is built to look like a spanish castle and they ran out of money so the landscaping is all dead. There are no black out curtains on the windows (did these guys ever even go to a hotel before they built this place) so at 7 am the light blasts you out of bed. They built retail stores but cannot lease them. So they sit vacant . You cannot even buy suntan lotion here!! My recommendation is to pass on the Sanctuary until the next owner takes it in foreclosure and makes the changes required to run a decent hotel.

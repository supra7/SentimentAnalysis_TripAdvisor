This was very disappointing, we had to move hotels after the hotel that we were in could not fit us in for an extra night. This hotel was just around the corner from the one that we had been staying in so when we walked past we decided to check the rates. The lobby looked ok and they quoted a price that was similar to our first hotel so we booked in for a night. Don't let the lobby fool you- the rooms are old and falling apart, the beds are very uncomfortable, our tv cut out every 15 mins or so, there was a radiator that would not turn off so the room was boiling and when we told reception we were simply informed "some of the rooms have that problem" and they suggested that we put the air conditioning on. The AC is preset to have a minimum of 67 so that didn't work. Overall it was a very uncomfortable night but what topped it off was when getting our bags the man didn't speak but scowled at us and then held out his hand for money. As we walked outside to get a taxi to the airport the doorman was tried to shove us in one of the unmarked shuttle buses that was parked outside- they quoted us $30 a head (a taxi costs less than that for all of us) and then the doorman tried to bully us into taking it. When we said no he refused to get us a taxi and moved on to the next hotel guest trying to get a taxi. I can't believe that the hotel allows this to go on- I see other reviews have mentioned this issue so they are clearly aware of it and must encourage it.

This has to be the worst hotel. Horrible service with bad attitude, this is what your going to get at Trump. We we're looking forward to stay at Trump hotel during our Chirstmas vacation and as it turns out it was a complete nightmare. they completely ruined our Christmas. It started by not having hot water in our first night. Yes, NO HOT WATER. Can you believe that? What kind of establishment that does not even have hot water? Then the very next day the front desk woke us up at 6:30am, the complete family, with a phone call trying to come into our room and want to check on the hot water. Anyone with a right sense will not do that. In our room we had a cracked pitcher and not to metion a broken phone. The housekeeping forgets to deliver requested items and on top of it all, the valet has an attitude bring your car. My sons are now sick because the valet won't bring the car to the front entrence, instead they told us to WALK, in the winter cold, to the far end of the building to pick up our car. We had to carry our kids and run to our van. The following day, I went down to make my 4th complaint with the manager and as it turns out I was not the only one. Guest was angry with valet, the room, service, food. You name it. People had to wait 45 min. to get their car from valet. Thanks Donald Trump for ruining my Christmas vacation. Oh did I mention it was my son's first trip to Vegas. They sure made it unforgetable!

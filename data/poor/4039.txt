I came in on Oct 5th 2008 at 4.30pm. (funny its today). they gave me Rm.520. Within 15 min I could get septic drainage smell inside the room thru the vents and called the guest service. THey said, they will give another room and I am typing this from the other room. there is no smell here but the hallway stinks. The room man said "At least you don't have the smell inside your room now"!! And to make things even worse, the previous room did not even have drapes. Now, please think twice before choosing this hotel. I will be getting out very soon.

Stayed there for a little over a month. The rooms are small, hot and noisy. They quoted me one price but charge me another $556.00. When I asked the managment about it they became very rude immediatley. Makes me think it's happend before. Also at night you can go outside and score some crack or a prostitute. I never left my room after 8PM. I will never stay there again.

This was touted as a five-star, Gourmet Inclusive resort, with penty of activities, great bars and lots of things to do for our late-teen children. In fact, we got none of these things. The food was, in general, awful right down to their so-called cappuccino/espresso. The entire resort resembled something out of someone's cottage in Muskoka (they even had their grounds crew start mowing the lawns right as we were trying to enjoy some peace and quiet in the sun). The food was barely passable and the cocktails were mixed with sub-par brands and mixers. The rooms were on par with cheap motels with not even a picture on the walls to liven up the place. The fan didn't work properly (sped up and shut off on its own, and the light in the fan came on and off on its own). Three of us even came down with Montezuma's revenge for a day. The restaurants noted that they had guacamole on their menu, but they never seemed to have any (imagine running out of Avocados in Mexico). This place is a joke, and the Karisma group should be ashamed of partnering with these clowns. They couldn't even figure out how to properly operate ther wood burning stove in one of their restaurants, with the result that the entire restaurant was typically filled with smoke (which fit well with the cottage country feel of the place), and meant that we always went to bed feeling and smelling like we'd been roasting weenies around a campfire. This place should be avoided at all costs.

I AM JUST GOING TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS: My husband & I were staying at this motel 6 for about a week. 1st off if you want to pay the extra money for one of there newly renovated rooms (not worth it, trust me) you will get a nice spot by the pool etc. etc. if you decided not to pay the money (the beds are more comfortable if you don't) they will put you in a room that is so far away you almost think you are on a different property. Literally, we walked through the renovated rooms, past a restaurant, past a convenient store, past another hotel and then finally got to our room. It was ridiculous. It was older.....found a roach, I told the front desk and was basically told "So What"......Here is the straw that broke the camels back........One morning before my husband & I decided to start our day.....we decided to "be with each other" (not to be crude) and without knocking at 930am house keeping whips the door open.....she sees us mid act and left the door open so the gentleman & his wife outside could see up too. I immediately went to the office and told her of the indecent. She told me that it was MY FAULT, I should have locked the deadbolt.......and then started to blame ME for housekeeping busting open my door (BEFORE CHECK OUT) then because of this she actually said that we were not allowed to stay at this hotel anymore because they do not condone acts like that at there establishment......I DIDN'T HIRE A HOOKER, I WAS MAKING LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND IN THE PRIVACY OF OUR OWN ROOM! I hate this hotel.......my recommendation.....if you want to have a good time in Las Vegas stay the hell away from this hotel..............everyone that works there is a complete moron (with the exception of maybe 2) ESPECIALLY THE MANAGERS.......WHICH I DID AND WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT TO THE MOTEL 6 CORPORATE OFFICE.

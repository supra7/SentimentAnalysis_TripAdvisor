I had a 2 night, prepaid reservation at the Whitehall, and the hotel confirmed by phone that they would hold my room even though I was arriving late. They didn't and didn't make much of an effort to find me a room elsewhere: the best they could come up with, after 30 minutes of trying, was a hotel an hour out of town.

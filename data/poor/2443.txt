We just recently stayed at the westin when some friends of ours came to visit us here. Being that we live on Maui, we were excited to see and experience this side of the island and this fabulous looking hotel. But, when we arrived, the bell hops and valets were very abrupt. As we toured the grounds and made ourselves familiar with the pools and amenities, it became obvious that the staff were more interested in chatting than they were being polite to their guests. Anyway, the grounds are amazing, but the room was tired, the hallway was cluttered, the staff looked tired at times, or not happy, and one of the staff helped himself to half a subway sandwich that was in the fridge as well as taking the pool towels out of the room before we checked out. We had planned to take a swim. I would avoid this hotel in the meanwhile until they have figured out how to treat their guests. So not impressed to say the least.

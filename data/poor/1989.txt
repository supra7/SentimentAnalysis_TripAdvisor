At this price point there are better alternatives for the money in Boston. The basic problem is that they have students from the area universities who are better behind a computer than delivering services in a hotel situation. It starts with breakfast where the waiters (i.e., students) fail to service tables in a timely manner. It took twenty minutes ( and four waiters) to obtain a piece of toast that should have come with my meal. Also, there are no papers available in the hotel on the weekend. Should you want one, you will be directed to a paper box two blocks away. So bring some change with you. Even though the room were remodeled recently, they are not maintained well. The front desk service was poorer than that in the restaurant. I observed a number of people attempting to remove incorrect charges from their credit card to no avail. Errors in billing appeared on my card a month later. The Head Concierge was condescending when asked to address an issue that one of the student front desk employees made. If you want to enjoy your trip to Boston, stay any place but the The Eliot on Commonwealth Avenue.

My wife and I were not happy with this hotel. There is no air-conditioning and the noise between rooms is very poor. For the amount of money we had to pay ($240.00 +) we don't consider this hotel worthy of the price being asked. The breakfast was just adequate. If you want a quiet, comfortable hotel to stay I would not recommend this place.

We stayed at Castle Rock September 29 - October 2, first, we will NEVER stay there again. The reason for booking the reservation was for the waterpark. Before reserving the room, I contacted Castle Rock by phone and advised I was staying three nights and would only use the waterpark one day and asked if a one day pass could be purchased. The employee informed we could purchase a one day pass and informed me to book online only requesting room only, so I did. We arrived at approximately 1100 PM that night and asked the employee how to purchase a one day pass. The employee informed me I could not purchase a one day pass, due to me staying at the hotel. I explained to employee I was not using the waterpark except for one day. She refused to give a one day pass. The next day I contacted another employee and explained my situation again. The employee informed me she would have to upgrade my rooms in order for me to get access to the waterpark ($50 a night). After reading there website, it stated a one day pass could be purchased for $15 a person. After pointing it out to management, they informed my wife that was a mis print and immediately changed their website and still refused to give a waterpark pass. The outside billboard even states a one day waterpark pass can be purchased. It does not say by whom, just says a one day waterpark package can be purchased. Will never stay here again. A manager informed my wife the room only rate was only avaliable during the months of September and October. I was able to book a reservation for May 2012 room only. Hotel does not care about their guest.

Don't waste your money.. We went there for our 25 anniverary, and OMG it was AWFUL. First off they lost our reservations... even when I gave the women our confirmation number she couldn't find them.. She did get us a room with an ocean view, we get to the room and it looked gross. You know its bad, when my husband came out of the bath room and said.. DON'T take a shower WITH OUT your flip flops on.. My gym has better looking showers!!!! There is no air conditioning.. Our room had the "saftey light" on the balcony NO TURNING IT OFF.. so we couldn't leave the sliding glass door open for some AIR we were on the third floor.. (there was an old rusted fan in the room.. does nothing without cool air) but we couldn't sleep with a bright light on.. It was just awful.. so at 1230 am (7 hours after checking in) we checked out and went across the street to Best Western..

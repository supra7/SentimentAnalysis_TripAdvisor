My husband and I made a reservation for 4 nights at Frenchmen for our first year anniversary. We received the confirmation from the hotel and cancelled our other hotel reservation. We were relaxed and excited about our trip. However few days later, they sent us an email stating that they actually do not have all 4 nights available (only the first 2 nights were available). We tried to get our other hotel reservation back but, we missed that opportunity as well, since they do not have any rooms available anymore. Many other hotels in our budget range are already booked as well. We already bought the plane tickets and cannot change the dates... Thus, thanks to Frenchmen instead of having a relaxed and happy wait for our exciting trip, we are stressed about our stay. Thanks for ruining it for us! We would never use this hotel in the future. Don't make a reservation at this hotel, if you are looking for something reliable!!

I tend to be more of a lurker than a reviewer, and in fact I put off writing this for several months. But now that I'm back looking at Trip Advisor for another trip, I realize I need to provide this feeback so other people get an accurate picture of the Surfer Beach Motel rather than the oddly inflated picture that some of the reviews provide. I went this hotel based on the glowing Trip Advisor reviews. The difference between what I'd read about the place and what I found in reality was huge. The place was basically a tacky motel, albeit in a great location. The room, which faced the dumpster on an alley, was mediocre with bare, dingy walls. The beds were sort of gussied up, which helped a bit. The bathroom was ridiculous. It was tiny, with no tub and the tiniest little shower stall that made showering a truly unpleasant experience. Worse yet, the bathroom door was warped and did not close. Didn't even come close to closing. Given how much we paid for the room, I was pretty shocked at how tacky it was. I have never before paid so much for so little, and I've done my share of traveling. The walls were thin. This is a big problem when one's 11-year-old starts asking why she's hearing moaning and rhythmic thuds on the other side of the wall. Enough said about that... On the plus side, the location can't be beat. Even though we had no beach view, we were able to be on the beach in just moments, and it was a fun area for strolling.

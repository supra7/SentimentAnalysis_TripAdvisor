We were visiting US from Europe. We were on our way to Grand Canyon and we've decided to spend the night in Las Vegas and continue our trip in the morning. We have arrived around 11pm and asked for a room at the reception for one night. The first thing we were asked for was the credit card and the ID. Ok, yes we were a bit stupid giving the debit card just like that, but I thought he wanted to do kind of 'double check' of the identity... I don't know... I wasn't thinking. So what happens next second is that the guy swipes the card through the reader without saying anything. So we were NOT asked if we would like our credit card to be used! We get to our room and we check the bank account and we see that 600$ more than the price of the room was taken from the account!! We get down to the reception to ask if they took it. The answer was 'no'. But they DID take the money! There was another weird thing about the payment. We were told that the price was 75$, and after the card was used we got something to sign where it was said that we payed 75$. Later we saw 682$ were taken. When we asked the thief how much he took he said he took only 82$ which is for 'security reasons' and he will put back 7$ tomorrow if everything is ok with the room. But in the morning some other person at the reception said that 82$ was 75$ + tax! So we got a 'receipt' from the thief saying 75$, but they officially took 82@ but what they really did is that they took 682$! We got the money back from the bank, but I wouldn't recommend going to that place. For the rest, the room was nice and clean. But I guess that is what is always expected.

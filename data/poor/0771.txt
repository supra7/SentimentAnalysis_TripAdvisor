My husband and I arrived in Maui for our honeymoon, excited to stay at "Maui's most Hawaiian Hotel" on Kaanapali Beach. Our travel agent had recommended it and the reviews I read on tripadvisor weren't bad. When we got there it was old, dirty, and a horrible place to stay Especially for a honeymoon! The elevator door opened before it stopped, the room was a one star at best and the outdoor atmosphere was cheesy. We thought about trying to "grin and bear it" since it is one of the cheaper places but would have rather slept in our rental car then in that hotel. So with some looking around at nearby hotels (all VERY nice), we ended up paying more to stay at the Marriott Maui Beach Club hotel which was FABULOUS! I would not recommend staying at the Kaanapali beach hotel ever.

Traveler be aware..... Purchased a trip through Orbitz - picked this hotel because of the excellent ratings. Lovely lobby, but... be aware that this hotel does enforce its policy of surcharging at the time of check in. Although we paid for our room (which was quite small, but clean) well in advance, and imprinting a CC is standard, but we were quite dismayed on receiving a call from AMEX asking us about an unusual charge (it was in excess of $1000). Management indicated that this was standard practice. We've never experienced this before (we're in our 50's) so thought we should share this information. In our case, it was not an issue, but for a younger couple on a budget, this might create a problem.

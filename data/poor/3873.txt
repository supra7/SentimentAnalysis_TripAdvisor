We stopped overnight here on our way to Kauai. I could have lived with the age of the place except for the mattress. It was the kind that tips to one side if your partner weighs more than you do, condemning you to a night of clawing your way back to your own side of the bed. We changed to the Marriott for the return trip and were far more comfortable.

The room was very, very small and dreary. Very little lighting, and very depressing. After a couple of hours in this room, I couldn't take it anymore and request a different room for an additional $20 charge. This was well worth it. The room I was moved to was still old, dated and smelled musty but was at least something that I could tolerate for 1 night. I was booked for 2, but when I advised the front desk that I simply could not stay there the 2nd night, they were accomodating and did not charge me the additional night's penalty. They were also very polite about it. Also note: this hotel is not for the claustrophobic! There's 1 EXTREMELY tiny elevator that has no air circulation. You can really tell that this is an older hotel. If you must stay here, without a doubt pay the extra $20 for a room upgrade.

Do not stay at this hotel unless they cut you a killer deal, and even then ask yourself how desperate you are! Fundamentally there's nothing wrong with the building, but the management suck, there are not enough staff, they are badly trained, they don't act upon complaints and do not deserve your custom. I can't be bothered to write an article length piece describing what went wrong, suffice to say everything that could, did. At your peril...

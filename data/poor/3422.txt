I did search through the reviews before booking this hotel and found mixed reviews. However, I gave it a chance because of the great deal we got. My great deal, quickly turned into a $1,000 stay for three nights. Not a great deal. The hotel is old and dark. I did like that the windows in the room opened. The bathrooms were less than desirable. The room was spacious, but in a weird shape with too many barriers. And most of all, we didn't intend to pay for the little critters that would come visit us over night. We woke up our last day only to find two little mice running back and forth between the rooms and the closets. I was disgusted especially since I had my 21- month old child playing in these rooms and all her stuff was on the floor. We planned to check out around 11am, but opted instead to get out of that room as quickly as possible. Believe me, if I saw the mice earlier, I never would have stayed there. Yuck! Finally, the location is great if you don't want to walk anywhere. Times Square is not within walking distance. We had to master the subway just to be able to get around because we refused to walk all the way back to the hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone unless you could find it for less than $50 per night including taxes. I've stayed at many different places in NYC and it's never been this bad.

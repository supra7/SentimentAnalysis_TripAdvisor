ruined my honeymoon!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!! It has been almost a year since our stay and we have always intended to come onto this site and complain and I'm finally doing it! This was the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in, ever! (and it was also the most expensive). The staff was RUDE, there were literally HUNDREDS of ants in our room and when we asked to move, they acted like we were being fussy, they messed up our honneymoon package by not giving us breakfast coupons and then got mad at us for not letting them know right away (we had no idea that we needed coupons). AWFUL. They comped us a buffet dinner at the hotel next door to make it up to us after we complained and when we got there, the waiter was so rude for absolutely no reason and actually threw a menu at my husband. We walked out (with me crying). It was actually like being on a hidden camera show. Surreal. They then comped us a meal at the top of the hotel next door which was wonderful, but in no way made up for having the first two days of our lives together ruined by pests and horribly rude staff. We complained on their website and to the manager and never heard a word back. We not only will never stay at the Royal Hawiian again, we pretty much have a bad taste in our mouth about Sheraton hotels in general now. They really were awful. If I could give negative stars, I would.

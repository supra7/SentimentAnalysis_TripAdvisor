unwanted visitors I stayed at the Touchstone on Friday Aug. 17, 2007 and it was one of the most disturbing experiences my girlfriend and I had at any hotel. We were OK with the simple furnishings and small room when we made our reservation because we were only staying one night. When we first entered the room we could see the street from our window and we could hear the noises from the street even though the windows were closed. We also noticed that the smoke alarm was removed from the room. This was not great, but we tolerated it because we needed a place to stay. We fell asleep at about 11 pm that evening.At about 2:45 am Sat. morning we were awakened by voices outside our third floor window. There were two strangers sitting/standing on the fire escape directly outside our window. We also noticed that one of the window handles that secures the window from the inside was missing meaning that these strangers could enter our room at any time. We were frightened.My girlfriend and I got dressed and ran downstairs to notify the person at the front desk of the interruption. He went outside and looked up to the third floor and then ran upstairs to resolve the situation. The intruders were apparently hotel guests as well. After the front desk person spoke to the guests, he told us he would call the police if this happened again. We are grateful for his action and we were able to sleep the remainder of the night.My girlfriend and I informed the front desk person in the morning of the situation emphasizing that there seems to be a real security and safety threat in the hotel. We also appreciated the efforts of the night desk person. But the day person's reply was that she wish she could help but couldn't. She seemed to be saying if you didn't like it here you should just go somewhere else the next time. We left thinking we will not be staying at this hotel again.

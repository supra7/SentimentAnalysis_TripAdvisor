When we arrived to the Hotel on a Friday afternoon, we were greated by a very polite gentleman/valet, who walked us in with our luggage. I wish I remembered his name...Glenn??? When my friend and I checked in, the front desk knew who we were and greeted us by name. It made me feel like I was in the Ritz. Allen was extremely courteous and even got us a room before check in time. As we went towards the room Anthony took our bags up and gave us the "tour". When he finished I explained that I'd get cash to tip him later, he said "no problem" then left. About 15 minutes later I was on my way to tip him for the bags. Unfortunately he did not see me coming and I over heard him speaking to another employee about my friend and I. He refferred to us as cheap MFR's. And a few other choice words directed to us and others who had not tipped him, words that can't be written. We were extremely offended! Obviously, I did not tip him. If the service I recieve is based on the amount of money that I give the staff at this hotel, then I will happily stay somewhere else. We returned late that night from a party and the lobby was very messy. We left the following morning to a lobby and bar filled with garbage, food, spilled drinks and beer bottles/cans along the walkway. NO ONE HAD CLEANED UP FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE?!!! Not to mention the sewer smell that came from the lobby floor. Hire a housekeeper! I would not recomend this place unless you're eager to throw around some tip money.

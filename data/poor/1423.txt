Stayed here for 4 days in June. Having arrived at the airport and then got the connecting train to the city centre, we eventually found the right tram to get us too the hotel. We were surprised by how far the hotel was from the city centre which was a problem in itself due to having to pay for a bus or tram each time we wanted to go to the centre (at cost) but probably our own fault for not looking into this more beforehand! Still worth noting though. Upon arrival at the tram stop, we soon felt like we were in the wrong part of town and probably the place locals would avoid was the impression we got.Bit like some parts of the Uk. Run down and dated buildings and lots of shops with arabic signed food shops which means travelling back to the centre if you want food. The hotel itself, from the outside, is like a soviet union communist style tower block. The room itself and general hotel decor was like a throw back to the 80s, at least decor style but was at least clean enough which for me is the top priority. The bed was good enough, the tv worked and all the lights worked. The main problem we had was noise night and day. Not from outside but from (we think) the air conditioning unit in the room which was very loud and had no obvious way of turning it off. Not great if you had planned on sleeping. We also got woken up very early one mornign when the fire alarm went off followed (10 minutes later) by a false alarm announcement. Overall a dated hotel, crap location with zero in the way of local amenities i.e. food shops, & expensive for what it is. Pay more and find a nicer hotel closer to the centre but will add that Amsterdam itself was a huge let down. Great if you go there for the 'coffee shops' but we stayed a week and struggled after 2 days to keep occupied. Happy travelling people!

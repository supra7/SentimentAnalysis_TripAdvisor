My family and I flew over to Maui from The Big Island to attend an event in Lahaina, on departure of our trip to return home we began to itch and after some medical investigation found out that we indeed had bed bugs from our hotel rooms. WE told the hotel of the incident and they replied a month later that there was no evidence of a bed bug infestation and brushed us off like a bunch of nobody's. A bunch of nobodys wouldn't fork almost $1000 for a weekend stay at their property. Very disappointed and I will NOT be returning to any Westin properties.

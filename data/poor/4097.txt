I reserved a room here since I was going as part of a group meeting- I usually stay elsewhere in Chicago. I made the reservation via phone and was greeted with emails each week about any special requests I may have. Three nights before I was to arrive, I received an email telling me they were oversold and would relocate me to a different hotel. When I called, NO ONE could explain or help me. I spent an hour being told to call back the following day. I spoke with the Director of Operations the next day who apologized and offered to upgrade me to a suite (which I had reserved originally). I travel extensively for business and leisure and I have never had such poor communication with a "luxury" hotel. I would expect it from a hotel that charges 1/3 the price. Oh, by the way, I am staying at the Ritz Carlton for less than I was going to pay to stay here!

When we arrived the rude staff would not accept the paperwork that the travel service had sent us. Check in took a good 10 minutes to accomplish. When we finally were given a room, we were very disappointed. The carpet had holes in it, the faucet not only dripped but poured when it was "turned off". The toilet was not attached to the floor and there was a hole in the wall in the bathroom. The beds were very old and the pillows were flat. It is a shame that all of this took place because my grandson really enjoyed the waterpark. Since there are other options for giving him the same experience, I will go elsewhere to stay.

I had booked a room but when I arrived to check in I was told there was no room available and I had to be transferred to another hotel in Bayswater. The staff were extremely unhelpful and quite rude. The hotel I was transferred to (Kensington Town House) was lousy. I will never book a Best Western hotel again if this is how they treat their customers, especially a lone female.

Have stayed at the Stratosphere before (3 times in last year)...but this time (19/07 - 02/08) was the worst yet. Was recently told that the hotel had changed management.......this seemed obvious by the lack of good check in staff. This time round we found them very inneffcient and each one contradicted what the other one said!.....plus we have always paid by travellers cheques and never had a problem ..till now. Got a call one morning to ask for payment! The check in staff 'misplaced' our travellers cheques - they had to view security tapes to see that we actually did pay the amount....they never got back to us to tell us they found them and that everything was OK Room allocation was also a nightmare - beware!! Have always liked the Strat but will seek another hotel next time as the whole place has really gone down hill. Shame on you Strat!

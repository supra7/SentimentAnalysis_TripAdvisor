While the beach was beautiful and the grounds were fantastic I would definitely NOT go back to The Grand Wailea Resort. We travelled over 10 hours to get to the Grand Wailea from Toronto and were not given the room we requested. The first problem was we booked an Oceanview Deleux Room and were given an Oceanview Room. No one at the resort would actually listen to us that the room was wrong and so we had to call our travel agent in Toronto to straighten it out. A total pain when you're on vacation and hoping to relax. Also be warned THE OCEANVIEW ROOMS DO NOT GIVE YOU A VIEW OF THE OCEAN. Save your money and get a garden view room instead. The customer service was extraordinarily bad....after our travel agent notified them of the issue they still did nothing to approach us about the problem. It is a farce that they call themselves a 5 star resort. The resort was very busy and huge. As well, there were kids everywhere and was not very romantic at all. Honeymooners beware! For a resort this expensive (almost $800 a night) they nickel and dime you. Nothing is complimentary. I would save my money and go to a different resort. Very disappointed.

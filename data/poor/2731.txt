My friends and I decided to stay at this hotel after looking at the pictures on the internet. We initially arrived and asked the woman at the front desk if the greek restuarant across the street was any good. She was insulting and said that it was expensive. When I asked if it was in the $20 price range she said "No honey, that is diner food in New York." We later checked in and everything appeared to be fine. Until we went take a shower and our skin was almost ripped off by the torpedo power of it! Then we all woke up with horrible back aches from sleeping on the hard beds. (think Elaine in the episode of Sienfeld!) The next morning we went to have the breakfast and everything was gone. After a long day of site seeing we returned to find no clean towels and only our beds were made. We had no toilet paper and the maids actually left their bag of garbage in our hotel room. At this point we decided to leave. Although we had prepaid for two nights we left and went to the Hyatt. Which was beautiful and excellent!

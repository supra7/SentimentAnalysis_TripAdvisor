Okay. Let me start by saying that I traveled the world for a year and had bed bugs 3 times. I KNOW what a bed bug is, and how it bites. I got one bed bug bite (admittedly a small attack) at the Westin Seattle. They were very relaxed about it. If you have had bed bugs, it is not like a mosquito bite, it disables you for the day. They told me that they quarintined the room (which there were no outward signs of it, after we saw the neighbor room taped off in blue tape). I then got a response from them that they brought in the team and there were no bed bugs. NOT TRUE! I KNOW bed bugs! I am now about 3 months out and the wound is finally starting to disappear. I beleive that they are a problem, but I think this hotel underestimates the problem!

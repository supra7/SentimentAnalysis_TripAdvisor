Debacle of a hotel Classic case of a hotel pretending to be nice when it really isn't. A few things:1. Terrible service at the Redwood Room. Terrible.2. Laughably unprofessional staff at the bellhop and at the reception (unfortunately this is not a very nice room was what I was told when my reserved king bedroom/non-smoking room was not available and that I'd instead have a room with 2 full beds on a smoking floor. Awesome.)3. Shabby rooms without the basics (nice sheets, coffee makers, a shower head that functions comfortably, a television other than a 12 1988 Samsung model etc.). 4. The comedy of errors included a 4 AM [false] fire alarm that found me dressed in a robe in the lobby, an unscheduled 7:20 AM wake-up by my alarm clock (who ever checks to make sure the alarm clock is set for off?) and another unwanted 9 AM wake-up from the television in the room next door. A perfect trifecta of no sleep!(The false alarm is [most-likely] no fault of theirs but we could have done without the snickering hotel employee on the PA telling us it was a false alarm. I mean, it's f'cking hilarious to be woken up at 4 in the morning expecting the worse, right?)This place is the pits. Our server at Asia de Cuba was the only redeeming point of the experience and all he did was serve us breakfast straight-forwardly without pissing me off.Needless to say, I can't recommend this place to anyone unless that person enjoys over-spending on crap.

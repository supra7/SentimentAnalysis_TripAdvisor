Terrible. Cold, dirty bathrooms, dirty rooms,dirty corridors. A constant smell in the corridor on 2nd floor !!! The staff were helpful as we had to move rooms 3 times to find an acceptable room. We did not have an en-suite room so had to share bathrooms....oh dear !!! Location of hotel was very good with the subway a very short walk.

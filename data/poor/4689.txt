I don't know if this proprietor is running a scam or what, but when we arrived at the hotel, no one answered the door. We asked someone in the building to find a way to get in and check in and he had no idea that there was a hotel in the building. He called the proprietor and she told him that she was having plumbing problems and that she had booked us somewhere else. She said that she had emailed us about this, but we never received the email. The place where she had booked us was her father's pension, with no breakfast and no air conditioning (two qualities that lead us to book this hotel).

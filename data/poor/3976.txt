I stayed at the Lenox with a friend. We had booked twin beds, we were give one queen size for two not small people. When shown the room we immediately asked to be changed and were told that this was not possible. This continued to be not possible for the whole 6 nights so I spent 4 of them sleeping on the floor. Our requests were met by blank smiling faces that refused to recognise a problem or do anything about it. Alex Alec-Smith

Room was dirty. I reserved a non smoking room and they gave me a smoking room and would not change it. Room was not stocked with toilet paper or kleenex. Front desk agent was on the phone the entire time I was checking in and kept making me hold. At 7am a strange man started knocking on my door, not dressed in a hotel uniform. I called the front desk and they told me they thought I had ordered room service. I had not and as a woman staying alone in a room on the first floor, I did not feel comfortable with a strange man knocking at my door in the morning and the front desk being so nonchalant about it. I will absolutely avoid this hotel in the future and would encourage others to do the same.

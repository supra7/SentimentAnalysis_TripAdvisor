luckliy we had booked only 1 night. First we were given a room with no window, actually there was one but on the internal corridor. The carpet was filthy, room noisy because of construction outside (not their fault), the AC broke in the middle of the night, the chair upholstery was VERY old, central location but near a homeless shelter. Noting positive about this hotel!

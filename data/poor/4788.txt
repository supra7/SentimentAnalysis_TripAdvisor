The first room we were checked in was dirty, greasy face smudges on the windows, chocolate stains on the pillow cases. We switched rooms to find out that it was worse than the first one. Again, oily faces on the windows and door, hair everywhere in the bathroom, an old rusty toilet. I dried off after a shower and there was hair hanging from my body (that obviously didn't belong to me) from the towel!! We complained the next morning, they checked the first room but refused to look at the room we actually stayed in. The staff was rude and extremely lazy. They are definitely on motel standards, not Hilton. They expected a 7 month pregnant woman to walk up their hallways to find a working ice machine at 1am, rather than getting it for me themselves after me requesting it, just so the night audit can finish her conversation with an equally lazy security guard. Customer service is completely out the window with this hotel. When I tried to follow up with the hotel's manager the following days, I got hung up on!

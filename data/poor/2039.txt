In the three nights we stayed at this property, we occupied three different rooms, not by choice, of course. First, we found a large wet spot on the carpet, and asked to be moved. The new room ended up being smaller than the first one, but we stayed anyway. Second, our door key reader did not work, so we asked for help. After an hour spent standing in the hallway while the security staff tried to fix the door (we were given no timeframe for how long this was going to take), we were finally packed off to another room because they couldn't fix it. The bellman came by, handed us the new keys, and didn't even bother to help us with our bags. The only staff who expressed any level of concern for our comfort and inconvenience were the housekeeping staff; the security, front desk and bell staff were not helpful and lacked customer service skills. We will not stay at this property again.

Very disappointed with our recent stay at the Centurion Palace. Traditional facade but inside the hotel has been totally modernised, it is cheap and tasteless and no thought to practical use inside the very small hotel bedrooms. The walls are lined with silk paper but the finish on everything else is cheap and nasty. I wanted an iron and ironing board but was told it was a health and safety issue to use one in my room, obviously due to all the combustable furnishings and /or tactics to use the very expensive laundry service. The staff were ar best unfriendly and worst arrogant and surly. The service was hit and miss and not to a 5 star standard.

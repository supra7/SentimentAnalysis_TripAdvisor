After reading some reviews and checking this place out, I sent 2 emails to the resort asking very simple questions on the amenities, pools etc.. Never received a reply to either. Sent same emails to Sunset Hotels, who own the place, and never hear back in regard as well. I don't know what the problem is or what the secrets are here but I do know we will not even consider staying here. If the service is bad already, I can just imagine what it would be on site and not willing to chance it.

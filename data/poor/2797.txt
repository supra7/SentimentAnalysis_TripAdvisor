I just got back from a stay at the Time hotel and this place is truly horrendous. Upon arrival, I learned that they did not have my reservation and I had to wait 20 mins for them to figure out what's wrong. The room at the hotel was small and dirty. My carpet had stains on it. Worse was the bathroom which is so tiny that you have to shower in a little corner of the bathroom with a curtain to hide you. The Time is not a luxury hotel; it is the same as a cheap motel except for the fact that it has a nice lobby. Do not be fooled by the fancy lobby and lounge, the hotel is horrible.

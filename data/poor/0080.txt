Where to even begin.....my wife and I checked in to a smoking room on a Sunday morning.....the morning front desk clerk was helpful and personable.....we get to the room and the tv didn't work, no big deal, i went to the front desk and asked for an ashtray and for someone to come and look at the tv.....he brought the ashtray and switchedc out the tv for us.....we proceeded to go to the aquarium and returned a few hours later to the room....we were only in the room a f ew minutes when the phone rang....I proceeded to attempt to answer but didn't hear anyone on the other end so I hung up.....Again, phone rings, I answer and didn't hear anyone.....I proceeded to walk down to the front desk to see if it was them trying to call......The afternoon clerk begain to verbally accost me about smoking in the room.....he continued on about how it was setting off the internal silent fire alarm.....I stated that we requested a smoking room and were given an ashtray by the morning clerk.....He stated that it was impossible because the hotel was a non-smoking one and called the other clerk at home to verify the information that I gave....Upon the verification, I received no apology......I then asked to speak to a manager and was rudely told that one was not available to talk to .....I asked for my money back so that my wife and I could check-in to another hotel....he obviously thought I was a comedian since he laughed in my face and told me that I was not getting one.....he did however, offer us another room (one he didn't care if we smoked in).....I reluctantly agreed, and proceeded to gather my luggage to move into the new room......He gave me the key and said we should be set and never moved from behind the desk......Needless to say, my wife and I moved all the luggage ourselves as well as the tv (since the tv in the new room didn't work and the clerk told me to go ahead and switch them out).....upon entry into the room much to our surprise their was an ashtray (LOL)....Not only that but there wer ashtrays in 75% of the rooms we passed on our way to the new room (LOL).....As we got settled in, trying to avoid sticking to the nasty carpet, we decided to order food....unfortunately, I had to go to the front desk, yet again, because the phone in this room didn't work either.....The next morning, waking up late, for we didn't recieve the wake-up call until 2 hours after the rquested time....I proceeded to the front desk and tried to explain the situation from the previous night to the Monday morning clerk,but I was rudely told my story sounded very "one-sided"....I then asked again for a manager and again was laughed at like a comedian......and was told one was not available.....so with the speed of Superman, We packed our bags, checked-out of the god-forsaken place, and headed to the nearest health clinic for a tetnus shot....... These rooms were completely disgusting.....The staff was rude, crude and sociablly unexceptable......I would not recommend this hell to a gitmo bay prisoner..... It made the Walter Reed Medical Center look like the Ritz Carlton.....However, if you are looking for drugs, prostitution, or down right ignorant hospitality this is the place for you......Thank you King's Inn for making my stay in Seattle a memorable one.....

Stayed for 3 nights during Nascar. Mardi Gras tower, 15th (top) floor. Looked right across to the rooms at the IP Hotel. Could hear the thumping bass of the band down at Carnaval Court until past 3 am. Extremely thin walls between room and corridor, which surprised us as they advertised sound proof walls in their rooms! The room door wasn't sealed as I could see a bright line of light beaming into the room when I got up to use the bathroom in the wee hours. Chronic dripping tap in tub, what a waste of water in the desert LOL! No bath mat - no matter, we just used a towel instead. Bathroom tissue is of the cheapest grade ever - visited many other casinos and restaurants on the strip and I was surprised at how cheap Harrah's is to their guests. Bedside lamp was missing a bulb, it was never replaced. Ate at Flavors for breakfast, (it was $8 with a $5 off coupon)it was okay, regular trough food, would not pay full price. Room was cleaned at about 2 -3 pm. I think this hotel has seen better days, when it was a Holiday Inn. The air quality in the casino is on par with the cheaper casinos on the strip. We had a good time except for our hotel stay - paid over $450 for 3nights, one night over $200 for a king bed in a "premium room".

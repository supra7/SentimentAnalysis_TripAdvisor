On a Friday night, a burgler broke into our room and stole several hundred dollars in cash. The burglar did not take credit cards or anything else, just cash from a pants pocket and from a purse. Early Saturday morning we reported the theft. We were told repeatedly that there was no manager on duty, and that nothing could be done until Monday. On Sunday, the story was the same - no one from management was available. On Monday we contacted "management" who refused to meet with us - agreeing only to a brief, unpleasant phone conversation. We were told that the hotel had thoroughly reviewed surveillance tapes and that no one had been observed breaking into our room. Period. In effect we were accused of making up the story - with no attempt by the hotel owners to hear about our experience. Place d'Armes is part of a small group of New Orleans hotels. We regularly advise travelers going to New Orleans to avoid this hotel group at all costs.

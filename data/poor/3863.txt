AWFUL....AWFUL..Checked in late in evening..Filthy, dirty, old furniture, stained carpeting, mold on A/C and bathroom ceiling. Door had rot on bottom.. Unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Couldn't stay another night.... Checked out in morning...Wished I would have seen these reviews before booking our stay there.

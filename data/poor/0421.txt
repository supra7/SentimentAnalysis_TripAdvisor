The hotel is really terrible. There were no towels when we walked into the room. After a few calls asking for towels, the receptionist (or the owner) even asked me to go down and grab the towels myself. Finnally I got my towels which were not fully dried yet, the person said the towels will be dry later. What could I say! I asked for a morning call so I wouldn't miss the train, however, they did not give me a morning call at all. I paid when i checked in, but they almost charged me again when i was ready to check out. In a word, Lousy!

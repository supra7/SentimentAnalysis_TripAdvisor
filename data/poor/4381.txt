My brother checked into Stratosphere for his wedding. I was with him and his fiance and the first problem he had was the price of the room. They had reserved on-line and paid for two nights but they were told they had only paid for one. We all went up to the room to drop off luggage and the room was dirty. They had large stains on the carpet and so-called jacuzzi looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Then, they asked for a room with a view and what they got was a view of parking garage. The "happy couple" decided to cancel the room and went down to the desk to get a refund and the staff didn't seem to care one bit and didn't try to make things right. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

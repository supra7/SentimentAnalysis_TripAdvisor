My wife and I never got a honeymoon so after a year of marriage we both finally took some time off from work. We booked two nights at the Roosevelt. I used my HiltonHonors points for the stay and booked via phone. I requested a upgrade and the reservation person said there were several suites open for my stay (booked it one day before we travelled). After arriving at 9pm, we decided to take a shower and head out on the town. Once we returned, figuring the room was hot from our showers, we went to sleep. I got up at least three times sweating so bad I had to flip the pillow over. The AC only goes to 65 but I will say it must have been regulated to stay at 78. I tried to use the fan but it was too noisy. After a miserable night, my wife and I decided to leave and head back home (7 hours away). Not to mention losing all my points for the second night we didnt stay. Front staff was apologetic and I knew it wasnt their fault so I didnt complain too much. Dont valet park for $38 because there is a parking garage 1/2 block away for $22. Rooms are small but updated and nice flatscreen TV. For the price I would have stayed across the street at the Mariott or an other major hotel---at least I know they dont monitor their AC controls....Very uncomfortable stay and will never stay at this hotel again.

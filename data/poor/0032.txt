This place is not even suitable for the homeless take my advice and stay far far away! We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!! GROSS...... seriously need a hazmat suit to enter.

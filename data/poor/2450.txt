I will not return to this hotel--throughout our whole stay, the elevator was broken, the phone in our room was broken, and the Internet (which you are required to pay for each day) did not work. When I tried to bring this to the attention of the staff, at first it took 10 minutes for them to even answer the phone, and then they never fixed the problem. They did not seem to care about the guests at all here.

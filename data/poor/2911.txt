My $400 per night hotel room reminded me of my college dorm room...only smaller. My room came complete with a broken chair and dvd player. The pathetic european shower even reminded me of the jail house shower stalls you'll find in every college dorm. The Whiskey Blue bar downstairs was pretty hip though. We saw Peyton Manning and fam hanging out and enjoying some cocktails. Do not stay here. There has to be better value in this part of Manhattan..

A Horrible Experience !!! Management Scam! What happened to me at this hotel was a nightmare, disregarding the four nights with no heat (because a mechanic was seemingly unavailable). It was a decent, cheap place to stay, until I received a charge to my credit card one week after I returned home for $300 for damage to my rooms ancient boxspring and mattress. It seems the management took several cans of cola I had left behind, and sprayed them on the bed set. Then they supposedly called the Police and had them file a report. The management blamed their actions on me, attempting to have me pay for new furniture for the room. No photos were taken of the damaged bed, and the boxspring and mattress were hauled away before I could examine them. Marina Inn management made no attempt to contact me by phone.As it turns out, the police report was a fake, and management of the Marina Inn have refused to commmunicate with me or my credit card company.So I am reimbursed for the charge, but it is still fraud and extortion on the part of the Marina Inn management.In all my years of travelling, I have never come across anything such as this. How they thought they could get away with this fraud is beyond me. I suppose they hoped that I would be lazy, and just pay the charge! WRONG!

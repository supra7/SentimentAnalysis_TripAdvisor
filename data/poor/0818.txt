This hotel is disgusting and tiny. We were in their "best" room and it still made a youth hostel look glamorous. The beds were stained, walls and doors had mold, windows would not shut and let bugs in, and the shower was the washroom so everything gets soaked. The pillows were like sleeping on a bad of potatoes and the mattresses were disgusting. Learn from our mistake and stay away from this place!

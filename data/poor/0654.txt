We stayed here for the second time just a few weeks ago. The hotel is more than fine as a family hotel, and MAC gym and location (as prior reviewer notes) are great. BUT on this trip my husband and two children all came away with bed bug bites! We had heard about this problem in the news on and off but this was our first encounter with them and it took us a day or so to realize that these were not "regular" summer mosquito bites, that they were much more intense and patterned on our bodies, and that we had all been affected (we also took photos). We confirmed that this hotel is on the "Bed Bug Registry" (which we didn't even know about until this stay) and a call to the hotel resulted in them saying they would investigate and get back to us but they never have! This is a very big problem for hotels and I am sympathetic, but they should have refunded us our money at the very least. If you plan to stay here, read up on bed bugs, inspect your room first, and cross your fingers!

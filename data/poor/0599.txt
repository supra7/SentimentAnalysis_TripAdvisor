Alaska Airlines put us up in this hotel for one night because they were running behind and we missed our connecting flight ..We were given a basement room .. No elevator.. Had to carry 50 pound bag down and up stairs ...Had to keep outside vent open just to breath .. Made room very cold .. If they put you up even for one night it is too long UP EVEN FOR .. RUN..

I have just returned from a 4 night stay in this place. I took my niece for her first trip to the US and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. My heart sank when I saw the lobby! The man on reception was ignorant . He asked me for my credit card and then gave me a receipt for $100. I asked him what this was for and he said it was a deposit. He didnt even ask if he could take it. Then when I asked him where the safe was he smirked and said there wasn't one. He then said there was one but everyone could use it!!!I said "are you saying that I can use the safe but other people could take my stuff". He grinned and said yes. I was really cross. Our room was on the ground floor. The patio door lock was not very secure and it was very creepy at night. It had not been decorated this century by the look of it. The only good thing about it was that the bed was comfortable. Water was coming through the bathroom ceiling during our stay. When I told him he just said "oh" I said dont you want to check it out and he did reluctantly. He said the people upstairs had ran too much water in the bath!!!!!The surrounding area was safe at night.

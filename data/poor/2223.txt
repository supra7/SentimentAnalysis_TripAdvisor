At first the Hotel seems very nice ,The lobby is very nice ,But once you get upstairs it gets bad. The carpets in the halls are very nasty . The wall in the shower had been painted and chipping off. Their are roaches around the soda machine on the 6th floor next to the laundry.Their was a dumpster fire when we stayed their ,The hotel was full of smoke . It was very scary . Tried to talk to girl at front desk at check out about it , She just brushed me aside like no big deal to check in the next sucker . Will never go back . And advise all not to !

Since we could not find any other hotels available this past Marathon behind , we ended up at the Time. The Location is great; right BEHIND the Crowne Plaza in the center of midtown. We just wished we could have stayed at the Crowne Plaza as they probably have elevators that work and bellboys that are available. This is not the case at the Time. It seems they have 1 elevator down for a while and the other is hit or miss. After an all day hike through Manhatten, we had to hike up 12 flights of stairs to make it to our room at 11:30 on Saturday night. Not fun!! The room was small but adequate and the lobby is loud. Overall, the hotel was OK but I would never stay there or recommend it to anyone.

If you manage to get through the staff of the front desk and FINALLY get a room, be prepared to be assaulted by the smell of body odor. The staff is absolutely not concerned with what you have to say. They are rude, and preoccupied. The rooms absolutely stink! Not just a mild odor you can air out and overlook, but an a full frontal assault of nauseating measures. Then the mini-fridge must have been on the quits because it would start and stop all night if you have the slightest possible notion of trying to sleep. Finally, the ground floor rooms were infested with ants. When my daughter turned the light on over the sink in the middle of the night, the entire countertop was crawling. We tried to change rooms, they wouldn't apologize or make things work, so we left. Left quickly and never looked back. You'd have to be insane to stay here. Do yourself a favor and find somplace else or you'll be highly disappointed. This place stinks, and is an infested mess.

I stayed here with my family during the all-star game because I thought it would be fun. It was a horrible experience. If you weren't a baseball they treated you like dirt. Many of the hotel guests bonded over the rude treatment by staff. The rooms were okay but dated and the pools at some of the other local resorts like the Phoenecian and Princess are far nicer. Food was mediocre at best, and overpriced as expected. I'm still not sure what I got for my $26 resort fee, as they even ran out of towels by the pool by midday.

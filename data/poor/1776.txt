Service was substandard because we booked online. It was insulting to be treated as second class because we did not book directly thru hotel site. My husband has stayed several nights prior to this visit and we have spent money at this hotel. This trip was beyond disappointing. I left after 1 night and the front desk still claimed our car was parked in their underground. This is not the luxury boutique hotel they are claiming to be.

Rooms were dirty Staff would offer to spray Febreze when guests complained about the smell .. ( I was thinking.. ARE U SERIOUS? Apparently they weren't kidding! O-kay! ) Given keys to a room that was occupied..apparently the guest had not checked out (Shouldn't they know if a room is empty, guess they don't clean the rooms either! ) Then... given keys to a room in which the keys were unable to open the door ( Thinking .. IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW..) Then go downstairs to find a staff at the front desk, who we will call "M". She proceeded to get an attitude with us, like it's our fault we walked into someone else's room and it's our fault that we were given keys to another room and the keycards didn't work because I really enjoyed squeezing my luggage into their tiny elevator twice! Unprofessional, low class! Needless to say after 2 hours we booked another hotel!!!

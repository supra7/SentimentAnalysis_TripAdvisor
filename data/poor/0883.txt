This is the first time I have ever written a review but I feel like people should know this stuff before they stay at any hotel! We were staying at the trump hotel and we had to change rooms initially do to sinks being clogged and no power. But wait it gets better. We had let in the late morning to get some food and left the room service bell on. We came back to hours later and the bed was made the service light was off. Nothing was clean in the rooms, no clean towels nothing, not even the bottle water we had to pay 20 dollars a day to have. Our stuff had been ransacked and gone through and 500.00 dollars of stuff, camera etc.. was taking from my bag. The maid pretty much came into our room stole our stuff and left. We reported it to security, but as of know I have not heard if this woman is still working there, or is going to have anything done about it. Scary to think Trump would hire someone like this. She didn't even do her job probably as just going room to room stealing stuff, since she wasn't cleaning. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, no one deserves to feel like this, or be violated, and have their stuff ransacked. The experience was disturbing to say the least. Do yourself a favor, stay at a luxury hotel that has better staff. The Venetian was amazing...and luxurious...on our last nothing even close to this horrific experience at the Trump hotel.

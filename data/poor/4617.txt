When we arrived at the hotel, there were upset guests ahead of us in line, They had been given a room that was already occupied. The situation was resolved but it left me wondering if the front desk staff would be handing out keys to other guests for our room also. We were in New Orleans for three days and I have to say the hotel's location and price were pleasant surprises. Unfortunately, not all of our surprises were so pleasant. On our second night there, as we prepared for bed, we found a large wad of chewing gum between the top and bottom sheets. It somehow got there when the room was cleaned that day. The front desk staff was very quick to respond but did not seem surprised at all. No apologies were offered---just a smile and a shoulder shrug. Later that evening, the bathroom was FLOODED when the toilet overflowed. Again, the front desk staff was quick to respond and, this time, was apologetic about the situation. The gentleman who showed up with a plunger shared that "this happens quite a bit". The safe in the room worked at times but was not consistent. Usually that would not concern us but we felt the need to lock up valuables since the front desk appeared to be handing out room keys randomly. It was just difficult to ever feel comfortable with all these negatives taking place. Spend a little more and save yourself the trouble.

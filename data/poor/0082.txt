Only place on short notice! Big mistake! Showed up in the lobby paid for the room. Once we got up to the room it was a dump. I would let my dog sleep there. This place is the biggest dump that I have seen EVER! Went to a friends room at the Weston tried to find another room in the city couldn't was going to sleep on the floor in our friends room. Called Kings Inn tried to get our money back after half hour and wouldn't give a refund. Called AAA which recommend then place on a whim since everything else was sold out in town. They told AAA there we that we sleep in the bed and used the shower. We spend 3 minutes in the room and left didn't even take our things up too the room. Loser and a RIP OFF.

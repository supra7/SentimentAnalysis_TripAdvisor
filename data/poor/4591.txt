This hotel is the worst place ever!!. I went after thanksgiving with my family and the people treat you kinda nice but they need to learn english since they dont know much. The housekeepers do a sloppy job on my room. I went to the restaurant and the service was not that good, i waited for an hour for my meal. Front desk always was busy and felt unimportant. Never coming back! I dont recommend this hotel for anybody!

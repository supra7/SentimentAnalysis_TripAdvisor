The rooms were booked by a close friend (for her wedding) who had been shown several of Dauphine Orleans' best and most newly renovated rooms. However, what we got was MUCH different. My husband and I were in a "cave" in the Hermann House. It wasn't even the corner room, but it was DARK and fit for vampires. The noise level of other patrons coming in and out of the gate was unbearable. The room smelled like New Orleans several weeks after Hurricane Katrina: a strong, intolerable odor that made it difficult to stay in the room. The refrigerator leaked on the carpet (pleasant to stand in a puddle when you're putting on make-up, right?) and a "Jacuzzi" tub that was hardly modern. (It looked like America's very first attempt at the Jacuzzi: it was as small as a standard tub, appeared filthy, and was quite a disappointment.) Another complaint was that the girl at the front desk magically lost our wedding favor. They specifically had names on them, and after we stressed our disappointment, she tried to give us someone else's gift. (Thanks, but no thanks, sweetie.) Finally, upon checkout, when I asked for a comment card for the hotel, she handed me a card with birds on it that was blank inside. She explained, "These are the old comment cards. You can write whatever." (I politely declined....)

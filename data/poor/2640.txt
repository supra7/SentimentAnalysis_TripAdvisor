Out the gate I was not happy with the staff at Place D'Armes because of the poor attitude I was getting from the the lady taking reservation. She made me feel as though I was putting her out. I other words don't bother me. But becasue the location was so great and the pricing reasonable I made the my reservations; 2 months in advance. The customer service rep (I use that term loosely with her) never verified any of my information. Hey, maybe she's better than I thought. Noooott. Nearly a month later I had to call them for my confirmation email. They didn't get my email information correct. I have to say the second lady I spoke to was much better. She sounnded professional and educated. They got the email address corrct this time ans I recieved and email. The problem is that they then got the dates wrong. The confirmation showed 8 Jun to 11 Jun. I was due for the Jul. Well as you can see the abriviation look pretty similar, I missed itm butr they charged me. I recieved the confirmation on the 28 or so of May so a few days came and by the time I realized what happened... they charged me. So not only did I not have a room for my visit they charged me for it. I tried to work this out wtih the GM and it was at that point I realized why this place operates the way it does. I was to recieve a call back from Bobby Valentio; it never happened. I'm from New Orleans, I was trying to help the local economy by patronizing some of the local businesses. Let's just say Marriot was grateful to see me. Katrina, BP oil spill. you guys need to think before you .......

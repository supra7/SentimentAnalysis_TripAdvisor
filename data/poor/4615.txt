I was visiting New Orleans for a conference and short vacation with my wife and stayed at the Embassy Suites on Julia Street as it seemed to offer excellent value. However, there were good reasons why it looked like a good deal. First the positive...the location is great for access to the convention center... Now the problems... On the first night we were on the 5th floor of the loft, which is a separate building behind the hotel. The first thing we noticed walking into the room was a cockroach sitting on the table. The room decorations in the loft have an industrial feel with unpainted exterior walls, as it is a converted factory/warehouse, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. We also had two double beds instead of the requested King, the elevator shaft was right by the bed, making noise all night and the hotel staff was unwilling and/or unable to move us. The next morning the toilet blocked and the alarm clock radio volume switch didn't work. We were moved to a new room the next day. While this one had a king bed and was in the main hotel, there was a noisy electrical transformer in the corridor closet behind the bed. The toilet blocked again, but flooded the bathroom this time, meaning we needed replacement towels that took a while to arrive. Then the towel bar broke. We were also unable to change the time setting on the alarm clock so had to remember it was always an hour behind. Finally, when we returned on our final day after touring the French Quarter, we found ourselves locked out of the room. We had been told we had checked out already!!! After showing our ID and having spoken with the senior receptionist, we were eventually let back into our room. Luckily our belongings were still there... We don't know if these types of problems are common in New Orleans, but they certainly should not be common at Embassy Suites. Our advice if you choose to stay here is not to expect the usual high standards and come prepared to deal with problems.

Boy did i make a mistake booking here. Unfortunately I did it based on the reviews i read on line, which must have been written by the owner or thir friends. Now I will try to protect the next person. First off we were greeted by a smoky smelling front desk area, and a most unfriendly gentleman who yelled at his housekeeping staff in front of us, which I was appalled by, and followed up with commenting on the weight of our suitcases. Suddenly we were "upgraded". to a room on the first floor (can you say "too out of shape to lift our suitcases a flight of stairs"). This Inn was eclectic for sure...like NOTHING in our room went together, it was overdecorated with fake flowers everywhere and was musty smelling, covered over with cheap air freshener. If this was an upgrade I would hate to have seen where they were planning to put us to start with. It was advertised as close to Balboa Park..I don't think so. Everytime we went to Balboa park it was a $8 cab ride. It was near NOTHING...it was in a residential neighborhood with a restaurant 8 blocks up and three blocks over. The clencher was there was no service to print our boardig passes. I nearly came out of my skin when the lady at the desk said we could go to Kinkos! The best part of this hotel was the housekeeping staff, and the cab that drove us away the second morning.

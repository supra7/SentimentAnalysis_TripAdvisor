Have stayed here in past after Bears nite games as the location is convenient and the price is low. Never had a problem though would have rated it just "okay". The last time I spent the nite is the last time I will stay. A man was on the loose in the hall, yelling and banging aggressively on doors. I called the front desk and was told that I was the second complaint and that they needed one more complaint to take action as the hotel had a "three complaint" policy. Did not sleep all night which negated the reason for even being there. I live about an hour away and should have made the drive. I wrote two letters when I got home, one to corporate Best Western and one to the local facility. Got a call from the local customer service saying that I must have misunderstood the policy and the front desk did not say what I heard. Got an email from corporate reiterating the response I got from the local unit and offering a gift card for 25$ to be used.... at Best Western. There is a very nice Hyatt down the street as well as a myriad of other hotels. I will be spending the extra money to stay at one of them in 2009.

I stayed at this property back in May for some rest and relaxation in what I thought was a nice hotel. At check-in, the staff was friendly, but once a problem arose, no one wanted to hear it. The problems began with being walked in on (Yes, my Do no Disturb sign WAS on the door, as the cocky desk manager argued with me... I think his name is Eric?) by the cleaning person at 9 in the morning. I brushed it off, for I didn't want to ruin my trip. Just as I was getting back to sleep, ANOTHER cleaning person pounded down the door (YES, th DND sign was STILL on the door!) asking to clean the room. I asked them to come back later. But the icing on the cake was the minibar attendant who, at 10 am, did not knock, did not even announce themselves, walked right into my room as I was dressing!! I jumped back in surprise and his response was, and I quote " just one minute ma'am, I have to check the minibar." Um, EXCUSE ME? Since when is it ok to enter without knocking and then continue on with your business while i'm half naked? The language barrier excuse would not even explain this! Feeling completely violated, I called the manager, Eric, who could not even find time to leave his office and come to my room. He lazily offered a 50 dollar credit and could have cared less!! I will never reccomend this place!!!

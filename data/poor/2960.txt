Bellman placed our luggage on a cart but we I had to roll it to our room ourselves. Oh and the room...my dorm room was larger. Water stains on the desk which I used as a counter for my suitcase. Musty old carpet, stained (with white crusty substance??) duvet cover, half inch think layer of dust on air conditioning controls. Clean but tiny bathroom was the only bright spot in the room. I've stayed in hotels all over NY from the best (Palace) to worst (Hotel Carter) and this is the smallest. It is a matchbox. Don't care about the club environment downstairs, I am paying for a comfortable room which I did not get. Shame on Starwood chain. I laughed at the room and cried at the bill. I've stayed in better rooms at hostels.

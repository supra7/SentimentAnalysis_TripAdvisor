We thought the valet parking that we paid for was through the hotel and secure..we weren't told until our vehicle was broken into, stereo stolen, windows smashed that the valet company was not part of the hotel at all but in fact was contracted out and our vehicle sat for 3 days in an unsecured lot. The day we checked out was a sunday (they told us about our vehicle as we were checking out) and there was nowhere open to have our window fixed..the hotel took zero responsibilty, we are from canada and didn't know the city and no one would help us get the windows fixed so we could drive home..we sat in the lobby for 5 hours trying to find a place to get our windows repaired... On top of that..the front desk people charged our visa 3 times for our stay prior to us actually checking out..we had two rooms booked for 3 nights each... When it was time to pay our bill my husbands visa declined, he spent an additional 2 hours on the phone with the visa company trying to figure out the problem.. Finally the visa company found the error but there wasn't a manager on duty to reverse the visa charges..it was an absolute mess!

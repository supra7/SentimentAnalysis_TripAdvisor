If you want to get mugged then go ahead and book! This place looks worse than the Watts projects! The pictures shown are not actually the units you get your room from. The main pic is the lobby area which looks nice, but they actually book your room 1-2 blocks away in ugly run down apartment buildings with bars on the windows and stinky inside. This place didn't seem safe at all, there was a lot of "suspicious" people walking outside trying to sell stuff...Literally it took us 7 minutes to walk from our ugly room to the lobby! It is literally down the street! They also rent out units to part-time workers. This place is HORRIBLE! Do not stay here and the staff isn't very welcoming! The only nice person here was the shuttle guy! Other than that please don't make the same mistake we did by booking this hideous, dangerous room!!!! BEWARE!

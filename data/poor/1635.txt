I usually dont usually take the time for writing reviews since i don't have the time for it. nevertheless, this is such an specific case i have to. I want you to know what i terrible mistake i made by chosing this hotel. As soon as i got there they could not find my reservation in the system and made me buy a bigger more expensive room. This girl i dont wanna mention her name (the only at the hotel on that sunday night) had a very bad atitude. The hotel was empty so i parked my car outside at the door. It wasnt valet, they kept the key and still charged me an extra 25 for that. I arrived around 11 at night and left at 6 next morning, so my car was exactly where i left it. The room costed me around 220 plus taxes and valet costed me around almost $300. The room was very old. The air conditioning/heater had to be turned off cuz of the loud noise it made I couldnt sleep. Everything and all the equipments are very old. The location is very unaccessible and horrible. Im not very familiar with Dallas but that location seemed dangerous to me. the breakfast is very deceiving also. PLEASE DONT GO THERE! The price is really not worth it. they are absolutely insane to have prices like that for such a low quality and bad services. Honestly if you stay at Motel 6 it will feel more luxurious than that! I have originally chosen to stay there cuz of the price, i thought it should be good for that price! I was very wrong! I went next night to the Crowne Plaza and had a blast! I was very amazed with the friendly stuff, great food, great location and FREE accessible parking right in front of the elevators! All of that for half of the price! New comfortable rooms i felt in heaven after the horrible time i had at the Springhill Suites. I have to go back to Dallas several more times and will never ever go back to the Springhill Suites.

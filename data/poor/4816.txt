Will not honor web site specials! A life long resident of California, we enjoy visiting San Franciso from time to time staying at one of the better hotels. The Mark Hopkins advertised several specials on their web site in the $200.00 price range.Upon calling to book a reservation, we were told they would no longer honor the advertised specials although they were still posted on the web site. We were offered another room and parking at almost DOUBLE the special rate cost. Mark Hopkins clearly uses deceptive  misleading advertising in an attempt to book you in higher priced rooms at 2X the special price....Sounds more like a used car dealership than a 4 star hotel. NEVER AGAIN!

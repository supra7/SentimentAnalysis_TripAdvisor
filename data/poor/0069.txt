The place is filthy, I'd expect to find a cleaner bathroom in a crackhouse! The staff have no control over the guests and parties carried on, on both levels of balconies, until after 3am. Repeated complaints had no effect and no got any sleep. In the morning we told the desk clerk how unhappy we were and his answer was " Guess you shouldn't have stayed here." I did but I'm urging everyone else to avoid this dump like the plague, you'd be better off sleeping in your car!!!

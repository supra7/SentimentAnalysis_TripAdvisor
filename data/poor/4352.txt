The check in process was the only thing good about this stay. The room was decent but our tub once filled would not let the water out (clogged). I called housekeeping who said they would send someone up. We went out, returned and someone had come in plunged the tub, left a dirty ring around the tub and shoe marks on the floor towel. I was left to wash out the tub with the complimentary shampoo. Housekeeping never came to our room during our 2 night stay despite calling to which they replied "oh, are you ready" . I didn't know you had to be ready to have your room cleaned these days. Even after placing the call to housekeeping no one ever came to clean, make the beds or empty the waste baskets. The hotel is way to far off the strip and despite the advertisement for a "strip view", we were notified that there is no strip view. I will not only not return to this hotel but I will not recommend it to anyone. I was overall disappointment with the Stratosphere during my visit to Vegas.

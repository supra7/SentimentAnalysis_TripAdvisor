Stayed 3 nights at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf with my family. From the moment we checked in until we left it was simply an awful experience. Just like staying in a cheap youth hostel. We had to queue half an hour to check in. Only one person in the reception and she was absolutely awful! No luggage arrived in our rooms. After 2 hours we had to make several calls to locate our bags which were nearly lost! The rooms were dirty, smelly and no extra bed available for our 7 year old daugher. The hotel is in a poor location. Hard to walk to central Boston. The rate we paid was similar to rates charged by Taj Boston, Ritz Carlton and other hotels. I will always regret having chosen this terrible terrible place. I am a Platinum Elite member and stay 70-80 nights a year with Marriott and this was by far the worst Marriott stay I have ever had. Will not even talk about the terrible breakfast experiences we had....... AVOID IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

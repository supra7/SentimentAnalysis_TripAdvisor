The location of this hotel is great. The staff were friendly. We awoke covered in mosquito, and other bug bites. My partner and I had literally dozens of bites between us. There was a bite on my eyelid, my forehead, between my fingers, on my feet. It was unutterably disgusting. I told the front desk about it, and they were apologetic. The manager didn't find it worth his while to apologize to us however. If you don't want to be itching for days after your stay there, don't stay at this hotel.

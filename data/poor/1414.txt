I've read some of the positive reviews of this place - obviously I wasn't staying in the same hotel. Scrappy, ill-maintained in an anonymous area of the town, unknown to most taxi drivers. On the positive side it was cheap and the rooftop pool had a certain something, at least it was clean. I think the gym was a room with an exercise bike. Breakfast was grim. I know that growing up with the Ulster fry spoils you for everything else but this breakfast was hopeless. I like to be adventurous and tried something that turned out to be a sort of tepid stew. I was sick for the rest of the day.

When I walked into the lobby of the Executive Pacific in Seattle, it was filled with young "hipsters" with ear plates and nose rings and tattoos - yawn - hey, youngsters, as an ex punk-rocker, you should know that all that nonsense hasn't really been "shocking" since the '80s. Don't worry - we see you. When I saw my room, now THAT was the shocker - old, run down, and most importantly, DIRTY. The grout between the tiles on the bathroom floor was black and mucky. The floor of the shower was filthy with "foot dirt". Even the robe hanging in the closet had STAINS running down the front of it! They should be embarrassed at the lack of hygiene in this place - maybe it's "alternative" to sleep in a filthy bed, but back in the '80s we did that for free, not for $150 a night. I complained at the front desk and was shown an "upgrade" room which was much bigger, but also had a dirty tub, and a filthy bathroom floor. When I pointed this out to the bellman, he said "Well, it's an old building." Pointing to some RECENT black fingerprint smudges on the closet door, I said, "Lots of buildings are old - this is a DIRTY building - I could take that off right now with some 409." I got out of there ASAP and found a CLEAN, big room in nearby Issaquah where the walls are thick enough that I don't have to hear my next door neighbor using the toilet (sorry to be gross). AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THEY SANDBLAST THE GRIME.

Its a nice hotel, not charming or romantic but nice. Stayed in a two bedroom suite and its a great size but had to fight with staff to not have a road view. Location is nice for some things like the proximity of oxbow market but overall neighborhood is not that nice ie. Wal-mart is a two block walk. Now lets talk about the problems wihthis hotel. It canbesummed up by saying poor management. The service could not be any worse. You need to call two to three times for anything! After our third day and second talk with manager i gave up. They miss cleanimg your room, miss simple thimgs like providing soap and shampoo. There is a full kitchen in two bedroom suite but no items like per towles to clean up. Its amazing how lax this staff is. When you get fed up and complain, they give you attitude. I came here to relax, and its difficult when you have to fight for basics. Maybe its because they automatically include gratuity makes them feel like they can act like a snobby french hotel. . I am a starwood platinum and would never stay here again. Westin and spg should be embarrased by this hotel. What a shame. Who is training this staff?

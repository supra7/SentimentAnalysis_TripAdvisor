Room was tiny. We paid extra for a 7th floor room but I have idea what we were paid extra for as friends stayed in a cheaper room but same size on a lower floor which seemed to be exactly the same (higher thread count sheets was the answer when we asked at reception). The window faced a brick wall. Amenities that were supposed to be in the room, such as a magnifying mirror, were not there. The hotel is simply a very cheap renovation of an old hotel with a few pieces of smart furniture in the common rooms. We had a office cabinet in the room as the chest of drawers - more cheap that stylish. We were unimpressed so complained at the front desk and the guy we dealt with was very sexist and was rude to my wife and did not try to fix things but simply said that we should find another hotel. A really poor experience all round as this is not what we expected from the website - never again.

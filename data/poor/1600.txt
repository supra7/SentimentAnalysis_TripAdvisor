This hotel has gone downhill!The location is the only good thing left; it's close to some really amazing shops and restaurants. The gym is very dated;the Starbucks located within the hotel is just awful.Their food is like a week old and they don't care about the quality of their coffee either. The most shocking thing was when my cell phone got stolen from my hotel room!!!No one has bothered to contact me ever since!Just shows how much they DON'T care about the guest! As much as I used to enjoy staying here I am now disgusted by this hotel and by it's operation system!

Stay away from this hotel. Front Desk staff was rude and unhelpful. Our "so-called' suite was nothing special with old non descript furniture and the bathroom was the size of a post stamp. The air conditionning is so old that you either freeze to death or end up in sauna-like conditions. The only good thing about this place is its location!!!

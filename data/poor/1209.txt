From the pictures the Boqueron Aquarius Club looks amazing, only steps from the ocean. However, once the pool area is crossed, the locked gate opened with the single key given to the group, a 200 yard walkway down an inlet, another locked gate surrounded by razor wire and short stroll across the sand you will have arrived at the water. A quaint village full of authentic natives lies across the inlet. For just $5 (wait nevermind the sign it is now $7) you can have yourself a nice straw sun hat. On a brighter note, about 8-10 miles south is the Cabo Rojo lighthouse where some of the most tranquil and picturesque beaches surrounded by cliffs are.

Our stay at the Napili Kai Beach Resort concluded on Saturday September 29, a four night stay. The first incident occured when my wife was harrassed on the beach and accused of not being a patron of the hotel by one of the employees working in the Makai Hale because we had not signed up for a beach towel which would have identified as patrons, allowing us to use the resorts chairs on the beach. We had our own towels and chairs were not items signed out for. By the way the verb harrass was used by the employee to describe her behavior, not a description we stamped this individual with. We then asked the employee to find out about the Honeymoon package which we were identified under(we were honeymooners) in hopes of getting the sparkling wine, food certificates....etc... included with this service (as advertised and stated in our itinerary). Upon returning the towel and snorkeling equipment the employee proceeded to tell me she spoke to my wife and the resort would be taking care of this for us. Nothing was ever done and we left the resort with a sour tatse in our mouths.

This was NOT a wonderful vacation spot at all. If I only would have been smart enough to come and read all of the reviews before booking the trip..... So sad that I had to waste one nights money on this place. I'm glad that we got the second night refunded to us, THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE PLACE...... If I were you, I would go down the street to Comfort In as it ROCKS!!!!!!!! It's cheaper and ALL of the workers are outstanding.... I would not take my dog back to this facility. It is very dirty, and watch out, they have HBO in the kids bunk area NOT A GOOD IDEA for 8 and 5 year olds......

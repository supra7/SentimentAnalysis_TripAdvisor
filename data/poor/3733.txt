No aloha at the Waikiki Parc This is a problematic hotel with serious customer service issues, starting with the staff at the front desk. One young woman in particular consistently acted as though she had been roused from hibernation to do her job. I was concerned for her health as she may have a sleep disorder.  During our five day stay, there was no encounter with the front desk that did not consume a minimum of thirty minutes or create auxiliary problems that required later redress i.e., another trip to the front desk or another time-consuming phone call. There was absolutely no spirit of competency, hospitality, or ordinary courtesy, much less aloha, at the Waikiki Parc. Inexcusable at any hotel, but particularly irritating in Hawaii.  We love Oahu, travel there frequently, and we're very much looking forward to our next stay at the Moana Surfrider.

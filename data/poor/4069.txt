The hotel itself is in a good location, but for the $190 a night I am paying, just not worth it. The rooms were updated years and years ago. The restaurant, like the exercise room, doesn't open till 7AM. And to make matters even worse, the exercise room is located on the only smoking floor. I used to smoke and have no problems with "smokers", but do I have to smell it (heavily) while I work out? And their reason for why they don't open the exercise room till 7? Too much noise. Yet it doesn't seem to bother them that their ice makers sound like mini lear jets trying to take off! I can hear it 8 rooms away. I also had to call down to get the wireless connection code. I called four times, each letting it ring 20 times or so. Finally I went down to the front desk. Surprise, two people standing there. One finishing up with a customer. I asked why she couldn't have picked up the phone (which was ringing again) and say "front desk, please hold". She seemed shocked that I would expect such customer service. I also NEVER took my socks off, which should tell you how dirty the room is, yuk! Skip this hotel! I found another independent hotel one block away, next time that is where our staff stays.

I stayed at this hotel last week, from December 3-7. The hotel self-parking lot flooded, my car was there on the last night, the car was covered in water and the rental car's GPS system was ruined due to the flooding. It was the third night in a row that the parking lot was flooding and the hotel did not inform the guests. Not only that, but they act with extreme disrespect towards me and my mother, since we were leaving. A very disrespectful person from the insurance company called me on Monday and said the hotel would not pay for my GPS because it was not their responsibility and it was an Act of God. My question: if I am a guest at your hotel and your parking lot is flooding all the time, you are not going to tell me? Not only that: after the flood, they did not tell any of the guests that our cars were covered in water. IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR GUESTS. PLUS, WHEN I ARRIVED, THERE WAS A DIRTY SOCK FROM THE PREVIOUS GUEST UNDER MY BED AND THE TOILET WAS NOT WORKING, PLUS THE FACT THAT MY CAR FLOODED IN THE PARKING LOT, THE GPS WAS DAMAGED AND THEY SAID THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR IT. THE WOMAN FROM THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY CALLED ME AND WAS VERY IMPOLITE. NEVER AGAIN, STAY AWAY!!!!!

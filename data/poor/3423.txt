The hotel is under reconstruction and there are jack hammers on the outside of the building all day from morning until night. We had to wear earplugs to stay in the room. The hotel will not tell you about the reconstruction, and they won't refund your money. No mike sound is deafening and it never stops. There is construction dust leaking thru the windows too. The entire outside of the building is being torn off and rebuilt. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP.

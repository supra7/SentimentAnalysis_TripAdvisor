We booked 2 nights at the hotel. We were awaken by the train in the morning. Left the room at 9 am and did not return till midnight. To our surprise, our room was untouched for 15 hours, bed was not made and towels were not changed. We were not impressed by the service at this hotel and will not recommend to anyone.

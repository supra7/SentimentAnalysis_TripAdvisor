We booked this hotel for Easter break at an excellent rate and were looking forward to our visit. Three days before our arrival in Turkey I received an email from the manager, that is barely comprehensible, stating our credit card didn't work and as a result they took the liberty of not only canceling our reservation but selling it to someone else. Never mind the fact I use this credit card daily and re-checked the details against our reservation that was e-mailed months ago--given this is over Easter and one of the most sought after dates they surely sold our room to someone else who was willing to pay a higher price. I'm also curious how the manager said he tried calling three times however he only emailed me once--and that was to let me know our room was gone! If you want a well-run operation with trustworthy management there are many other options in Istanbul to choose from. Don't say you haven't been warned...look elsewhere.

I stayed here for a 3 day conference and had nothing but problems from the moment I checked in. Twice on the first day my room key got deactivated - and it was never near a credit card or cell phone! It wasnt only me either, people in line next to me were having the same problem and the hotel staff claimed to not know of anyone else experiencing the same issue. Then it turns out the a/c wasnt working correctly in my room and all that came out was humid air. When I got back to my room it was fixed but the smoke detector was taken off the wall and was hanging down with the wires out. That night I discovered a huge swarm of bugs above the bed! The hotel staff immediately assumed I had opened the windows (which I didnt because my view was of construction) but reassigned me to another room - at 1 am. Then I bought internet service for my room with the wireless keyboard that was provided, but not a single website worked. The a/c units are also terribly noisy (no matter what temp air is coming out of them). It is so inconvinient to get to the business center and fitness center because you have to take 2 sets of elevators. I found out it used to be a radisson so maybe it explains some of it - but dont waste your time or money here!

Checked in on a Friday afternoon, all was going well until night time when the hot water went out. Luckly we showered after we got back from the pool. The hot water seemed to have gone out some time before midnight (Friday night). So, here we are 5:10pm, Saturday evening and still no hot water. We called and complained about it and asked for at least one night be taken off our bill and nothing. The hotel managers said the best they can do is give us a $50.00 concession. We called and complained 3 times during the day and still nothing. Customer service was terrible, basically said "too bad their is no hot water, it will come on when it comes on." I stopped gambling here and can not wait to check out of this hotel. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!

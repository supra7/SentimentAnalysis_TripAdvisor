We were given rooms on the 10th and the sixth floors.. they smelled... they were unclean... with ripped comforters, bouncy beds.... exposed pluming.. no lightblubs coffeemakers didnt work.. We stayed there for an event... they knew it was be 200+ people attending..and they didnt even check to make sure the lightbulbs worked.. The resturant food was at best unappetizing and overpriced. Most of the employees dont speak english so you had to find a manager who did (BARELY).. The front desk was rude and the room keys needed to be constantly rekeyed.. and in the end they overcharged me and the said basically " SO WHAT!!!"... Im telling you that this is the worst hotel I have ever been in... Super 8 right across the street would have been a better choice.

RUDE RUDE RUDE front desk staff. My first and last time staying there. The girl who waited on me should find another job cause she sure seems miserable there. Not to mention the nasty and dirty carpet in the rooms. I also payed for the internet service they provide and it only worked 1/4 of the time.

Nothing works in the middle of nowhere Not only was this hotel off in the middle of nowhere - in the middle of the industrial part of town right next to the Boeing manufacturing site- but nothing worked. This would be the perfect hotel for anyone that's not picky about being someplace interesting or having any amenities like decent service or door locks. Just a brief synopsis of what was broken: the pool was closed and empty; the restaurant was being remodeled (we were there for 3 days and didn't see anyone working on any remodeling); the ATM was out of order; we asked for a few extra towels around noon one day and were told they're all in the drier; the bathroom door didn't close all the way and had no lock; both of our keys randomly stopped working one evening; the fitness center as they called it was really just one treadmill and one stair stepper perched above one of the staircases that literally had spider webs across the entrance ?they obviously hadn been used in ages never mind cleaned or serviced; the day before we were departing, we reserved the shuttle to the airport for 4:30 on our departure day - he was about 20 minutes late. It was cheap, but there are cheap places elsewhere in the city that would probably be a better call for someone looking to enjoy their stay.On the plus side, there this crazy retro diner just up the road (andy? that was pretty decent and worth the trip if youe in the area (though you really shouldn be). There was also he Tavern?a bar with a number of interesting characters, though not some place I want to go alone.

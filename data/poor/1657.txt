My daughter reserved a room for herself and father from out of town, as it was a block from the court house, and they had a very important court hearing on July 5th. With the stress, my daughter left a very special one carat diamond ring that cannot be replaced from sentiment, along with 2 less valuable rings. After 2 calls, and finally my husband calling, we were told the cleaning person's name, and that they would talk to her. My husband offered a reward, knowing that would only admit guilt from someone, but that they would talk to her supervisor. A message on my daughter's cell phone, was left 2 days later that they did not find them in the room. I want this exposed, as a hotel is only worthy if one can trust them. Very disappointed that the rings were not returned.. and a sad daughter.

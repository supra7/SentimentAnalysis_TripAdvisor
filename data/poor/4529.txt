I would love to give this property a 5 star rating but I honestly can not.I have VERY fond memories of staying at this hotel when I was younger staying her with my mother!! I normally stay at the mansion on turtle creek but I was flying back late at night from a trip in NYC and needed a place to take a shower and sleep for several hours and did not want to spend $2000 on my normal suite at the mansion and could not beat the $100 a night rate at the adalphous!! What a mistake this hotel was a complete disappointment for the full 6 hrs I was there! NO HOT WATER was the biggest disappointment and the other was the way I was treated by the gentleman at the front desk! When I checked out he ask me how my stay was and I told him about the hot water(no hot water in my shower) problem and he just laughed and said "thats funny most guests have been complaining about having nothing but hot water and no cold". I had just got back from a 4 night stay in the royal terrace Suite at the plaza in NYC which goes for $12k a night and might have inquired about the penthouse at the adalphous for the next time me and my girlfriend where in dallas if I was treated as a guest and not a customer renting a basic room at this property!! With all do respect to the wonderful history of this hotel if you are looking for luxury dont be fooled by this place book at the Ritz, four seasons or the Mansion or maybe even the palmor !!! I mean no disrespect to the historic property but as much as I want to love it and make it my home in Dallas it is lacking in quality and staff. I will always stick to the terrace suite at the Rosewood from now on.

It was horrible experience to stay at Red Roof Inn on my recent trip. Staff was very good, location is amazing but the rooms and overall hotel building is in very terrible shape. The room carpets are sticky and dirty, towels were ages old, Bed and blankets were horrible. There is a strange and dirty stinking smell in the room. Every time you return to room you have to face it and I was regretting having booked and prepaid for this hotel. If you really want to spend some quality time on vacation consider a better hotel as it is most important part of trip where you will recharge yourself after hectic sightseeing schedule.

My wife booked us elsewhere based on TA review and we're glad she did. We just had to see the place though. I was put off by the aged appearence, the boarded-up building on the property and the wooden walkways with some boards we would have replaced at least 5 years ago if they had been on our deck.I will say that the grounds are lovely.

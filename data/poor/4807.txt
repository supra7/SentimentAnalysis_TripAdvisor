Continues grest service Mark Hopkins Hotel San Francisco---January 23- 27, 2008The Mark Hopkins continues to give great service to it's hotel guests. We have been guest at the hotel in the month of January for years. One of the reasons we visit San Francisco is to stay at the Mark Hopkins. We have found the complete staff very constant in providing excellent service to us as well as other guest we have sent there. Always prompt, always professional and friendly. Through the years we see the hotel keeps their rooms fresh and up to date. It is our opinion the hotel is somewhat understated and quietly delivers excellent service, very clean rooms, excellent service and a fantastic location. We use the hotel web site to get very good rates and never disappointed with our room selection. Sometimes we are given up-grades which is always appreciated. There seems to be a sincere welcome when you first arrive; starting with the doorman and front desk. We also find the cosigner desk very helpful and patient. The room service is also very efficient and prompt. We have learned not to have a car in San Francisco--no parking and expensive and it is very expensive at the hotel. Not a inexpensive place to stay, but a great value. Stay there and I bet you will agree.

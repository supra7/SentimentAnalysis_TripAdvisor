We are living in the same area as Columns Hotel and it's curb appeal made me decide to make a reservation for Sunday Brunch. The woman behind the desk was not only aloof and snobbish, she walked away from me when I was asking a question after making the reservation. My husband was offended and upset but I did not cancel the reservation. After a few hours reflection I have decided that he is right, we DO NOT want to support such a business. I had told her that we were local and she was so disrespectful and cold that I won't repeat the experience. Thanks but no thanks!!!

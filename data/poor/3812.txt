Don't Stay Here This hotel was so run-down that as soon as we got into our room, we decided that we wouldn't stay there and called our travel agent to book us somewhere else. The name of the hotel (on the building) wasn't the same as what we had on our confirmation, even though it was the same place. The front door was broken and we had to slide the automatic door open by hand. The staff was rude, the elevator up to the room was small and unstable, the key to the room was a traditional key (metal/not a key card). To get into the room, you had to literally put your shoulder into it, as the door was misalligned. The bed was VERY small and was right next to the tile floor, which didn't seem safe. On top of all that, the window air conditioner was broken. We were so disappointed in the place that we decided to lose our $80 for the night and stay somewhere else. Sometimes it is worth it to pay more money for a decent hotel. Staying here would have ruined our vacation!

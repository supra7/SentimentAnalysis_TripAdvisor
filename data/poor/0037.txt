If old, torn and stained linen, towels, bedsheets gives you a thrill, you'd love this hotel. If you never iron your clothes, youd love this hotel as there are no irons in the rooms. If you feel that rusted bathroom and showers that dont work gives you an excellent reason to skip a shower, you'd love this hotel. If you think that a hotel that has no airconditioning in the rooms is a great opportunity to get fresh air, you'd love this hotel. If you think that having only 3 channels on tv to choose from is great, you'd love this hotel. If you think that "identify that carpet stain" is a great game to play with family and friends, you'd love this hotel. If you think that massive holes in the ceiling and walls in the room means that our dear rodents friends wont be bored or hungry, you'll love this hotel. I could go on, but I think you get the picture here.

This is a terrible hotel! The bed sagged, the room was small and the hotel was noisy, run-down and unclean! We were booked for 2 nights - we asked for a refund for the second night and went to a better hotel! The clerk was more concerned that she not refund the night we stayed (which I didn't ask for) than finding out why we were leaving early. Go somewhere else!

My husband and I just returned from staying at the Park Plaza for 2 days. It was the most disgusting place!! The hotel itself is nice but our room was so gross. We were on the 5th floor and the walls were dirty and needed a new paint job. When we got into our room, the carpet was extremly dirty. There was a musty smell. There were 2 bathrooms in our room but they looked like they had not been cleaned in years. One of the bathrooms had mice droppings on the counters along with dead spiders on the walls. The showers had mildew all piled up on the walls. Then to top it off a cockroach came running across the room. I thought was going to vomit. I have never stayed in such a filthy place. I will never stay there again. The managers were rude and told us we were seeing things. Right!! I do not recommend this place. I would have rather slept in the park then in this place.

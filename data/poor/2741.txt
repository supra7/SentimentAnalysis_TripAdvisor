We picked this hotel for its proximity to Columbia (we usually stay in midtown or the Upper East side). The hotel lacked any charm and did not seem to be a good deal for the price. Hotel has a small lobby area by check-in counter that wasn't inviting and we missed having a nice continental breakfast or place for snacks or coffee. Also, they claim to be a AAA hotel but they wouldn't honor our AAA card and give us the AAA discount because we reserved the room online - and the online price we paid was 100% higher than what was quoted in their hotel brochure! The only pluses were that the room was perfectly clean and being a block from the metro, was easy to get all over NYC - from Midtown, to SOHO, etc. All considered though, we wouldn't stay here again.

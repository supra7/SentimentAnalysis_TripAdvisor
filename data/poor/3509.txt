When we arrived at the hotel (party of 4 in 4 double rooms), we were helped with our luggage (4 flights of stairs), through dark and dusty hallways. The first night in my room I was bitten by bedbugs and woke up at 4.00 am. The nightstaff were fabulous and arranged another room for me, which was perst-free, but with no working telephone line. It is hard to contact your colleagues and the frontdesk with no phone, and being on the 4th floor, I had to walk up and down the stairs, to make sure I could move rooms again. They gave me an 'upgrade' and a 'free night' for the trouble (has not been credited by the way, nor did I get a confirmation of this). All but one member of staff, called Anthony (he was great), were arrogant, did not believe me, were not helpful. Lady at the bar was wonderful too, and made my stay at least nice in the Moroccan style lounge/bar. I have been back home for 4 days, but the bedbug bites still bug me. The whole hotel is very dirty, there was a mental woman out in the hallways screaming and yelling, so had very very little sleep. This is nothing more than a youth hostel with 4* hotel prices! On a slightly positive note, the area is nice, with some lovely restaurants, I enjoyed the Metro Diner, and a Peruvian/Chinese/Polynesian place, and the 103rd street Subway was right outside the hotel.

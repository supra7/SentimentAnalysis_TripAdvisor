We stayed here for a weekend wedding held at the Old Red Courthouse a couple of blocks away. We had our car parked at a meter outside the hotel on Saturday afternoon. The meters are free after 6 pm. I thought I had enough change in the machine to make it till 6. Wrong. I got a ticket at 5:37 in a nearly-deserted downtown Dallas. The next day after checking out. we discovered that my son's car had the windows busted in and some items were stolen. I guess the police were too busy protecting parking meters to watch out for anything else. Do not stay in downtown Dallas. It is just not worth it. Hotel is average.

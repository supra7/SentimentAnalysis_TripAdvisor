Room apparently had water damage, so arrived early evening to no room (it happens I guess). They offered to put us up in their recently renovated apartment, but when the bell man walked me over to the empty buildings, the hallway was filled with construction (tubs, and other stuff) materials. There was no services including no WiFi, the guy actually thought it was a plus that a kitchen was included. We were supposed to walk over to the hotel for the breakfast. I'm in Venice for 2 nights and paying nearly $400/night, you think I'm going to find a grocery?? A second offer was made for the hotel next door, and they would move us the second night. I called Expedia and they moved us within the hour.

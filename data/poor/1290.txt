First of all I dont even know where the photos of the hotel Super 8 provided came from. A more accurate photo was offered by a trip advisor member (see the person from San Fran). Got there, walked in, almost pasted out from the stench and dirt, canceled, and ran out before i got mugged or violated. This has nothing to do with being a hotel snob, this is based on safety...lack there of!! Like Crack, it's wack and just say no!!

Stayed @ Sheraton Maui twice before. Also a starwood gold member so I stay at Sheraton brand often. Upon checkin, we were informed there were no more King beds available although that is what I booked. I was told since I used a third party to book I had no guarantee for bedding. I had booked a Partial ocean view king bed. I asked for a manager and was finally placed in a partial ocean view king. Calling this a partial ocean view is one of the most mis-leading statements ever. The opposite side of the hall is ocean front so how can this be partial? By hanging your head 3 feet off the ledge and looking around the corner you can Partially See The Ocean. The room is very bland and white with no water pressure in the shower. The bathroom was set up for midgets with a 3 foot counter. Bad experience all around, be sure to avoid or you will be next

The room was hot and humid at night, making it hard to sleep. The noise level didn't help either. Little privacy. We caught the neighbors peeking into our room from the balcony while we slept. The beds were homemade with sharp corners that we kept banging into. Also, the screen to the bathroom window was missing, and was not fixed as promised. The stay was miserable!! We finally cut our loses and moved to a nice hotel, near Sea World, on Mission Bay. However, if your purpose in life is to surf and party, without the need for materialistic stuff like air conditioning, this may be the place for you... In my opinion, it should be torn down and replaced with a modern facility.

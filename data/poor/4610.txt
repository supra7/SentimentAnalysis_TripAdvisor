Yes the hotel was clean... Yes its close to the sites... Yes the food was OK. But there was NO mention of the HIGH parking costs that were going to be added to the BILL! When I checked in I pulled into the parking entrance. There was a sign there that said "Unlimited Parking Privlages for Hotel Guests" No indication that there was a fee for guests. No mention of this charge was made upon check-in even though it was asked if I had a car in the lot. There is a sign farther in the parking area that has hourly rates on it... as well as an over night rate. However, on that same sign there is a statement that it is unlimited for hotel guests. Upon check out I found that there was a $180.00 charge for the six days of my stay. I complained and even showed the desk clerk the outside sign that had NO mention of the parking charges! "Sorry, Thats what we charge for parking!" is all I got. People from our corporation travel all over the USA and Canada and mainly stay at Embassy Suites when we can... Well as of June 23rd. that has changed.... Sorry Embassy... You have now lost several hundred stays across the country per year! By the way for those of you that need Internet connections for work, It is $14.95 per day here. You figure that at $170.00 per night that could be included... I have stayed a cheap hotels that had MORE to offer with the room fee than this place. Watch out for the Hidden Costs that they don't even want to mention my friends. An added note. The desk clerk did say that the Manager would be in touch with me. Well I have tried three times over the past few days to get in touch with them.... NO LUCK! I guess Embassy dosen't care. Photos of the parking sign in question will be posted ASAP.

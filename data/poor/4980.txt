If you're planing to check in with this hotel, just don't! Unless you really have to. I booked the hotel for 3 nights upon arrival on 14th and upon the 2nd night i was told that i had to leave the room! reason given that somebody else had reserved the room since 1st of July and the system wasn't showing the slot on the computer so i wasn't told on the check-in date! So they offered me another 2 rooms with no windows that would have ended up much more expensive for me and my family! so we just checked out and spent our money on a family room at Fragrance Hotel for the last night which was much cleaner and had a great service. Location wise it's not exactly the city center nor it is a prime location but at least is close to public transport. However, in Singapore, where ever you wish to stay is close to some sort of public transport. Some rooms don't have windows that can be really depressing so make sure you get a room with a window if ever. Payed around 130 sqd per night for a family suit room but that's even considered expensive in regard to the location, comfort and service quality. I finally ended up in Fragrance Hotel Emerald down the same road and it was much cheaper for 89 sqd per night for a family room. Fragrance was much cleaner, had friendlier staff and really helped us out even when we were one person extra in a 3 beded room.

DO NOT STAY HERE! We experienced everything from holes in our sheets to a cockroach in the bathroom. The carpets have not been cleaned in years (socks will be black in minutes!), the pools have dead bugs that are NOT removed daily, and housekeeping didnt take out our trash in 5 days. It would be cleaner to stay on the streets of Las Vegas!

I am here in my room at the Ritz Carlton as I write this review. Unfortunately, I ignored warnings and kept my reservation. My list of disappointments is way to large for a hotel that should be so much more. First of all, there is not any "in-room" coffee. So, we had to go to the Lobby area to get a cup of their "Complimentary Coffee" that is part of the 18.00 per day service charge. Needless to say, walking into the lobby at 6am for coffee is not joyful. All the guests were scrambling over a coffee set up. The hotel is run down as they are closing in July for a complete renovation. So, expect everything including the Pool Lounges to be aged and "ratty." We have about 40 large spider webs in the trees in front of our balcony with large spiders in them, which is a little creepy and distracting. The views are terrible, we have a peek a boo ocean view. No sounds of crashing waves or sunsets or any of the wonderful things that make Hawaii so special. The Service Staff have not been properly trained in the true meaning of "service and hospitality". They are proficient but don't expect any special treatment. They have a pool with 3 levels, one of the levels should be for Adults only, but instead their is alot of children. Which is fine, except if I was "honeymooning", I would hope for a different atmosphere. I would suggest for the RC Managment Team to visit a Four Seasons in a crash course on Service, Style and Operations. One visit to a Four Seasons will make anyone realize how disappointing this hotel is.....I hope in December when they re-open that everything is turned around. But given the off water, way north location I still would not suggest it to anyone unless they bring "very special service" into the equation. They should be bringing complimentary otter pops by the pool, evian spritz's, cucumbers, fresh fruit and service levels to that level with a name like Ritz Carlton.

Just recently stayed for HOFEX the Hospitality Expo. Being a traveller 6-8 month of the year I've lived in hotels for the past 12yrs. I was recommended by a HK friend who stayed for a weekend getaway. I was up graded to a suite which was nice. Room are spacious with all the latest mod cons. ( But already run down & not well maintain) The hotel is very slick with some young beautiful staff but most with little substance/knowledge. The hotel has only 2 restaurant (Fire) the up scale casual dining.....Modern Pan Asian fair....the restaurant is again as expected slick, but that's all. Food was slow and lacked flavour, small portion and quite pricy the room was over half empty. (A forgettable experience) The wine list was well rounded but with a 250-300% mark up.... (Kitchen) the all day dining was the the other I had breakfast on most days and dinner. Breakfast pretty standard...while dinner was now a buffet which was changed recently I was told. Items & selection was poor on the buffet the seafood was flash frozen and was not replenished fequently. Again items lack flavour and variety. The best part was the choice your own Mains. The Lounge bar was the highlight quick efficent service, the only thing cocktails took a little time to arrive but was well made..a little aver priced compared to other venues in HK. The music was uplifting yet not overly loud so we could still chat. Overall the place was like a Faberge Eggs beautiful & expensive on the outside but when you open it...it's just an empty shell.

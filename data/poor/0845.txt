On arrival they were overbooked and bumped me to a truly awful hotel that you wouldn't keep pets in. On complaint I was told it would be resolved but when I actually returned with my bags they refused to do anything about it were unbelieveably rude and I ended up with no refund or place to sleep - I stayed on a friends floor in the end in a different hotel. Never ever, ever again!!!

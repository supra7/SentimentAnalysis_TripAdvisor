Setting expectations is everything. I made a res on Expedia for a hotel with a pretty good brand and a great location, for $264 how bad could it be? Really bad. The listing on Expedia failed to mention that the hotel is under renovation and that there is no f&b...When I was so informed at check in I was told that there was a big collection of menus in the room from nearby spots that would deliver. There were two dog eared pizza menus but no matter, lots of nice places nearby. Did I mention that they are coring concrete in the building? This is what God's own root canal sounds like, but they stopped by 5pm so no worries. In the morning it was pouring rain, even at the humblest Quality Inn the good folks have a tray of pastries and a thermos of coffee. Not here, and although they are within blocks of more shops selling umbrellas than anywhere else in the civilized world (Michigan Avenue) there was not a single umbrella available for a guest to walk up the street to the Red Roof to grab a cup of coffee. What else? It took three calls to Wayport to get the internet working, the mirror in the bathroom is way too low for six footers. I booked (and paid for) a studio suite and they put me iin a regular room. The television cannot be comfortably viewed from the bed. But the worst thing is they don't care. There is just an utter disregard for customer service. The valet parker was nice but for $40 I guess he should be. I should have slept in the car! If management is reading this and wants to make sure this is not a fake, my name is Mark E. and I stayed on April 24. You can figure out how to get in touch with me if you like.

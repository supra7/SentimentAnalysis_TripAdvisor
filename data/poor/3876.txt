We were there with my whole familly and our stay at that hotel was absoluely disgusting! Right when we got there guests were warned about theft going on in the facility so right there there was a red flag and so we paid extra for a safe deposit key for our belongings. The room had 3 locks just to be safe but we were still scared. We wanted to changed hotels completely but we decided to suck it up and forget all the hassel. First of all, everything is OLD and dirty. I will never ever stay at this hotel again. Luckily it gave us more motivation to leave our hotel and tour most of the island. The staff there is rude as can be. There was this one lady ( she had long long hair) she was always rude to me and even when we had to borrow towels they acted like we were going to steal them. Their service is horrible. The only persone who was helpful was the concierge and she wasn't even part of the Maui Lu! Nothing came with the room either. If you needed anything, you had to request it from the front desk. I would never ever recommend this "motel" to nobody. We figured since it was an Aston that it wouldn't be that bad but this was the worst ever.

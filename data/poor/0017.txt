First impression was scarred by their valet parking attendant. He was driving a car in reverse at a speed higher than necessary and almost removed the front end of our car. Further moments of not being impressed were numerous stains on the curtains and bedcovers, internet access at $11 per day, movies at $13.99 each, cable channels were not coming in except the news, parking was additional $27/day, had to request housekeeping service by phone and it was already 4pm in the afternoon, noise from the steet is loud at all hours due to the METRO stop right outside the window, and to top it all off, the food at their lounge and restaraunt is so expensive 2 of us ate for $140 with 1 bottle of cheap wine and we shared our dessert, other nearby establishments were reservations recommended or 45 minute wait to eat/drink. The only good thing about the hotel was the pool was warm and the location is good for walking to attractions.

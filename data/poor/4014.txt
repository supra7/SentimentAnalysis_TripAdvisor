We paided for half board but could only get breakfast.The restaurant was closed at night we then had to go to the french bistro and choose 2 courses and the selection was bad.The selection at 12- 3pm was bad too ie the buffet.The only good thing was breakfast.I dont recommend staying here to anyone.

W Hotel at Lexington Ave and 51st. What a big disappointment! . The lobby looks trendy and is fairly nice the staff is ok, not rude but not particularly nice with the exception of the concierge staff who were very courteous, helpfull and professional. The first room I was given was a size of a closet (imagine the size of the closet..) and telephone did not work. The second room was ok in size, but: no directory, no slippers, no stationary, no turndown in the evening, not a single European TV channel, Light in the room is terrible, The air conditionning/heating was extremely noisy, the bath amenities are ok in quality but very poor in size. Overall there is a lack of service and the feeling that no one really cares. I paid 600 $ a night (tax incl)! Be sure that you can get a much better hotel in NYC for that money. Will definitely not return and would not recommend.

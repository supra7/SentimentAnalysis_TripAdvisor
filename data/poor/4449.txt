This place is foul! Absolutely the worst hotel and casino you can get in the area! Disgusting in every way. Crack heads, hookers, and people you don't want to meet are here. Loosers and users hang out here. I was terrified my car was going to get broken into. The casino is a dirty joke, I would never want to touch any machine in the place. The room had no phone or remote control... need to deposit money to get those. No ice bucket because there is no ice machine, unlocking window which made me super nervous about leaving my room. No mirror on the wall because the druggies stole it. Dirty shower/ bathroom with a tub/shower whose drain barely works. Water is up to your knees in just a few minutes. This is by far the seediest hotel I have ever stayed in. I only stayed 12 hours, and I will NEVER be back. The only people who will enjoy this hotel are people who come from and are used to the ghetto. It truly is like a little piece of compton right there in vegas.

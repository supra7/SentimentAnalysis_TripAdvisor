Firstly Buyer beware, when you book a room online (In their words) "They do not garentee that you will get the room that you pay for, it is simply a request". Oh and i should note that when you book they make you paay for the first night upfront. We "requested" a King bed, non smoking strip view premier room. When we checked in they said "We are booked out of the king stripview premier non smoking', Instead they gave us a SMOKING Stripview room with 2 doubles. OMG!!!!! This room STUNK!!!! An Ashtray would have smealt better!!!, When we complained they didnt realy care, they basically said Tuff, take what your given. We will move you to the room you requested tomorrow. OMG Overall i was EXTREMLY Disapointed about our stay and will NEVER recomend this hotel to anyone! The only good thing was the pool i guess, oh wait i forgot... it closes at 7pm....

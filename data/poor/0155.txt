I read many reviews on citysearch and trip advisor re: Moore Hotel. Called to book; only "shared bathroom" queen room was avail. I lived/traveled in Europe for over a year; didn't think shared bath would be a problem. However, fiance and I shared a bathroom (one toilet, one shower) with an entire floor (we stayed in room 403). That is, 25 rooms: 1 bathroom. Yes, you read correctly, 25 rooms with at least 2 people in each room, and ONE bathroom. Everytime, day/night/6am/midnight/noontime that we tried to use shower, it was busy. Paper-thin walls, no shower, toilet so far from room, tiny room with dirty sink in room, and smaller-than-reserved-bed...well, we were miserable. Asked to change rooms but were told they were full. Tried to find another hotel in Seattle for under $150/night, impossible. Loved the town but will never, never, never stay at this hotel again. Passed many homeless/drunk/druggie-looking types on way to hotel each night---for sure I wouldn't have felt safe without my 6'5" fiance on my arm. Wanted to warn everyone with our experience--try to stay in Capitol Hill or Belltown, both close enough to downtown action/shops/mass transit and far enough away to enjoy more of "the locals' Seattle".

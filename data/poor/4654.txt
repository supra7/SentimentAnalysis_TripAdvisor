We have just returned from a 3 night stay during the French Quarter Festival (room 103). Let me begin by saying that we have been very loyal to the Chateau for our 15 years of traveling there and have recommended the Chateau to many friends & family. We were very disappointed at how the place has deteriorated. The carpet was filthy, the tiles were almost falling off the bathroom ceiling, there wasn't enough hot water, the TV had constant stripes running over it and the room smelled so moldy that we had to keep the AC on constantly to make the smell go away. The beautiful courtyard of the past is no longer. The pool was dirty and the fountain was green. I really hope the owners replace the carpeting with hard wood and do some major renovating with out taking away the charm of the old place. On the upside we love the location, but won't return until we know the Chateau has been upgraded. We love Idessa, Wendell and the bell boys.

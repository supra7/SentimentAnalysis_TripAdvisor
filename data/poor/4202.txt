I was looking forward to attending a convention this past week. Arrival wait to check in 30 mintues. Room was not ready upon arrival. When it was room was filthy. Housekeeping services came up and said sorry, and made a half attempt to rectify. Dont ask for anything because if you do, they will treat you awful! Our confrence included internet and when asked why I was charged, they said because I used it. Only after bringing it to the attnetion of confrence mgnt did they agree that it was included and remove the charge and Hotel staff makes it seem like they did me a favor. Staff were rude, elevators were not fully operational and for a 3 year old hotel is very outdated. What convention center has no spa? Considering the confrence was for handicap rooms were anything but.

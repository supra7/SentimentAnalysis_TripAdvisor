This place was a huge dissapointment, we stayed there for two nights and the second night we had classic bite marks (three in a row) very typical for bed bugs. I inspected the room but found no bugs (but a new mattress with tags on; a typical sign of a previous infestation at hotels). The receptionist admitted that they had preivously had bedbug problems at the hotel, but the manager did not yield and claimed there was no proof etc. We ended up having to move to another hotel and treat all our luggage with washing, freezing for a couple of weeks etc to be sure we did not bring this problem back home. All in all a terrible experience and even worse that the manager deducted a full charge on our credit card for the stay. I would warn anyone against staying there after our experience.

Absolutely terrible customer service- lost our luggage, didn't care about it; couldn't call the front desk without being hung up on which meant when we wanted service we had to go down to the lobby; ordered champagne on our wedding night and it never arrived; ordered a place setting during our stay and it took over an hour for room service to bring it to our room; no hot water- you had to wait 15 minutes to get a lukewarm shower; when my husband complained about the service we were receiving the hotel manager was sarcastic and anything but apologetic. I spoke with many other guests at the hotel who had similar experiences. If you want a relaxing hotel to stay at, go elsewhere.

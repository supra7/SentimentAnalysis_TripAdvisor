Looking at the photos of accommodations at the Soniat House in New Orleans made me think we were staying at some place special. I wish I could show you some photos of the room that cost us $368 a night there. It was dark and damp, on the ground floor, and must have originally been a storehouse or stable. The walls were plastered unevenly. The furniture looked like it had been bought at a garage sale. The lamps were wobbly and some of the bulbs burnt out. A large dehumidifier hummed constantly in the corner. A big frameless mirror (its silver blackened and spotted) was glued to a wall in an attempt to make the room look larger. The charmless bathroom had not been updated in years, the wallpaper torn and stained, The grout between the bathroom floor tiles was stained and blackened, and the shower head was broken. However, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The linens, especially the towels, were exceptional. After the first night we asked for a different room, but were assured that the other rooms available had no windows (!). We had reservations to stay five nights but the whole experience led us to leave a day early (but of course we were stuck with paying for five nights). The rooms on the top floor must have been the beautiful ones shown on the hotels website. Anyone tempted to stay here should ask for a description and photos of the particular room they intend for you, otherwise you might be stuck with a dismal room and an outrageous bill.

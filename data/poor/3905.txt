If you want to have a good vacation, please stay away from this hotel. It is really dirty and old and has not been renovated in decades. Dont waste your money on this hotel. Not sure how this hotel qualifies to be a 4 star hotel. The faucet's and attachments in bathroom are rusted. Please see the attached pictures. The carpet was installed incorrectly, shoddy job in installing it. The closet door was out of the grooves, hence we were not able to open and close it - or use it. That kind of tells you a little bit about the upkeep of the rooms. I usually dont write reviews but, I thought it is important for me to warn other vacationers from making the same mistake that our family made. And if by any chance you have to work in the room, there is no proper table and chair for you to sit. You have to sit on the side on a wicker chair and work on a small crowded round table. No WIFI in the room, have to be attached to the cable to get internet. Which was o.k. but there should be a decent place for people to work. Hope this helped you in making your decision. The service staff is not helpful at all. They just say, this is not mainland. Thats how it is here. I just dont know how this hotel qualifies to be a 4 star hotel.

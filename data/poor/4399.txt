My girlfriend and I reserved a room at the Stratosphere because it was a good price at the time. We were welcomed by a friend who worked at the front desk. He immediately upgraded us to a suite. The room was pretty nice. In the casino i couldn't believe how many cigarette bums there were. I think I handed out about half a pack before I devised a strategy so people wouldn't bother me anymore. My girl and I were crossing the street and witnessed a drug deal. Also our camera was stolen from the hotel room. Thanks guys

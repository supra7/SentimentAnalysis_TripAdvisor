We booked our daughter's wedding reception dinner here. Mark is the food and bev mgr. Reception planning is WAY above his head. He would not return phone calls from the beginning... had us booked for wrong date (of course, had he returned phone calls, this could have been cleared up instantly!). Mark hired a grubby bartender who was also the owner of the stereo system... and rather than use our professionally pre-recorded music, used HIS! When the toasts were given, we had to wait for Mark to open the champaigne and pour it;when it was time to cut the cakes... Mark had forgotten to provide a knife; after the cakes were cut, my daughter actually went back into the kitchen in her wedding gown and asked where the slices of cake were... it had been 30 minutes! For the 32 of us, Mark only had one waitress. This was a nightmare. If you want to have a special, relaxing, fun reception after your daughter's wedding, DO NOT BOOK AT THE PIONEER INN! The entire staff was totally unprofessional. I will NEVER recommend them to anyone!

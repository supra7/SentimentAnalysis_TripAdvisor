This hotel is dirty, shabby, in a horrible part of town, offers no parking, and has a rude, unprofessional staff. There was no manager on duty for the entirety of our stay. The shuttle dropped up off at our destination then refused to pick us up as they advertise on their website. We were actually threatened by an abrasive, erratic, and largely incoherent hotel employee; yet our complaint was entirely disregarded by the onsite staff. I have put in 4 calls to the manager since we left and no one seems to know when he will get in. I feel that they are purposely avoiding my calls. Stay here at your own risk.

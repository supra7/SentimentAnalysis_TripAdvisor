The hotel accommodations were slightly below what you would expect from any of the beach hotels along the Ocean City boardwalk. There was not anything spectacular about the hotel that would make it stand out from any of the others. The worst part of this hotel is the staff. The entire staff was arrogant and self-loathing, particularly the red head manager with the black lipstick. Do not stay at this motel unless you are accustomed to a geriatric ward or a nursing home. If your lights are not out by 8pm she will be watching your every move! Smoking is also not tolerated even on the balcony. Remember, if you do smoke, you are being watched and will be caught and asked to vacate as well. A little tolerance and hospitality goes a long way. Neither of which this hotel offers!

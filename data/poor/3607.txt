Horrible experience with Travelocity. Reserved 3 night. When arrived at hotel reception they had canceled my reservation same day. No previous notice. My credit card charged and had no reservation. Talking to them. Sorry, sorry, waist of time. Will refund my money. Just avoid Travelocity. Hotel Griffon contribution. Offering me just one night in an smaller room for a higher price. I was touch. What a customer focus, what a wiliness to help. No thanks. When at test people show their real style.

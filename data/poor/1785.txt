The location of this hotel is good, situated near the Taksim square in a guarded area with limited traffic. However, this is also the only positive to be said about the Golden Park Hotel. The staff is rude and do not offer any service. In addition, the enter occupied rooms at all times of the day, including in the middle of the night when hotel guests are sleeping, supposedly to add to the mini bar, change towels, etc. without having been requested by the guest. The breakfast buffet is primarily sweets, which makes it difficult for anyone not eating sweets for breakfast to find something. The rooms are big, but the interior is bashed and not well maintained and the air condition is not functioning. My room was 40 degrees Celsius despite that I turned the air condition to lowest possible temperature. Upon request for help from the reception, I just got an angry answer that they cannot do anything, and that I should open the window. In addition, the wall are very thin, so if you are a light sleeper, you will hear when all the party people are returning from the nightlife throughout the night. Finally, if you have Turkish friends of business partners, do not invite them to your room. The front desk will start to call you after 5 minutes upon arrival that they should leave or you will be expelled from the hotel. All in all, the Golden Park Hotel was a very interesting experience that I will not like to repeat or want anyone to experience.

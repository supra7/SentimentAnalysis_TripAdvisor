I wish I knew about Trip Advisor before I stayed at the Eighth Avenue Inn. I would have booked at a different hotel. I booked a room with a queen sized bed and a pull out sofa bed. My husband and I do not like to sleep in double beds so a queen was a must for us. When we checked in and went up to our room we were shocked to see two double beds.. no queen bed and no sofa at all! Also there was a strange metal box in the middle of the room. My husband told me it was an ozone machine, to remove odors. So we went back to the front desk and told him this wasn't the room we had booked. We wanted the queen bed with the sofa sleeper for the kids. He looked at us like we were crazy and said that they didn't have any sofa beds! We said it's right there on your website and so he called someone on the phone and said nope we don't have any sofa beds. At this point the kids are tired and cranky so we gave in and just took the double bed room. A maid later came and took the ozone machine away. Besides being the wrong room in the first place, it was just plain gross. The room looked nothing like the photo's. The carpet had stains. The bedding and curtains were dated. I went to take a shower and the shower head was way too low for a normal person. I'm only 5.6 and had to bend backwards to rinse my hair. We thought maybe this was intended to be a handicap room but one of the beds was almost up against the bathroom door. Overall we didn't feel safe here with the kids. The only good thing I have to say about the place was they had a good breakfast!

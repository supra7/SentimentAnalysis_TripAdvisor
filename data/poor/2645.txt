Not sure how this hotel got to rank #9 in the top 10 hotels in New Orleans. It is in a great location, but that is about the only good thing about this hotel. Inhospitable staff behind desk, which is rare in New Orleans! Very disappointing! It was our first (and last) stay at this hotel. We should have been informed about things like the time and location of breakfast, but were not. A piece of paper with this information would have sufficed. Neither were offered. Our room was dark, musty, noisy, shabbily furnished, and the bed was uncomfortable, and our pillows were lumpy. My husband and I did not sleep very well, because we were itching all night. Could have been due to the poor quality bed linens. I have been visiting New Orleans and staying in the French Quarter for at least 20 years. This is the worst experience that I have ever had. Newlyweds, stay away!

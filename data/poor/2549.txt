The ONLY reason my wife and I stayed here was because of a 30% web special (if you prepay for your stay.) The person that booked the reservation said only one night qualified and she couldn't book the nights separately so I should just prepay and then speak to the manager upon arrival, I inquired about this upon check-in and was told he would be there the next day, the next day he was unavailable again and the day we checked out I was given a number to call. After numerous attempts I spoke the gentleman and he said he would get back to me. Again, after numerous attempts, he said they were phasing out that special and he would give me a huge discount "the next time I stayed there!" Stay clear of this one folks, there are many, many places to stay in the area that are worth $300/ night, this is NOT one of them... As it turned out we were given no discount on either room and they told us there was nothing they could do...again the ONLY reason we even looked at it was the substantial discount of their "web special"... BEWARE!!!

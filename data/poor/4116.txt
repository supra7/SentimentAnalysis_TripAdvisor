I had a room booked at this hotel for several months. When I recently called to confirm my reservation, one week before the trip, they did not have my room and wanted to jack the rate to give me one, if available. I would never book here again. Its sad when the manager says that he really doesn't care about a previous arrangement and will not honor the confirmation. I can't believe a hotel will sell your room out from under you for an extra 25.00 per night. If I hadn't called ahead I would have been on he street!

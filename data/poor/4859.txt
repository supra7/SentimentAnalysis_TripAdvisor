Stayed in the place for 1month and I must say I have never met so many incompetent hotelier. Staff doesnt speak proper English. You can only speak basic English and pray to Allah that they got it right! Peopl kept on entering the apartment and doing "maintenance works" (or hell knows what) whenever I left the place. My clothes went missing, my food got eaten from the fridge and no matter how many maintenance work they do the place stinks, household machines kept on breaking down, windows so dirty I can not even see clearly... the contstruction that is 24/7 around the building. The noise of generators and workers around at 2-3AM is unbearable. I havent had 1 good night sleep... and I am missing my things! :( Oh yeah...swimming pool has unidentifiable floating things on top and way too cold! Hotel assosciation should close this place or remark it 2star.

rude people and management This hotel is poorly run and will never stay here again!!! Shannon is incredibly rude and told me there was parking was available. She failed to tell me that parking is available at an extra charge (and that lot was full) and street parking is near impossible. She should not be in the customer service industry at ALL!!!! The rooms are small and somewhat clean but the hotel is run down.A friend of mine used to stay at the hotel all the time, until new managment. New management has hired incompetent people. However, the only courteous and professional person I talked to was David. Also I noticed many people said there was bagels. No bagels anymore, only sweets!!! Donuts, muffins and hard boiled eggs. I am told old management used to give every guest a bottle of Sherry. Also, they used to leaev the breakfast room open for people to gather before dinner, not anymore, the doors are locked up right after breakfast. SO if you liked the hotel before you probably won't anymore.

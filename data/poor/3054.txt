Couldn't believe it when I tried to get online and found out they charge 15 a day. It's just tacky. If the resort needs to increase revenue raise the room rate, the resort fee, restaurant prices or charge extra for the water park. It's just insulting to charge money for something that costs almost nothing to provide and is typically free. Bad move Az Grand...

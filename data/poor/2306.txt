The hotel is ok, the ONLY reason you come is because you have kids. The pool has numerous water slides and kids go nuts running all over the place having the time of their lives. As for me I just wanted to chill. and you can do that, just not really in the shade, that costs money. there are plenty of lawn chairs but the ones with umbrellas cost money and the 4 lawn chairs with a tent above it (think cabana but really just a canopy and 4 chairs) is $500 for the day. and as a result they are all empty sitting there unused. same with the umbrellas. I should ask how mush that costs. I have yet to see one person rent one of these. at least wifi is free. oh and the fish place with the super long name on the grounds looks cool, but the food was worse than most weddings Ive been too. oh well.

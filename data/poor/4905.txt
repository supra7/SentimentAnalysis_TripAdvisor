We have a 2 and 4 yr old and came for the indoor park. The park was good and the kids had fun. Thats where it ends. The rooms were filthy. A slab of plywood would have had more cushion than the beds. There is zero insulation so you can hear everything 3 rooms away. They have the right idea like the kids cuby bunks but then they go cheap on the mattress and apparently have completly done away with vacuum cleaners. The rates (166 per night after tax) were no indication of how bad it would be. When I mentioned how bad it was at the front desk at checkout the guy just acted like it was the norm as if people complain all the time. They don't care.Not only will I not recommend this to a friend I will very loudly recommend they NOT waste thier money here.

Stay away from this hotel! Jonathan Davis, hotel manager, is qualified to be working at McDonalds at best. Guest services are rude, unprofessional, uncooperative. I was staying at the hotel with my husband but came back to the hotel early by myself one afternoon and didn't have the room key. Hotel manager was extremely rude and wouldn't let me up in the room becuase my husband's name was the only one on the reservation. A simple situation was turned into a huge issue. He wouldn't accept my drivers lisence, wouldn't speak on the phone with my husband. Other employees at the counter who saw my husband and I checking in and earlier that morning (even gave us directions) acted as if they didn't recognize me. What a shame on Marriott for letting unqualified people represent their brand and take managerial positions. Moved out to Hilton down the street immediately, will never stay there again!!

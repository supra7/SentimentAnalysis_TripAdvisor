As a person who travels to NOLA at least twice a year for 10 years, I've seen quite a few hotels. This is the WORST one I've been in. I understand hotels in the quarter can be outdated, old, in need of repair... I get it. Im used to it. Sometimes it is what adds charm to places. This place is not one of them. We booked a "double" room, the room was ultra small. There was only one key when we checked in, which made me wonder who had the other one and if the lock had been changed since it was lost... Front desk was very non chalant about it and did not really think it was a big deal and was rude. The sink backed up, there is no shelf in the bathroom to put anything. Carpeting old and smelled. The heat was on in the entire hotel. It was close to 80 degees in our room. We slept with the door open and the shower running with cold water, as did our neighbors. which I am sure made the rats we saw very happy. We were told there were no fans available and there was no way the heat would be shut off. There were no windows to open. Front desk did not really care or ask how our stay was when we checked out. Im sure they had many complaints. Pay the extra money and go somewhere else. DO NOT STAY HERE.

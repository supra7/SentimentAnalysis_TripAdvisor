This is not a nice hotel. It is a dive with rude employees. I had booked to stay for 4 nights but had to move out after enduring 2 nights. The maids spent about 5 minutes in the room, no dusting, moping, wiping, vacuuming, no soap, shampoo, etc. Drunks at the pool each night. I stayed at this hotel several years ago and it was OK but I do not recommend now.

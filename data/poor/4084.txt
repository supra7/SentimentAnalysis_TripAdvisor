After traveling four hours to an area we were unfamiliar with, we called the hotel for directions. They told us to get out of the area we were in but were unable to give us directions to do that...."just get out at a gas station and ask." was the response. Hello, two women and two children in an area where there are bars on every window. Sorry I'm familiar with what happens in Detroit if you get out. When we finally did manage to get to the hotel, we learned that valet parking was extra and that's all that was offered. The heat from the room blew us across the hall. What idiot in their right mind sleeps in a room that is 67 degrees unless it is summer time? Did I mention that the people in the next room tried to come through the adjoining door after we got settled into bed? Then there was the room, it was hardly bigger than a closet and there was no room to move around. And if there was a restaurant, it sure didn't open early enough for us to get any breakfast. Where are the luggage carriers? it sure would have helped with check out. NEVER again.

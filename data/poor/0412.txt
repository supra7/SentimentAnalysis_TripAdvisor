This is a Dirty, Old and Smelly Hotel. We should have transferred to the Travel Lodge next door, since we had stayed at the Travel Lodge before (and we were pleased with the service, as well as the full complimentary breakfast). Not here however. (Sorry this is long, but we are looking out for you as the consumer.) This Hotel Owner does not understand the concept of the "The Customer is always right." Part 1

Don't Stay Here!!! We chose to stay here because we were on our way back to Lawrence, Kansas from a week down in Port Aransas, Texas. Dallas/Ft. Worth was the halfway point home and this particular area was really close to one of our favorite restaurants, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen. Basically, after traveling from the beach for 7 hours we just wanted to have a good meal, rest our heads, and head out early the next day.However, our plans were rudely interrupted the next morning when we awoke. I parked my car right next to the managers office/check-in under a very bright light that night after we finished eating, but apparently, someone decided that they wanted my car stereo and other items (including my 7year old son's suitcase) and broke out a window to take these items. The night manager said he didn't hear a thing, although there was glass all over the parking lot from my window.Don't stay there, there is no security or monitoring on the premises. The hotel posts a sign in the parking lot, stating ...Not responsible for lost or stolen items. How inviting for a thief.

This was the 2nd and last time I'll ever stay at the Stratosphere. Both times I had issues with either getting locked out of my room (maintenance couldnt even get in to get my stuff for 4 hours!!!!) or overcharged. The staff was rude addressing my issues and never once offered an apology for my inconvenience. I am a travel agent and would never recommend this place to my clients again.

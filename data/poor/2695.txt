I'll start off by saying the Chelsea Savoy is in a great location and was completely convenient for our walk to FIT. It also is close to the subway stations and has decent little shops and restaurants around it. However, the customer service was absolutely horrible! I've never felt so UNWELCOME in a hotel. The staff never greets you when you walk in and when we approached the front desk to ask questions, we even received dirty looks (and this was before they knew what our question was!)! It didn't matter what crew was working either, they were all rude! Our room keys got deactivated multiple times and in order to activate one they must give you a whole other set of keys (very frustrating when you're in a hurry). One big aspect that added to this was when we first arrived it was too early to get in our room so we checked our luggage and ventured off. When we came back, the staff member brought down the cart filled with our luggage and left it there for us to take up ourselves! Mind you, we are 3 younger women left with over 150 pounds of luggage to take up to the rooms. We are very capable of doing it, but I've never been to a $300/night hotel that has left this task for the guests to finish. To sum up, the location was convenient for this particular trip, but the service has helped me decide that I will never book the Chelsea Savoy again!

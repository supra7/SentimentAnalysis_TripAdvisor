Checked all the reviews before booking, was totally taken aback. I have stayed in a lot of 3 and 4 start hotels in New York, this was the worst. The place is is terrible shape, everything worn/torn, dirty, broken - my closet door had been replaced with a curtain, there were chunks of repair plaster falling off the bathroom walls, etc...apparently the hotel has just been sold and is going to be remodeled. It certainly needs it! In the meantime, my advice is to avoid the place. The only good thing about it right now is the location which is nice.

Stayed a couple of nights with friends at the end of a long vacation. Whilst the hotel is in a good location, the property itself is nowhere near a well run downtown Marriott. I'm not going to waste too much time writing about this place, but as a warning to others... * Valet Parking took 40 minutes to return my car. Their excuse was 'there was an event the previous evening and were busy'. Charged me $30 for the priviledge which I refused to pay. * Concierge has NO idea of anything anywhere. They gave me a local map of restaurants etc. and when asked for information, were reading off the map they just gave me. I can do that. Plus a number of the staff are linguistically challenged. * Tatty Rooms * Non caring staff (none that I could find, anyways).. * Chaos at check in. Gave up calling reception in the end. * Poor restaurant. Small choice and no 'higher' end eatery. * Expensive bar * Upon checking out, my wife and I crossed the whole reception area and covered parking area in front of the hotel - laden with luggage- watched by no less than 8 bell boys (I counted them). It was only after me making a smar comment did somebody run up to 'help'. The luggage was at the car by this time and I told the guy where to go. Unbelievable!!! I won't go on. The irony is that we stayed at another Marriott property on the other side of town 10 days previously. Whilst in a less attractive location, the difference in quality and service was like night and day! Recommendation is to give this place a WIDE berth and stay elsewhere until the Management get their act together. Finally, I am a Marriot Elite member and stay at Marriotts all over the world so I am in a position to compare. As a previous reviewer wrote, JW Marriott would be less than impressed how this property is run in his name...

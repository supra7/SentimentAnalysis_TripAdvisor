Good: nice looking hotel and good location. Bad: sinks pumped up yellow liquid with black flakes and didnt drain. I called the front desk and had them send someone up in 1 hour since i had guests till then, he arived 10 minutes later, i was embarressed. We made plans for an engineer to stop by at 3 pm, he got there at 6 pm, again when we had guests, after 3 days it still hasent be fixed. The front desk offered to downgrade me to a different room. Every 15 minutes the TV goes to channel 00, kind of annoying when your trying to watch football.

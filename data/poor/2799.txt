This hotel is run by amateurs. Booked an online package that included parking and taxes. Only trouble the package was a mystery to the staff who was rude and argumentative when we tried to get the terms of the package applied. Of course, the parking garage did not want to honor the "free" parking and the manager of the hotel had to accompany me to the garage to straighten things out. Rooms were small and poorly maintained. Plumbing was substandard, for example, and carpets were worn and frayed. The king bed was soft and lumpy. Overall, a lousy experience and pricey to boot. Stay away!

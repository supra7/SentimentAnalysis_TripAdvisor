I researched for months before we selected WorldQuest Resort. We had read reviews on Expedia and on TripAdvisor that were positive. It had everything we wanted and gated security. The room safe was not working and we "hid" my husband's wallet in our room for one day during our activities. The rest of the 9 day trip it was locked in our console in the truck. We discovered $160.00 missing from the wallet the night before we left. We reported it and still had to make several phone calls to the manager after we returned home. He agreed to get expedia to credit us $160.00 because of the faulty room safe. Expedia had not been contacted several days later and we had to call the WorldQuest manager again. He blamed his staff for not getting the task completed. He said he interviewed housekeeping without results. Ten days after we had returned home, our credit card company called to check unusual charges. The thief had taken our credit card numbers only and charged over $2,000.00 at a Best Buy in Orlando! We reported this to the manager to see what he had to say and he would not return our calls. The housekeeping staff ignored our "do not disturb" signs repeatedly and tried to come in one morning when we were still home. We tried to expain we did not need services. This was ignored daily. We know they came in daily because there was always something different. I hate feeling violated! Keep your money with you at all times! I wish we had been smart enough to know that a thief doesn't take the credit card anymore, all they need it the number!

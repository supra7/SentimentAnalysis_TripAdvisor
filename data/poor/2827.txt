I expected far more from a Starwood property. This hotel is absolutely mediocre. The rooms are unspeakably tiny, the bathroom doesn't even have turnaround space, and the water pressure in the shower was horrible. The only good thing I can say about it is that the location is fantastic, and the hotel is surrounded by great shopping and restaurants. But there are a lot of other choices on the East side. Stay at the Fitzpatrick, for example, which has suites.

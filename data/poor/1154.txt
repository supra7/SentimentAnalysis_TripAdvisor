I sometimes use Travelodges and generally find them a good low price option for a single night while traveling. AVOID THIS ONE. The room had not been cleaned properly - there were dirty cup marks all over the table. The bathroom fittings looked as if they were about to expire and the taps were leaking badly. The window could not be closed as the handle had been removed. I brought all this to the attention of the recpetion - they did nothing. Finally, breakfast was not the usual Travelodge standard - nothing hot, no croissants, just a coffe tea maching and make your own toast. DISGRACEFUL. I contacted Travelodge but they declined to respond.

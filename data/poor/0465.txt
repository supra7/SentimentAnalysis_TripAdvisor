I just returned from a stay at the Hotel Vintage Park and have to say it was one of the most disappointing hotels I have ever stayed in. I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco, which is lovely! Unfortunately, they were sold out. So, knowing the Vintage is also owned by Kimpton, I thought it would be equally as good. NOT! I requested a premium room and to be away from the elevator. Their version of premium was a small, dated and uninviting room with worn out furnishings, old washed out awful bedding and a tiny tiny bathroom. The room seemed dirty and was definitely musty. Not to mention, I was right outside the elevators! I would never stay here again nor would I recommend them to anyone. It was a total waste money.

I went there with my wife in March 2010 for six nights after looking at the reviews on the Internet. Boy..don't these reviews mislead you!!! You will be put off by the reception area itself..they haven't vacuumed it in a long time nor do they do that it to your rooms..there was dust settled on the beds for what it seems to be a really long time and no one seems bothered to clean it. Overall, it was a very unpleasant stay...I will not recommend it..go find another hotel..not this one certainly...

I am a Hilton Gold member and have stayed in many Hilton Garden Inns. This one was the worst and you are much better off at the Hampton Inn a few blocks away. The front desk staff was too busy socializing to help with check-in, the room was dirty (sheets were dirty and not changed from prior occupant), the walls are thin so the hallway noise is very loud and the walls between rooms are so thin you can hear everything (and I mean everything) happening in the rooms next door. When I went to the restaurant for breakfast the next morning, the wait staff (same problem as the front desk) was too busy socializing among themselves to pour coffee, or otherwise serve guests. While most Hilton Garden Inns that I have stayed at have been comfortable, clean and with helpful staff, this one needs a great deal of management and improvement.

We stayed in this hotel on June 5th. The hotel made a mistake and check someone else in our room. That person took all of our electronic equipment including our computer, IPAD, Ipod etc. The hotel has not made good on replacing our stolen items. I am a Marriot Gold member but and switching to Hilton Honors based this horrible expirience. This hotel is run by folks that don't give a damn.

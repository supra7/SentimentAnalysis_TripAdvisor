Stay Away "RUDEST STAFF" arrived on June 27th 3:00pm arrived on Park Pl side of hotel unloaded the luggage & passingers. Bellman tells me to go (L) & find the parking valet. Well I go (L) do not see any parking valet. Get lost in the cily by myself for 45min. Get back to hotel to find out that my room is not ready. Ask Not to be placed near the 5th floor. I call the front desk @ 5:30pm informed that my room is not ready & the hotel will call me I do not need to call them. I ask what floor will I be on informed 9th. 9:30pm go to the front desk still no phone call. Told that there is only 1 room left & it is on the 6th floor. I ask to see a manager "Erin"" Rudest person. I ask for a room on another floor, told the hotel is completely booked you can take it or leave it. I asked why the hotel did not call me to let me know my room was available. Erin said I don't know & we gave the room on the 9th floor to someone else. No Hot water if you need to take a shower @ 5:30am. Called the front desk who stated no one else complained. Well everyone else @ breakfast complained of the NO Hot Water. Stay Away from the Boston Park Plaza. Ice Machine on 6th & 8th floors did not work either. Here for a conference had to stay 5 days. Great to be back in NY with nice people. At the Boston Park Plaza the customer is never right.

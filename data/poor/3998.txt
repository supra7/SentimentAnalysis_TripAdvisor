My husband and I planned to stay at the Bostonian for 4 nights during Christmas. We booked this hotel based on their website photos and after reading some reviews. Most of the reviews were favorable so we went ahead and booked the hotel. Since we were flying into Boston during winter, I called ahead to the hotel and let them know that we would be coming in late. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at 3 am at the hotel. We were greeted by a friendly valet but the front desk person was rude and stated that he was not expecting anyone to check in althought we had a guaranteed reservation and had called ahead to let them know of our late arrival. We were finally checked in after some "discussion" and our "superior room" was on the second floor looking down into the common areas (loung and hallways). The room was small and very outdated with worn, dirty carpets. When I called to ask about another room, I was told that this was one of their better rooms. After two days, my husband and I checked out and moved to the Hyatt at Boston Common. Although the Bostonian is in a great location, there are much better hotels in downtown and Boston is small enough that everything is within a 15 minute walk. So don't bother with the Bostonian for its location.

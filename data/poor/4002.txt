We stayed for four days at the Millenium Hotel Fanuel Hall Hotel spending about $1.100 on the room bill and were stunned that a four star hotel was so dirty! The entire hotel including the room, had carpets that were filthy. The hair dryer was hanging from the bathroom wall with exposed electrical connections, the towels were harder and rougher than any hotel I have ever been in and there was only towels for one person. The TV could not be made to work, and the wooden window frame was all rotted out and moldy. To top it off, my letters to the management were never responded to! While this review is written some months later, my anger and disappointment at this appalling experience has not diminished one bit. If there had been a room available anywhere nearby we would have immediately checked out. We were trapped!

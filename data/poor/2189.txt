I was in Dallas for a conference and stayed at this hotel I have to say that It was an incredibly unpleasant experience that ended with me being unexpectedly charged a fine for smoking ($200). I had a very difficult time sleeping due to the constant noise from partying people in the hallway and was dismayed at the drunken behavior in the lobby, presumably the students coming in for the Oklahoma/Texas game. When I asked for a taxi, the bellhop said I should take a flatrate limo instead of the taxi, which caused the taxi driver to correctly accuse the bellhop of trying to cheat customers (the flat rate was twice that of the metered taxi). I expect more from high class hotels like the Sheraton. The main reason I am writing, however, is the unexpected charge. When I checked in, I gave the receptionist my credit card, and received a card key for the room. That is it. I was not informed that the hotel was nonsmoking, nor did I sign any no-smoking agreements, and there were not any no-smoking signs in the room. So, I was surprised when I was asked to stop smoking in the room-which, of course, I did, when asked to do so. No problem, I went outside to smoke my cigars. I was much more surprised to learn that a $200 fine/charge was levied on my folio. When I asked to speak with the manager about the charge, a surly, somewhat off-putting person repeatedly told me the charges would stand, regardless of my attempts to explain the misunderstanding. I sent a letter about this only to be told that the fine stands. I have stayed in many Sheratons and never have been treated so callously.

The location is good, but that's it. While the staff was pleasant enough to talk to, the service was dismal - slow or nonexistent. I arrived about 9:30 pm; the first room they gave me reeked of men's cologne and made my throat tighten up. The manager was good about giving gave me another room and a free breakfast the next morning. Still, it took several phone calls to get a new key to me. I called room service and front desk, but they never answered (I let the phone ring at least 16 times). When someone finally answered on the fifth or sixth attempt, it still took an hour to bring the key. The second room was very warm even though the thermostat read 65 F. The paint was chipping from the windowsill, and the wallpaper looked dirty, as did the carpet. The linens were very nice, but the cold water faucet on the sink broke off as soon as I turned it. I called about having that fixed, but it was never done in the three days I stayed there. Even the priceline deal was too much money for this dump.

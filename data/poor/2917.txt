On Saturday, April 28 my boyfriend and I reserved a Spectacular non-smoking room at the W on Lexington in Manhattan. Instead we got a craptacular stink box built for a midget. I understand NY hotel rooms are small, real estate is at a premium, but this was ridiculous. I was sitting at the end of the bed and had to move to let my boyfriend by to go the restroom. The carpets and shades were shabby and gross. The bed, though we reserved a queen, was definitely not. When we called downstairs to get a different room (we were more than willing to pay to upgrade to a suite) the staff said they overbooked Saturday night and the only room available was the stinky little hole we were in. My boyfriend and I travel to NYC several times a year and would never stay at a W Hotel again. W= Worst hotel ever!

This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life! It was disgusting, dark and dirty. The rooms are like closets. The carpet was awful. There were stains on the comforter. There was an electric radiator in the room. I couldn't wait until sunrise to check out of there. I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here if your looking for R&R.

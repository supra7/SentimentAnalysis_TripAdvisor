Flew into Boston on Thursday, August 15, 2007, en route to Nantucket when we were advised the flights to Nantucket were cancelled due to fog. Contacted this hotel and arranged a reservation over the phone that was confirmed with my credit card. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were advised in the rudest manner that we were at the wrong hotel, which was not the case. Too bad, they could not, nor would they help us, despite having a reservation number. Not having a room when a reservation has been made, happens. But the manner in which we were treated, the absolute disdain and refusal to provide assistance was shocking from the front desk staff at this hotel. Fortunately, the Westin were only too happy to accomodate us and delighted to assist us. This hotel offers a great location, but their staff should take a graduate course in customer service and courtesy.

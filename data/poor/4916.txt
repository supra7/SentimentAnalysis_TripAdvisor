So I made my reservation back in March to stay at the Castle Rock Resort for my son's birthday. He invited 3 friends to come along and we reserved the room with bunk beds that would hold all 6 of us. The 4 boys were sooo excited! It's a new water park in Branson (oh yes, we are locals too) and none of them have been there. Well, I found out yesterday that the hotel never made my reservation despite my confirmation letter and now the hotel is booked up. I now have to tell 4 young boys that there will be no trip to Castle Rock Resort. Also, the manager was supposed to call me back and never has. Don't get your hopes up to stay at this water park because the staff is too incompetent to make your reservation. So be prepared!

We came to a convention like every year.. .Two yeasr ago we stayed in this hotel and everything was ok.., but this year we made the reservation through expedia one month ago and everything looked ok...but we arrived today for the convention and the front desk people told us that they didnt have any more rooms, because the hotel was oversold, so they just send us to the hilton near the convention center, which is brand new...very nice and with friendly people..and Peabody people just didnt care if we made our reservatiion ot ime and fully prepaid..They just said we have to leave ande they didn care at all if we liked the other hotel they sent us..We travel a lot all over the world and we have stayed in very good hotels and this had never happen before...we felt humiliated.....I can not believe this could happen...and they did that because we made the reservation through expedia and they were prefering the guests who booked directlly with them...First time in my life I see something like this...Thank god Hilton hotel is very nice, so we were lucky..Too bad for the other who will come later, because Hilton now is almost full...Who knows what is going to happen to them...so think twice before chossing this hotel..because they dont care about you.. Of couse they are going to pay ut for a regular room at hilton..but, I made the reservation with them, because I wanted to stay in there...I would rather prefer they sent me a message before, so I could choose whatever I want...not what they want... As I said before...thank god we got a room at hilton...so, your choice..but beware...

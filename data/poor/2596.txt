Poor service, old tv, valet parking is expensive and takes forever to get your car. I called to complain and the Intercontinental guest relations dept. was of no help. I spoke to Jada at the hotel several days later and she was somewhat helpful but not what you expect for an Intercontinental Hotel. The best part of the trip was the ballgame RTR !!!!

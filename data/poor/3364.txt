The pool is super small (not like the picture showed) and is linked to a bar - which at first we thought would be fun but quickly realized its open to pretty much anyone off the street. They try to check who is a guest and who isn't but a few young-lady smile and winks to the pool staff and that quickly was overlooked. The pool is filled with beer and drunk people (unless you're into this) No one at the hotel really speaks english - so to order a crib to my room, I almost had to draw a picture on paper for the guy to get the idea what I was looking for. Room keys were not programmed correctly and failed to work twice. The room was ok - but old smelling. Lastly, even though they have 4 elevators, plan to wait - they are very slow. This is a NON family friendly hotel with little, if anything to offer for kids. We couldn't even find a ramp to get our stroller to the pool/kids pool. We had to walk around the building and still carry it up 8 stairs. (what about the disabled?) Not worth the stay - look elsewhere.

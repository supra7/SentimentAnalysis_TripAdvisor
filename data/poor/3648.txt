We made these reservations over the internet and prepaid them. Upon arrival, we were treated like unwelcomed relatives. We stayed 2 nights and the second day our room was never cleaned or resfreshed. Believe the other reviews about the elevators. You need HUGE patience. The thermostats have govenors on them. You can not get any cooler than 68 degrees and it was 102 outside! The ice machines don't work and most of the staff don't speak english. LOL to you if you are brave enough to stay here. NEVER again!

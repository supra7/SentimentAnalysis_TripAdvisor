We booked the bridal suite for my husband's 30th birthday. We have never been more excited. I had called a couple of times to make sure everything was set. We had a bottle of champagne added to the room. When we arrived, the hotel had given away our room to another guest coming in early!! They were apologetic but stuck to their guns and bumped us to an awful room. Old, small, musty and dirty with no view at all. The floor was softer than the bed. (Actually all the beds are like that.) We were heart broken and finally asked for our money back. My mother had paid for this for us and she called and tried to reason with them. The man at the front desk was nice and polite as was the manager. But, would not budge on their decision to favor someone else over someone who had had reservations for a month for this room. They did offer us a free night of our choice at another time. We will probably go, but you better believe I will be calling many times to insure we still get the room. I will also bring a memory foam pad for the bed. I will never pay for this hotel. Like other reviewer said, only go there for a drink on the patio or at the bar. So we left and my mother made us a reservation at the Ritz Carlton which is much nicer and was actually CHEAPER then the bridal suite at The Columns. We are here now. The Ritz is Highly recommended!!!!!

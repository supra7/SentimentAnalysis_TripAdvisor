My husband had a conference at New Orleans for 3 days. He got 2 free nights points from Priority Club, so we paid one more night by ourseelves. Because we had a good experience staying at Intercontinental Hote in Chicago and the good location close to French market, so we booked this hotel. In fact, after staying at Intercontinental New Orleans, I won't think I'll come again. The Cons: 1. The service was bad. The front desk told us that the free room and the paid room would combine together, but it never. On the 3rd night, the card could not open the door. We had to go to the front desk to lie up again to change to a new card. 2. Breakfast was cold, no variety, less choice and pricey. The paid room $199 is including 2 free breakfast. We have 2 kids (6 & 3)with us. We brought our kids go to the resturant with us becuase they could not stay at the room by themselves. They bring their own milk inside. The manager still charged 1 kid's price at $14.99+tax. I argued with him, he still had to charge a small box of cheerio which my son just took a piece into his mouth. The manager told me the box cheerio just costed $2-3, but it was $4+tax when he handed me the bill. 3. The same opinion with other travelers is the bed is old and too soft. It caused my husband and I had back pain. They have to update the beds and furniture. 4. Lack of amentiy. We have 4 people but they have only 1 person's amenity. We have to ask call them to bring in everytime. A bit stingy. It maybe good for one business traveler but not family with kids. Will recommend to anybody especially family with kids. 5.

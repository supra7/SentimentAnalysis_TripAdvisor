This is the worst hotel room I've ever stayed in. The bathroom was the worst part: small, old. It was actually so bad that I didn't want use the shower. I could also hear all noises from the corridor, it was going through some kind of vent above the room door... which also let the light in. Terrible room. terrible night. I assume the hotel has better rooms than this one but I would not take a chance of ending-up with a room like this one. I will never sterp foot in this hotel again.

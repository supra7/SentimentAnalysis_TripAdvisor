We simply needed a decent room to crash for a Saturday night, and our only requirements were a non-smoking room and a king bed, and got a decent (not smoking) rate through Hotwire. When we arrived, we confirmed the latter, and reiterated verbally "and that is non-smoking, right?" to Ivy, the receptionist. For reason I cannot fathom, she ignored my statement and gave me "the last room available" which was on the smoking floor. The hotel was also full of partiers, and I spotted four of them going into the adjacent room, which is a recipe for disaster on top of the pervasive stale smoke. Ivy was so helpful to find us another room at another hotel, we said great, make this happen and she so kindly informed us "well, here's the number, you can call and make a reservation" -- they were not going to help us in anyway. The attitude was arrogant and indifferent. They just fell back to the fact that we were lowlife Hotwire customers and there was nothing they needed to do about it. The two minutes I spent in the room while waiting for my husband to finish parking the car (before he knew about this fiasco), I was completely unimpressed by everything but the view. Old World Charm? If you like slow elevators, maybe. I thought we were due for a Langham-type experience, and it was a complete let-down. Totally overhyped. One positive - location. That's it.

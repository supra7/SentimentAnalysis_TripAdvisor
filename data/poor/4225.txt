This hotel has got the biggest yet most ingenious scam running. They charge for almost everything. So you get in kinda early to this hotel, you're tired, you're weak and you just want to lie down. To check in early they charge $25. That's why when you walk in at about 11ish you see a crowd of people waiting in the lobby. It's free to check in with some type of member after 12 noon. Then you join YET ANOTHER LONG LINE out the door to check in again. Lesson - Book Your Flights to arrive in the afternoon. Now if you get the wrong room (and yes I was in the Mardi Gras tower) and you are coffee drinker, you are going to see a trail in the morning of folks with McDonald's Coffee cups in their hands because you may be gifted with a room without a coffee maker. And if you are - you are supplied with the cheapest coffee no name brand around. Lesson - choose another hotel or room that has a coffee maker. If you like to sleep - forget about it, the walls are paper thin. No free high speed internet. Overall, the only way I would stay at this smokey casino filled hotel is if I were paid for it. Never again - you lost me.

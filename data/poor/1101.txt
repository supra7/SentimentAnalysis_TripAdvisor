I mean what year are we in that the rooms do not have wireless? Especially for a hotel that's meant for business travelers? In addition, the rooms are terrible. I am in a King Suite, but the heater doesn't even work in the bedroom. Not to mention there is no way to turn off the ventilation in the bathroom so it's really loud all the time. Oh and lastly, even the food at the cafe sucks here. I always get a healthy start but this place is the worst. Way overcooked and the bread became as hard as a rock within minutes. And another thing. No other yogurt flavors except vanilla. Really? I can't believe this dump even received 3 starts. And before you doubt my review, I am a gold member for marriott. I am comparing this to other marriotts and this one by far is the worst.

I was attempting to check-in my hotel room on a trip I have been looking forward to for months! After a few clicks on the computer, the nice front desk agent excused herself. I wonder what the problem was...ten minutes later a "Hotel Operations Manager" named Sal came out. He was already walking arrogant before approaching me. I had to read his name of his name tag because he never introduced himself to me nor greeted me. Just informed me that they gave away my room to a different "VIP" guest. He smirked as he said it as if he was proud of it. I asked if there was another room type like mine available. He rolled his eyes and typed in the computer and then smiled and said "no...there doesn't appear to be anything in here for you." The old guy was getting a kick out of making me, a diamond guest, look like a no-body. I hate to see what this guy does to normal, off the street, hotel guests. If I get this type of rude treatment, and I am a long time loyal...wait...excuse me.... former loyal Harrah's guest, no one is safe. Rooms were mild if anything else. Bugs everywhere. Dirty sheets and dirty bathroom. I called down and, lucky me, I got Sal again. He said he would send someone up to clean my room. No one ever came. So I slept in used sheets that night. The morning came and I checked out early to go over to MGM. Thanks Sal!

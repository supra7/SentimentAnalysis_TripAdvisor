Horribly overpriced,, tiny room, tinier bathroom with wimpy shower and pedestal sink, so no room to lay out cosmetics/shaving stuff. No dresser or drawers in room for folded clothes; just a hanging cloth shelf thing in the closet. Tiny round table as one nightstand, no lights next to bed (hanging fixtures over the bed, but insufficient light for reading). Will never stay here again; there are much better hotels in NYC for less money.

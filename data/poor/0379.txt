where do i start? only one of the elevators worked and it looked like it was going to break down. once we got to our room, the smell of mold and fungus was disgusting. blood splatters on the back of the backroom door were found and the beds were damp. we thought we would check out the veiw, and little to our suprise, homeless people where eating 5 feet below our window. there were no locks on the windows so if someone stood on the bins they would be able to climb through. within an hour of being in that room, we re-packed our bags and booked another hotel.

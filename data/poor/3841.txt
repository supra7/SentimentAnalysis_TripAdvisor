Wow..I just read the reviews of other travelers and can't believe that we are talking about the same place. I agree the location can't be beat. We had to stay there twice in the past 2 weeks having to deal with flights. I did not have a problem dealing with the age of the rooms as they are getting a little outdated but that's okay...my concern was the cleanliness. Our first room I wouldn't even take my shoes off and the door frame and baseboards looks like they haven't been cleaned in ages. The bedspread had holes in it and I wouldn't even let it get close to me. I knew that we were going to be there again 10 days later to deal with flights so I mentioned the cleanliness of our room thinking it was just that room. We were given another room this time by the ocean....pretty location cleaner then the first one but still very poor conditions. Check out the ice machines....a cleaning around them would be great. Easy to do but never gets done. Air conditioners roaring away dripping everywhere ...ours was broken. What took the icing on the cake was that we had a very late flight and they offered to us a room that we could shower and change in...sounds great but they don't bother to clean between customers...dirty dishes ..toilet full...wet towels thrown in the tub... disgusting. Staff say all the right things but no pride of ownership. I am not a 5 star traveler but I do like cleanliness regardless of what price you are paying....both my husband and I were very disappointed.

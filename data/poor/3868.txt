My sister and I just got back from the Maui Lu yesterday. I was impressed with the staff as they were all very helpfull but I was not empressed with the grounds or my room. The beach across the street was rocky and murky and very small. If you want a very budget hotel then the Maui Lu is for you. I myself will liook elsewhere the next time.

There are too many choices in Vegas to waste your money on the Stratosphere. Their website crashed once I put credit card in. I phoned, they then said their system locked up & call back later. Called back and was cut off. So went directly to hotel when arrived - massive line up barely moving - and 3 separate groups noticably complaining with raised voices about issues. There were several staff members at reception seeming to be doing nothing. I went to hotel phone to ring again & booked room as it hadn't gone through on website when it crashed. Was offered non-smoking room. 30 mins later (the line took that long) we were told there were only smoking rooms left. After saying this was not satisfactory & would we be charged if we cancelled, the guy offered to have a word to his manager to see if they could shuffle some things around. He came back offering us for an extra $75 we could have a non smoking suite. We did not want to pay the extra - and as was told the rooms are cleaned very well, and we may not smell smoke, took the room. It STANK. We rang housekeeping to ask if they could bring up air freshener spray. They wrongly sent up maintenance who thought he had to adjust the shower spray.. Luckily he was lovely (Ralph).. and rang housekeeping to tell them to bring a machine up which would clear the smell if we left room for an hour. When we returned the smoking smell had been neutralised. However it stank again in the morning - as did the hallway. The room was tired.. The bathroom was tiny (literally only a bath/shower & toilet & space about the size of the toilet to stand in).. Room rate was $130.. we'd have been better finding a motel off the strip. The hotel is looking tired and dated, and staff were surprisingly unhelpful and frazzled compared to even small busy motels we stayed in on our trip.

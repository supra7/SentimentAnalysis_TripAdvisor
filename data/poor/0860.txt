Stay away from Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. My wife and I went there for our anniversary recently and were very upset about the whole experience. Will never go back again. Service sucks. Took 30 min to check in without any line up, even though I am a trump card holder and I booked ahead of time. STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT STRESS!!!! SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. SUITES WERE AVERAGE. LOCATION WAS TERRIBLE. Best rate Commitment was not honored even though it was advertised on thier website, first they agreed, then when we got there, they wouldn't give us the rate. We stood there arguing with them for half an hour. Would never go back again. Beware of Amber from reservations...

Stay somewhere else! My fiance thought he was being super hip when he planned to stay at the W for my 30th birthday. After a long flight we were disturbed at the site of our miniature "room" on the spa floor. They were suppossedly the newest but the floor smelled bad and there was constant noise from all the cleaning, etc. The spa was a constant slap in the face b/c they don't block out appointments for hotel guest so there was no hope of getting a much needed massage after attempting to sleep in our miniature bed. Tiny Room We booked a king but got a full-almost queen bed that we couldn't walk around without hitting a wall. We couldn't even open our luggage b/c the room was so small. The last night they upgraded us to the slightly larger room that we had booked but only because we had a bazillion "points" from staying at other W's. Some loyalty. Mini Bathroom The bathroom was slightly larger than what you would find on a train. No ledge/counter for toiletries. The trendy cheap shower head sprayed out of the shower and could not be turned. The shower also did not drain properly. So we stood in dirty water while we showered. Bad Service Minimal conveniences. It took me days to get a hair dryer which should have already been in the room. I was awoken at 1 AM on my birthday by a man trying to deliver blankets and sheets that I hadn't ordered. Housekeeping called back 30 minutes later to argue that I had indeed ordered them. Incompetent Staff Door men didn't have a clue about city geography. They couldn't give directions to intersections that were just a few blocks away.They weren't great a cab grabbing either. They do have a nice workout facility but the bottom line is this is a joke of a hotel. Stay somewhere else!

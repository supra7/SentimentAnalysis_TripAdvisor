The room was ok, clean if not small. But they put us on the second floor facing Broadway. The Flags flapped all night and the street noise was unbelieveable. A "shoe shiner" had claimed the hotel's front door as his prime location for "shining" and he carried on conversations with whoever would stop quite loudly all night. You could hear the garbage trucks outside the hotel, so noisy. The elevator was so slow we just walked up and down the stairs even with our luggage upon check out. On the second morning of our stay the hot water didn't work. The maid was nice, but that's about all the nice things I have to say about this hotel. Plus it would be nice to be closer to the action, this was too far up the west side. lower is better. After a full day of site seeing, its worth it to pay more for a better place to get some sleep at night! This place was cheap but you could tell why once you see the building in person and actually stay there. Definitely not worth the money you save on this place.

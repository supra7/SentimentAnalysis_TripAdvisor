Even the $70 priceline rate failed to buffer the ordeal that culminated after our 3 night stay here this past weekend. Upon checking out, the valet office discovered that my vehicle keys were lost, not a comfortable prospect on a cold snowy Sunday morning in Chicago, hours away from home. I personally had to search the key storage area of the valet office where many hundreds of car keys were stashed away. After finding the keys myself the staff realized they had no record of my car being parked and for a time debated whether or not the car would be findable. After an hour of resolving these two issues we were told that our luggage which had been transported via cart by a bellhop, was also missing. When I suggested that the bellhop who assisted us with our luggage be located and asked about the location of our bags I was told that there was no way to contact him and we would "just have to wait" for him to show up. (This was 30 minutes after he left our room.) Finally I was taken to a storage area, where once again I had to locate our property. This whole sequence of events becamre progressively surreal and needless to say I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Never again. Oh yeah, the rooms were small, the bathrooms tiny. No coffee makers in the rooms and one designer shaped (Void of practical use)trash can in the bathroom.

After checking in and going out on the town, we returned to find our luggage was ransacked and 2 of us lost over $500 in cash (yeah we were dumb not to put it in a safe) hidden in 2 different suitcases! The maid had entered for turn-down service but the hotel could've cared less - didn't offer to review security tapes, etc. RUINED our vacation - and the staff was uncaring!

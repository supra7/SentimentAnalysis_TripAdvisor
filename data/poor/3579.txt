Better place to spend money We stayed there three days ago for one night and vowed we will never go back.We were looking forward to staying there and we chose this place to spend our last night of our trip in San Francisco.The welcome tea ceremony that was promised never took place. The room was smelly and when I went to wash my face I saw the finger nail on the basin. Yuk.The Internet connection was bad. Took 10 mins to open a webpage. You need to connect and reconnect repeatedly.Then next morning when we went to have breakfast in the hotel's restaurant it took more than 10 mins for someone to take the order. Had I not voiced out my displeasure it might take more than 20 mins. I saw a family whose father also lost patience becasue of the same issue.There are many better places in San Francisco to stay, definitely not this one. We so regreted of making such decision and decided to pst this message so other people will not have to go through what we experienced.

Complete dump! Nasty, and very unclean. We only stayed one night and that was one night too many. The air conditioner couldn't keep up with the soaring temperatures. I woke up in the middle of the night soaking wet, because I had sweated so. I didn't have on heavy pajamas, just a short sleeve top and capri style bottoms. When we complained to the manager he acted like he didn't care. The hotel was cheap, but spend an extra few dollars and pay for a decent hotel, especially one where you can look out the window and see your car.

Please be advised that I stayed at this hotel 10/3 - 10/14. My room, 5W1 was infested with bed bugs. I had to deliver live bugs to the front desk to convince them I was telling the truth. The hotel manager Mr. Khan was completely unsympathetic, made no apology and after moving me to 2 other rooms at great inconvenience, only was willing to credit me for 2 nights stay. I've reported them to the NY Health Department and the Better Business Bureau. Note that since bedbugs lay eggs in your luggage and clothing, I had to put all clothing in the my washing machine, including the articles I was wearing immediately after arrival home and spray my luggage with bug spray before ever entering my home so as not to infect it.

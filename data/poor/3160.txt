Lost my reservation / staff was not apologetic So here's a case of a hotel that thinks it is too cool to have to worry about customer service. I booked a two night stay specifically so that I could come in off the redeye (from Japan) and check into my room early. I do ths often, so I know my travel agency (AmEx) is good at making sure that this will work. So I get to the front desk, and I am informed that I was deemed a no-show from the first night. I was charged the full room rate. And then I am told my reservation was therefore canceled and that they are sold out for my second night.... wow, major surprise. of course, I can't believe what I am hearingAfter some conversation, out comes the manager, who says that, actually, they do have rooms for the night, but at a rate 60% higher than what was on my reservation. He actually, with a straight face, indicates he is more than happy to accommodate me at this higher rate. *choke* *gag* I cannot imagine a more outrageous thing. They resold my room, and then want to charge me a higher rate.Here's the happy ending. AmEx gets on the line with the hotel - this is good - they have a recording of the conversation where AmEx specifically notified them I would be arriving early in the morning. Of course, they now have to honor my room rate.What's the worst part? Not even an I'm sorry from the manager. Got a free breakfast from one of the front desk staff.

My friend and I, being young people, decided to save a few bucks on our hotel to save more for our shopping trip that brought us to Seattle. NEVER AGAIN! We ordered TWO queen beds when booking, was told this was fine when I booked and then called to CONFIRM the whole thing, then ended up with ONE tiny double bed. There was a stained nasty pull out couch; however, this did not come with any sheets and we arrived late at night and didn't feel like asking the dirty, gangster looking staff to bring some. Had to wear flip flops in the shower...and didn't dare go anywhere near the bathroom walls! Come on..I've seen cleaner /nicer youth hostels!

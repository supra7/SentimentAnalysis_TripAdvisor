I had booked a room this morning to stay in this evening. I had an emergency situation and had to cancel the reservation only a few hours after making it... with plenty of time for hotel to rebook the room. While Expedia had no problem with the cancellation, the hotel manager emphatically refused to be sympathetic and allow a cancellation without charge. The room has been cancelled with no credit given. So, they intend to charge me and presumably resell the room, as well. The irony is that I was excited about staying there because I heard this place was nice and wanted to sample it with the intention of reserving up to 20 rooms for an upcoming conference. I planned to rebook this sample trip for next week! now, no way! When it comes to attitude, management always sets the tone and their cold attitude and lack of understanding leads me to believe this is probably emblematic of their staff. No where I want to bring my sales team! I stay in high-end hotels every week and will probably never stay here because of this.

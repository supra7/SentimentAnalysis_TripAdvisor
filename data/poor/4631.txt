We were disgusted with our stay, the lobby looked great when we walked in but when we got to our room it stunk like mold, the carpet was soaked near the bathroom and was torn across the entire entry way you would think they money we were charged would cover some new carpet, the headboards were not attached to the bed and every time we rolled over we would wake up from the banging the headboard would make on the wall, the hallways were very hot like they had no air conditioning, the room was dirty from the people before us there was trash on the floor and trash can in the bathroom was not clean. We had ridden the train to New Orleans and when we made the train reservations they put us through to the hotel to make a reservation, we didn't want to pay the high price that they gave us but we didn't want to have to pay more for a cab to take us further so we went ahead and got the room, after we payed the $134.00 dollars for the room I went to google to see the room I read the comments that were left and already knew we were going to have problems but was hoping that the people that had made the comments had just had a bad experience well we found out different when we got there we knew that all there comments were not false. We were most disgusted because we were not traveling alone we had our four very young children with us and even they were disgusted with the smell of the room, they complained of headaches in the morning which I have never had them complain of there head hurting I didn't even know that they knew what a headache was. We travel a lot and stay at many hotels and never have I gone back and had to make a complaint just because I don't want anyone one else to have to stay in such a horrible place we have payed 39.99 for a room at the hotel 6 and been happier we have even payed 24.99 for the best value inn and have had better experiences.

This hotel offered the worst customer service I have ever experienced.. I called before our arrival to ensure our reservation was in order. We had booked one stay and then gone back and added some days. We had also booked four rooms which we wanted to ensure were near one antoher. I spent 68 minutes on the phone with a customer service rep who said he worked out all the details. When we arrived, the reservation was a total mess and we spent another hour HOUR checking into four rooms. We left for the day on our third day there for a FULL day trip and did not return until 4 a.m. the following day. When I tried to get in my room, the key did not work and I spend almost TWO HOURS trying to get ito my room. The front desk clerk said our reservation showed us checking out that day (hence the two plus hours I spent earlier "working out" our reservation was in vain) and she could not override the lock-out. Even though our things were in our room, they LOCKED US OUT. There was no manager on site. I have traveled a lot and have NEVER had this or anything closely resembling this happen to me. My medication was in my room and I tried to explain that I REALLY needed to get in. She sent me up to my room THREE times assuring me each time I could now get in. Each time I went back down to the lobby I had to stand in line AGAIN to tell her the key didn't work. It was the WORST hotel experience of my life...BY FAR. I finally convinced her to get security to let me in my room. By this time it was morning and I WAS supposed to be checking out. It was awful. None of it made any sense. They had my credit card on file. It really was pitiful. Add to all this that this hotel is off by itself and it is not convenient to much of anything. You feel very isolated. The casino is poor, the buffet not so good and the rooms so-so. With so many awesome hotels in LV DO NOT CHOOSE THE STRATOSPHERE!!

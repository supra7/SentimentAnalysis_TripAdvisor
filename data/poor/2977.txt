We received a room through a discounted website and as soon as the women behind the desk saw this, she handed us our keys and pointed to the elevators. No explanation about hotel services, no map of the grounds was given, nothing! Dont they realize that we did pay for the room AND we might be using their restaurants, spa and other services? We are frequent travelers and use a lot of these websites to book travel but never have we been treated so poorly. Front Desk Staff: It would have been helpful to understand that they gave us a room in Tower 1 (the old tower) and that there is a different entrance for your car/valet and 2 sets of elevators. Rooms in Tower 1: old beds, ink-stained carpet and very small bathrooms. Our room overlooked a dirt parking lot to the convention center. If you do stay here, ask for a room in the new tower. Valet Service: Day 1 we tried calling down for our car but were told that they were too busy so we walked down and waited for 30 minutes. The valet mgr acted like he did us a favor by getting our car. Day 2 we were able to call down and we let them know that we wanted the car pulled around to Tower 1. We waited there for 20 minutes and finally my husband went to the other entrance and found that they pulled the car around to wrong entrance. Restaurants: stopped by the B-Line Diner for breakfast at 11 AM and the hostess rudely told us that we were too late for breakfast. We drove to the First Watch restaurant on Sand Lake Road and had a great breakfast.! The hotel pool grill/bar was a lot more pleasant. Pros: nice pools and plenty of upscale restaurants in the area. Cons: All-around poor service. Valet was $20. I dont mind paying that if there was service to back it up! No coffee in the room. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress for 3 days earlier this year and wished we had returned.

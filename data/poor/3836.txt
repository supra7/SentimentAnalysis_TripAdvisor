We were sent to the Maui Lu by the Maui Banyan. We had a confirmed reservation for the night at the Banyan but that didn't mean much as they had no space for us. They made a big deal about securing accomodation at their "sister" hotel, the Maui Lu, implying it was a decent place. The Lu is located far from the main area of Kihei which might appeal to some. The grounds were lovely & green but that is about it for the positive aspects of the resort. The room we were given had an overwhelming odour of chlorine - not at all near the pool - and was dark & gloomy. The carpet was very dirty with stains and the mattress & box spring were stained on the sides as well. The air conditioner was old, noisy and dirty. The beds were of the lowest quality & were very uncomfortable. Overall, we would never recomment this hotel - if there had been any other place available, we would have left immediately.

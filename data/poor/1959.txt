I got this hotel once on Hotwire. I had read bad reviews but I'm an optimist so I had an open mind about it. But it turned out to be not that great at all. The rooms are EXTREMELY small, meaning you can barely walk around in them. Also, the bathrooms were showing their age and weren't very clean. The lobby is impressive but don't be fooled. If you can stay somewhere else, then do it.

Beware BEDBUGS! I saw it in a travel book. 5 minutes from the airport - it sounded perfect for a quick sleep and shower after a late flight into Honolulu airport and before catching an early plane in the morning to Maui.The rooms are more like closets - there are no real doors, nor do the walls reach the ceiling. In the morning, i realized i had bites on my feet. By the evening, the bites had spread all over my body. Bed bug bites create intense itching and welts that don't go away for over a week. scars remain longer.Apparently only 50% of people react to the bites. My friend didn't, but i did.Not a great way to start a vacation! Beware!

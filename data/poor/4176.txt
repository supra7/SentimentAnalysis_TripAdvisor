Stayed here last night after having been on a cruise- all I wanted to do was call home. No wifi? No phone?! Went down to the front desk to ask to use the phone, the gentleman at the desk said absolutely what's the number? I needed to call Canada using a phone card- he says they can't call 1-800 numbers. Is that not the concept? Free calls? Apparently not, went to the Marriott across the street to use a pay phone - for free. Bathroom only had 1 towel. Hair everywhere, scuffed, dirty walls, closet door off the track, no Internet, missing closet door handle, dishes and cutlery looked like they had been left behind by past guests. There's no quick food in the area- we walked 20 minutes to find a Burger King- which had wifi, pay phones, clean bathrooms and hot food. Unfortunate when the local Burger King is better appointed than your damn "hotel".

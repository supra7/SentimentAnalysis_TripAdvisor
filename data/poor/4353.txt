Staff is plainly rude. You walk-in right inside the casino. Every new guests look stupid, walking around to find the desk/reception. Check-in painfully slow, have to queue in a line for 30mn Rooms: sink is in the room, no wardrobe, stinking of tobacco as central aircon. tiny window, felt like in jail. Oh, should I mention, no sleep cos the train run along the hotel and trains blow the horns for minutes at a time right in the middle of the night also room next to ice machine! Less than 12 hours in this motel,yes, not a hotel, I upgraded to a premium room. Right, you are entitle to have furnitures and a proper bathroom. Still very noisy room, no ice machine, but this time the lifts and the low life guests screaming as they are drunk, then kids abandonned in the corridor outside their rooms at 1am... and still those trains. Staff: Reception: rude, Buffet restaurant: Rude, Cafe: nice but horrible food Location: crap: away from everything and noisy, beggars, addicts every 20 yards on the street. you would not walk around there at night time. Wonder why they have all these "Get out of Jail" bons places just next door to the next. Would that be a clue???? I selected this hotel for my first 3 nights to get over the jetlag. If my friends hadn't join me (in a proper hotel: The carriage house hotel + MGM Grand) I would have left Las Vegas. horrible room, horrible staff, horrible location, kind of OK food.

We got in late and very tired. I checked to make sure there there was nothing under the bed,removed to bedspread and went to sleep. We should have known there was something wrong when we had to drive around the American to another set of buildings circled by a chain link fence.. These were definitely not the renovated rooms some people talk about. I have felt softer horse blankets, and they didn't have burn holes. The tub was disgusting! There was a combination of grease and mold embedded in the tub surround seams. The sink wouldn't drain, and crude that was in the pipe floated up into the sink when we turned on the water. The motel caters to a wide variety of clientele .... The ones around us were extremely noisy and minimally dressed.

This "resort" was a joke. First of all, it is located well off the strip, next to a power plant, in a very seedy neighborhood. We were apporoached by numerous bums as we walked the 20 minute walk to the strip. We were even followed by one! The best part of the walk was the dead bum we had to walk past as the cops were investigating. NOT A NICE LOCATION! Luckily we had our car, so we drove from then on out. The next thing I would caution you against is that the resort pictures online look NOTHING like the actual resort. It is what the resort "will" look like when it is completed. Right now, hardly any pools are open and they are all tiny. There are no covered cabana-looking structures as pictured. There's an abundance of construction equipment and non-paved roads. I understand that Vegas is often under construction, but we never saw anything being worked on and we were there both on a weekend and weekdays. We were given two room keys and of course only one worked. The room was nice; however, the beds were uncomfortable and the sheets were a rough, low thread count that didn't feel pleasant on the skin. Additionally, upon check-in, we were given an inventory sheet and asked to verify the count on ALL of the linens, glasses, dishes, utensils, appliances, etc. and compare it with what housekeeping said we had. This took almost 20 minutes and we found numerous discrepencies that we probably would have been charged for if we didn't catch them right away. (When did vacation become work?) When my husband took the inventory sheet and the key that didn't work to the office, he said he couldn't really get anyone to help because no one in the office spoke very much English. They just said, "OK. Thank you" over and over.

When I arrived after midnight, having confirmed my reservation twice (including just a few hours before, when I'll called from the airport upon finding that my flight had been delayed), they told me that they had overbooked and that I now had no room, so they were sending me to a comparable hotel nearby. They sent me across town to an awful, noisy, foul place. The next morning they refused my request for a written record to use in regard to related charges; they also lied to me, to the group that had organized the meeting, etc., about what had happened. Folks attending the meeting who had stayed there reported various problems, so I'm not sure I missed out on anything other than sleep.

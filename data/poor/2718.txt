This place was terrible,We arrived around 11.00am and our room was not ready. The check in desk was a half of a door no joke. It took 20 min to tell us that our room was not ready. When we arrives around 4.00 (check in time) our room was not ready so we wated 20 min once we arrived on the 7th floor the hall reaked and was very small. When we arived in our room we were greated with a 4 in bug no joke. The only good thing about this hotel was it was humongus. The beds were not very confertable and were very small. The tv was 12 in and there was 2 one for the bedroom and one for the faimly. When we woke up next day we went down to get b-feast. the elevaters took 15 min for me to get on. Once we got down there the b-feast was terrible it was bagels still frozen and crosants coffe and oj thats it. We paid 1,150 for 2 nights. I would never stay here again, I would rather stay at the ymca. DON'T STAY HERE

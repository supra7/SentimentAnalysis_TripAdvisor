Planned this for our friends and I am truely embarrassed. After speaking to management multiple times before our arrival to ensure everything goes smoothly, it was quite a disappointment when we arrived. Money was not an issue...so we did not mind spending a bit more for this place but we found it to be more like your average mexico trip. Defintiely not a place for people from the bigger cities that know good service and food. There many better places you can find for your money in Mexico (especially Playa del Carmen). Management didnt even bother accomodating us until we mentioned calling amex to dispute the charge. It was only then that they even spoke to us after 4 torturous days and attempts to speak to management. Management even agreed that all the issues we were having were unacceptable. By thispoint we only had a night left and could not be bothered with them.

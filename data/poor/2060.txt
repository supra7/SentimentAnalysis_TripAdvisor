I'm writing this review to warn fellow travelers not to stay here. Because the wonderful Homewood Suites next door was booked up, we were wound up staying here. I expected this hotel to be similar to the Homewood Suites. Instead, it was a complete disappointment. Sure, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were very clean. However, ultimately, when you pay for a hotel room, you're paying for a place to sleep for the night. The Hilton Garden Inn is a total, complete and utter failure in this regard. The walls have absolutely no soundproofing at all. You can here your neighbor's TV, conversations, everything. One night, I got shaken awake by my neighbor who happened to like to blast his TV at 1:00 a.m. And mind you, all rooms are like this. I kept changing rooms, and they all have the same walls which seem to be made out of a thin piece of drywall, or possibly even cardboard. No matter which room you're in, you'll be able to here TV's and conversations from the rooms adjacent to you. This place also serves no breakfast, unless you're willing to pay a rediculous amount of money for cornflakes and a bagel. You're better off staying in a cheap motel. Cheap motels that I've stayed at had better services and better soundproofing than this Hilton Garden Inn. If you're just looking for a nice, quiet place to sleep, do not stay at this hotel. For what you get out of it, it is totally overpriced and generally not a pleasant place to be.

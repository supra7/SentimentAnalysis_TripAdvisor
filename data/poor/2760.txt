I checked into this hotel on December 9th for what was suppossed to be a two night stay. Although the staff were friendly and helpful when I checked in, that is the only compliment I can offer. I found it to be one of the dirtiest hotels I have ever seen. The elevator looked like it had never been vacummed. I was given a nice sized corner room that was handicap accessible and fairly large by New York standards, but the bathroom was run down and there was mildew and rust in the showers. The walls in the room were scraped up and in need of a paint job. The bed was lumpy and the pillows felt like they were 10 years old. I asked to switch rooms because of the mildew in the shower. I looked at four other rooms, THEY ALL HAD mildew in the showers and all needed paint jobs. Finally I just told them I wanted to check out. I found it to be too dirty to justify the price. I went and stayed at the St. Giles Hotel for about $150 less a night and it had a HUGE clean room. Stay there, not here!

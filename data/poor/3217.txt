I confronted a bartender for degrading a patron after he acknowledged the bartender didn't pour any alcohol in his drink, but still charged him $11. Surprise, surprise! The patron was upset and as soon as he said something, he was verbally abused by Miguel the bartender after the acknowledgment. So I stepped in and confronted the bartender, and notified his superiors, unfortunately the hotel staff couldn't have been any less helpful. I guess confronting a bartender by the name of Miguel, who is extremely unprofessional, and for lack of a better word, ghetto!!! Is not allowed or acknowledged by the encore management staff. They were extremely uncooperative with the investigation, and I'm sure they kept the unbelievable rude Miguel, and his extremely rude manager Anthony on staff, which exposes future customers to this unfriendly and unprofessional environment. I will most definitely take my business to the Venetian/Palazzo or any where for that matter, as they know how to treat people, in a kind and professional matter. Keep in mind I was not originally a victim of encores horrible customer service, what triggered my abuse was sticking up for someone who didn't have the courage to stick up for himself.

book 2 rooms for 3 night from 29/8 - 31/8/11 and full payment with credit card. Guess what when we arrived they told us the aircond are faulty and we have to transfer to other outlet which is Fragrance Classic.Imagine with heavy bags you have to walk across the street to distance to the other outlet. I book for this cibai oasis because they got twin bed and now I have to move to the other one only with single queen bed. What is the point filling the email and contact no. if you cant contact me and inform me about the changes. At least let me know and save me for the move around trouble. I've travel all over the world and this is the worst hotel service I ever encounter. Pls stay away from this horrible hotel by all mean

Definitely will not stay her Ever Again! we stayed here from friday to sunday 09/18/2011... I woke up saturday morning and noticed several marks on my arm which was confimed to be Bedbug bites..The manager was so unconcerned that he could not look me in the eyes. He never appoligized this is very Discusting and Unsanitary ..let me first say when we arrived the choice of rooms available was, one where previous guess had pets OR, handicap well my thing is, if its against the law to park in handicap parking space the rules should apply to the rooms ..

I just returned from a stay at this hotel in New York City. I go to New York often and normally stay at a different hotel but thought I would try something different this time. What a mistake. The Time is expensive $400 per night, the room had broken airconditioing that failed completely the last night, a bathroom that smelled like someone died in it, internet that drifted in and out making work impossible and a Tv remote that required the patience of a saint. This hotel was disappointing in every respect and uncomfortable in many. There are many hotels in this area. Choose any of them and you will be happier.

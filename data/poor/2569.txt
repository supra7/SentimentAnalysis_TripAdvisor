When we arrived the hotel was dirty and the rooms were not up to the standards in the pictures or as promised. We had to ask each day for our room to be cleaned housekeeping complained they didnt have any towels to do so. On our second night there after returning from dinner we came back and there were other ppls possessions on our balcony and cameras missing from our room. We called the desk they called the police who wouldnt even write a reoprt. So we emailed a complaint to the manager since he never was available. That same night as we packed to leave we had our balcony open one of us was out on it the other in the bathroom. We were talking back and forth. Security came to our room and said we were being to loud we apologized. 5 minutes later sherriffs showed up took us put in our nightgowns and arrested us for disturbing the peace. After a hellacious nightmare of 20 ours long we returned to gather out belongings which the hotel had thrown into garbage bags to find our money missing. They offered to call the police again. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. We are two women in our thirtys who were doing nothing wrong but made a complaint and they took revenge on us.

Once we pulled in we realized we were the only guest and the parking lot was set up with camaras from the Memphis police dept. We were immediately concerned. The area is also very concerning. We walked into the lobby and noticed an unpleasant stinch but were greeted by pleasant staff. When we reached our room we once again opened the door to the same stinch but after getting a little air circulating it was better. The room was ok and was nicely equipped with with a microwave and refigerator. The door however had a crack in it even when closed and bolted which let us feeling even more unsecure. The train near the hotel starts running about 6:30am so no sleeping in unless you can sleep through a train. The next morning we ran into some other guests who commented its nice to see someone else...and we felt the same! The owner's suite door had bars over them which also left us feeling very uneasy. There were many signs posted around the property and in the room to keep valuables on you at all times which led us to believe they had probably had a problem with theft. And then breakfast was a disaster I would suggest you skip it altogether! The juice both apple and orange wasn't even recognizable the coffee left something to be desired. The hot waffle was good and that was it!

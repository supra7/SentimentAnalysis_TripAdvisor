I reserved a Deluxe Executive Suite on a comp offer on the website and when I arrived I had to practically beg for what turned out to be an oversized,rundown Classic room! Outside of being larger than the very small standard room it was terrible. Harrahs seems to take pride in offending their best customers! Diamond Players stay away from this property!

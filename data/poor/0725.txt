We went to the pool to get our towels from the counter and when we went to sit on them we found a giant, fresh blood stain, probably from some womans period. The towel had not been washed as it should have and then it should have been thrown away!! In my bed i pulled the covers up to my chin to sleep and found a long line of fresh blood on the rim of the blanket that is closest to your face. Having blood is unsafe and toxic and can carry blood borne pathogens. Finally, when i went to check out my rate was raised 100 dollars. i told them that wasn't the rate given to me,but they said it was my fault because i didnt get the email telling me they changed it. i checked the email i have to theirs and they sent the email to the wrong address!!!! he still blamed it on me. the beach there is surrounded by reef and you can't go in the ocean. head down and stay at the westin or sheraton. their beaches are people friendly, and their hotels are much classier and safe.

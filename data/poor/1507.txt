Do not stay here! I stayed at this hotel for two separate nights while visiting Dallas for a family reunion. I needed something cheap and close to Love Field Airport, so this fit the description. However, the rooms were just scary. The first one I stayed in was on the bottom floor. I noticed the soap holder in the bathroom was broken and also saw huge finger print indentations on the door. The outside door had been kicked down it looked like someone fell in the tub and the door had to be kicked down so they could get to the person. The second room I stayed in was on the top floor- the only thing clean in that room was one of the towels and the sheets. The blanket had caked pee on it and the room had the smoke detector stolen so that people could smoke in it. I also didn't feel very safe- this hotel accomodates monthly housing for people who can't make a monthly rent- so think about it that way. I didn't have anything stolen from the though, so I guess thats a plus. Free breakfast was nice, but the only good thing there was the waffle maker. Will not return to this hotel- it would be worth the extra $10-20 per night to find something in a nicer condition that is in a safer neighborhood.

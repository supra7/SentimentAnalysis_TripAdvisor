I decided to stay at Elite World because of the convenient location in Taksim but other that a good location, this hotel is terrible. Rooms are very dirty: carpet full of stains, shower cubical full of mold, low water pressure makes it very hard to take a decent shower but the worst was the trash from previous get was still in the bin, including used a condom!! Minibar not refilled, of course the consumption of previous guest was on my bill! AC in the room not working made it almost impossible to sleep. I complaint three times without any result. Telephones not working had to go down to Reception to order Room Service. Room service order was delivered incorrectly. Breakfast is very poor as well. Selection and quality below average, coffee & tea served out of urns, if you want to have fresh coffee you need to pay extra. Table linen very dirty and seems not to get changed at all. Overall recommendation for this hotel - STAY AWAY!

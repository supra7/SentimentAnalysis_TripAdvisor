We have been staying in Peabody Orlando for 4 nights (Dec 25-29, 2010) and had a terrible experience. The wall is paper thin and you can hear everything outside including noise of elevator, people walking down the hall and the worst, housekeeping. We were woke up 8am in the first morning by housekeeping and I had to ask them for a door tag ( we did not have one in our room) for "do not disturb". Surprisingly, the housekeeping still tried to get into our room regardless the door tag while we were catching some sleep. I had to complain to the concierge but nobody cared and I never got any feedback for this issue. We were trying to have some hot water after a freezing day and realized there was even no coffee maker. I called the housekeeping and they said they will CHARGE me for hot water!!! Not even mention additional 30 bucks for parking and resort fee. The Peabody Orlando completely ruined our holiday trip.

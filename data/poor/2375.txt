My stay at the Maui Prince lasted a total of 10 minutes. My husband and I checked in, walked around the room, and checked out. The hotel was terrible. It stunk and it was very out-dated. I would compare it to a 2 star Holiday Inn in a small town. When we decided to check out, we called other hotels in Maui and found rooms close to the Maui Prince rate. We only stayed here because we won our bid on Priceline. The staff at the Maui Prince was nice enough to not charge Priceline, which should enable us to get a refund.

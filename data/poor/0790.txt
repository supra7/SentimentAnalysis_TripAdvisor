The Management company Outrigger is slowly destroying the Maui El Dorado which I consider a true gem on Maui. From the front desk staff manager and her female assistant Michelle to the RUDE girl at the cabana the service is absolutely horrible. This is very special place to my whole family and I and it is so disappointing to see what The Outrigger has done. Their employees are bothered by guests and truely do not want to do anything to help out either in regards to the condo (especially if you havent rented directly through them) or at the cabana. I will say the one kind person working there is the older woman working at the cabana on the weekends...other than that it is very disappointing. The girl at the cabana sits with a miserable face all day texting on her cell phone.....if asked she will throw a towel your way but you can tell it is NOT what she wants to be doing. If we didnt rent through an owner directly I can say without a doubt we would NEVER go back! I hope that either the Outrigger gets it together and re-vamps it's staff or this place is not going to make it!

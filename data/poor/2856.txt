This is dated - I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights in 2008 visiting friends in NYC. Let me clarify where I come from - as a gold or platinum SPG member for years now, I have great respect for this chain. I have had good experiences in the Westins in Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai; W Hong Kong; various ITC group hotels in India; even places like the Westin Copley in Boston and the W - both of them - on E 39th or thereabouts in NYC. I can categorically say the W New York was a disappointment. The rooms are small - do not put this down to NYC, because the aforementioned W Tuscany or its neighbor have nice rooms. I had a drink at the bar, went up, could not get into my room. Went down, got a new key, could not get into my room. Repeated the exercise, could not get in again. In exasperation, I went down and slammed the card on the desk and the ruffian manning the desk, who was not in the least bothered that a guest was having trouble getting into a room they paid for, admonished me for my behavior. Then I spoke to a supervisor type, who sent me upstairs and I waited on the couch on my floor in a dismal narrow corridor for perhaps 15 minutes. Finally a maintenance guy showed up - the battery in the electronic door lock had failed. It was not the stupid foreign guest not knowing how to use the key, after all. I complained to SPG and all they did was to give me a few free points, which I earn in a couple of days in any given week seeing how much I travel. I was tempted to put this down to a New Yorker attitude - but as a former New Yorker, and having been served better at other SPG hotels in New York, that would be untrue. Therefore, I conclude that either a) this constitutes acceptable service levels in this hotel or b) black sheep like the people who "took care" of me are condoned. Either case is unacceptable and I heartily encourage you to avoid this hotel. There are a dozen choice I can think of.

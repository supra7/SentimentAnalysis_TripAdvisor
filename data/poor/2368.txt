If the Adams family ran a resort for the witness protection program, then it would be this hotel. This throw-back to the 1970s could be a world class resort and I mean one of the most amazing if it were completely gutted and redone. Why do I say this? The physical location is wonderful - a perfect cresent beach with nice gentle surf. However, aside from friendly-enough valet folks, the rest was like the Adams family house - probably nice in the day, but unfortunately the day was well before I was born. The pool is circular - completely wasted if you want to do laps and it is about the size of a bathtub. The walls - are white...ok, they were white, but now look like the shade of Bob Geldoff's teeth. And what is up with the makeshift mall when you first walk in - au curant with the other hotels int he area, the Makenna allows local "artisans" to sell stuff in the lobby. I use the word "artisan" loosely, as if you think you can get nice jewelery at the Piercing Pagoda in a mall, then you can find fine craftmanship in the lobby. So, on the good side, like I said, the beach seems really nice. The hotel is out of the way of everything, but if you have a car, not a problem - out of the way means ten minutes from anything. The golf course is about as good as any poorly kept executive course, so if you are going for th egolf, but Tiger Woods on Nintendo and stay at home. Overall, the resort feels is a bit down-on-your-luck. They could try to weed a few beds here and there - they have amazing fully grown specimen trees and such, but totally ruined with weeds and such. It could be great, but it needs Disney, Trump, or someone with bucks and vision to take it from where it is, to where it needs to be. Too many other options that are nicer and cheaper.

I arrived late on a Thursday night having booked a queen smoking room (disgusting i know), when i arrived i was told the hotel was full and the only room available was a double (ie a single beds) non-smoking room, yes i was offered a downgrade, so much for being a 'starwood preferred guest'. The room was tiny and had the hotel airconditioning out the window which made for not a very good nights sleep, and that classic new york view of a brick wall next door. I have stayed in other w hotels and enjoyed the experience but i would avoid this one. Aside from this experience the place could do with a makeover, the airconditioning unit in the room is loud, and the finish in the room is poor, lights didn't work in the room, you get the idea, you'll get better value elsewhere.

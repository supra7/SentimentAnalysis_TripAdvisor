The Downtown Los Angeles Marriott is one of the worst Marriott Hotels anywhere. The rooms are noisy even at the top floor, Aircondition did not work, Hotel is run down, and they use very cheaply decorated for the level of nightly rate they charge. I chose the hotel because I am a Marriott Rewards Member, I stay at Marriotts Worl Wide, and the location of this hotel was just what I needed. But I would never stay there again.

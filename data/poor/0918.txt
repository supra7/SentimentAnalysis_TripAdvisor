We had requested a 12:30pm check in and arrived at 2:20pm (official check-in time is at 3:00pm). Our room was not ready since they "were full last night." To me, whether or not they were full does not matter to me; it's up to their management to ensure that rooms are ready for the guests on time. It was then that we noticed that the lobby/lounge area was completely full of people waiting for their rooms. We were given an option to wait (for an unspecified amount of time) for the room or leave our bags with the bellhop (for tip). We were not offered any compensation until we checked back (they waived the $14/day valet fee). Only after my friend was on the phone with them for nearly a full hour, did we get the keys to the room at around 3:30pm, but everyone else was still waiting for their rooms; some since Noon! When we went back out around 4:15pm, the same people were still waiting. At around 6:15pm, even more people were waiting both in the check-in line and in the lobby/lounge! This is not the way that anyone wants to begin a vacation. There is also a fee for smoking in the room. I don't smoke, but apparently the people in the adjoining room do, so the doorway area and our room kept smelling of smoke, so I had to call reception/security about it. Nevermind, the odor when it was promised to be smokefree. Reviews had talked about the long wait for the valet (for us 15 minutes at an off-peak time), so we opted for cabs at peak times. However, the queue for the cabs so we crossed the street to Nordstrom to get a cab there instead. At time of checkout, they had the valet fee on the bill, which I had to remind them that they'd promised to waive. All in all, the hotel ended up being the sole source of stress during our vacation. The room was almost identical to the MGM Signature. I would highly recommend staying at the MGM Signature instead -- the Signature is very relaxing and so much more better managed.

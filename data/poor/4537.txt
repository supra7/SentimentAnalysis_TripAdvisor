I have just recently returned home from the USA back to Melbourne Australia. This hotel experience was nothing short of a nightmare during my stay! First of all we were allocated a room, after settling in and unpacking ect we decided to have a shower. There was no hot water. After calling reception up to 5 times to try and have this sorted they decided to inform us that they were having problems with the right side of the hotel so they would upgrade us to another room on the other side of the hotel. So we packed up at 10pm and moved rooms. As for the upgrade that did not happen, just a different lay out of furniture in the room! My next issue with this hotel was the house keeping. They were very slack leaving our room unmade up to 5:30pm-6:00pm both nights. Only when we called the reception they had our room made up for us. On the second occassion she made the beds but did not empty the bins nor hung our towels up (left them in a pile in the bathroom) nor gave us fresh drinking glasses!!!! Our key cards kept deactivating so we often had to visit reception and have them reset! And finally on return home I noticed $280.00USD was missing from my credit card. They "thought" we over stayed a night so took this amount off my card! After a phone call (at my cost) we are currently having this resolved and credited back onto my card. The only positive I can add about this hotel is the complementary driver "Dave" who was a pleasure to ride with.

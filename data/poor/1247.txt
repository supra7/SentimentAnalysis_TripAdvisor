Book the Hotel Smit for two nights in early June 2007. We lasted 1 night. The hotel is quite literally a building site. There are radiators, double glazing panels left lying and workmens equipment on all of the floors. The lift is out of operation and the stairs are quite frankly dangerous. The room was not clean, wallpaper hanging off the walls, carpet disgusting, stunk of stale cigarettes, holes in the ceiling. The bed 'sell by date' had passed '20' years ago. You could clearly hear what the guests were doing next door. Paper thin walls.... To cap this we were badly bitten by an infestation 'fleas' during the night. We ended up 'sleeping' in our clothes on top of the bed because the bed wasn't clean. The hotel needs to be closed and fully refurbished. The location totally misrepresents the appalling quality of this disgusting 'hotel'. Use at your peril....

I stayed in Room 2168 in Mardia Gras Tower. I checked into the hotel on 11/24/10 and I was first given a deluxe room which was dirty and had a horrible odor of sewage, I then went down to the front desk and was offered an upgrade to a suite for $50.00/night which I took. the shower in the room did not work properly and the room was also dirty and the refrigerator stunk like rotten eggs. My husband and I went to bed and awoke with bites marks all over our body, we checked out the next morning when I had the room booked for 3 nights. Later in the evening on 11/25 more bites appeared all over our body and hives all over. I called the hotel to report the bed bugs ( I own a pest control co so am 100% sure these are bed bugs). I spoke with Carrie Gargano at 1200 AM and she informed me that there was no one at the hotel to take a report and I had to call back the next day, I asked for her manager who she advised me was Sal Goerella and he was not available either. She was very rude and I was treated like I was making this up. I just wanted to report it so they could have the problem corrected and this would not happen to someone else. I visit all the Harrahs properties in Las Vegas and in Atlantic City but will think twice about returning to a Harrahs owned casino in the future after being treated like this. Do not waste your time or money staying here!!!!

First room I stayed in, for less than an hour mind you, had a entrance room door as thin as a Closet door, No Air Con, so I opened window to have 5 flys flying around like vultures interupting my view of TV, room was also too bright, cheap blinds cover half of windows, the other half has nice thick curtains. No screens on windows however, SO I left room to leave hotel when the front desk convinced me to stay with a new room. I reluctantly gave it a shot and was disappointed once again with the water pouring in the kitchen over the microwave the following morning, In order to stay cool the windows had to be left open only to hear a club/pub close bye celebrate till 2am. I dont mind paying a little more for a nice hotel, and thats exactly what I will do when I visit Queen Anne. I have stayed at the Mediteranian across the street whixch is wonderfull, AC, excellent security, overall pleasant experience. This place is a dump, itchy feeling, Oh yeah this now third room smells of Vodka-like someone was sick or something. Front desk says they have no more rooms, one more answer to appease them and not the guests. I could go on-but I have better things to go on doing. I have done you potential guests a favor-Your welcome...

I visited Hotel Felix this past weekend w/ my mom, two sisters, and teen age niece....this was the worst hotel experience we've ever had. We booked two rooms on price line and when we got there were told that they only queen beds available....we had 3 people in a room....they don't have roll away beds, but we could either get a 3rd room or they'd bring up extra pillows/blankets. The rooms are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL....there wouldn't be room for a roll away bed and that's why they don't have them. We had to get a 3rd room and my mom ended up by herself. Five people shouldn't need 3 hotel rooms! We were constantly bumping into each other--the rooms were smaller than my college dorm room. We requested wine glasses to have a pre-dinner drink and the entire hotel was OUT of wine glasses...how is this possible? They brought us plastic cups for our wine. Every time we ordered coffee from room service it was wrong and they'd have to come up 2 or 3 times to rectify it. They didn't bring any of us clean washcloths on our 2nd night....3 rooms and NONE of us had clean wash cloths. When asked at the end of our stay "how was your visit?" We explained everything that happened....the man at the desk said, "I guess we won't be seeing you here again." I just couldn't believe that they could have no regard for the poor service that we recieved and didn't do anything to make us feel better about our experience. I've never seen such AWFUL customer service in my life. We frequent Chicago on a regular basis and have never been treated like this before. Also, families should be aware of the small rooms....there wouldn't be room for a pack-in-play, or room for kids to play, no bathtub either just a shower.

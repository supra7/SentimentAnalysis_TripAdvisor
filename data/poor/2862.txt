Upon arriving, unprofessional front desk clerks clueless about a simple debit card situation. The elevators are tiny (4 very thin people, max), the hallways are very dark, musty smell. The room: 2 good things: comfy bed and good tv. Bad things about room: the decor /color scheme is not trendy anymore, needs an update to lighter, happier colors, yellow-grey lighting everywhere in the hotel, no natural light anywhere, especially bad lighting in our room's bathroom and the mirrors in bathroom were too high, the sink was clogged and slow to drain, the heating system made loud noises when it cycled and woke us from sleep, dirty carpet. The mini bar area is tricky -don't touch anything for more than 30 seconds if you are not planning on eating/drinking it. We stayed for one night and definitely did not get our money's worth. We should have gone the Plaza... or the Red Roof Inn.

The room I prepaid two weeks in advance was still not available to us 3 hours after check-in. We were told they had no idea when we would have a room. We missed our dinner reservations with friends for my 30th birthday, which was the only reason for staying downtown in the first place. The staff was extremely rude. When I was told there was no room I asked for a refund so that I could find a room somewhere else. I was then told "I don't know what to tell you" and then the man at the desk walked away leaving us to stand there upset and stranded. We finally got in a room that was not the King we had book and PAID for in advance. It was filthy. Our city view was a construction view. Between the blowing of the tarps outside our window and the noise of the elevator right outside our door, I was kept up all night. When I got up I decided to take a bath, but the tub was broken. I went to check out and listened as the asked everyone around us how their stay was....no one asked us (wonder why?!?!) I told them about the tub and filthy room and was told "thanks for letting me know" with a snotty attitude. I have never in my life seen such poor customer service anywhere. The elevator is broken so you have to go to the lower level then carry your bags up to the lobby. I then paid for my parking (almost double what I had been originally quoted). I have stayed at this hotel once before and it was okay, but after this experience I would never stay again and advise everyone else to go elsewhere.

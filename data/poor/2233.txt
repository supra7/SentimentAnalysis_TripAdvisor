Luckily I only had to stay one night but it really sucked. I paid extra for a "full kitchen" when I found just a microwave and a broken fridge. The balcony has a view to the ocean with seats but you can't even access for "our protection"- when we got our room key we had to agree that we would not open the balcony door or we would get evicted immediately. Felt like I was signing my contract to a dorm room, we had to check off the condition of everything in the room including wall hole size to ceiling to blow dryers. They also attached an article of a kid who jumped off the balcony - what a great way to welcome your guests. The walls are paper thin and I was able to hear conversations from the other room. They open balconies for only people over the age of 25. Really crappy hotel and I would never recommend this to anyone

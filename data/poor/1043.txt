Although this was awhile ago, I was prompted to write this after again searching for another stay in Philadelphia and saw Roadway reviews. This place was a living nightmare. The front door had glass missing and it was taped together. The stairway was so small, we had to wait until someone came down to go up. No elevator service, broken. The rooms were very small and there was no fire escape accessible to us. We could not sleep for fear of getting out safely. Stuffy. The advertisement shows great location, which it is, but I would never stay here again. Above us were thirteen girls staying for a bachorlette party. This building is an old three story fire trap. Do not stay here. The price invites you in, but you may never get out.

Well, a great weekend and stay, until I valeted my car. Rude service from doorman and shuttle driver, then the worst happened. Young valet driver by the name of Mike did considerable damage to the clutch in my vehicle, and was apparent to all in the lobby who could smell the car when it pulled up. Now the hotel and valet company claim absolutely NO responsibility for the three thousand dollars of damage done to my car (Audi parts are NOT cheap).

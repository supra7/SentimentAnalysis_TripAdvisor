First of all let me start by saying the actual hotel is beautiful. That being said, I would like to complain about how rude management is. I attending a wedding on saturday and after the reception we tried to go to bond, the bar inside the hotel. We were told we were not in appropriate attire, bc we were all dressed up however after dancing in heels for 4 hrs were wearing flip flops. Instead of explaining to us why we were flat out told by the roid head manager that we were not going to be let in. Of course this did not go over to well. We were guest at the wedding and we were guest at the hotel. After talking with the bar manager we were told we were a threat to the club bc of a comment he hard us say and that there was no way we were going to get in so we should "just go to bed". When I tried to complain to the manager of the hotel I was met with the same rudeness and arrogance. While I was trying to voice my opinion, he was blatanly ignoring me and continued to go on with his nightly duties as if I was not there. I was talked down to as if I was a child. And basically he did not provide me any explanation for why he or the bond manager were rude. I guess 205 per night to stay here does not include being respected. I would not recomend staying here.

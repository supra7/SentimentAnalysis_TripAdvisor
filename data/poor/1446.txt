The only plus point about this place is the location -- less than 5 minutes walk from Central Train Station. Otherwise, this is likely the most "cheapskate" hotel I've ever stayed in. They nickel and dime you for almost everything. The ones that I have discovered are as follows: - $2 / bag for depositing your bags. This applies even if they haven't had your room ready before check in and you want to go walk about without your luggage. - $3 for using the safe in your hotel room (key lock, not digital lock) - $10 / hour for late checkout after 10.00am. In the dead of winter, heating is not available for you to customise in your room. According to the reception, temperatures are kept by central heating at 20 degrees C, but it certainly didn't feel like it in my room. Walls are also paper thin -- could her the noises from the neighbouring rooms and the lift lobby which was outside my room door. I am a seasoned traveller (both for business and leisure), and I have never encountered such skinflints in the hospitality business. (The budget hostels don't count, as they cater for the bare bones traveller)!

I'm very easy to please and can't recall ever making a complaint like this in the past, but Doubletree was flatly dishonest. The NO SMOKING room stunk of smoke, not a little, but a lot. When I stated this to the lady at the front desk, she looked at the computer screen, told me I was wrong, and that they could not move me as the hotel was full. The Free shuttle service within two miles of the hotel that was clearly advertised on their website was flatly refused once I was there. When I referenced their website, they just replied "We only offer that service to the airport." So for each of the four days as I was taking cabs back and forth I walked by a sign at the lobby entrance that stated "We offer shuttle service on demand but make an airport run on the half hour regardless". When I called the front desk stating I needed to be taken to the airport and referenced the sign, the employee at the front desk denied it existed. When I reached the lobby the sign had been removed. Unbelievable. The shuttle did eventually show up, but left basically when the driver finally got around to it, even though I wasn't the only one waiting to go. I could go on, but isn't that enough?

Run down motel The Backs Motor Lodge was a bath/house type of motel located in the heart of the gay part of he city - the management has decided to install gates that prohibit the activity and send the cops when they see you in chaps yb your front - Hey! You're in San Francisco! Hey! There are some other ways to let people know this is not what you want any more...So what's left now? Totally unpleasant employees (at the front desk, checking in on friday arround noon) bathroom clogged, noisy location, noisy gates, doors, etc etc...What was the attraction of this Hotel before has totally disappeared - I will take my business somewhere else and leave this run down motel to whoever wants to stay in the first non gay hotel in the Castro at an expensive price!Enjoy your stay!

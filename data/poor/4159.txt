I was in Chicago for a conference and booked the hotel through the conference's housing commity. 215$/night. The hotel is in a great location. The rooms are very small. couldn't get around the bed without bending out of the way of the flat screen TV mounted on the wall. TV is flat screen but most channels are distorted because it is a 16:9 screen. No movie on demand either. Breakfast was very simple. Very poorly furnished. Only a tiny desk with a simple chair. No couch. Mind you, there wasn't any room for anything else. The worst thing was that the room (#1606) was close to the elevators and the wooshing of the elevators kept waking me up all night long. Very noisy, I heard similar complaints from other guests. When the hotel staff could not find me another room (they said it was all booked, even though I know people were checking out) I checked out and stayed at the sheraton for 220/night. In short, too small and noisy for the price they charge.

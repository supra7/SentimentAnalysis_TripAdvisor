Horrible! Horrible! We stayed here for two nights on the way home from Hawaii. I would have left immediately if I could have. Tiny room. Dirty carpet. Water dripped in the sink all night and the toilet ran. Bargain restaurant attached to the hotel charged $20 for breakfast after a discount. I wouldn't stay here again for free!

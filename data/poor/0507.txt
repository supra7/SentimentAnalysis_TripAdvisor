This hotel is in a great location. There's the one star. The service is very below average at best. From the Expedia reviews, I knew that one of the two elevators were not working in April and May. It is now July and only ONE of two elevators are working. I asked them why did it take over 4 months to fix one elevator and their excuse was that they are "renovating" the "other one". Oh please. They don't even have a sign that ONE elevator is working on any of the floors. It's like they want to hide the fact that it hasn't been working for 1/3 of the year already. One elevator for 20+ floors is ridiculous. You share the elevator with any and all hotel staff and wait 10-20 minutes for it (not knowing why unless you asked since there are no signs or apologies on any elevator!). I think the worst was when BF and I were told that we booked two queen (more like full) beds by the manager, Alicia. She was the worst. She told us to our face that we booked the two queens when we booked the one king bed. I asked her for proof, a print screen, anything that supported her statement that us, a couple, would book two queen beds and instead she told us to call priceline ourselves. She is the worst hotel "manager" I've ever encountered. Her young minion that looked like he was 12 was similar. He told us to go book a hotel elsewhere and good luck finding one on Fourth of July weekend. I will never be staying here and I highly advise that everyone avoid the lack of professionalism and service, hotel management all under the age of 25 and who act like it and one working elevator for 20+ floors. Very rude and obnoxious. The non-apologetic behavior re the elevator and how they screwed us on our reservation was the worst. Avoid at all costs!

no working ac no cold water (boiling water in sink, shower and toilet!!) hugley disappointing experience very average breakfast (and DEFINITELY not worth E15!!) Average location - lots of better options within five minutes walking distance in summary,it is in mayor area, but petit palais descriptor very wide of mark - makes me worry about rest of chain.....

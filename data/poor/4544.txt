This is 2nd time we've tried Adolphus in a year and it's even worse than before. The hotel itself is beautiful, historic, and centrally located but that is where it ends. They still have no organization to valet your car--you wait at least 20 minutes or so in the street before you can pull car in. In our room we find a toothpick wrapper on the table...minutes later we find the toothpick on the floor. Wine was supposed to be delivered upon check-in. Additionally, we had also asked for ice....2 phone calls and an hour later it finally arrives. When we call to get our car, we're told they are not taking phone requests. You have to go down in person to request...and that it would be a 20-30 minute wait before your car would be brought to you. When asked to speak to a manager, can you believe we were told there isn't one on site?...so we were told. Are you kidding me? This during busy time of year, week-end before Christmas! This is same type of thing we experienced before. It's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to stay there...especially given the price you pay! Too bad the service is so bad and they are indifferent. They beauty of the hotel is marred by the lackluster service you receive. You can always go visit the lobby and bar but save your $ and stay elsewhere. This coming from a seasoned traveler whose stayed at many a hotels!

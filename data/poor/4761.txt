Perspective from a very frequent business traveler who is also a member of the highest tier in this hotel chain's frequent stay program. GOOD: The grounds are nicely manicured and the original Frank Lloyd Wright buildings are iconic. Service at The Biltmore Grill is good. Upgraded king room is spacious. BAD: The pathetic service starts upon arrival. The Valet/Bell Desk will not offer to help with your luggage. The Front Desk will give you keys that don't work, causing you to return to get keys that do. It'll be a 5 minute walk to your room in the summer 100+ degree temperatures. The clock radio will be broken. The coffee maker you request (there are none in the room) will be delivered with a used filter and coffee grounds in it. Housekeeping will wake you by banging on your door at 7:00 am and will call twice when you don't answer. The fitness center will start turning off the lights and the TVs 30 minutes before closing (8:30) even though you're working out. You'll be told there are no umbrellas to borrow when the lightning storm comes. Upgraded king room bathroom is shabby and the shower very small. Food at The Biltmore Grill is over priced for the small portions. In room safe is not large enough for a small laptop. RECOMMENDATION: If you want to experience the Arizona Biltmore, just visit for a meal or a drink, but stay at any of the following: Royal Palms, The Phoenician, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, Sanctuary on Camelback, The Boulders, Westin Kierland, Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons Scottsdale.

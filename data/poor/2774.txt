I have stayed at this hotel and had a decent room for the price, This time the room was awful. Very small (Stress very) old, chipped paint, bathroom was barely big enough for one, hot water took forever and the air conditioning made alot of noise. This time we got the hotel through hotwire, perhaps that was the reason they gave us such a horrific room. The entrance and bar very retro and cool but it is a real gamble to book a room here.

The first room they gave me was very dirty, the carpet was full of brown stains, the bed's duvet cover was in terrible state the bathroom floor also full of stains and the smell of the room was nasty. So I went back to the front desk and ask for a refund so I could be on my way and go to a decent hotel, the manager came out, apologized for the inconvenient and ask me not to leave the he could show me another room, this time one in decent conditions, I was tired so I went to take a look at this new room but it was like if they would've take me to the exact room they gave me the first time. I end up leaving to another hotel.

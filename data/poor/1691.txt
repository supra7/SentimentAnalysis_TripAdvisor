My wife and I have stayed at this Laquinta now an then for the past four years as we liked the staff and management up until about 6 months ago. We travel, more on business than leisure and many times, stayed more than 4 days at this location. The cleanliness up until this year was usually sub-par or lousy, but they had really good management to help make up for it. Now days, it seems they just don't care about it, we arrived, immediately were disgusted by the room and changed rooms only to find the same problems. Filthy bathroom, mildew still in the tub, q-tips on the floor complete with the wax. The AIR CONDITIONER with a FILTER that probably has never been changed. There was stuff spilled all over the refrigerator, and it still had some cheap beer in it which indicated it had not been cleaned for awhile. Since we were tired from the trip, we gave up and cleaned the mess the best we could, the air filter especially because of breathing problems. The filter was CAKED with dirt. When my wife cleaned it, it literally fell apart because it was so old. We got the usual "Maintenance does not work Friday night or weekend so just change rooms. What for? Same issue! This is all the manager would say, plus he just stated that they have never had a complaint about the air filters. Oh yes, plenty of Dog Hair in them too, we refused to walk barefoot on the carpet. We love pets and it is nice they accept them, but what about being HUMAN friendly? Black Listed this hotel from now on. Terrible management and the cleanliness is atrocious. I wouldn't stay there for free.

We had a weeks stay booked through the internet with deposit paid. When we arrived with all seven of us, we were refused a room with new news that they have a fire policy that they only hold up to maxium six guests,when we booked on line four kids and three adults it didn't print up four kids because my son is only one year old who is concidered free,so we had no where to stay,with four children who were ready to go to the beach, my son needed a breathing treatment because he has asthma and the women behind the counter where ingnorant and pretty much said sorry we can't accomidate you in any way. We waited an hour for a manager who gave us back our deposit and called another hotel four blocks away, not oceanfront......which we had. So if your concidering......I wouldn't give them the satisfaction and find a better place.We were unaware of this policy because there was no where stating this fact online,which is pretty dumb.

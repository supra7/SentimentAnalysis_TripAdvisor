I live in San Diego a mere mile down the street from this hotel. I was forced to stay here by my landlord because our building was being tented for termites. Thank goodness I didn't pay for this room or I would have been extremely pissed! I was on the bottom floor on the very end of the hotel (room 101) conveniently located next to the dumpster. The flies from the trash attempted to follow me into the room which let off a musky smell. The comforter had blood stains, and other large yellow circular stains all over it (not to mention the cigarette burn holes in the comforter in our NON smoking room). There is no air conditioner but they do provide a large standing fan which works well to blast air around the tiny room. Not using the disgusting comforter, and needing to use the fan because it is the middle of summer, I had no sleep because I was in a constant temperature fluctuation battle. The bed was super hard and no better than sleeping on the ground. My body hurt the next day from being so stiff. The bathroom was old and the shower dingy with some type of rust casing the bottom of our shower. The bathroom window also provided a nice view of the Burger King across the street. I could hear the person in the room next to our snoring, as well as the sounds of the bar across the street bumping the music well into the night. I am young and go to the bar across the street as a regular, but I am really glad I don't live next to that noise; it was a traumatic experience, which I hope never to relive. My landlord gave me an apology gift certificate for a restaurant because he felt so bad.

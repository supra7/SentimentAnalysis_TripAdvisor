In October of this year we decided to take a trip to the Shops at The Grand Wailea. The personnel at the valet parking area were rude and obnoxious. Not only that, they seemed to take pride in their rude behavior by congratulating each other on their performances as we departed. I wouldn't stay at this hotel or revisit it ever again.

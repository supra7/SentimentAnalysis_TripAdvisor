I want to shout it out for all the world to hear (but I still won't get my money back) - DON'T go to the LUAU at the MAUI PRINCE. I surfed the web before our trip to Hawaii, and every where you see that the luau at Lahaina is the best, but I found some compelling reviews for the Maui Prince (and since we were staying south, we chose that one) that were completely unfounded. Yes, the fire dance is kind of cool, but this luau is $75. The food is like (but not even as good as) the Old Country Buffet. The pre-show is the worst kind of cheesy. The actual dancing was okay but the setting ruins the experience. Big round tables on a grassy lawn (not on the beach); you're seated with complete strangers - not of your choosing. Even with the dancers, a few were good and a few were bad. We thought about asking for our money back 5 minutes into it, but tried to make the best of it - as you can tell, it didn't work. We can't get our money back now, but if we save 3 people from a ruined night in Maui, it will make us feel better!

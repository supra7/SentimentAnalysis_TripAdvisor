I have stayed at all of the best hotels in Vegas, and this was a disappointing, disgraceful experience. Steve Wynn should be embarrassed and the health inspector should be called. 1) In a four-night stay, housekeeping failed to come to our room on two occasions. We were out many hours during the dayduring normal hours that we'd expect a maid to show upand they never came. Even after we called and specifically asked that housekeeping come, they didn't bother to show! I have had better service at a Motel 6. 2) And when housekeeping did actually show up, they left an OPEN, USED BOTTLE OF WATER, "Compliments of Encore" on the table (next to a brand new bottle). The seal of the bottle had been opened and at least 1 inch of water had been consumed by a prior guest! This was NOT our bottle from the prior night; we finished those. The implications of this are unspeakable. I shudder to think about what other things Encore may be re-using to save money. 3) Many things were missing from our minibar when we got to the room. I was concerned that we would be charged. I called the front desk to ensure that we were not charged. They said that housekeepking would come up and re-fill the minibar. I said, fine, but that we would be leaving in an hour and asked if they could come back at that time. The front desk told me to call back in an hour. Not a huge deal, but why should I have to waste my time calling back? Also, to add insult to injury, for the rest of our stay, the minibar was never replenished (although I did specifically go to the front desk to tell them they could go up and to confirm that we were not being charged). 4) During our stay, we had countless problems with Internet access. Wifi never worked, and we spent at least 90 minutes trying to get it working. 5) They couldn't get our newspaper preferences right, even after we asked several times. Again, not a huge deal, but is it really that difficult?

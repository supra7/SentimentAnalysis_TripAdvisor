The lobby definitely gave a misleading impression. It was clean, even had computers to print boarding passes. But once in the room it was all downhill! I went to wash my hands and the water came out yellow/brown! It just felt dirty in there. And it took fifteen minutes for warm water. I would never stay in a motel 6 again. On the bright side, the housekeeping was friendly and it was close to the Strip.

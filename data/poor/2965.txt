We stayed here end of November for three nights over Thanksgiving. We had read mixed reviews about the W, but decided to try our luck. We were sorely disappointed and regret the decision hugely. Our room was hardly big enough to swing a small cat. Common in New York I know, but when you can't get to the bathroom because your luggage is taking up the entire floor space, due to the lack of storage, then it really does become tiresome. Most of the 'Terrible' reviews cover many of the points that we also experienced but there was something else that we weren't fully prepared for. On check out we decided to leave our bags for the duration of the day to collect in the evening. There was one luggage guy covering a 20 deep queue. During our lengthy wait, we observed the luggage guy swearing at guests behind their backs as they deposited their bags with him. This was done numerous times once guests went to leave. No strangers to the States we know the tipping culture, however, when we went to leave our bags, the same guy would not give us our luggage tickets until we handed over cash. He actually held on to the tickets and we grappled with him to retrieve them. Incidentally, we didn't tip him due to his threatening nature and felt for the rest of the day that he was torching our bags! We reported the incident to the manager and he said, "We can't touch them due to their Union". So again, ineffective staff as described by other travellers and having stumped up a large amount of cash it left a really bad taste at the end of largely noisy, rude and cramped stay.

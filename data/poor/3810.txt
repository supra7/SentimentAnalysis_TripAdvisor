Poor Choice Only one member of the evening staff was helpful, the others acted as if we were a nusiance. While we didn't expect a whole lot for the low price, this hotel was way below par! I have stayed in many low priced hotels in Honolulu but their quality was substantially better. This hotel doesn't even provide the simple amenities such as coffee, soap, etc. on a daily basis. We didn't even get clean towels every day (they did take the dirty ones). The small air conditioner sounded like a Mack Truck every time it cycled on. This is the first time I've slept on a single bed in more than 40 years, talk about uncomfortable. We only stayed there for 3 days of our time!This hotel is way past the need for renovation. The kitchen area was jury rigged and unfinished, the sink wasn't even functional. The enterance light switch was not functional either.Hawai'i was beautiful, this hotel was not!

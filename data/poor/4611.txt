We arrived for our weekend stay to find ourselves, and several other customers with reservations waiting in the lobby without rooms as the hotel was oversold. Worse than the oversold situation was the front desk staff - manager was unable to deal with customers, front desk staff were surly and rude. After staying in a Hampton Inn 20 mins away for the first night, we got our room, both were in an annex building - one (942) was next to the elevator and ice machine and was noisy the entire night.

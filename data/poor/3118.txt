Straight or Gay, Stay Away Contrary to all the reviews that I read, I had no significant problems with the front office staff. Trying to get the maid to provide me with a fan was an immense linguistic difficulty which fortunately came to an end by pointing to a fan in another room and then pointing to myself. The rooms were smelly, the towel bar broken and the lamps not working. The fridge was not working either and had a terrible smell. The ugly gates recently installed have kept the cruising to a minimal. In fact cruising was for many guests one of the main reasons that they stayed at Beck's, now that last motive is gone. The noise eminating from market street was horrible, I woke up each time a street car passed by and virtually had no sleep all night long. Straight or gay, stay away.

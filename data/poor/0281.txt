The room price was OK for Seattle. It was the first hotel that I ever stayed that had NO pictuers hanging in the rooms or in the halls. There was a draft under the door as it was an inch off the floor & was very noisy when in the room, poor water pressure & the fellow at the front desk was not very courteous upon check-in.. My thought is that this is a place to hang your hat & not to expect very much more..

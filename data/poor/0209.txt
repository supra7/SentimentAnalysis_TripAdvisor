You take a large gamble when you book a room here. Either you will face the busy freeway or you will get lucky and have a quieter room. My first room had two double beds. I had booked a King, so I called for an adjustment. I was re-booked into a King Suite that sat right next to the freeway on the 6th floor. LUCKY ME! I'm exhausted, and now I get to hear the highway traffic all night long. There are wonderful hotel choices in Seattle. Why stay here?!? There are also no restaurants next door that are open past 9 PM on a weekday. I mean, shoot, this is a metropolitan downtown -- any other decent hotel in Seattle will have lots of choices withing walking distance including the Grand Hyatt, where I stayed last time. P.s. The Grand Hyatt has better bathroom amenities and a steam room in their complimentary fitness center. Again, WHY STAY HERE? ! you have a lot of better options

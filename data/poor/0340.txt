Booked direct with hotel. Prepaid for rooms and stood on two seperate occasions. First time they overbooked and sent our family of seven,3 children,2 seniors,2adults to another hotel at 2 in the morning. It was a partying hotel with vomit in the elevators and lots of drunks everywhere. Very scary for children and old seniors. Next stay, checked in at 5 and our rooms were not ready till after 10 that night waited around with the kids and grandparents . Requested two doubles in each of the two rooms did not get it. 7 of us, figure that. . .

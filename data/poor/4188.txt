Had a billing problem. Called Accounts Receivable to dispute charge. Was not called back. Called again and explained that I did not sign for a charge that was on my bill. Was told they would look into it. Was told I signed for the charge as the waitress was a witness to it.. A total lie! Told them to check their security tapes. Called to speak to general manager about my problem. Left message with one of his assistants. Never got a call back. As a SPG, very disappointing! Not the type of treatment I expect from a Sheraton.

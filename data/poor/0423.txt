1st off I called several weeks in advance for the reservation and price with room, pet fee, and taxes got a total of $144.36. Wife called a week later to double check the rate and was given the exact same rate. We arrived and went to check in the young man charged us the exact rate we were told WITH pet as well. Then the haji old man Indian came running after us asking for more pet fee. When I said we have 2 quotes at this price and your employee charged us the same price as quoted, he stated (in terrible broken engrish) "no no, that can't be the rooms start at $149 so no way you owe me more" (rooms are $109!) Being we had drove from Portland for a concert and all the rooms were booked nearby I reluctantly HAD to pay another $25 Then we got to our chithole of a room with the overwhelming stench of mothballs and carpet fresh trying to cover whatever god awful oder was there before. I could hardly breath and had to go get a fan and put in the window to air the room out! Dont' waste you time or money on this dump and chitty managment!

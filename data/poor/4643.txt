This place looks nothing like they make it look online. It is loud, feels and looks dirty, and the water pressure in the shower is terrible! Do not use body wash it will take you an hour to wash it of! The free breakfast they offer is a choice between a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice. Did I mention it smells like old people and kind of like a sketchy night club. All the homeless people smelled way better. So with all of that said I must also add that for what it is it is way overpriced $268 for two nights for a king size bed with rats under it is way overpriced. I think I'll go sleep in the park a few blocks away instead of this place.

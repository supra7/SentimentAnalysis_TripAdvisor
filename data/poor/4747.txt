The grounds of this resort are spectacular. In fact, if you wanted to camp outside all night, this would be an unbelievable choice. However, the condition of the rooms and the service are horrible. Our room had only three sets of towels for four people, one of the sinks did not drain, and the shower did not drain. You ask yourself that at a five star hotel, what systems do they have in place where these issues are missed. Did the cleaning service really clean the rooms with stopped up sinks and shower and never notify anyone or did they just not clean the rooms? They never asked us if we wanted a bellhop to carry our bags to the journey to our rooms. This is not good service even for a motel 8. The meal at Frank's was also disappointing; the service was great. They clearly had no systems in place. People were complaining about not having their drinks served with the answer that we were really busy (it was Valentine's Weekend); meals were clearly being left under the heat lamps without being served on time. My fish dinner was returned. It was the first time that I actually had to use a knife to cut into the fish as the heat lamp stonified my fish. If I were the chef I would be yelling. The substitute hamburger was like a hockey puck; again ordered medium and the victim of the heat lamps. If you must see this place, then just go have a drink at night outside and enjoy the grounds. But stay elsewhere.

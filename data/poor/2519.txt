Don't waste your money I recently stayed with a group so we had many rooms at the hotel. Our room had no Alarm clock, refrigerator, half the channels on the TV didn't come in,the shower worked awful,the door stuck BAD. A couple of my co workers rooms smelled. A couple rooms had Cockroaches and to top it off I got stuck in the elevator. I don't suggest this hotel, Saving money is one thing, but if you have to stay here you'd be better off at home.

The location of this hotel is great but unfortunately it's the only thing that was positive about my stay there. The first room we were given had two stand-up showers but the floors in the showers were so disgusting that I would not have taken of my shoes to shower. We were given a second room - the air conditioning was broken and it was a mere 94 degrees outside. We were finally given a third room but with only one bed when we need two. It's not worth the price you pay.

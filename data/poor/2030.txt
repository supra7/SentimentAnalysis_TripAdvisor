We spent one night at this hotel and fled. We arrived on a late flight into Istanbul and arrived at the hotel after midnight and extremely tired. The staff was friendly but the room was hell. Instead of a window, we for nd a large steel firedoor behind a curtain. The toilet wasn't bolted down to the floor, so the seal didn't hold and dirty water would run out onto the bath room floor whenever we flushed. The drain in the all-in-one shower didn't work well so the water level would quickly rise over the half centimeter door sill and flow into the bedroom. Had we not been so tired,we would have checked out immediately, but hung on for a night. As soon as the sun rose I ran to the Erboy hotel and secured a new room there.

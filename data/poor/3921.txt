In short, this hotel was not tolerable. Our room was not cleaned until late each evening. We were forced to hang clean clothes outside (even clothes we had not yet worn on the trip) because the humidity in the room was so bad. Couldn't get away from the stale smell and overall dampness. Our neigbors could be heard snoring through the walls at night. The staff was not particularly friendly. The pool area and beach were overoccupied, especially with locals. (The hotel allows non-guests to use the resort). I felt uncomfortable with the staff. No one seemed to care about making us feel welcome. My husband and I actually left after two nights and stayed elsewhere for the remainder of our trip. Needless to say, the Sheraton would not refund our money for the days we had payed for in advance.

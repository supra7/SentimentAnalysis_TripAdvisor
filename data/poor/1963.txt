We thought we had selected a great value in Boston for our trip and we arrived at the hotel with no service help and the rooms were dated, drafty, cold and over the top prices on the menus. Traveling all over the world this had to be the worst trip to the US with over twenty trips here in the last few years. Our accomodations were dirty and small and we had asked for a Deluxe room and payed for it. The staff said nothing could be done that we had booked on the internet, informed no refund could be given. The staff was not polite and we didnt complain enough as they didnt even feel concerned. Cheers and good luck checking in to this hotel. We will not return but will try another lodging option before we book a vacation to Boston. Reading the ledger of experience we agree the hotel is horrible. Only thing good was it was close to Boston Commom but we realized there are other hotels right nearby like Parker House and Holiday Inn too.

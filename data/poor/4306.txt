We stayed at Harrah's 3/31-4/7/07 It was a LONG week. It was so crowded and smoke filled. The noise level was so high at night with allthe slots we went to bed each night with a headache. Was told room would have a coffee pot but they dont have enough to go around, Would a $10. pot put them back much?? The buffett was not worth the long wait or the high price. All I got for my comp, for spending over $2,000. was $12.00 of a meal. I will be going back to MGM much better there. One more thing we rented a car to go to grand canyon skywalk, The Grand canyon is a must see BUT dont spend $25.00 to walk on the skywalk. A really big disappointment. They wont allow cameras on walk, they will take your picture for $15. A really big rip off. If going to las vegas I hope your time and money spent is not at Harrah's.

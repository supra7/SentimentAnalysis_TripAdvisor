My company booked 5 of us here through Priceline - granted I don't know what they paid per room - but the rooms are tiny, uninspired in design (which can make up for small), there was no tub, just a shower. In addition, the supposedly work-friendly desk was so tiny that it barely held a computer and the closet - well the closet isn't a closet - it's an alcove with a drape with room for 6 hangars all crushed together.

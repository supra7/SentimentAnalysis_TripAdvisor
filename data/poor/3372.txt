I'll get right to the point. I, we were very unsatisfied and will never go back again, Went there for our 30 year wedding anniversery and it was the worst ever. Checked in like we were supposed to, took the elevator upstairs and the room was terrible. The room was not clean, the bed looked like it was just thrown togther and the ceiling which was once white seemed to be stained or had fungus growing everywhere. We have stayed in beachside hotels in many countries as well as California and I have to say this hotel didn't rate anywhere close to the others. Even though we paid what we did for the room we decided to check out two hours later and return back to Virginia the same day. What an anniversery. I made it up to her the next day with two dzen roses, a nice dinner in Washington DC and a request for another 30 years. I'd think twice about staying if I were anyone else who has never been there.

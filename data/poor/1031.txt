I have never experience such horrible breakfast hard cold bagels and donuts for breakfast and out dated yogart (STAYED JAN1 DATED DEC 15&18). my children asked why are those homeless people putting all that food in their bag. I was so uncomfortable and concerned for the other guest because the host never acknowledge them due to him eating and making calls. He never used gloves with open cuts on his hand. The stale food was left in the dunkin donut box for guest to fend for w/o any tongues.(UNSANITARY). the 1 DINOSAURS coffee pot and the other that did not work was very confusing. the area was never clean prior to my famiy coming or during us leaving. The room had NOOOOO HOT WATER or HEAT.. THIS WAS THE WORST WAY TO BRING IN THE NEW YEAR. I WILL BE CONTACTING THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND CHOICE HOTELS. PLEASE DO NOT EVER STAY AT THE DUNKIN DONUT INN AKA RODEWAY INN HOTEL!

i thought we were booking a five star hotel, but only feeling this is one star place. to start off, they never told you that there is a daily $20 resort fee to cover what a hotel suppose to offer (Pool, Fitness Center, Coffee and etc). And the hotel claim they will drop and pick up hotel guests off the Vegas strip and Ceasar Forum Shop. Well, the catch is, the drop off and pick up from Ceasar Forum shop is only every hour, not to mention finding the pick up spot from Ceasar forum shop is more complicated and impossible than anyone can imagine. I believe this is part of their scam in not making it accessible for hotel guests. What can I say, the hotel itself is nice, except it is located in the middle of nowhere, if you want to do anything, be ready to leave the hotel. Oh did I mention the television did not work in our room, we called the operator, it took them more than 30 minutes to get here. TRUMP NEVER AGAIN. Save your money go elsewhere.

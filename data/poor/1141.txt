We stay in London every month and always in the Euston area. This was one of the few hotels we hadnt stayed in. Facts of our stay below: No information provided at checkin- just "do you want the breakfast or not?" (not exactly a good sell) The room wasnt clean, dusty and long hairs in the bathroom. For 100 per night we had to manage with one towel and no soap or showergel of any kind. nothing! The bed was the most uncomfortable id slept on in years. we could feel the springs digging in all night. I was under the impression that Travelodge were similar in standard to Premier Inn (being similar prices) This is not what we found at all. Unless you get this VERY cheap or think a hotel is "just a place to sleep"- do yourself a favour and try the two nearby premier inns or the Novotel

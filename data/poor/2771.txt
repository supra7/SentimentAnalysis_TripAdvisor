I don't have much good to say about this hotel. The check-in was a mini drama session with one staff pregnant staff person who was so focused on her taking time off that we were obviously NOT her priority. The 2 elevators are sloooowwww. The room is tiny and worn. The mattresses were yellow. The TV volume was erratic, sometimes too loud, sometimes too soft. There was no dresser. You have a tiny closet with 10 hangers to store your clothes. The bathroom was just as tiny. The shower temp was hot and hotter. The toilet handle would stick and the water would run unless you unstuck it. The exhaust fan barely works but made plenty of noise. There was mildew in the caulk around the shower and the sink. They advertise turn down service, but there was none. They never came to clean the room or change the towels. The restaurant downstairs was condemned by the health department. Internet was not free. But my stay was free, so I shouldn't complain, right? Next time I'm going back to the Westin on 42nd.

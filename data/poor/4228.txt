A simple request for a rubber bath mat and coffee for the coffee maker went unanswered for three of my five day stay. Not only did I ask the housekeeper in person as I left the room, I left a note both in the bathroom AND with the $2 tip I left on the nightstand. She was able to find the $2 tip, but there was no coffee and not bath mat. Housekeeping did respond with a phone call to them when I got up to my room, but there was no coffee left only on the one day that the "regular" had off. I'm not sure why the simple stuff if being neglected when those are the most annoying things that tick off those who stay in hotels. I hope Harrah's improves their housekeeping services by the next time I stay there. There are way too many other choices for hotels in Las Vegas.

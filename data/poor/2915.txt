I stayed at this hotel in March 2007. It is by far one of the worst 4/5 star hotels I have stayed in. The staff is terrible. Now, the W hotels are renowned for stylish lobby's, bars, restaurants BUT cramped rooms and uncourteous staff but this was just terrible. Take it from someone who stays in a hotel 4 days a week and spend your money elsewhere. Pros: - Nice lobby - Good hotel bar (adjacent to the hotel) - Good fitness center Cons - Rooms are terrible, some are smelly and noisy (air vents) - Staff is absolutely uninterested in catering to your needs I was going to be staying there for 11 nights. When I checked in, I was given one of the most congested and cramped rooms I have ever stayed in. It was hard getting my bags through the door. I immediately requested to be changed to another room. Now, given the fact that I have the highest tier on their Starwood loyalty program I thought the staff would be accomodating but no such luck. They reluctantly agreed to change my room. The new room was bigger, but smelt like poop, had a wet carpet spot and made noise all night long. I called and spoke to them again and mentioned that I would be moving out the very next day. Instead of addressing the problem, I was told that they had to check if I would pay penalties for early checkout. At this point, I had had enough and spoke to the manager. Although he did apologize, I thought he would try and do more especially given that I travel to NYC every week, 4 days a week and given my tier on the Starwood loyalty program. But no such luck !! So, I took my luggage the next morning and checked in at The Marriott across the street. The lobby is very basic but I was immediately upgraded to their Executive floor (large rooms, free breakfast, soft drinks, appetizers, snacks, desserts, private concierge). The fitness center is also nice. W - SUCKS !!

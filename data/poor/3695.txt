A Royal Pain! I'll never stay here again!I had used a room upgrade coupon to make the booking, but needn't have bothered... the room I got (after a fairly unfriendly check-in!) seemed to be more of a DOWNGRADE than an upgrade. I compained at the front desk after 2 days, but they seemed totally uninterested in my comments or complaint.I was on a business trip and needed to look my best for the various meetings, but was surprised and disappointed to learn that the room did not have a hairdryer. I had to call three times to get a hairdryer delivered to the room and eventually had waited over two hours for that item before it arrived..The entire hotel looked dated and (in places) decrepit! The staff were less than helpful and not knowledgeable about local attractions any distance outside of Honolulu.Food and service were below average - hence add overpriced to my list of complaints!

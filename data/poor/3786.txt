Not what it's cracked up to be My husband planned our trip to Waikiki and was given a travel magazine showing the Beachcomber as a 4-star hotel - he booked a non-smoking, full-ocean view room. We arrived and were given a smoking, partial-ocean view room. Upon a visit to the front desk, we were moved to the proper room-type two days later. While clean, it was worn down, the bedding had holes in it, and the vents pumped air that made the room smell either like smoke or food. In fact, we were told the hotel isn't even rated. That said, the location is fabulous if you just want a place to rest your head.

Yuck! What a dump! Dirty, filthy and smelly halls and rooms. They had a security guard patrolling the hotel, which did not give me a warm fuzzy about my safety. Very basic and boring rooms. I couldn't handle staying there. They did have high speed wireless internet and, in all fairness, they are renovating: Perhaps it will be much nicer in a few months.

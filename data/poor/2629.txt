I've stayed at Marriots before and had top-notch service, but this was one of my worst hotel experience ever. I left a message for the hotel to allow my sister, who would be arriving from San Francisco 3 hours before I would be checking in, to be able to check-in and get access to my prepaid room. The message was never given. She in turn left a message at the front desk to let me know she was in the hotel restaurant waiting for me. The message was never given. I checked-in and got settled in my room. My sister does not have a cell phone in case you're wondering. I decided to go to the restaurant and eat, but wanted to leave a message at the front desk for when she arrived. I was told a paper message would be thrown away and given the impression that a message would be ineffective. Obviously this JW Marriot has inefficiency issues with messages. The list goes on: a rude and discourteous valet, had to call for housekeeping at 3:30 in the afternoon because the room hadn't been cleaned, had to call for toilet paper, short-circuited iron, short-handed bar staff, took 30 minutes to get my car out of valet at check-out. New Orleans was great, but the stay at this JW made the trip a disappointment.

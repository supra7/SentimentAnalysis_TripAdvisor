We have come to expect better of Hilton Hotels. We had a backed up sink in our room, and after the third day of requesting that it be fixed, we gave up asking and just lived with it. :( MMiller1000, we also were on the 14th floor with a non-functional ice machine and had no response from staff to our requests to fix it. There was a cheerleader competition at the convention center and many of the cheerleader groups stayed in the Hilton. Hotel security did little or nothing about maintaining control over the loud and noisy groups. I am talking about people RUNNING up and down the hallways and shouting back and forth from room to room at 3AM. We did enjoy the view of Camden Yards from our room. The staff, other than the young woman at the front desk when we checked in late Thursday/early Friday, gave the impression that we were disturbing them whenever we had a question. We had a very early flight on Monday morning and requested a wake-up call for 3AM. That call came in at 3:45. We would have set the alarm clock provided by the hotel, but it did not work. I suppose it could have worked if someone had responded to our requests to get it operating. On the other hand, Tommy, one of the bellmen, went above and beyond to help us make our travel connections. Light bulbs were burned out in the bathroom and in some lamps, but again, nothing was done to replace them. The breakfast in the Executive Lounge was way below the quality we have come to expect from other Hiltons. There was nothing except milk with protein in it, very bad for diabetics. I guess the erratic functioning of our room key to operate the elevator and get us to the Executive Lounge was a blessing in disguise, or a warning. Too bad we did not heed that "warning" and go elsewhere for breakfast. The view of Camden Yards from our room was way cool! But otherwise, we'd suggest staying elsewhere.

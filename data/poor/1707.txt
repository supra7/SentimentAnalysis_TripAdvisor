Weather was great. Loved daytona but would never stay at this place again The pool was closed as was the restaurant and bar. Construction going on in lobby and roof. Place was almost empty and now we know why. Sheets clean but blanket dirty. Front desk closed at 7 and no assistance after that, Very poorly run business

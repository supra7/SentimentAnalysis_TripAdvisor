We made an internet reservation for a Friday, then rang an hour later to add Thursday to the booking. On Thursday, we rang to let them know we'd be arriving late, they said "no problem". We arrive at 10.30pm to hear: "Oh, we don't have your booking for tonight. We don't have a room for you." Total apathy, not concerned at all. Says a few sorrys, looks at the reservation book, more sorrys, more apathy. Finally says, "There's a B&B next door" then calls someone in authority, hangs up and says sorry several more times. Incompetence all around from management to employees. Completely soured our trip. STAY AWAY!

Not really what I expected. First , I booked for 3 nights Thue thru Sat night. There was a problem at BWI Airport and I was running late. I called the Commander to tell them I was running late and that i would be arriving late Thur P M or early Fri A M.. When I arrived Fri , they had cancelled my room. They gave me another room that was ocean front like I wanted but on the 2nd floor not the top floor that I had requested. The key cards did not work all the time, so I had to return to the front desk for them to reprogram the key cards. My big complaint was the parking, Not enough of it. I had to park 2 blocks away crossing Coastal Hwy into an unguarded lot! For $300. plus a night I think I would be able to park at hotel lot under the two buildings. Never again at the Commander. I was not the only one complaining about the parking. Every time I pasted the front desk, someone was there complaining about the parking.

Our group was booked into the 6th Ave Inn by another hotel that had overbooked. The folks on the desk were wonderful -- helped us into non-smoking rooms when all were full, no hassels at all with the transfered booking. My first night I awoke to water pouring through the ceiling in my bathroom. The night clerk wasn't alarmed -- apparently this happens when another guest showers on a floor above. My complaints the next day were waved off until I insisted on a maintenance person coming up to inspect the staining and bubbling of paint in my bathroom. Bedding was poor -- the sheets on my queen-sized bed were for a twin? In any case, the sheets could not be tucked in top and bottom. If you stay, insist on a room on the east end of the hotel (numbers under about x20.) Those on the west end had NO HOT WATER.

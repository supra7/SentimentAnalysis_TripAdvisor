Upon arrival the first thing we noticed was the smell & the filthy carpets & this was in the lobby ! The room was minuscule with 2 beds squeezed into a space only big enough for one . My wife was horrified at the condition of this supposedly 3.5 * star accommodation . I wouldn't let my dog sleep in this dump . We felt it was neccessary to wipe our feet on the way out of the door . There is a lovely view of the local power station on the corner . You will need a pack mule to get to civilization ! Don't bother staying here uless you like wallowing in filth in 3rd rate accommodation .

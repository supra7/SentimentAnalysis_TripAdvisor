If you're an honest, hard-working person who doesn't want to be hassled, don't even think of staying here. They put a DENVER BOOT on my car for no good reason (their parking system) I almost missed an important meeting because of it. I returned the following day for an explanation and an apology, the general manager was insulting, rude and dismissive Actually, it's the worst display of Customer service I've seen in my life, and this guy is a supposed VP!!!!. There are PLENTY of other hotels in the same neighborhood like the Courtyard Marriott, L'Appartement, the Holiday Inn, the Sofitel and Hotel Opus. Do yourself a favor and choose anything but the Hilton Garden Inn downtown Montreal!!!

When my partner and I go on vacations, we select 5 star hotels during our trips. This hotel had great reviews, but we had a very bad experience there. As soon as we were there registering, we felt unwelcome, as the staff could not believe that two guys were sharing a room with a king bed. After asking us initially, they went to a corner and murmurs to another staff member. Then came back and asked to clarify. And we were speaking in Spanish! - same language! We felt unwelcome by the staff and the hotel guests as well. It was quite sad that when we were walking around the hotel together, no one greeted us. No one looked at us in the eye. Whenever we were by ourselves, we received "Good mornings", "Hello sir" and tons of other salutations thoughout our stroll at the hotel.. Diners were awful as well. One night, a waiter went around each table giving out a rose for each couple. When he got to our table, he looked at us, had a look of shock in his face, turned around and continued delivering the roses to the other tables. That was really sad. The only good thing about that night was that the chef sent us a special dessert, so at least they tried to make up for that bad experience. It was a very nice hotel in general. Beautiful place, great good, beautiful rooms, amazing beach. But if you are going with your same sex partner, it will be a sad and uncomfortable experience. We were even pointed at with index fingers by several guests through our whole stay. It was a terrible experience we had never had at a hotel of this class.. We felt umwelcomed from day one. Definitively wouldn't recommend it for gay couples. I still have a bad taste from that place.

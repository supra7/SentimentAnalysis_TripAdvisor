We stayed at this hotel overnight. It is in a great location. However, the person at the front desk was watching TV with the full volume up the entire night & disregarded our request to lower the volume. We did not sleep one minute and felt very unsafe. There are no elevators and lots of stairs. I suggest you think twice before staying at this hotel.

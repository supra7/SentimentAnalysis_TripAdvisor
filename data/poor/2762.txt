This hotel was bad from moment one. I arrived at 1pm and was told my room wasn't ready. They said they'd call when it was. I never got a call. I returned to the hotel at 10pm (after a day of meetings) and my room was ready. When I got to my room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. I called to the front desk for another room and they told me none were available (technically, they told me none were available and to call back in an hour (11PM), as some might be available then. Sure, I'm going to stay up all night hoping for another room. As someone who was explicit about needing a non-smoking room due to allergies, it didn't mean much. Also, like a number of other reviews mentioned, the bathrooms are vile. Mold everywhere and on every white surface. It's disgusting. Overall, this has been a terrible experience...the worst I've had in NYC (and I'm here a lot). There are thousands of hotels in Manhattan and there's no reason to select this one. Move along to ANYTHING different.

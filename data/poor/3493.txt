14/03/09 I booked my mother and myself a 5 night stay in what I presumed from the brochure "a nice hotel" I have never been to New York before and I asked the travel agent to locate me a good hotel close to central park, times square and all local sights, I informed them of my mothers ill-health, and I asked if their was lifts in the hotel and I was told there was- and this is what they gave me? Yes its close to Central Park but its too far for my sick mother to walk anywhere!!! Its a dangerous area and the hotel doesnt even have security on reception at night. After arriving from Ireland we were both looking forward to a great trip but being held in immigration for over 5 hrs and not receiving any food plus we had both our visas approved through the esta site.!!! ( my mother is a DIABETIC) and now we are both knackered and just want rest but nooo. We eventually get to the hotel and get checked in, head for something to eat and then bed. But we had partying in the rooms beside us and they continued playing loud music and fighting into the wee small hours, I finally began to get some sleep at 06.10 am this morning...... this place is just a joke. My 61 year old mother hates this place and we've just arrived. STAY WELL AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL AND THIS AREA. This supposed hotel is just like a hostel, we haven't been informed of any amenities this hotel may have, but we aint going to be at the hotel much throughout the day - its only a bed for the night.

I booked this "hotel" for a special guest we had at our company. The location was great, and it seemed like a good deal. However, this is not a hotel, it's a condo. The guest arrived at 9pm and there was no service at the front desk, her room had no curtains, and the bed had no linens. There is no service at all, no one cleans. Unless you don't care and all you want is a cheap place in a good location I would never stay here. Certainly, this place does not conform to the 3.5 star rating it has, I would give it 2 stars at most!

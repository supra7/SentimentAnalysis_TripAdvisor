Seriously, unless you are an 18 year old on springbreak with an alcohol level of 0.99%, do not stay here. The place is filthy. The first night I was placed in room #106, a small hovel near the generator that sounded like heavy construction was underway. The dirty, moldy shower backed up 3 inches of dirty water, I had to stand on the ledge and shower in order to not stand in it. The toilet didn't flush, the closet had a small panel that had fallen off which exposed a bug filled inner walling area of some sort that I was afraid rats could come out of, the rug was filthy and tattered, the corners were filled with dust and filth, the walls were paper thin, I heard my (unfortunate) neighbors as if we were in the same room. When I offered my complaint to the head guy at the desk, he had a hissy fit and told me he could not fix it until the next day. Told me I was the first ever to complain about the noise. I was "upgraded" to a better room #225 the next day, but that too had filthy, tattered carpet. The entire hallway smelled of urine and smoke. The first day in that room I had no toilet paper and waited 3 hours and multiple calls to get it.The toilet had poop stains and when I asked the maid to clean it, she did so with no gloves!! Man, I could go on and on but I won't. I would rather forget this part on my three night trip to NOLA. I have no comparison to other hotels in the area, but I paid $101 per night, and there has to be something better than this dive! Positives: It is right in the heart of the French Quarter, but so is the sidewalk, and frankly, that's about on par with this hotel.

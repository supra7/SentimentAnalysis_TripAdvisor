We stayed there for 2 days in March. The wall paper was coming off the walls, paint was terrible, The carpets were so dirty we wore our shoes in the room. The windows and door glass had not been cleaned for some time. I've stayed in some cheep and bad hotels but this tops them all and it was NOT cheep at $200 per night for our bill. We have stayed at other Aston hotels and I certainly hope the other properties don't fall to this disrepair. This place is a discrace to the Aston name.

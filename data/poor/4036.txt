I thought this was a pretty nice place, until the itching started the day I left (stayed Thurs. through Saturday night at the end of May 2009 in a double room on the 10th floor). It got progressively worse for several days. I called the hotel to let them know, and after sitting on hold for several minutes, they asked if I went to the doctor (no, I didn't think medical attention was necessary or useful), and acted like they had no idea there were bugs. Maybe it was only our room that was infested, but it was like nothing I've ever experienced. My daughter showed up Friday night and never noticed anything. I don't have bugs at home and have never had them before or since.

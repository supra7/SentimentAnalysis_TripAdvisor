I had made a reservation for a stay in August 2009. Unfortunately my Mother died and I was forced to cancel. Since I had a "special rate" reservation I could not cancel but was told I would be allowed to reschedule the reservation up to 3 times for one year from the booking date. I have just tried to reschedule and they tell me it has gone over the end of the year so I will not be allowed to reschedule. I would NEVER stay at a Noble House property as I could not trust their policies.

We knew what we were getting into by selecting a hotel with no AC- but after looking at the average temperatures for SF- we thought we would be ok. So selecting the Chancellor was our choice and this review is not really about the heat. We were in SF during the recent heat wave- it was very hot and miserable to sleep at the Chancellor as we had a front room, the window had no screens (there were crows on the balcony- not exactly something you want to wake up to) so our room had no air flow. It was so helpful (not) that they offered us electric fans as we checked out- in that heat situation- those should have been offered to all guests. The room was a good 20 degrees warmer than the outside temperature. SO- if you happen to go during extreme heat- ask for a room in the back and the extra fan. As for the room, it was very small and while updated in its decor- it was old. The bathroom was also very small (the door barely clears the toilet) with no frills. I would have no problem with this- but it also wasn't very clean. It needed a good scrub and some major cauking. On the positive side, they had a nice lobby restaurant and the location was great. So between the balcony crows and the dirty, small bath. We won't be returning to the Chancellor- but SF was fun.

Stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend for 4 nights in October 2010 for my birthday and 1st visit to Berlin. After a lot of time spent on the internet, we chose the Melarose as we felt it offered the best value for money in terms of mid-range hotels (based upon the hotel website, services, room photos etc.). It could not have been more misleading- our first night we didnt even have a double bed but 2 singles put together, the room was cold/damp and the lights were so dim that it was dark. The next day we changed rooms in favour of a big single bed (140cm) so we could actually sleep together. The room was a bit nicer but it was tiny, the bed wasnt very comfy, the fixtures/lights were shabby, towels were thin, worn and coarse and on top of everything, after a long night out clubbing we couldnt even close the blinds to get some early morning sleep as there were none. Ive never written a review in trip advisor but felt I had too this time as the hotel website is really misleading. there is nothing feng shui about this place. they charge the same rates as nice midrange 3/4 star hotels but give none of the service or comfort you would expect, so disappointed as it was my birthday weekend and we wanted to spoil ourselves.  350 wasted on a crap hotel. Location was ok, but if youre looking to stay in a good value mid-range hotel, this isnt it. Dont stay here.

We picked this hotel because they could accomadate my whole family of six in one room, upon arriving we find out they did not book our first night there, of course they were full so they tell us we would have to stay somewhere else that night. The desk attendent did call some places to see if they had vacancy. We explained to him that we would have to have two rooms or a more expensive suite and it would cost more for us to stay. I asked was there some way they could compesate us since they were the ones who made the mistake.He called his manager and she told him it would have to go to accounting the next day.The guy would not let me talk to the manager so we went next door where they were very friendly and helpful.The desk attendent had the nerve to ask me did I want him to cry me a river to show he did care.Very poor attitude.

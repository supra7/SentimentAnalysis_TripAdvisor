Skip this hotel! We had booked this hotel over the Internet while on the Big Island of Hawaii, and therefore had not seen it first. We didn't want to spend a lot , but did want something fairly decent. We arrived at this hotel, where there was construction right outside the front door - not a problem, we wouldn't hear it as we would not be there most of the time. The first room that we stayed in had some sort bodily fluids on the comforter, and pubic hair on the walls. The room that they transferred us to had dirt and hair on the plate where the water glasses were held. The third room (we just wanted somewhere to sleep by then) was fine, but that was enough, so we found another hotel, which was 100 times better, just down the road and not much more expensive. This hotel did have a great view, and they do give you a free cup of coffee in the morning, if you dare to use the cups.

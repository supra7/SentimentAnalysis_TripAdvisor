My recent stay at the W won't shed any new light on the deep, fundamental problem that plauges this hotel. The lobby is beautiful and there's a great hip energy to the place. But the rooms themselves are a disaster. Our "Spectacular" room was absurdly small and uncomfortable. So small that my knees pressed into the bathroom wall when I sat on the toilet. So small that I cracked my elbow on the sink everytime I reached for the toilet paper. So small that I had to turn sideways when walking around the foot of the bed. Also, the TV's got lousy, snowy reception. Don't people notice these things? I guess not because the hotel was so full that our request to be upgraded to a suite -- and we were willing to pay for it -- couldn't be fulfilled. In fairness to the staff, they did upgrade us to a "Super Spectacular" room at no charge. That room was marginally larger than the first, but still, by any standard, a very small uncomfortable room. And it's already dim lighting was plauged by a few burnt out bulbs. I think this hotel chain does itself no favors by creating expactions that can't be met. Maybe a little less creativity in it's copywriting and a little more truth would avoid these situations. The next time I go to NY, I'll stay at the Kimpton's Park 70. Yes, it's more expensive, but the rooms are much (MUCH!!) larger and far more comfortable.

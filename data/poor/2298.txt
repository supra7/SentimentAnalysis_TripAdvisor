Avoid this place. We couldn't sleep at night because the disco pub dowstairs. The music was very loud till three o'clock at night. Our room was just under the kitchen of the same pub and can hear all the noise till late in the evening expecially when they beat the food.They offer the breakfast in the same pub and the first day we did feel bad all day long with the stomac. A disaster and wouldn't suggest this place even to the worste enemy.

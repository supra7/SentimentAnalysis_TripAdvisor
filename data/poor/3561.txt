Everything was terrible about this tired old excuse for a hotel - supposedly an airport hotel, yet a 20 minute drive from the equally dismal airport. Building was tired and dirty - like a trip back to the 1970's. Room had been upgraded, but the effort could not overcome the poor housekeeping and attention to details. Food and Beverage was like a "Last Chance Saloon" Worst pretend four star hotel that I have ever stayed in around the world. Thanks goodness it was only a night!

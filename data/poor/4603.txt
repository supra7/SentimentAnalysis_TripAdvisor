Our stay at the Lofts starting Thurs 2/16/12 started off great.. then on Monday night, the 20th, I went up to the room after the Orpheus parade and found our room ransacked and over $1000 stolen out of the room. Yes I know.. hiding cash in the room was not a good idea.. but two keys were missing out of our room after I allowed housekeeping in the room to clean the only on the day we were robbed. Security director was accusatory of old friends that had spent 3 days there with us.. that I have know and been friends with for over 16 years... and they were already gone when the room was ransacked and back in Texas.. then she produces me a sheet where the interrogated the lock and it only showed the entries where I entered the room. There is an investigation going on.. but I do not look for a favorable outcome! The hotel's solution.... they comped one night's stay and one night's parking.(much less than what was taken from our room). and of course.. I am sure will NEVER admit to which employee came into our room and stole our room keys as well!! I will never stay at this hotel again! Oh.. and the day we were robbed .. conveniently there was a fire alarm pull and we had to evacuate the building!

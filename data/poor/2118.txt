I could not be more dissapointed! Ou room was so outdated I could not believe it! We had room 17-255 and the floor was uneven, the bathroomtowel rack was holding on for dear life. Our oom looked like it has not been remodled or touched since they originally built the hotel. The staff is great but I will never book a night at this hotel again!

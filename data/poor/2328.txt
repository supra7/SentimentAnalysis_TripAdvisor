We are checking out of the Grand Wailea today and we are really happy to be getting out of here. We've been in Maui for about ten days for our honeymoon and have been staying at a few places including the Ritz Carlton, the Hotel Hana and the Grand Wailea. The Grand Wailea has been a HUGE disappointment. The service is lackluster at best and the entire place is packed with people. There is nothing relaxing about being here- it has the feel of an overpacked cruise ship. The grounds were supposed to be luxurious but are actually pretty tacky. There are ads everywhere for everything from vow renewals to property ownership and the whole place is just a tourist trap nightmare. My husband and I booked a spa treatment at the spa hoping that it would be a nice retreat but it was just more overpriced tourist fodder. The hydrotherapy room was so packed with people that it just seemed gross to be jumping in and out of the pools- you couldn't get any room to yourself. The service at the spa was not good, the whole place is much more hype than reality. At the end of the day we spent over $800 on spa treatments today and if I had to do it over again I wouldn't have done it. Moral of the story- this place is not at all worth it. We had heard that from some of the reviews on TripAdvisor and didn't listen and we couldn't regret it more. We made the mistake of pre-paying for our room and we were so disappointed when we arrived that we tried to cancel and go somewhere else but due to prepaying didn't have the flexibility to do so. If we could have left the day we checked in we absolutely would have.

We got the hotel off the internet and looked just what we wanted. We pre-booked and reserved a room for late arrival. This was confirmed as a Superior Room by the hotel. We arrived at about 01.00 and checked in and were shown to our room. It was the worst room we have ever had in a so called reputable hotel chain. The room was so small there was no room for our luggage on the floor; you couldn't get into the bathroom if the wardrobe door was open; the mattress was covered in a plastic sheet which meant all the bed clothes slipped off; although it was meant to be a no-smoking room the place stank of cigarettes; there was no window in the room. The room was nothing like the photos on the web site. Being tired after a long journey we slept as best we could for the night but in the morning complained to the manager. We were told they had no better rooms but for an extra charge we could move to a sister hotel virtually next door which, as we had paid for 3 nights was the best we could get and were told that we could complain later which we did. When we complained we were told that there was nothing they could do as we should have complained the night we checked in and despite our protestations the management refused any refund at all. We later found out that this is what is commonly called a short time hotel catering for ladies of the night and their clients. We have since written several times to the Managing Director of the Hotel 81 chain but not had the courtesy of a reply. If you want an hotel in Singapore dont book the Hotel 81 Classic; it is awful and without doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in on our travels. Do learn from our mistake and check reviews on Trip Advisor before you book any hotel and if in doubt try and get an independent review.

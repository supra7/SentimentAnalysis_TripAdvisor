This place was awfull I have never felt scared being at a so called resort like I was at the Summberbay PROJECTS. I am not exagerating this place reminded me of Compton CA. It was absoloutly the worst place I ever stayed at. It is not even a resort people actually live in these rooms and the very worst people I may add. Like your prostitutes, drug dealers, Sex offenders and all kinds of criminals. After a long night of clubbing I got dropped off at the Harrahs (which is next door) the securtiy guard told me to be careful walking to my room she said that a lot of bad things happen at this so called resort. I mean it rooms are actually boarded up and run down. I am not joking when I compare it to the projects. If you want your life to be threatened on vacation stay here, if not pay the extra money and stay at somewhere descent. IF I CAN JUST GET ONE PERSON NOT TO STAY THERE I WOULD FEEL LIKE I MADE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE.

I have never seen anything like it - the staff entered our room three times in one morning, twice while sleeping and again when I was up. After telling the staff that our room didn't need servicing and that my partner needed to sleep, they then rang us ten minutes later to ask, again waking him up. For the next morning, there was no "do not disturb" sign to use, and sure enough, I was walked in on again twice, once while I was in my towel. I had to change in the bathroom as I never knew when they would walk in unannounced - it was like the simultaneous "knock-and-enter" that one's mother would do... creepy, shocking and would not recommend.

Service is extremely poor. Prices are obscene for closet sized standard rooms. Hallways are dimly lit, probably to hide the fact that the carpets desperately need replacing. The staff seem to think they are movie stars. We rang the pathetic 'Whenever/Wherever' service line three times to have someone look at, among other issues, the room safe and they never arrived. You must constantly line up for the front desk, the concierge and even to use the lifts. Can you believe it!! They overcharged by $150 for send a 30 page fax to Australia. They tried to charge $37 for a minibar item that was never consumed. They also tried to double charge for the room. The bell hop was a completely out of line. When we came back for our stored luggage, we eventually found it thrown in a service hallway, upside down and damaged. The management has a well polished marketing propaganda that they serve you when you ask a simple 'why'. I will never stay here again.

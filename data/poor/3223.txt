I booked a special rate thru TP housing in connection to ASD So many disapointement from a Name i expected a lot. This is the crapiest hight-end Hotel in Las Vegas. Dont bother stayong there and dont b impress by the XS/encore beach... Staying at the hotel wont give u any priority or free access.. 1-i booked a smoking room and received a non smoking 2-ibooked 2 bed and got 1 and right away the answer was we r out of 2 beds... 3_the receptionist gave me a small card saying free internet and local calls ... But when i came to check out thats happened to cost $20 a day 4 during the last 2 days they had construction or smth (i stayed on 30 floor after they move me from yhe 9 floor) and noise day & night 5-room service didnt care much on the last day. Kjnd of i know u will b gone tomorow. Never never again Save ur money and go to another hotel and u wontvregret it Fyi the smallest room at vemetian is almost twice the size of a reg room at encore. Is it really a Steve Wynn resort??? Maybe it should change to original name Desert Inn cause if the service stay the same it will b deserted... Dani Stayed 07/28/11 to 08/15/11 Room 3017

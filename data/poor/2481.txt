We did not receive the room we booked. Room was postage stamp size, fridge did not work and the hotel could not fix it for the entire stay. Not a single time the beds were made up before 3PM. Lousy, overpriced food in the main restaurant and totaly untrained and unprofessional servers did not help to soth us either. Resort is crowded, busy and noisy, personnel indifferent, forget Hawaii serenity and experience. At $350.00 per night it is no bargain, Sheraton just down the street is a better choice if you must do Maui.

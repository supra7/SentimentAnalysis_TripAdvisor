I did not have hot water for two days. When i notified the front desk they said they would take care of it. I ended up complaining three more times that day. It was not taken care of until the day after my initial complaint. When i asked for a refund, the hotel said that they responded the issue as soon as they were made aware (bs!). I guess a day and a half is "as soon as" they get around to things there. They also charged me twice for my room(s) and i still have not seen the credit. It was and still is, a giant pain!

Some friends and I stayed at Harrahs over the Labor Day weekend, it was terrible from the start! The hotel is old and out dated, the staff is rude especially the manager Chris and to make matters worse my friends found bed-bugs in their room and I woke up with bites as well!! When we brought it to the staff's attention, they pretended like it was no big deal, no offered any kind of sympathy let alone compensation. Chris the manager is the worst of them all, he was very unapologetic and nasty and threatened to black list us if we told anyone they had bed bugs!!!! WELL I DONT CARE I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW HARRAHS IN LAS VEGAS,NV HAS BED_BUGS!!!!! SO BEWARE!!!!!!

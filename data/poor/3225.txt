80% of the restaurants and bars are closed. The pool wait staff sucks - I was never asked if I wanted a drink or a snack for more than 3 days. The lobby bar staff is lazy and stupid - I did not get a cup of coffer for three days becuase I did not want to wait in line for 30 minutes. This hotel is only about making money, upcharging for what one would expect as part the the general offerings and is not concerned with a customer experience. I must say that none of this was unique to Encore - a $35 dollar cab ride from the airport. I know the economy is bad but please tell me why I should come back.

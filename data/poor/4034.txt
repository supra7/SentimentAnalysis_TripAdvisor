I stayed at the Fairmont downtown chicago. I was told that the cots was not available at the moment. I never received a cot or a phone call to inform me that they had no cots. I finally called myself at 10 at night. I then asked for an extra blanket and sheets. I had to wait an hour and forty minutes and three phone calls.

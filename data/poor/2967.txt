Arrived after a long flight and gave receptionist email booking confirmation via booking.com. Insisted had booked 1x triple and 1xdouble yet our confirmation showed 1 single room and 1 double as needed. Made us pay over 900 aed more than what email confirmed as price blaming booking.com but wouldn't show what confirmation he had received from them. RUDE & ARROGANT, CLEARLY CAN'T READ ENGLISH Just a MONEY MAKING CON.AVOID UNLESS WANT TO BE ROBBED! ABSOLUTLEY DISGUSTING BAD SERVICE!

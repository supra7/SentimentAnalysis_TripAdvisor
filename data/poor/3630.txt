Paid 600.00 to get out My partner and I stayed at this hotel after a trip to Maui (which was fantastic) because of the look of the web site. When we arrived at 11pm all I could say was YICKES! After staying two days in this hotel we could no longer endure so made arrangements to fly home asap.It cost us $300 each in airline fees to make the changes but we felt it was well worth it.I was ignorant of tripadvisor before this vacation but I will always use it from this day forward to plan vacations.

Don't be fooled. Not every room has been renovated. The location of the hotel was excellent, however, the hotel itself was terrible. Musky moldy smell everywhere, the ceiling in our room (407) was peeling due to a leaky roof and a piece of the paint actually fell on my face during night. There was no seating - not a single chair, no microwave, no coffee maker, not even a hair dryer. The shower was disgusting and I really didn't want to touch the shower floor without flip flops on. The shower curtain fell at the lightest touch. The housekeeping personnel did not KNOCK and walked in on us...The sink did not have a stopper - make sure you don't drop your ring in there. Our last night we were really cold and tried to turn on the heater but it didn't work. The pool was too cold to swim in for the weather. When I complained during check out there was not even an apology from the front desk personnel, all we got was just a dull "ok" The only nice thing about this hotel was the location and a nice big flat screen tv in the room. Parking was $15 a night and never mentioned during booking. The railings on the balcony are lose - make sure you don't lean on them or you might fall. Oh..and their elevator operating permit has been expired for a while, too...just a bad hotel all over.

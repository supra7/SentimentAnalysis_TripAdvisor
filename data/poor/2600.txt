Don't use the valet parking service at the InterContinental Hotel New Orleans. I did not stay at this hotel however the valet staff destroyed my colleague's rental car which impacted my trip. My colleague handed the keys over to the valet staff late in the evening after returning from work add day. When he picked up the car in the morning the front wheel had been destroyed. The valet staff changed the tire which took 45 minutes. We believe they didn't just change the tire. Every time you turned left we heard grinding metal coming from the wheel. The water light on the dashboard also came on. We could not replace the vehicle since hertz did not have any available vehicle. However the valet manager did get a replacement vehicle from Enterprise rent a car the day after. The valet staff also admitted to damaging the car. The vehicle had to be cleaned since the valet driver vomited all over the driver seat. Disgusting!! We also noticed the gas was half empty. Basically the valet staff took the car on a joy ride and was drunk. It was a nightmare for my colleague taking care of the paper work and situation. Basically don't use the valet parking at the InterContinental Hotel New Orleans. The hotel manager did not care!! No compensation or even an apology from the hotel. The hotel manager just pointed the blame to the valet company which is run by another company. The valet manager was very apologetic. My colleague will never stay at another InterContinental Hotel. Neither will I after this experience.

Hi, This is my first review on Tripadvisor, cause I feel that I have to advise anybody to stay AWAY from this so call hotel. This place is nothing but a hostal, they have place nice photos on the site, provably from another hotel, dont be fool by the photos, rooms have nothing to do with it. You better sleep on the subway. No elevator, dirty and smelly carpets. Horrible beds. We sleep with our clothes on!!!

Had a horrible stay at the Sheraton Dallas. The rooms were not clean at all. Dirty bathrobe was left on my bathroom door, hairs were in the bed, mud on the bathroom floor, air-conditioning didn't work, coffee creamers were expired and came out in chunks. When I tried bringing my concerns to the hotel management via email after my stay they blew me off and said there was no record of any of this in the night managers log, essentially blaming me. Forgive me for not calling the night manager. I had just traveled internationally to be there and had not slept in 2 nights. My first thought was not to talk to the manager. Don't even look at this hotel! Not worth it.

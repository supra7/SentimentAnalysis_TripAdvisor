We had a choice to stay at the Ritz or Westin, and we thought Wesin looked more fun so we stayed there. But we wanted to see if we missed anything at the Ritz, and wend up there to check it out. I can not tell you how extatic I was that we stayed at the sunny and fun Westin. First of all, it was drizzling up by the Ritz, it was foggy, almost no palm trees, instead they had pines everywhere. Pines? Then it looked like you had to walk a whole mile to the beach. There was only one pool and it was nothing spectacular. I guess if you're a golfer you can go there, there was a big golf course there, but I personally could care less what it was and how good it was. I don't fly 9 hours in a plane to do sports. Also, everyone int he hotel was, how can I say it nice, older... I dont have kids and do not particularly enjoy their screaming everywhere, but the Ritz was so quiet, it was like visiting a semetary. Not to compare with fun and upbeat yet luxury Ritz Carlton at Naples, FL, where we stayed some while ago. I would not go to the Ritz in Maui.

I recently stayed here and I will never stay there again. It smelled horrible! There was no microwaves or fridges in the room. My curtain was torn down from my window. My air conditioner did not work. The water did not get hot at all. The front desk clerks were not helpful at all. The room was moldy and had a wet feeling. It was disgusting!

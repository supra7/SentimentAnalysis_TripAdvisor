This hotel was one of the most unkept hotels we have seen in all our years of travelling. The window was so dirty that we could not get light through it. The bed for two was up against the wall and the carpets and bedspread was very unclean looking. One elevator had trapped people in it the day before so only one was working. It felt like a firetrap. We booked on Hotwire and it was said to be a three star. We had to forfeit our $200.00 but it was worth it not to have to open up the bed and see what the sheets looked like.

I initially researched the Inn @ QA on Expedia and found a $74 rate. I contacted the reservation agent directly and asked if she could match the rate. She said the lowest she could offer (AAA) was $80. I accepted to allow more flexible cancellation options. We arrived at 10: 15 p.m. on a Saturday. We were offered a first floor or second floor room, (We were cautioned both faced a noisy first Avenue.) We chose the second floor even after being told there was no elevator. We were not offered help with our bags. We arrived to find a small room (converted from apartment studio - kitchenette) with stifling heat from a radiator. We dialed the front desk fro 15 minutes to no answer (hoping for advice on turning down teh radiator) We finally noticed a note to turn the knob. This had little effect. The bed was firm and outfitted with scratchy sheets. The television received cable channels somewhat clearly but local ones were very 'cloudy.' When using the toilet one had to contort to the left to avoid a stack pipe which was very hot. The highly praised Continental breakfast was weak with watery coffee, poorly mixed juices and a varaiety of slightly stale small muffins. When I brought up our concerns to the check-out person, we were told, 'It is an old building." When I asked for some compensation, the clerk shrugged her shoulders. I asked for a manager. The tall female (seemingly barely out of high school) gave us the same response. I cautioned that a negative comment was 10 times more powerful thatn a positive one, I was not given a response, comment card or name of an executive or owner. I would highly recommend all potential visitors to search elsewhere. Luckily I chose not to pay the $15 parking fee. I travel a lot and have stayed in some medicre hotels but the INn @ Queen Anne was the worst in ambiance, features and customer relations.

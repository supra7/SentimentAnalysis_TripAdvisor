1. when we got to our room it was clearly a single room, couldn't get round to the other side of the bed as the end of the bed was up to the wall and there was a huge tv in the corner hanging over the bed (tip to the designer - when it's such a small room don't emphasize the fact by putting such a big tv in it) when laying in bed the tv was 2 feet away so the picture was awful. i went back downstairs to ask about a double room and was told that we had a double room, they don't do single rooms (rubbish - that was not a room for 2) bathroom was tiny also and again not helped by the huge sink in it. 2. sticker on the window confirming that they know it's a small room however to compensate for that they offer free wifi - not true, you have to pay. 3. they charge $8.73 for a bottle of water!!. 4. cleaner removed the soap and didn't replace it. 5. when we checked out the person on the desk asked if we had enjoyed our stay i said new york was great but we weren't impressed with the hotel. she shrugged and said "oh well". 6. we wanted to leave our bag at the hotel for the day as our flight wasn't until the evening, we were stood waiting for 5 minutes, 3 members of staff on the check in desk had walked past and ignored us - a simple "someone will be right with you" to acknowledge that they had seen us would have been nice, but no - i eventually got one of the check in girls attention to asked if someone could help us, as she turned to us she gave us the dirtiest look as if to say "how dare you ask me a question" i asked if she could let someone know that there were people waiting, she huffed and very slowly picked up the phone, but didn't know who to call. i have never been treated so badly in a hotel, and i have travelled a lot, staying in many different kinds of hotels from 2* - 4* i wouldn't even rate this hotel as a 2*.

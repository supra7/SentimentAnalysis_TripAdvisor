The bad reviews featured by other hotel patrons are understandable when you consider it is an old hotel with few amenities. It certainly wasn't worth the money considering the lack of services, horrible cleanliness, and poor hospitality. I was unfortunate to get a room that smelled of curry spice that seeped into the room thru the vents from the Indian restaurant that is on the first level. The rooms were less that adequate with minimal space and no amenities such as internet or wi-fi. The continental breakfast was a free for all to grab some stale bagels and genetic muffins that weren't worth the trouble of waking up early by 7am to fight over with the crowds of uncivilized people. It's only plus I could state is that it is centrally located in MidTown NYC in walking distance to the Metro and local cafes. This Hotel with it's expensive $300-350/night charge certainly isn't worth your stay considering that it is nothing more than a glorified and dated Days Inn Motel of the 1930s.

I also stayed at this hotel for a week and I too found the service very shabby compared to my last stay. I do not usually write reviews and stay in hotels all over the world including staying in hostels while back packing. I have never had to ask for my room to be made up and I too had a camera stolen from this hotel. Whilst I acknowledge this is not the Bellagio or Venetian, I think that I was entitled to a standard of service. I am not expecting to be on first name terms with all the staff or even expecting a free upgrade. However, this hotel did not make up my room, the taps in my room were persistently dripping and I was woken up every night by whistling and banging on my door. I am not a hotel employee and I live in the UK. I have stayed in the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood (when it was the Aladdin) and think that the Flamingo is a similar price but far better value for money.

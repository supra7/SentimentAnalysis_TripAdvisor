HATED it! I paid a $150 deposit (3mos in advance) for a non-smoking room. Upon arrival, only smoking rooms were available. Since it was ProBowl weekend, the hotel was sold out and no effort was made to relocate me. Ultimately, I spent the night trying to get some sleep on 2 lawn chairs out on the balcony. Not an easy task due to night air wreaking of old wok grease and noise pollution akin to New York City. The Beachcomber charges for EVERYTHING -- including PARKING. That's right -- registered guests pay a special rate of $8 per day! You pay for phone calls, use of the safe, $2 for instant coffee in your room ($1 for tea) and, at the dining room, you even pay for soda pop refills! Fortunately, we were able to relocate to a motel off the beaten path, thereby salvaging my first trip to Hawaii. If I can spare ONE person from wasting his or her hard-earned vacation money on this hotel, then I've done my job.

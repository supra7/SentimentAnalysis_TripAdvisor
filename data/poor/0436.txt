This place was a pigsty. I've traveled a great deal and I have to say what makes this place so bad is the "owner" Raj. The door locks barely work, the carpets are dirty and I wore flip flops in the shower because it was so filthy. The location isn't that great anyway, close to Seattle Center yes, but you'll hear freeway noise all night. Read some other reviews and decide for yourself but my interaction with Raj when I told him that the tub needed to be cleaned was to get hostile and yell at me to leave. If you have other options of hotels I would advise you to take them instead.

We are Starwood preferred guests and so expected better  we got a small, well worn room apparently a suite (I would hate to see the size of other rooms!) The service was initially enthusiastic, but no one never resolved any of our many problems. To add insult to injury after one complaint the manager sent up four free beers with a note and then charged them to our room! On the positive side the location is great and if you are 20 years old this is definitely the place to get hooked up in the ever packed bar. There are much better places to stay in NY for the price.

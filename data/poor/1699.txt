Very well where do I begin? The room was pants, way too small. Satellite television my ars*, it was rubbish analogue. Wifi? What wifi? Sneakily trying to charge me an additional fee (after begging me to go and get cash out to not pay by card, surely nothing tax related there...") Took 15 minutes to ask for simple additional items for the room. Rude staff that made me feel uncomfortable to stay. Come on I'm paying you're wages you can at least say "hello". Not worth the money. Stay away.

Miauw Suites looked great on the internet but the reality is completely different. This is not actually a hotel as it has no facilities outside of the rooms whatsoever. Having lugged our bags up the steep stairs to the first floor (no elevator) we arrived in the White Room. The temperature was around 90 degrees inside (despite being 70 outside) and there is no air conditioning. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to experience a boutique hotel but this was appalling in every way. We checked out straight away and found alternative accommodation close by that was very good. Miauw Suites has declined to refund any of our costs for the 2 night stay. I understand that we arrived at 3pm on the first day and that it would be unlikely that the room could be sold again but feel that the second night should have been refunded.

So glad I did NOT stay here I just had a horrible customer service experience and did not even stay at this hotel! I was planning to fly up to SF to get engaged this weekend. I booked the hotel earlier in the week. I got a suite and was ready to go. Yesterday a tragic personal event occurred, and I was no longer able to go. I called the reservation desk to cancel, assuming that this would be fine since it is 4 DAYS AWAY. As soon as I tried to cancel, I was put on hold for 5-7 minutes. When she got back on, she told me that with suites you cannot cancel within 30 DAYS! I was LIVID. I told her that first of all NOBODY even mentioned this, and secondly, what other hotel on this planet has this crazy policy? The longest I have EVER heard of is 48 hours, and the other 97% of hotels are 24 hours. She put me on hold for another 5 MINUTES. When she finally came back on the phone she said that they were able to cancel. I am still absolutely furious and I will NEVER stay at this has-been hotel because of this experience.

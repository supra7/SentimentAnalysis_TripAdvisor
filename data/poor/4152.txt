Stayed here for a wedding with a friend. I had originally booked my own room but cancelled it when we decided to share. He turned in his suit for dry cleaning the day before the wedding and was assured he would have it back by 8am the day of the wedding. When it wasn't available by 10am, we were told they were not sure where the suit was. Finally he got the suit back around 3pm - AFTER the wedding was over. There were no apologies or offers to fund a suit rental, and he had to completely miss the wedding - the whole point of us being there. Weeks later i discovered my credit card had been billed for the room I cancelled, and after 2 days of repeat phone calls I was finally able to talk to finance, who said they had no record of my credit card at all. Finally after making them check the number 3 times, their system did find that I had been billed and they said they would refund my money. During this time no one was very apologetic or sympathetic, and there were no offers to attempt to make things right, comp the room, or anything. Very disappointing and a stain on the Holiday Inn Express name, which I had always been a fan of. Oh and the rooms are very small/bathrooms are cramped/elevators are scary and small/the two beds were different sizes/walls are paper thin/they charge hotel guests for parking - but those would have all been forgiven had the service not been horrendous.

My husband and I booked The Oasis Suite online in July. When I arrived on Aug. 31 to check-in I found out about the hidden fine print of a $50.00/night deposit which was NOT mentioned anywhere on your website during the reservation process. My husband and I were looking forward to spending our Vegas honeymoon in a lush suite...instead we spent it in a room that was very small, had terrible pillows (I'm still working through the chronic neck pain those gave me), and lacked a refrigerator so whatever leftovers we wanted to save went to waste. We felt especially alienated during our stay because we (fortunately) do not carry credit cards....this prevented us from, well, everything. We wanted to get in-room wi-fi internet access....but alas, a $150.00 deposit ($50/night) was needed since we didn't have a credit card. We wanted to rent a movie for in-room viewing...again, another silly deposit of $150 ($50/night). We offered to pay cash upfront....alas, a deposit of $100/night was required for cash. Ridiculous! These silly policies made us feel unwelcome at the Stratosphere; we felt like our personal well being wasn't important, only our money was what mattered. In addition to all this, the most annoying thing about our stay was consistently being harassed by people on the casino floor by the Select elevators trying to get us to sign up for promotions and sell us things we had absolutely no interest in. They had a hard time taking a polite "No thank you" for an answer. All of this guaranteed that when we return to Vegas we will NOT be staying at the Stratosphere.

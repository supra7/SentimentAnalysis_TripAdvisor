Worst hotel experience. Ever. Hotel came highly recommended and was a HUGE disappointment. Pretentious, uninterested staff, terrible food, terrible rooms. Worst hotel stay ever. When we raised questions or problems they were completely uninterested in resolving them. BEWARE as well, they conduct wedding receptions in the hotel and the noise from them is so bad you feel like you are staying above a booming nightclub. Not really what you expect for the price! Also if you are not attending the wedding you are treated like a second rate guest and given the worst rooms and service. Both my colleague and I after a 15 hour flight were given rooms next to the service elevator (so we found at 5am with a bang every 30 seconds). When I rang reception I was told that this should have been explained to me when I booked in. I pointed out them that obviously if it had have been explained to me at check in I would have refused the room. I was then told I could just change rooms. When I asked if the hotel actively engages in a policy of just putting guests in these rooms until they complain this was not refuted. Just one of the many problems encountered? To many to go into detail on all. Do not stay here.

I come to Napa at least twice a year for long weekends and decided to try a night at the new Westin Verasa. If there is any management at all in this hotel, they must be on an extended vacation. No one has a clue how to do anything or where anything is. Starting with my phone call for directions to the hotel, they were totally erroneous. I arrived one hour early for their 3:00 PM check-in and was told very rudely by the person at the front desk, check-in is 3:00 PM, come back at 3. I had requested early arrival and did not feel one hour is that big a burden. There is absolutely no parking for checking in and they have only valet parking. Even if you are only going into the hotel for a couple of minutes, you must valet park. As Westins go, it is moderately attractive, but it is in a really crappy part of town. And it is not convenient to anything or for anything. They add a $20 Resort Fee to the daily rate and in no stretch of your imagination can this be considered a resort. I asked 3 different employees where I can find ice. None knew, but the last did get me some from the cafe. It took more that 15 minutes to check out and I was the only person. The person at the front desk had to get help to check me out and said they would have to email me my final folio because supposedly the printer kept jamming. I never did get that email folio. I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience the hotel had to put up with, not a welcome guest, let alone a welcome Starwood Gold Card member. Other than the kid who got me my car, I don't think I saw anyone smile. Ironically, when I was waiting to get my car, there were 2 people waiting in front of me. When I went and checked in at the Marriott for the rest of my long weekend, the same 2 people were coming in to check in as well. There are at least a half dozen other hotels in the Napa area that are a lot better in all respects, including staff that are truly friendly, courteous, helpful and most important, professional.

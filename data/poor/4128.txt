I was at the Whitehall Hotel on July 22nd & 23rd and was extremely disappointed. I had similar troubles as the other reviews such as closets that don't work and wet floors by the air conditioning unit. However, my big trouble started the night of the 23rd. After returning from dinner at about 11:30pm, the key to my room wouldn't work. I went to the front desk to get a new key, still no luck. I went back and they sent someone up that had all the keys, again no luck. I went down to the lobby and they said they were going to call maintenance. At 1am I must have fallen asleep in the lobby, around 2am, I was told there was a room they could put me in for a few hours while they wait for maintenance. I went to this temporary room around 2:30am because I had to depart by 8am I awoke at 6:30am to see if my room was available to get my things. Guess what, it still was not ready. At 7:10am, I received a call that the door was open (they had to cut the door apart to get in the room). As I was leaving, I asked to speak to the manager about my stay and was told that he was not available and would have to call later in the day. I left without settling my bill. I did receive a call later in the day from manager and he offered me a gift certificate for a future visit. After much discussion, I received credit for my stay. A few days later I had to call to have a receipt faxed up to me and found a number of room charges put on there that I never used. I am guessing the people that got the door open helped themselves to the bar in the room. I know this is a long review but I want people to be aware that this is an older hotel that has not been maintained well and when issues do arise don't expect immediate help.

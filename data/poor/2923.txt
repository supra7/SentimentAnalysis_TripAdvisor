This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at for the price. After walking into a very jazzy, fun lobby, the rooms are so disappointing--tiny and dingy. Even after moving to the renovated floor, the bathroom was very small and the shelf was tilted so that everything you put on it slid into the toilet or on the floor. The staff was friendly but the phone rang at least 7 times before any of them would answer. The topper was that my new shower did not work and they provided no robe. The location is great but skip this dog unless the prices are significantly reduced.

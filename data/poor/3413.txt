Creepy! I stayed here in early 2005. Worst place I've ever (not ) slept. My room was right behind the check-in desk. It had originally been the Night Manager's room, but they'd re-modeled it and were renting it out as a regular room. Like one of the other guests' review, one wall of my room was a sliding glass door that wouldn't lock. The cement courtyard echos and amplifies every sound (including the 4 rowdy "Dudes" who came in drunk at 2 AM. You have to buzz the front desk to be let in to the undergroud garage -- and I heard every one: at 12, 2 and 3 AM. I'm a grown man and didn't feel safe -- (I took my luggage with me whenever I left the room ) I checked out the next morning and let them keep my 2nd night's rent. Just wasn't worth it. Stay away from this dump!

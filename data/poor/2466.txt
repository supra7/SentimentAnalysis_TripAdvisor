My husband and 2 teen sons stayed here during spring break. we found our 2 Ocean Tower rooms tiny, worn and dirty. Both bathrooms had cracked tiles, missing and dirty grout. The mirrors and balcony doors were smudged , the electric outlets and switches and walls were covered with fingerprints of prior guests.. The beds are comfortable and the views great. The resort was jammed resulting in long lines for breakfast,,crowded walkways and shortages of lounge chairs and parking spaces. Our stay was not relaxed as we were constantly fighting lines and crowds. The staff is competent but impersonal .Next time we will stay at the Sheraton about one block away where it is less congested and more relaxing.

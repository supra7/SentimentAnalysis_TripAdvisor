I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. It is horribly maintained. The rooms are small and filthy. The beds are made of fabricated steel that any little movement creates the most annoying squeak. The carpet has holes all in it. The walls have stains all over them. We called for extra towels and we had to go down and get them. Do not waste your time and money here.

This hotel is very bad, they are thieves, they have stolen my very expensive laptop out of my room. Door was closed 100%. The staff did it but they don't want to admit. The owner of the hotel doesn't do anything about the situation. The breakfast is very dirty. You can only drink dirty tea and that's it. They have no coffee, milk or limonade. Some staff members are arrogant. In the beginning they are kind but as soon you paid everything they start to behave arrogant. They also clean the rooms once in 4 days en change the bedding once in 4  5 days. While you expect them to change everyday because yuo pay by day and you have the right on a clean room. The place where you have ''BREAKFAST'' is very dirty. A dog would nog eat there.

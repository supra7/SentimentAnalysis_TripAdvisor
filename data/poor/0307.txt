(1) This is a few hundred feet from a constantly running frieght line - they even give you ear plugs which are useless - trains run all day/night (2) Room for business meeting was extremly hot (80's) with the choice to be cooled by an extremely noisy, and easily replaceable, wall AC unit so that no one could hear anyone speaking. Conference room also had two obtrusive columns which were not disclosed meeting planners by the hotel (although citing obstructions was on criteria previously provided to the hotel), this then required our own meeting facilitators to have the room rearranged! Meeting room also has only a 7 foot ceiling. (3) Guest room had no dresser or a real desk ... only no closet place for clothes and anything else is a warm cabinet (second one up) above a hot fireplace that has a constant pilot on (4) No bathtub - just a shower (5) Lots of room space taken up by prententious 1990's honor bar stuff at outrageous prices (6) Requested an extended check out at 8pm day before checking out - was told to ask the next day and that up to 2pm would be no problem ... asked the next morning and was told some quota had been reached so no late check out was possible (7) Not convienent to too many reasonable food places - although some are available if you want to walk about 1/2 mile (a lot uphill). (8) Not all in room coffee supplies refreshed (2 days) (9) There are charges for toll free number dialings from guest rooms. (10) Cleaning staff would constantly turn off AC, requiring me to turn it back on when I returned each day, taking an hour to get the room cooled down to 70. (10) a good point - 200 feet from the Victoria Clipper if you come/go to Victoria

This Travelodge right next to the Convention Center - which is under construction. It also lacked a few things you would hope they'd provide for a price that high. If you enjoy getting woken up to the melodious sounds of construction, don't need a small fridge, don't mind staying on a slightly dangerous block at night, enjoy gray walls with new good views of Philly, hard rock beds and over-washed rock pillows, and stoned/drunk boys yelling at 4am down the hallway - do stay here. Oh and bring your own conditioner, I only got a complimentary shampoo.

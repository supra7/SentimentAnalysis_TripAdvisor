This is definitely not what you would expect from a Marriott Hotel, and as a Marriott Rewards Member with silver status I know what I'm talking about. Tiny rooms, old scratched furniture, no minibar, no refrigerator, no in-room safe. Had a room to the I5, even on the 8th floor it was extremely noisy. The whole hotel needs a complete refurbishment. Definitely no 4-star location. Next time I'll have to visit Seattle, I'll try to get another hotel.

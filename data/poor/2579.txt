My husband and I stayed for a weekend at the Roosevelt recently. The lobby is elegant and the bar has nice wood decor. Aside from that, I cannot recommend the Roosevelt and would not stay there again. My husband asked the concierge to arrange ground transportation from the airport for me (I was coming in on a later flight), and the concierge made it clear that he resented the request and agreed only reluctantly to make the call. When I got to the room, we were appalled to discover a dirty sock left over from a previous occupant. The front desk took 20 minutes, keeping me standing there the whole time, to sort out a discrepancy with Expedia over the room rate. Nightly turn-down service was absent or incomplete both nights of our stay, and it took up to 45 minutes to have that problem corrected. And the door to the mini-bar would not open, so we had to pay room service $20 for two small bottles of water. When we checked out, we presented a number of these complaints to Sarah at reception, who did not seem surprised and said simply that she would "talk to the concierge." When my husband told her we would be inclined stay at the Ritz on our next visit because the service at the Roosevelt had been sub-standard, she said she agreed and understood. No offer to speak with a manager was made, and we have received no follow-up communication from the hotel concerning the complaints or attempting to remedy them. If service is important to you in picking a luxury hotel, stay elsewhere.

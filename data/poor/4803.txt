They call this the Palace!?! really wanted to be a fan of this place, just by stepping into the lobby and meandering the halls of the first floor. (Wow, that atrium is amazing!) Looks and names can be deceiving, right? The rooms, the spa, the pool are dreadful. I had anticipated the rooms to be on the smaller side (duh it's San Francisco!) so that wasn't an issue. However the carpets were dingy and the bed and linens were circa 1990 just by their overused feel to them. The fiance and I had booked services at the spa which were just hotel rooms converted into spa rooms! what?!? And it seemed as if whoever administered my massage also distributed the towels at the nearby indoor pool! The pool a lazy little rectangle in the middle of a damp smelling indoor space w/windows that haven't been cleaned, maybe the person in charge was out giving a massage.And they call this the Palace! please.

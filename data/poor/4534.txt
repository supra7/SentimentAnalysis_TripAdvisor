I booked three rooms for four nights at the Adolphus, spending almost over $1,800.00. On the plus side, it's a beautiful hotel, and the concierge and valet staff are great. But there are some issues. During our stay, one of the rooms still had garbage in it from the previous tenants, half the mini bar gone, and no towels. The second room had no towels and the third had one towel and was cleaned twice during our stay. What really irritated me was when I explained to the front desk what our issues had been, he simply said, "Yes, we had some issues this weekend." No apologies, no offer to make things right, etc. I understand that things happen, but it's what happens afterwards that makes the difference. Based on what just happened in the lobby, I'll never stay here again.

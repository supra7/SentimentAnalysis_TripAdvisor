The Auberge is lovely, the food is great, but you can't help but feel that you are getting taken advantage of. Management behaves with an insincere earnestness and concern for guests' well-being is related to the size of the bill being generated. Go and enjoy and try to ignore that instead of your face, the Auberge sees $$$.

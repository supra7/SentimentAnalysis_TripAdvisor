The hotel was in the centre of town, and that's just about the only positive thing i can say about the place. Don't be fooled by the photos on the website - the rooms are much smaller and are not nearly as fascinating the visually modified photos are. The view was terrible and dirty and we simply refused to open the window as we didn't want air from the outside coming in. The shower seemed impressive from a distance, but once you get close, you'll find that its not well cleaned and maintained; all the fancy functions don't work either. The same goes for the toilet...dirty and toilet seat wasn't steadily attached. We found used tissues and toothpicks on the carpet, room was badly lit, and the air-cond blows room temparature air. I was horribly disgusted when my hand had sticky substance stuck to it when i held the phone by the mouth piece. The coffee and tea dispenser in the restaurant was not well cleaned and neither were the plates (that's what my friend told me when she tried to grab a plate for breakfast. She found at least 4 of such, in the stack of plates left out for guests to use). The lifts are also small, so we had to use the stairs on more than one occasion throughout our 2-day stay there. II never really got to experience the warmth and friendliness of the hotel staff to comment much, but I do appreciate the fact that they were able to fix the non-functioning light in our room within a few hours. So, I guess the service was ok. In short, unless you've completely run out of options, try to avoid this hotel.

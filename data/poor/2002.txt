Very understaffed and eating there made us sick, sometimes the front desk was unattended for up to ten minutes....I thought a hotel was opne 24 hours. Also,,,we became ill after eating at the restaraunt. Then we had to wait 45 minutes for security(apparently only one security person works each shift we were told) to do a food poisoning report.

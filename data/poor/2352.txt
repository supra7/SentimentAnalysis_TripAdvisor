This was the worst resort I've stayed at. We reserved a Deluxe Ocean view room, and when we arrived we were given a room with a partial ocean view, and a full view of a crane and construction sight. We were not told when we made reservation that noisy construction was going on next to all of the deluxe ocen view rooms.We were never accomadted with a better room and felt the staff were very rude. The inside of our room had wallpaper that was peeling off the wall, a broken shower head, and a broken knob on the sink. I would think that a resort would keep their rooms in better condition than this. The only upside to the stay was that the pools were amazing, but if you are looking for a quiet, romantic, getaway this is not the place to go. It is very crowded with kids and families and most of the seating around the pools are taken early in the morning.

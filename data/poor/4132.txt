The staff was incredibly rude. Some of the hotel patrons were waiting on a bus and their children were pushing each other all over the sidewalk. The children tripped my mother-in-law and she fell and cut her knee. It was bad enough the children and parents did nothing to help but the doorman offered no help either. A passing paramedic stopped to help. We took here inside so I could get some towels and water and not one of the staff offered help as they watched me clean and bandage her knee. Later when we mentioned the incident to the doorman, he said nothing and then snickered to the bellhop as we left.

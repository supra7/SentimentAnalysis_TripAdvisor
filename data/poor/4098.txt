Be very suspicious of the glowing reviews you get on these websites (phonies). Trust me, this place is under construction --- big time. How can anyone rate this as the best hotel he/she has ever been, when it has no restaurant, there are wet paint signs, there is scaffolding above the entrance, cracked sidewalks to navigate to get in (careful in heels, ladies!). Not even a vending machine to get a bottle of water. Oh, did I mentioned that from 1:15 am through 7:00 am there is construction going on, drills, pounding. I didn't sleep a wink. I'm NOT kidding. I got charged for a movie I didn't order. They were nice enough to comp my stay (I think). My stay was for business, so maybe its a great area for shopping, bars. But otherwise . . . On the bright side, the rooms seemed clean. People were nice. Maybe when it's done the hotel will be really nice. But for now, how can I rate this place other than terrible. My fixtures shook because of the pounding. Come on!

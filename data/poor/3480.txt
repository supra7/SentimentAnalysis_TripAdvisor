I booked my hotel blindly on Travelocity's "Top Secret Hotel Deals". Great location, three stars, for a great rate, seemed like a steal at the time. But now, not only do I have to deal with bed bugs for 3-6 weeks, but I have to pay for the privilege! I stayed at the Marrakech Hotel. This hotel absolutely has bed bugs. They are not taking their bug problem seriously. Therefore if you stay at this hotel, you will be bitten by bed bugs, you will have to deal with this disgusting problem for a month, and your subsequent pleas will fall on deaf ears. My reports to management weren't taken seriously and they tried to pawn my bite marks off on other city attractions (that I didn't got to). I am positive that I was attacked by bed bugs at this hotel. I was only in town for a few days on business and the only time I held still long enough for the bugs to get me was when I was sleeping. I know they are bed bug bites because they were verified by my doctor. When I contacted the hotel to report this problem, I was told that they were unaware of any bed bug problem, however the internet reviews I've read since then would prove otherwise. Also, refuting the possibility of them not knowing was when the manager Keith told me that they would do "what they normally do" in these situations and call in an exterminator to see what they could find. (Notice they have a normal way to handle problems that they don't know they have.) Keith said that he would call me back the following day... that was a week ago.

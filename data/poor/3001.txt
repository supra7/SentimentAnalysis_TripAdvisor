I stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was terrible! I understand it is an old building but old buildings don't have to be dirty and falling apart. Poor, poor, poor, terrible value for what you pay (on this occasion a "special" conference rate of $199). Tiles in the bathroom were chipped, dirty, and in need of repair, the "art" on the wall was falling apart inside the frame, the pillows smelled like they were washed in beer, furniture and doors had chipped paint, you can hear your neighbors coughing and taking showers, your skin is scalded in the shower whenever someone flushes the toilet in your wing of the hotel, and there is a story and picture of a rape and murder line up next to the elevator. If that run-on sentence doesn't detract you then look at the rest of the reviews on here-- more than half of them seem like fake 4* ratings and the rest tell the true story and echo my complaints.

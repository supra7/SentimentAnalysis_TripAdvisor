Our room was broken into, money credit card , video camera, ipod, and prada glasses were all stolen while we were alseep. Made out police reports, and security from hotel, and they have dismissed this case like we were the criminals. We have never asked for anything except to get the room comp, they were rude to us, and never kept us informed. We have tried getting in touch with the risk management that was taken care of this case to get questions answered, and they told us they couldn't talk to us. Not one person , manager or costumer service had even inquired about how we were doing. I have been a devoted costumer, for over 20 years, and this is the reward. People be careful, there are no security cameras in the hallways to protect you, only where they casino is protected, and that would be in the casino.

We were very pleased with the room we got when we first saw it. The receptionist had upgraded us to a room more expensive than what we had paid for (this room had two rooms and two balconies). On the second night, both my husband and I found roaches on both bathrooms (the one upstairs and downstairs). One of the roaches was huge! Anyway, we immediately called the front desk and they were closed (they are not open 24 hours). So we had to spend one more night there. I couldn't get out of my head that we could transport some roaches or roach eggs back to our house in our bags. How could we pay over $200 a night and be in this predicament? Unreal! The next morning we contacted the front desk receptionist who proceeded to tell me that this has never happened before. Really??? Who is she trying to fool. When I first mentioned it to her I did not hear a hint of surprise in her voice and now she is telling me this is the first she ever heard of it. She continues to convince me that I should not worry about transporting them back home (her tone was not sympathetic at all). The hotel manager stopped by to apologize and said that some times guests leave the balcony doors open and stuff tends to come in the rooms because the place has a lot of trees around the property (some plants even hang over the balconies). He was very accomodating...he offered to give us a discount and move us to another room. Of course, I couldn't imagine staying there one more day even if they paid me to do it. After all, I came to Key West for peace of mind. We looked around and found a fabulous Marriot beachside hotel. We paid $300 a night and got a waterfront room. Another good news is that hotels.com (we had booked the Parrot Key room through them) gave us $194 back for our inconvenience.

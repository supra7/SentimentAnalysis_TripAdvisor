Sloppy credit card management / A total mess with the strike... A hotel worker's strike is going on in San Francisco, therefore this hotel is understaffed and going through a hard time, I understand. HOWEVER, their guest credit card management is extremely sloppy (I found out I was overcharged $1000 in excess without my authorization!) and with their guest relations currently not existing, this is very, VERY distressing. After several frustrating long distance telephone calls and faxes, I finally got the number of the accounting manager, but have only talked with an answering machine (same thing with the general manager, answering machine) to this date. This means I might need to dispute my credit card bill..... Most services and member benefits were omitted -due to the strike- as well as no room service, and if you try getting something at the restaurants, you will get bad service. (This comment coming from someone from NYC should mean something.) I was going to let all this pass, but I genuinely felt I should warn other people thinking of staying here. If you don't believe me, try getting hold of someone at the hotel during the daytime.....I now remember another guest screaming at the front desk during my check-in. I should have taken that as a hint...By the way, I also stayed at the Holiday Inn Express at Fisherman's Wharf. Same strike situation, but no such glitches and service much more better (at less than half the price!)

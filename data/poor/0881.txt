Stayed at the Trump International for four nights, including Labor Day Weekend 2010 with my girlfriend. We were convinced to upgrade to the one bedroom suite upon check-in. Between the room and the spa, we spent over a $1,000 at the Trump, which I ordinarily would not have minded. After the third night of our stay, we awoke with hotel security at our door asking if we were missing any items from our room. A quick check of our room revealed over $6,000 worth of stolen items, including an expensive mens Swiss watch, a digital camera, a few hundred dollars in cash and a silver money clip - all apparently taken while we were in our room sleeping. Next door neighbors also had some expensive items from their room missing. Spent half of the next day dealing with hotel security and speaking with Las Vegas Metro Police. Police Report No. LLV100905002547. Absolutely no attempt whatsoever by the hotel was made to remedy the situation before check-out. No discount on our stay, no immediate insurance claim, nothing. It has been over two months now since the incident, and Trump International has ceased all contact with us and no insurance claim or compensation has been made. I would have never expected such poor security and horrible treatment from a 5-star hotel. Now we will have to foot the cost of our stolen items and hire an attorney. I will NEVER stay at this place again.

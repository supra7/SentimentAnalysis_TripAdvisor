Worst Hotel in NYC! The pictures posted do not accurately reflect the living arrangements. Furthermore, I stayed here and dealt with the worst customer service and front desk clerk I have ever seen. Just so you're aware in case you decide to go, he's a middle aged Indian man who works the night shift. I was thrown out of the hotel at 1am on a cold night and was not given an explanation why nor was I given a chance to retrieve my things. When I politely asked him if there was any way we could work things out he screamed in my face "Leave here and do not come back." Upon returning to the hotel several hours later to work things out he threatened me and proceeded to aggressively yell at me as I walked up the stairs to my room. I can not express to you how rude, judgmental, and immature this man was. You would think someone who paid to have a hotel room could at least stay in their hotel room, but nope, not at good ole Hotel Newton! Oh, and by the way there's only one bathroom per floor and if it gets locked with no one in it good luck having any of the quality staff open it for you.

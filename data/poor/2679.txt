OK, so you want a hotel room for a few nights and the Frenchmen sounds good, here's a checklist for you, just so you know what to expect: 1 Are you over 5ft 9inches? If your answer is yes, you're screwed. The beds in these place are designed for leprechauns and other vertically challenged folk. Quite simply the smallest bed in America... possibly the whole world. 2 Are you used to sleeping under bright lights? If your answer is "no", you're screwed as the hotel leaves all the exterior lights on all night (eco friendly it ain't) which floods the rooms with 'Close Encounters' stylee lighting which is about as conducive to sleep as a pot of coffee. 3 Like sleeping on rubber? If your answer is no, jog on buddy... the bed sheets are such poor quality that every time you move they roll up, exposing the rubber mattress underneath which stick to your skin. Lovely on those clammy NO nights! 4 Wanna hot shower? Well this ain't the place to be buddy. Nope, no hot water in this 'bargain' joint... Freezin' cold and lots of it. In summary: Pretty little boutique hotel that seems to be perfect until you actually experience it up close. Worst night's sleep for $100 I've ever had. The ONLY saving grace is that the reception staff are very nice. Jog on... seriously.

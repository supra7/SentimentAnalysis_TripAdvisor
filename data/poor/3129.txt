Mouldy bathroom. Room was dark during the day and light at night. Very noisy. Poorly maintained. Old noisy matress. Complained to front desk staff and at least someone tried to clean the bathroom a bit. Only redeming feature was front desk staff friendly and helpful. Wrote to management upon our return and have never even received the courtesy of a reply. Back to the Triton next time!

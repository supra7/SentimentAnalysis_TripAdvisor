Pros: Lots of parking. Huge hotel grounds (20+ acres). Cons: Free wifi is only in lobby, which is not connected to the hotel. The decor is from the 70s, and has not been maintained since then. It had peeling paint, patched bathroom walls, stained carpet, shabby bed linen, grimy cups, and ugly yellow counters. Pervasive musty and moldy smell would not go away even when we opened the doors/ windows. Walls are thin, so bring ear plugs. Not on the same side as the beach, so careful when crossing street. Essentially, we checked out after 1 night and found a nearby budget hotel for a better price with much better accomodations. If you look around, I'm sure you can find a better deal somewhere else.

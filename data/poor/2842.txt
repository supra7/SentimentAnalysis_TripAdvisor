It's a nice hotel if you aren't paying for it. However, from a value standpoint, if you are going to spend over $300 a night in new York, you can do so much better! This was by far the smallest room I've stay at in NYC. It was very clean and nice interior designs, but....again...the price was rediculous for what you were staying in. The previous week I was a guest at the starwood siste property, Le Meridian. Not only was it a lower price, but nearly triple the room size, and much better views overlooking Central Park. I stayed at the W hotel because I thought it would be cool to stay at the original W location.....and frankly speaking....I'm surprised the W brand becoming successful after luanching such a horrible firt hotel. Again...if it was a free hotel or if you only had to pay $130 a night, it's totally worth it. But that's not the case...

Pros- the location Cons- lights broken, phone did not work, no room service, no coffee in room and none until 7am Good luck business travelers- towels worst I have had outside youth hostels when I was in my 20's. Furniture and carpets cut and frayed seriously. Furniture tables looked like they came from Goodwill. Should be ashamed

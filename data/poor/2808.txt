The Time Hotel is indeed a very modern hotel just as shown on the brochures and excellent in location as its just round the corner from Times Square. However, arriving there on a Friday night at midnight US time (5am UK time) we were somewhat confused if we were at the right palce as there was music blaring out just light a night club. There was no reception on the ground floor just Bouncers ushering you to a lift to go to the sencond floor. Whilst we were checking in the music was really thumping! Arriving to our room on the 12th floor, you could not hear any music but on entering our room though it was pleasant in style it was really small, just enough room to walk around the bed. No room to hang your clothes, just a small rail and a curtain to cover it. No place to put your suitcases and no draws. Basically for 6 days we had to live out of our suitcases and move thing in order to move from one side of the room to another. Apart from the hotel, the location was excellent and New York is an excellent city to visit.

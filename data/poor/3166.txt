Complete Disappointment This hotel is a complete disappointment. The lobby gives off a luxurious vibe and the Redwood Room is very cool (if you fancy expensive drinks). However, my stay in the hotel was a disaster. The gray, threadbare carpet was stained with red spots in multiple places, the cheap IKEA furniture was falling apart, and the bathroom was way too small. However, any of these things would have been tolerable if I had been able to sleep. Our next door neighbors partied all night, and despite calls to security, nothing was done about it. I slept maybe one hour that night. Either the hotel needs to invest in sound proofing, or it needs to revise its party policy. San Francisco is an amazing town and I still had a great trip, but I will not be revisiting this hotel, ever.

Nightmare Nightmare stay. We arrived for a 7 day and was placed in the $125 room which was suppose to have a daybed--it didn't. Place was cramped,noisey, and no workable air temperature control--so we had to open the window at night which brought in more noise. The vending machines didn't work at all. I informed the clerk that we wanted to leave and was told that we would still be charged for a second day because we didn't give 24 hour notice. Difficult to give notice of leaving 24 hours in advance when the reason we were leaving was because of the shoddy conditions. The second day we were placed in a much smaller room for $85 dollar rate. Could not even move in the smaller room and, even though an interior room, was still noisey. After that day we left and the Inn submitted charges on my card for 2 days at the $125 rate even though we were in the $85 dollar room which was overpriced. Would NEVER recommend this place for anyone.

My stay at Harrah's was from June 18-22. Once we arrived, I expected to at least be greeted kindly, but instead, I was greeted by a very grumpy woman who only appeared to be anxious to clock out. We were offered to pay $10 more for a room with a view, to which we agreed to do. Needless to say, once we walked in the room, it was old, it smelled bad, and the view was overlooking the air conditioners. I called the front desk to be moved to a renovated room, which she agreed to move us, however, since it was still an "upgrade", we still needed to pay $46. My girlfriend checked in that same evening and was given the same room for no extra charge. The staff insisted that it was still an upgrade and the charges needed to apply. No one was flexible to give me a reasonable explanation on the charges. I can tell you that this was the last time I will step foot in that hotel.

Simply, this hotel was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have traveled world-wide for years and have stayed at many Best Western hotels with very good experiences. Thus, this review should not reflect on Best Western in general. First, the web site indicated that the motel was a 10 minute walk from the tube station. Actually, it was 30 minutes. When I arrived at the hotel they had difficulty finding my reservation. There was no restaurant within a 30 minute or more walk. The staff could not make change for me to take the bus to a restaurant or to get a candy bar and Coke from a vending machine. But they did invite me to breakfast the next morning. When I returned to the hotel the second night after sight seeing there was only one set of towels. The staff was very reluctant to deliver a second set obviously believing I was trying to steal a set. The next morning I returned for breakfast was was informed that I could not have breakfast because it wasn't included in my rate. The staff was very rude, uncooperative and very customer unfriendly. NEVER stay at this hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you're travelling on a budget and don't mind noise 24/7 this place is for you, otherwise forget it. The hotel is located at the lower end of La Rambla and especially at weekends the noise outside is 24/7 with late night revellers until 7am being replaced by tourists. Pension Picasso is located up several flights of stairs, entry is via a buzzer at the external door, then an internal door, the external door is usually open during the day but entry can be difficult if no one is on reception at night (supposedly open 24 hours a day). The receptionist had a shaky grasp of English but at least it was better than my Spanish! My room was a single with a shared bathroom overlooking La Rambla, small but clean with a sink, a TV that worked when it felt like it and a hard bed that gave me back ache. There is a WC near to reception and a bathroom with shower down the corridor, however the door didn't close or lock properly so i didn't use this! Returning to the hotel after midnight i was constantly harrassed by Prostitutes outside the hotel and the noise outside was constant, the only way to get any sleep was to get drunk and pass out! The room also shared a balcony with the room next door so there was a privacy issue there also, with people sitting outside my window! When i did check out there was no one on reception so i left my key and departed. Pro's: Very Cheap, clean room, location Cons: location, Everything else The Picasso is cheap but thats the only thing it's got going for it, if you're a student on a budget and want to be out all night fine, for everyone else not recommended. cheap and nasty.

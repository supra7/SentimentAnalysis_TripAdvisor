The manager at the hotel was the rudest lady i have ever delt with in my 46 years.They do a room inspection when you go to check out.This makes you feel like a criminal.What a joke!! The casino is filled with very drunk locals that are fighting all the time.I dont even smoke and the same drunks would try to mooch ciggs.every time i walked through the casino..I stayed in the hotel alone this trip.Than god!!! I would never bring my wife into a mess like this..I wouldnt stay in this dump again if they paid me.........

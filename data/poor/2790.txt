This is the first review I've ever written for Trip Advisor, but I had such a terrible experience at this hotel that I feel compelled to share it. I was traveling on business from the West Coast, and had to be up at 4:30 a.m. the next morning for a TV shoot. When I pulled back the covers to my bed, there were several long, dark hairs in the bed - enough to indicate that the sheets were not cleaned. When I called downstairs and requested a new room, I was told they were sold out, so I had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come change the sheets on the bed. Also, the internet did not work in the room (a large problem for a business traveler), and maintenance never showed up when I called to request it to be fixed. The minibar was broken, too. The "gym" was tiny, dirty, and half the machines didn't work. And RIGHT NOW I have been sitting on hold for 25 minutes and counting, trying to get a charge moved from my client's credit card to mine. This is the sixth time I've called. An absolutely abysmal hotel.

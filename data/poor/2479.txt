when booking the room i booked a garden view room when checking in i got s second floor balcony over lookin 3 smelly dumpsters with rats running all over the place when questioning hotel management( marshall gallen, james pulver, chris reeds) they increased my room rate and did not ,move me at all. talking to other guest at the hotel they do this alot. many hidden costs when checking out on your bill next time stay at the ritz carlton at kapula bay. ive traveled to over 42 countries and never got treated like this. traveler beware

Where do I begin to list what went wrong? 1. room type not availabe at check in 2. new room had used water 3. missing toiletries 4.broken tub, 5.used coffee in decanter from room service 6. extremely rude "whatever/whenever" customer service employee not to mention the noisy doors and smell of pot in the hallway at night third room was fine but the safe was locked. Make sure you get compensated for this type of stuff, its not acceptable to the W brand and they realize it

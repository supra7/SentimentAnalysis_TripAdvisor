I had to write this review to save you from picking this Hotel. It's doesn't deserve the 2.5 - 3 star rating. I got in late, so I put up with the hard spring like mattress and dust. But when I saw the holes and stains on all 3 towels plus there is rust on the shelves it turned me off. However, I was too tired and I've already unpacked so again I put up with it. However, at 3am I woke up to get a drink of water when I noticed a MICE crawling near my bed. I'm a guy, so I don't scream but I certainly don't want a mice crawlilng around while I sleep. So I had to try to sleep with all of the lights on to scare the MICE from coming out. I didn't get much sleep. Needless to say, I will NEVER go back to this place again. For $200/night, I would have expected a little bit more even for NY.

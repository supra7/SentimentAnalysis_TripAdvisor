We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. When we first arrived the rooms were very nicely decorated and seemed clean. One of the double beds seemed to be defective. It caved in the middle like a taco. We decided to give it a try but by the morning we realized she couldn't spend another night on the bed. When we went down to request another room in the morning they said that they were full and they could provide us with a cot at no extra charge. Really I didn't pay that money to sleep on a cot. I asked them to look at the bed to see if it could be fixed. We arrived back 3 hrs later and the front desk said they didn't know if it had fixed. When we went to the room it still was the same. Also the windows are paper thin so it felt like I was sleeping on the street because it was so loud. You could hear the dumpsters bring emptied at 4 am. Then there was the 7am wake up call I didn't request. When I told her that she said wrong number and hung up. There was a gas main break infront of the hotel so we had to wait 3 hours to get back in and then there was no heat or hot water till 7pm. The gas main break was at 9 am. When speaking with the staff they were less then helpful. When we were finally leaving they got us a taxi but took 5 dollars from the driver so she could have the fare SO TACKY! I will never stay here and I will tell everyone I know to NEVER stay there.

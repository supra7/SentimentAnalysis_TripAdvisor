I WOULD NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE! i stayed there from dec 18th to dec 23 and this was my worst stay in a hotel. there were bed bugs in my bed the first night i stayed in room 536, i didn't know until i woke up the next morning and found them under my sheets. They then moved me to room 402 and the same night i also found bed bugs. By this time i had over 45-50 bites on both of my arms and neck. thats when it occurred to me that they have had this happen a couple of times already...They then moved me a third time to another room, i don't remember the number ( i decide to just stop trying to remember, i had only 2 nights left at that time). They gave me on complimentary night, and had me sign a waiver.... one of the hotel staff said they had pest control in at least twice a week, and i suggested that obviously that wasn't working, maybe they should consider bombing the whole building to actually have a good shot at controlling the situation. today is December 26th, its been exactly 7 days since i had been bitten and the bites are still on my arm, still itchy but have finally started to go down i feel like i have waisted my money. The parking was horriffic, metered parking on Broadway from 8AM- 10 PM, $1.50 p hr and u have to pay every hour... no clue about the breakfast situation, i didn't want anything to do with that place.... no elevator, narrow hallways, the heater was ridiculous, too hot and then the air conditioner wouldn' t cool either... and u cant open any of the windows.... WOST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A HOTEL

We couldn't get out fast enough. We reserved a room for 4 nights for 2 adults and 2 kids. The hotel boasted confortably equipped rooms with a desk, t.v., cable, etc. and with breakfast next door at David's deli -- with 3 country fresh eggs, etc.The place was downright horrible. The beds were a cross between platform beds and futons that were so hard and the mattresses so thin that it was virtually impossible to get comfortable. The room looked nothing like the picture on the internet -- it was so small you could barely move around. The windows were so old and rickety that they kept none of the street noise out, so if you were lucky enough to fall asleep on the horrible bed, you would be awakened by noise from the street soon thereafter.The price quoted on the internet for 2 adults and 2 kids was $139/night. When we got there they tried to charge us an extra $10 for each kid. We told them that it didn't say there was an extra charge for the kids on their internet site. The receptionist went on the internet but couldn't find the additonal charge listed and still insisted that it was there somewhere. We said, if she couldn't findit how did they expect us to.The delicious breakfast at David's deli was barely edible and I don't know where they got their Equator Estate coffee, but the coffee at McDonalds is far better.We left after the first night and moved to the Park 55. Their on line rate was the same as the Touchstone and the place is truly lovely.Don't torture yourself by staying at the Touchstone. You deserve better.

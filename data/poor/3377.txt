Here's some information you will need to survive a stay at the commander 1. No WiFi. there is a small room off the parking area that allows two people at a time to get "hook up". With face book and kids....just leave the computer at home 2. no clocks in room. The call system doesn't work either so go down to the desk and get a wake up call. 3. no iron in the room. On a brighter note there are two irons total "nailed" to the wall in small very warm humid closets on two separate floors. Take a wash closth to prop the door open to the "closet". 4.Soap despensers like you find in gas stations are attached to the shower and sink walls. You do not get bar soap or shampoo. 5,do not complain, or make eye contact with the manager. She will do her level best to ruin your remaining stay. We were placed last on the "rom cleaning" for asking that a dirty diaper be reomved from the front steps last year, maid told us) 6.Restaurant keeps odd hours, no lunch is served. 7. I found the front desk to be nice excluding the manager (she is overweight, roughly 60, and well rough) 8. beds I would guess as old as the building, and hair dryers maybe too. I have stayed at this hotel since birth. Makes me sick they leave the Lynches on the wall (former owners) they would never have been a part of this. You will need sedatives, alcohol and aleeve to survive this vacation at the Commander hotel

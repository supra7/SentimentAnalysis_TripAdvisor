The only difference between the Maui Lu and a transient hotel in Gary Indiana is the palm trees and the price, at least in Gary they wouldn't have the nerve to charge $200.00 for a room that featured different and interesting insects, mold, fungus and tatoo-ed locals in the adjoining room throwing a beer bash. The so-called beach is the size of a bed and the property is located so far into the leeward side of the bay that I expected jimmy hoffa's body to float up. Spend an extra $100 a night at a four star hotel in Makena, like the Prince.

I have stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels including HGI across the country, but I have never had this kind of experience before. We checked in late on January 6th 2012 in the HGI and my room key could not be prepared, because the system was down. We were tired and just wanted to go to sleep, but had to wait about 45 minutes. When we checked into our room the room was a smoking room. When we officially complaint about it, we were asked to leave the hotel. Thank god there was another Hilton-Conrad right next door that was able to accommodate us. Needless to say, we will never stay at this HGI again.

I found pubic hair on the bed and the room next door had a weiro outside the door. This was the worst place to stay, infact I asked for a refund. The lady at the front wasn't too concerned about this situation. She tried to sent me to another room and had given me the wrong key. I knew then that I couldn't stay at this place; even though it was very late evening. What a waste of my time and energy. I would highly not recommend this place.

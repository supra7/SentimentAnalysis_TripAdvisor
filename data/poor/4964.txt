Botel Zebra's cabins are soooooo tiny and not very clean. The beds are made for 5 year olds. The tiny bathrooms are dirty and the shower curtains might be 100 years old. The "continental" breakfast consist of dry old bread and tasteless cold meet. I would really not recommend this botel to ladies or "romantic couples". Hope this helps. ;-)

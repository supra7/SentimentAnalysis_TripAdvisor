The walls were thin. We were kept up each night by people simply talking in the next room. The concierge desk were less than helpful with any problems I had. I was never offered a drink while I played the slot machines. I am mostly dissapointed in this hotel because I had a very bad experience with on of the tower shops ( Aqua Massage). The hotel would not help me resolve my issues. And I therefore feel ripped off. THe hotel is far from the action of the strip. We spent a fortune on cabs. We wasted a lot of time walking or waiting for a bus, which is why we ended up taking cabs. I do not recomend this hotel. Where other hotel do thier best to keep their customers happy, The Stratospher will do nothing at all.

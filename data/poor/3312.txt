I always thought Red Lions had a good reputaion and have had good experiences...this one was different. We got in about 10 PM - the gal checking us in was really nice. The halls really smelled like old smoke enouph that we were worried our room would reek too - luckily it did not.The room was actually OK..but old pieces and parts and A/C didn't work. The place needs updating very low ceilings and the outside is beat up. We missed our departure and need a late checkout..we asked if we could have a little more time - and the gal at the counter (the one with light brown hair in a bun in morning) wouldn't even look up at was very blunt and mean about having to be out at noon, because a number of people were to check-in..and- that we "had the right" to hang out in the lobby or connecting coffee shop. I understand - but the housekeepers had already cleaned a number of rooms so that wasn't the issue...and she wasn't letting people check-in anyway we heard her tell people not until 3PM---so we hung out in lobby with all our Hawaii luggage for an hour until our ride came. We won't stay at Red Lion SeaTac again.. All for $150.00

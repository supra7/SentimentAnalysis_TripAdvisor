My family of 4 booked for two nights. We stayed one. The halls were dark & smelled putrid. The rooms, save for bathroom was just weird and disjointed. My son accidentally left his $400 glasses bedside.. Easy enough to get back just hours after realizing his mistake right? WRONG!! The staff was less than helpful and "claimed" they looked for them but to no avail. They were rude and impatient. Best hotel in seattle?? Who and how much did they pay to say that? STAY ELSEWHERE! Waste of money and valuable time.

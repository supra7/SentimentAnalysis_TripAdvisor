Do not use the bank machines at the Freemont Hotel. The bank machines themselves are not what you need to worry about, it is the crooked casino cashier's. Whe you use the bank machines they provide you with a voucher you need to bring to the cashier. The cashier will find some reason that they cannot give you the cash. They will claim that if they do not process the voucher the funds will be returned to your account , this is NOT true. Instead of taking their word for it I contacted my bank who informed me that the money was out of my account and the transaction was closed. I agrgued with the unsavoury staff for about 15 minutes when they threatened to call security....I welcomed this and suggested they call the police as well so I could file a complaint. Some moments later their greasy supervisor arrived and I had to argue with him for 30 minutes. When they realized I was not taking no for an answer and would not leave until I received my money, they caved and handed me my cash. This put a bad spin on an otherwise great trip.

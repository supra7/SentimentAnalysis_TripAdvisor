Obviously has an overbooking problem Don't count on actually staying here, even if you have a confirmed reservation! Based on a previous review and our own recent experience, it appears this hotel regularly overbooks. What made this especially galling is that we had received a phone call from the Casablanca management the day before we arrived, to confirm that we would be coming for a four-night stay (3/27/04-3/31/04). Yet when we showed up at 5:00 pm to check in, we were told we did not have a room and fed a ridiculous and obviously invented story about a roof leak causing our room to be unavailable. (Suspiciously enough, they insisted the roof leak would be a problem only for Saturday and Sunday nights. They were absolutely certain it would be fixed for the last two nights of our stay -- the obviously less-in-demand Monday and Tuesday night.) They packed us off to the Royalton, right around the corner, and paid the difference in room rate for the first two nights, but they expected us to come back to the Casablanca for the last two nights. Talk about inconvenient. In any case we loved the Royalton and decided to stay there for our entire stay, even though we had to pay substantially more for the last two nights. Everything about the relocation made the trip much more expensive. For instance, the Casablanca includes free continental breakfast and free afternoon wine and snacks, while the hotel they substituted charges $21 for continental breakfast and a minimum of $10 for a glass of wine. Also, the Casablanca has free high-speed Internet access, while the substituted hotel charges $10 a night. Had we been on a tight budget, this experience would have been absolutely infuriating. Fortunately we could afford it. But we'll never book the Casablanca again.

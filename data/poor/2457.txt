We booked this hotel thru Travelocity with deluxe ocean view and king bed. When checking in we were offered a double bed no king beds were available.and we were told those are reserved for bookings directly through Westin.. We voiced our opinion to manager and she put us in a smaller room with king bed for one night. I was so disappointed as we took so much time booking the perfect hotel...bed, view, etc. We moved the next day to the room we originally booked. Very inconvenient as they would not accommodate after 12hrs of flying. Very noisy hotel even with windows shut.This is an old property and it is over due for a total renovation of their rooms. Bathroom shower curtain reaked like mold and I have had sinus issues since I arrived there. There was black mold in the shower area and I have pictures for anyone that would like to see them.If you want a spa I wouldn't recommend Spa Heavenly. Very small locker area.I asked for plastic for my wet bathing suit, and was told they no longer offer them since they have cut back. The gal was nice and got a plastic bag out of trash that I used. Blow drying my hair they had no brushes. Massage about a 5 and seemed rushed Overpriced for what you get. Great breakfast buffet and great comfy bed. Staff very friendly.Nice lobby and parrots were a nice touch, but rooms are not 5 star maybe a one. We travel to Maui often and will not return to Westin Resort & Spa nor recommend it to family or friends. So many other newer hotels to choose from...

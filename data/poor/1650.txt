This hotel needs an update badly. The pool was kinda green and not very inviting. Electrical outlets in the room were broken. Carpeting in the room looked dirty to the point you didn't want to take your shoes off. Iron didn't work and was replaced with another non-working model. Breakfast in the hotel dining room is an OK self-serve experience (eggs made to order). This was a bargain rate compared to other hotels, but you definately get what you paid for. I wouldn't stay there again.

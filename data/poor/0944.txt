We could not use the pool area because of the compressors running in the immediate area of the pool on a Sunday afternoon. A complaint was made at the front desk and in response to an e-mail and no follow up action was taken. When placing the reservation they did not state that construction activities would be ongoing and some of their facilities would not be available for use.

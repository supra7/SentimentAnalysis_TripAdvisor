We were stuck in one of the back rooms, not on the beach where I wanted to be. Friendly people, but room was so dirty I didn't want to walk around on the floor after my bath. The bathtub had terrible black stains in the bottom; the bathroom floor was filthy, as was the carpet. The sliding door to the patio was bolted shut, so it was impossible to get fresh air into the room. Dirt was built up on the baseboards, grimy fingerprints needed to be scrubbed off of the bathroom door and there were dead roaches in the bathroom in the morning. The coffee pot was never cleaned out and the towels were not delivered somtimes until 4 or 5 p.m. This hotel was once very nice, but has obviously fallen on bad times. Beds were so hard and lumpy and so uncomfortable that it was impossible to get a good nights sleep. Go somewhere else!

I found this hotel in the Frommers travel guide, and it sounded quaint. I like boutique hotels, but this one seemed as though the owners did not really pay attention to details or care too much about them. Our room had a dresser with missing knobs, a piece of the wall had loose wires hanging out as though the fire alarm or something was supposed to be there. I told them about the wall, and they didn't seem to care. They didn't come look at it or anything. Also, the walls are paper thin. We could hear every word of our neighbor's television (among other things). For the price of this hotel, we were expecting MUCH more. We originally had three nights booked here, and left after our first night because we were so dissatisfied.

Dont let them entice you to stay here. This is the absolute worst place to stay. It reminds me of a crack house that you see in the movies. It was 105 outside and the AC did not work it cooled the room down two degrees from 95 to 93. If you want your room cleaned you have to take the dirty stuff to the front desk. Are you kidding me? The place is very dirty too there were stains on everything including the lampshade. The shower curtain was covered in mold and the drain was plugged. There were no phones in the room so you could not call the front desk of you wanted to. The refrigerator in the room was rusted inside, and there is one dirty microwave in the lobby to share for all guests. It was so hot in the room that the people next to us slept outside on the porch. Please dont stay here they need to clean it up and realize people wont stand for that.

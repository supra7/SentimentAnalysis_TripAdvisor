My husband, teenage son and I spent 1 Saturday night at this Holiday Inn Express. We found the room to be clean but very cramped with 2 double beds. This hotel was formerly known as the Hotel Cass. Unfortunately when the hotel was renovated, the rooms were not enlarged and are cramped with odd shapes. Our room had only one lamp, so we didn't have a reading light. The room had only 2 cups, no hairdryer or kleenix. The walls were not soundproof so we heard the elevator dings, outside sirens and the neighbors shower. The room lacked a place to put suitcases, had no table or chair. We had actually changed from a room next to the elevator to avoid hearing the elevator going up/ down. Breakfast was cold foods with a sign indicating hot food "coming soon" which meant sometieme at a future date. The room had a tiny closet with a safe, the mattess was comfortable and staff accomodating. Location near Michigan Ave. The room rate seemed reasonable until we discovered the disappointing room. We expected more from a Holiday Inn Express.

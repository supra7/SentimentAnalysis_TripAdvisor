We have stayed at several budget hotels and don't expect mints on the pillow or valet service but we do expect it to be clean and comfortable. What we found was a dump that was falling apart. We were booked for 7 nights but only stayed one and changed hotels. (United Vacations was very accommodating in getting a refund for the remaining nights and rebooking us in another hotel) Their idea of a beach is a 50' wide strip of sand between the rocks & the pool was so cloudy and nasty you couldn't see the bottom in the shallow end. We wondered when we checked in and they gave us an 8-1/2 by 11" sheet of paper that cautioned us to double lock all doors and windows, secure every valuable in the safe, not leave anything in the car and to report any suspicious persons. This warning was repeated in the room and in the parking lot. Although good advice, didn't give us a warm feeling. It appears that they are only keeping this place open until they can tear it down and build a new high rise.

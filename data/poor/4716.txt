This hotel has to be the worst setup in all of Philadelphia. Surrounded entirely by one-way streets, complete with no stopping signs everywhere (parking wars anyone?), this hotel is wedged between buildings on either side and does not have four walls to call its own. Situated in China Town the streets are bustling at all times of the day. I drove around the hotel's location three times before calling them...since I couldn't pull to the curb...and cancelling my reservation. I booked through expedia who put me on hold for twenty minutes at $2.00/minute roaming charge to complete the transaction. Thank god for the Mariott Courtyard which was a few blocks away and a whole different ball game. Travelodge does NOT have on site parking. They expected me to park two blocks away, walk through the streets with my luggage/ small children and not to worry. Crackheads are literally everywhere. The homeless are a serious problem in this area of town. I could go on and on...do not stay here.

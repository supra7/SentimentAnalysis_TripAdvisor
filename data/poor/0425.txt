I chose this place because it was close to the space needle, looked clean online and offered a continental breakfast, plus parking. I placed the reservation for a non smoking room with 2 beds since I was with my 2 young children. When I got there they had my reservation all wrong! The told me they were doing me a favor and would give me the last room they had with 2 beds and was non smoking. The parking was supposed to be free but I was charged for it. When I finally got checked in, they did get me a room with 2 beds but it was smoking, actually the whole place besides the lobby smelled like smoke. The carpeted floor was sticky, the clock didn't work and there was mildew in the bathroom. We were only going to be there for about 7 hours and I didn't want to try to find a place at 10:00 pm. When people started coming in the early morning they made so much noise they woke us up, you could here EVERYTHING GOING ON. In the morning the "continental" breakfast consisted of mini muffins, mini bagels w/ creme cheese and orange juice. That was it. No butter, no jam nothing else. They wanted their plastic knives back to reuse. If you go to this place, make sure you are up to date on all of your shots, you might need it!

Bates Motel Avoid this place at all cost. Everything you read about this hotel is true. However, I had to learn about it the hard way. I had the miserable pleasure of staying at the Touchstone for two seemingly endless, sleepless nights. The rooms itself are very small. There is barely any space to do anything in the room. The beds are very bad, not comfortable at all. The tv's are very small, about a 13 inch. The bathrooms are unbelievably small and outdated. There is mold and mildew throughtout the tiny bathroom. And I dont think this place has heard of a thing called water pressure because there is none for the shower stall. The carpets are filthy and the bed linen is very questionable.  The service at the front desk is equally bad. When you arrive there will be no one at the front desk. The receptionist also pulls double duty at the diner next door. They claim they are always booked up but you see very few people coming in and out the hotel. The day I came to check in, she knew exactly who I was. It seemed like I was the only one checking in for that day. The hotel has one elevator serving the entire hotel. The elevator and the halls smell very bad. The two night I stayed, I had to use an oil burner to mask the smell of the hotel. A very unpleasant experience. STAY AWAY,YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!

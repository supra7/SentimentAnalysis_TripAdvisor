My wife and I were in Baltimore to have her treated at John Hopkins. Room on 11floor with 2 walls of glass had A/C that ran all the time and could not keep up. Temp in room was over 80 degrees. No response from person at front desk when we brought this up. Additional charges were added to room for a "made to order breakfast". We received a voucher for this at check in. The restaurant did not offer this, only a small buffet with hour old food and the fresh fruit containers were empty. The complaint card that we filled out has never been answered. We filled out a customer survey online on the Hilton website. We got 2 generic emails, never addressing either issue. Hilton has serious management problems at this hotel. And has poor to non-existent customer relations in dealing with their customers.

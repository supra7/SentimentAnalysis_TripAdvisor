We stayed here in July...thought being Trump that we could expect a quality experience, but sadly, so far from the truth. It starts with the additional fees for parking - it is ONLY valet and they charge you about $17 extra, per day. Although the valet guys were nice enough, it was sometimes quite a wait. The pool hours are ever changing and are not accurately reflected in the hotels' information book (when asked about this - they said the book was outdated - which is hard to beleive since this hotel only opened 3 months prior to our arrival). One night when arriving back to the hotel, it appeared as though someone had used our toilet and clogged it!!!! This was reported and security came to check it out. The same night, our extra pillows were missing and it took OVER 2 hours to get the pillows, after a snarky reply from the front desk that we should check the cupboards (this was our 6th day here - we certainly knew where the extra pillows were). The day we were checking out, we had requested a LATE check out - security came banging on the door (ignoring the do not disturb sign) at about 9am to have us fill out a form about the toilet complaint!!! A bit later, now up and getting ready to leave - SOME RANDOM GUY WALKED INTO THE ROOM, apparently checking in, however I was in the bathroom changing at the time.......Hotel security and front desk staff said it must have been a mistake when they gave someone the key to our room before we had checked out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Although some nice flash....this is all it is. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! Stay somewhere, where they know it vegas an treat you accordingly!!!!!

Pros: friendly front desk staff convenient location such as close to restaurants ect. cons: we had to be moved to another room cause a pipe under the sink broke and soaked the carpet and stunk up the room. dirty smelly room stained carpet,I would not walk barefoot on this carpet if I were you. the guest laundry room was less than to be desired,DONT USE IT,it will rip you off,didnt dry clothes right after putting 3 dollars in machine kids running up and down the breezeway making noise waking us up. shifty characters. I would park kind of far from other cars or you will wind up with a dented car. if you can afford it,stay elsewhere,trust me you will be better off,trust me.

Arrogant and complacent Oh dear oh dear oh dear.Arrived with several bags in a taxi from the airport. Not a bell-hop in sight. Struggled into the lobby with the bags, the reception staff just watched us no effort made to assist.The receptionist was rudeness personified. Sure, we had a pre-paid rate, but that doesn't constitute any requirement for contempt in my opinion.We had to wait over 30 minutes for luggage to be brought up. I tried to telephone, no response. Went down in person, bell-hop rude.The room was very, very small. Bathroom was OK.Top of the Mark bar has a lofty view, and prices to match.We most certainly will not be coming back.

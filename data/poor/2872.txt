For a hotel chain which sells itself as such an amazing experience, they make very little effort to live up to their promises. I have stayed in three W hotels, and each time the experience has varied from extremely expensive and mediocre to downright dreadful. So, this hotel in particular. I have been given a room about 7 feet by 20. That includes the bathroom, the closet and the bedroom. The air conditioning didn't work, they had to send an engineer to dismantle it. The room is on its own down a tiny passageway which looks like it leads to a cleaning closet (which would be a better use for the room) next to the ice machine, which makes an incredibly loud clanking noise when people use it. And I'm a "Gold" Starwood card holder, entitled to complimentary upgrades when available! Last time I stayed in a W - the one in Times Square - they actually DOWNgraded me - I had paid for one of their best rooms, at some expense and for a particular reason of a romantic nature. We were put in a tiny standard room which smelled of bleach - there was no apology, in fact they didn't even acknowledge that they had put us in the wrong room and when I enquired they said there were none available (even though I had booked and paid in advance). They wouldn't have refunded me the difference unless I had asked the manager. In Sydney, the W is much hyped bit inconveniently located, staggaringly overpriced and has very unexciting rooms. The Westin, its sister hotel, is much better in every way and actually in the center of town. In short, this chain fails to live up to its very high standards. Their hotel guide says that they "promise to make all your dreams a reality". Well... as long as your dreams don't include a decent room and air conditioning which works, that is. Not to mention value for money,

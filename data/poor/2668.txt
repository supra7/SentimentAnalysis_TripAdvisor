I reserved the Soniat House in July of 2010 for the Essence Festival and the room was $675.00 a night. My credit card was billed for one night in advance. I called to downsize because I was traveling alone as oppose to traveling with my family. Now mind you I stayed with them the year before and paid $650.00 per night in 2010. I saw online there were rooms available and I couldn't believe they treated me the way they did. The staff in the evening said it wouldn't be problem and the next morning I was told they couldn't downsize me because they were a small property and they couldn't afford to take the loss. I was so shocked!! and couldn't believe my ears......they could have at least given me half of the last night of my stay....nothing. I can assure you I will spread the word and let Essence Staff and Press to never ever recommend or put this hotel on their website for their event. I will also inform the Jazz Festival employees to do the same. Maybe when we stop staying there and wasting our hard earned money, Soniat will take classes on how to give better customer service for repeated business.

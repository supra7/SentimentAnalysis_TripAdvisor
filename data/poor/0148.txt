I checked in to a $120 suite and at first glance it looked fine, apart from the view of the rooftop ducts and carpark. The fridge was the first issue. The ice box was broken and turned the entire fridge into a freezer. Everything I had bought from the local grocery store, after a long-haul flight from London, was frozen solid when I got up the next day. The fridge was replaced, but no apology made for the wasted food. The second issue was the WiFi. Nobody could access it. It requires a username and password. The ones supplied by the front desk were rejected. The manager came round and said the router was broken. After he appeared to have fixed it and left, the problem persisted. The third and most important issue was the desk clerk. His name is Robert and he quickly grows impatient when you report problems, blaming it on "the guest's equipment". I said that without WiFi I would need to check out, since I am on a business trip and need to access emails. His reply was "Awesome" and "Have a nice evening". After a long flight and business to conduct this is the last thing you need. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are looking for a hostel. The prices are modest, but the staff do not like dealing with problems with the room. I got the impression it is family run, with the desk staff being relatives who do not need to worry about complaints from guests.

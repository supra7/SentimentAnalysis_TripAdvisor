Our five night stay was the worst in NY ever. The carpets in the rooms were soiled and torn; in some places the carpet was gone and we could see the concrete slab. For over 36 hours a room service tray from another room remained on the floor in the hallway. Rooms are TINY. The wait staff in the restaurant is way too pushy, the food was adequite, but no more. In the evenings, the lobby is a mad house. The bar is packed and the music is loud. The front desk is snotty. Breakfast for two ran us $60. without the tip; this consisted of coffee, juice, bacon & eggs, and toast. This hotel needs a major renovation. would not stay there again, not at those prices. We would have been better off across the street at the Waldorf.

As you walk into the hotel, you will smell stale tobacco smoke and the smoke will follow you during our entire visit. The smoke can be tasted in the food and beverages purchased on the first floor of the hotel. I went with three other women, two came down with bronchitis due to heavy smoke exposure (they are none smokers). Absolutely no ventilation. The hotel is not near the action, too far off the strip to enjoy the Vegas experience. If you leave the hotel, you must take a cab or walk through a rough area of town. One can walking to the Monorail a few blocks away -so that is an option. Do not take the bus!! The buses fill up quickly, the drivers are rude and you must have the exact change to board or buy a ticket. Plus, the bus will kill part of your day, getting to your location. Claustrophobia doesn't begin to express the bus ride, its also dirty. There is not a microwave or coffee pot in the room. Actually, I did not find the hotel had anything to offer that I couldn't find at a hotel at the strip. By the time we paid for a taxi cab to take up to shows and leave a tip, we could have paid for a room on the strip, and had greater access to events. I will not return to the Stratosphere.

Avoid this place at all costs. My organization booked 20 rooms at the Blake for an upcoming event nearby. When we needed to make changes to the reservations, we found the reservation line went unanswered, and responses by email were very slow. I finally visited the surprisingly dumpy Blake in person and found chaos and angry customers at the front desk. My handwritten note to the General Manager to please call me ASAP was never answered. We then cancelled all of our rooms about a week ahead of time. The Blake sent an email confirming the cancellations and promising that none of us would be charged. Despite that promise, the Blake charged my credit card for one night's stay and did the same to one of my colleagues. The Blake did not respond to my faxes, emails, letters or phone calls, but eventually my credit card company persuaded the Blake to reverse the charges. Four months later, however, my colleague is still fighting to have her $179 charge reversed. No one at the Blake will respond to her in any way. Between the two of us we've spent dozens of hours trying to reverse charges that should never have been imposed in the first place. Incredibly bad customer service, and an incredibly frustrating experience.

I left me jacket behind. I called from the airport. I spoke to Vanessa. She said she had my jacket at her desk and could arrange to have it sent to me. That was on December 12th. Since they I have tried to get my jacket back from Vanessa, who is concierge, from Kion in reservations in miami (he is suppposedly a supervisor) and from Johanna who is the sales manager of the Azul Fives. On January 28th Johanna told me that she would ship my jacket and send me a tracking number and I have not heard from her since. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor can I recommend it to anyone else. While the staff on the ground at the hotel is lovely, they are poorly managed, and the conceiege service was terrible the entire time we were there.

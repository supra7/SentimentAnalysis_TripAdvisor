The location is good but the service was really awful. We waited 1h the car from the parking where the average pick up time is 20min, we should stay out of the room for an entire morning due to the cabling of the wifi; after the work they left the room dirty; the worst thing was that when we complained about these problems the reception guy was totally unconcerned and served us very bad Totally unacceptable

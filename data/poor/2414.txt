This hotel has been called one of the "best in the world" by a popular travel publication. Take it from someone who has stayed at some of the best properties in the world, this hotel is utterly average! The rooms remind me of staying in a Marriott Courtyard property. Nothing fancy, lots of pastel colors, dated decor. The hotel staff are poorly trained and do not live up to the Ritz standard. The restaurants food is below average and the service is substandard. When the staff was told it was our Honeymoon the best we got was a congrats and have a great time. At $395 a night, and a gold level Marriott customer, I expected more! The location is just ok, the beach area is exposed and is dangerous for small children and older adults. There are great snorkling and protected coves a short bus ride away. The pool is nice and there is adequate seating on the busiest of days. The grounds are beatifully landscaped and are the hotels only saving grace.

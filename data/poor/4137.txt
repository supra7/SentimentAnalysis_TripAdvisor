The Whitehall advertizes itself as once being Chicago's premier hotel. Unfortunately, those days are long gone. Although the bar and lobby faintly echo lost days of glory, the halls were dirty and smelled stale, the rooms had damaged furniture, the bathrooms are tiny and dark. Worse, the manager was surly and the persons who parked our vehicle were careless with items stored in the vehicle. It appeared that it was given the "Ferris Bueller" treatment. We stay in Chicago frequently, and this is one place we will not revisit.

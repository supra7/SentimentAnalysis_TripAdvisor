We went to NYC for my friend's bachelorette weekend and I was extemely dissapointed in the W! One of our friend's had our rooms held with her credit card at a rate of $199/night which is an excellent price. When we arrived, they told her the credit card expired (it was valid at the time the reservations werre made) and that we will now be charged $279/night. No one contacted her regarding the expired card even though it was to simply HOLD the room, not pay for it. In addition to that, we get to the room and it has 2 twin beds in it. We had 2 rooms and 7 people in them. When the reservations were made, they were aware that there were to be 7 people and they still put us in rooms with twin beds. When we confronted them about it, they told us NONE of the rooms have larger beds. Peering out our window, we noticed King, Queen, and Full size beds!!! They ended up rolling cots into our rooms, but the rooms were so small, there was nowhere for them to go. Another negative event that occurred in our room was the horrific experience with room service. We had come home from a night out and 3 of the girls in my room wanted to order pizza. We did not have any menus in our room, so they called room service and orders 3 personal pizzas. When the pizzas arrived they tried to charge them $60 for 3 personal pizzas!! It seemed like some kind of joke! We told the room service guy nevermind and to take them back. He started yelling at us and was quite frightening. He called his manager and the manager said to take them back! The only nice thing surrounding this hotel is Bliss Spa and the Whiskey Bar. This was one of my worst hotel experiences EVER! I will NEVER return to this overpriced DUMP!!

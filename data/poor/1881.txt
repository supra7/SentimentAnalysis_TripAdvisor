The room was tiny and the staff was rude. I had to wait until almost 5 pm to check in because they were overbooked. I had over $100 in charges on my bill for room service I never got, movies I never ordered, and calls I never made. They told me when I checked out that apparently that same bill had been slipped under the door of everyone on my floor because there was a computer glitch. Don't you think someone would notice that every single person on the same floor ordered the same thing and was getting the exact same bill? Clearly no one knows what's going on here. I would never stay there again. Aside from the lobby, there's nothing nice about the furnishes. The location is great, which is why I booked it, but I would rather spend $50 more bucks to stay somewhere that's really a four star hotel.

I have moved out to Singapore to work and stayed in this hotel until I could find more permanent accommodation. It was not a pleasant stay, and was very expensive for what it was. The rooms were very small, there was really only enough room for a bed. There was no floor space for putting a case down, let alone anywhere to hang clothes up, so living here for a week was very difficult. There as absolutely no storage space at all. There was tiny flies flying around the room which appeared to have come up from the drains. The walls were very thin and you could hear a baby crying all night from down the corridor, in addition, work men began digging the road up at 8am. The sheets were changed every day, as long as you put the sign on the door, but often we received ripped, dirty sheets and they were very thin, as were the towels which were covered in holes. They also provided no handtowels nor a towel for the floor, which after a shower became very slippy. Under the bed was dirty and covered in bits. The internet was very pricey and the phones in the room was so bad that it was impossible to have a conversation as it seemed a poor connection. Overall, the I had to check out early, I was booked for 9 days and booked out after 6, incurring an early check out fee of 1 nights room rate. The staff on the main desk were not very friendly or helpful. I would advise people to not stay here, I will have a number of visitors coming to see me while I am out here and although this hotel is conveniently located for where I am, I would strongly suggest they don't stay here.

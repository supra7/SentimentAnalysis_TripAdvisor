I have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and this was by far the worst I have ever stayed at and most certainly not worth the price. I know this is Vegas and no hotel will be as good as Europe or Asia, but the place was loud, busy and the service was not up to what i would expect as a Wynn property. When we arrived our room was not made up and when we companied no-one helped us to move to a new room (where the new key did not in fact work.) Again, more complaints and no support. I actually refused to pay the bill (of course charged anyway.) But overall I would not stay here again. No way is this hotel worth the price.

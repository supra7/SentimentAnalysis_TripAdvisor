Terrible! We came with good will to stay for four days. We payed for Four Days, stayed only one no refund. the staff was a guy in a old t-shirt with a bad attitude. The hallway was cold as well as the room. Breakfast or as they called it, terrible! Dont make the same mistake. Something is really wrong with this hotel and the staff. If You renovate the Hotel, the staff should try even more to satisfy the guests. I would fire these if they worked for Me!!

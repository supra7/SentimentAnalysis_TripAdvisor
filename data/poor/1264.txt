If you need paternalistic advice this may be the hotel for you. On the other hand if you are capable of making some basic arrangements for yourself and dont need to be advised of what is obvious for any guide book there may be better options for you. My wife and I fell into the second category and the initial pleasant and enthusiastic response from the staff waned into aloofness when it became apparent we did not need their advice and or assistance. Not sure about what arrangements they may have had with 3rd party supplies of services, but it did cross our minds that this may have contributed to coolness after a day or two. The power of the internet, we booked the hotel because of positive reviews. Our experience did not align with the majority of the positive reviews. The hotel had trip advisor review page as their home page on the public access computer. Due to my experience at the hotel I will now have a circumspect view of hotels who adopt this arrangement. Our stay was for 5 nights on mid September, I have since been back to Istanbul and have had the privelge of staying at a comparable priced hotel in relative proximity that was far better value for money, with a higher quality of professional service and all in all a fare superior experience. Overrated, overpriced, much better options available. Rod and Jessie - Australia

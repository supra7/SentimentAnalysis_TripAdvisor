We stayed at the Time Hotel in NYC from 8/13/05 through 8/16/05. I booked a "superior" room with either a queen or king sized bed through ORBITZ. The room had the smallest QUEEN sized bed I have ever slept in. At my house that size is called "FULL" size. The room was very dark and small and looked out onto a lovely hole filled with big huge pipes surrounded by the rest of the hotel rooms. Lovely view!! And this room was termed a SUPERIOR room!!!! The one good thing was the location was very good, although there was a hotel right next door which was much cheaper. I am unhappy with both the TIME Hotel as well as Orbitz for not living up to the advertisement.

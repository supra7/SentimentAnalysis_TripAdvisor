The Ritz is great! We have been there 3 times. Christmas Eve we wanted to do something extra special so we read the reviews on the Ritz web site and decided to go for The Banyon Tree Restaurant since it was Voted #1 by the local Maui Newspaper. It is a JOKE!! This is like walking into a swiming pool hamber restaurant and paying $200.00 for a meal that is terrible. The atmosphere is non existant, the food is terrible and we paid a fortune. Funny enough the waiter kept the smile on our face. I think he was a French circus actor or something and at the end of the evening when we were walking out he brought the GM up to us and he asked the ultimate question: "How was it?". My wife begged me not to be truthful but I told him DAIRY QUEEN was much better. The food is awful, and the atmosphere is terrible. His excuse about the atmosphere was canceled reservations. We were at the hotel the next evening at another restaurant which was wonderful and it was still very lacking. Don't wast you money on this one. The Ritz is great this restaurant is terrible and the GM should be washing dishes to rejunivate his resaurant skills.

Just returned from Maui where we planned to spend 10 days at the Grand Wailea. The setting is beautiful but the rooms, the staff, the cleanliness and the service left us wondering what we were paying so much money for. Our room suffered from deferred maintenance; the bedding was not clean; the mattress was broken down on one side; the tile in the bathroom was stained and often not cleaned well by housekeeping; the shower head leaked more water from the valve than it sprayed. When asked to leave extra towels, housekeeping simply took the tip and moved the note to the nightstand, ignoring the request entirely. We reserved and paid $275.00 in advance for a cabana at the pool and had to spend the entire day policing the chairs that were included with the cabana because the hotel does not provide different towels to indicate that those are reserved chairs. When we asked for a different cabana location after our third day in the same one (we wanted a change of scenery), we were told that we could have that same cabana or none. The food was mediocre at best, and very expensive, although the wait staff at every place we ate was friendly and helpful. On the fourth day we sought the assistance of a manager for the smelly bedding and inability to get enough towels for each of us to have just one. The solution was to remove the feather bed and down comforter and leave us with a lightweight blanket and cheap mattress pad. The attitude was "if you don't like it we can make it worse for you." Our bill was in excess of $1200. per day with the standard room in the lagoon wing, cabana and food we charged to the room-not worth it for that kind of attitude! We checked out on the fifth day and moved to The Four Seasons where we had exquisite service, food and our room was clean and free of deferred maintenance. Our bill was much lower and our vacation was revived.

What was supposed to be a wonderful weekend getaway turned into a stupid hassle over a $20 charge. No help from the staff and after endless phone calls and emails, I gave up. It is a beautiful place but they charge incredible prices for it and then add charges after you check out. I'd like to see this place go out of business. They ruined our weekend with their stupidity.

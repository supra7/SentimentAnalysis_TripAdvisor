We booked this hotel because of the service an quality I usually get from an Embassy suite hotel but this one I was extremely disappointed. When we got to our room it was one king instead of 2 queen. Then they said they had to put us in the second building which was thru the parking garage across the street. Then rooms were smaller and the ammenities not the same as main building. Before you book this hotel make sure you do your homework and they put you in the new main building that they advertise.

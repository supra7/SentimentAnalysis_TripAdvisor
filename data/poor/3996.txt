Hotel is under renovation and it is an absolute mess. It's noisy and the whole place is boarded up with plywood. I was horrified by the sight of the place -- I've seen many hotel remodels, this is definitely the worst. The front desk staff is rude - wow, the service was bad. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, one lady - tall w/ grey hair, had the nerve to laugh in my face. The only thing this hotel has going for it is location - do yourself a favor and stay somewhere comfortable with friendly staff who care about the customer experience. Millenium certainly doesn't -- I tried to call their Corporate Offices to tell them about my experience and they let all the calls go to a general voicemail box with no access to a live human.

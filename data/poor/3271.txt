To be honest this hotel may suit some people but we had just come from the Bellagio and to this standard of hotel it just didnt compare but even though it was not the standard we were expecting so we went up the road to the Marriott - lovely there was three of us and the beds are so small along with the rooms that all out suitcases didnt even fit in the room and you could leave them open as there was not where to walk?? It is old but has character and again if it was for one of two people at the most per room it would be ok, but too small for three adults

I stayed at the Eighth Avenue Inn last weekend and it was the worst place I've ever stayed. The room was dirty and the facilities were run-down.The management allowed people to loiter in the halls and parking lot all night long which prevented us from getting any sleep. The next morning we found a different place to stay and checked out. I waited until we got to the new room to shower because I was too scared to get in the dark, tiny and dirty stall at this dump.

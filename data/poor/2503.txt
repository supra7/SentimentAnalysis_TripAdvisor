Not so great hotel. The location of Marseilles is great if you want to be in the heart of South Beach. We chose this hotel becuase we thought it would be close to the Port of Miami. The hotel has a musky smell because it is very old. We had a roach run out of our room thankfully we were only there for one night. The bed is comfy but the the television is horrible with very little stations to choose from. Don't even try to use the business center downstairs in the lobby, the internet was so slow that dial up would have been faster. The daytime staff was friendly but the afternoon/evening staff was very rude and unhelpful as we asked what restaurants were good in the area and they didn't want to help us. The room is very small and cramped much like European hotels. The walk to the beach is very short and the pool is nice. I wouldn't stay here again nor would I stay in Miami. We found out very quickly that the people there are very bitter and rude so that will be the last time we stay in Miami.

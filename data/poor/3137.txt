Hotel Rex almost ruined my honeymoon.....I`ve stayed at this "boutique" hotel at room 316 last week and it possibly was my worst experience in an American hotel. The problems and lousy service started at the check in: the front desk officer checked every detail in my passport and US Visa for full five minutes, using even a small flashlight to check any possibility of fraud: I never was treated in any US hotel as an illegal immigrant or passport fraudster and even in other Joie de Vivre Hotel (the Erwin Hotel, were I stayed later) the treatment was much nicer. The room was terrible: extremely small, we were forced to move our luggage (2 medium suitcases) everytime that we wanted to use the bathroom. Almost no decoration, , an old and ugly closet, windows covered with dust and a crack in the bathrub floor covered with a plastic adhesive. In the morning we decided to check other nearby hotels and we found at least three hotels with much better rooms in similar prices or worth the extra bucks. We decided to check out at Rex and change hotels, but there was a last surprise at the "Rex Experience": the room was not cleaned by noon (the housekeeping request was at the door since 8 AM !).

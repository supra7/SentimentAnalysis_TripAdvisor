I have stayed at dozens of hotels in New York City ranging from the YMCA and its shared bathroom facilties right through to the 5 star hotels of Lexington Ave...this latest trip was by far the worst. Let's put aside for the moment that the one day hotel bill (including parking and cocktails in the lounge) was almost $700!! Instead, let's review the service and accomodations. When we checked in, the greeting was couteous and friendly and the service was decent. When we arrived at our room (or our high priced 10' x 10' sardine can), we found soon enough that $700 doesn't buy you a sink or shower that actually drain...nor does it buy you a TV that works. It does however buy you a heater with a broken thermostat that will keep your room at an unbearable 90 degrees. Oh yeah, and it also buys you the thinnest walls of any hotel I've ever stayed in to compliment the noisiest neighbors I've ever had. Oh well, at least repeated calls to the front desk scared off the neighbors who choose instead to head out to the bar - which incidentally closed at around 4 am...which brought our now-drunk neighbors back to their room. Further attempts to call the front desk were fruitless. If I were planning a trip to the Big Apple, I'd stay far, far away from W Hotels.

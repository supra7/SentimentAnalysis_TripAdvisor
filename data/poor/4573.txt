This hotel has the makings of a solid entry level boutique hotel but is totally let down by the miserable and unhelpful attitude of the front desk staff. I stayed this week and most of my colleagues also staying at the hotel echoed these sentiments. If I was the manager of this hotel I'd promptly be setting up some basic customer service training for the front desk team. On the flip side, the most charming and helpful person at the hotel was the bell captain. Great shame to have such inconsistency in the service quality.

paid $100 and had our car broken into We booked this hotel through a park, sleep and fly website at the last minute because our flight was rescheduled. What a mistake! We paid a ridiculous $100 for one night in a room with sticky carpets and for 2 weeks parking. We returned to find our car had been broken into, even though we parked it as close as we could to the registration desk and the front of the hotel where it was well lit. They stole our insurance papers so we assumed they tried to get a new key cut and coded at a dealer (but were unsuccessful) and luckily we didn't have our house broken into while we were gone. But our car was damaged and the battery was dead because they left the car door ajar. What a terrible way to end a great family vacation.

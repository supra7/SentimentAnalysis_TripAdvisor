I stayed here for a business trip in August 2010. My reservation had a special rate, but the front desk lady would not let me check-in because I didn't have the proper ID to secure the rate. I informed her my coworker who would be arriving, would have the proper ID and paperwork for both our rooms. She said there was nothing she could do. So I sat and waited in the lobby for 45 minutes for my coworker to arrive. As soon as my coworker arrived, another front desk associate was helping him and didn't ask for any ID or paperwork at all. My coworker is also a Marriott Rewards member, either silver or gold, so he was being treated very well. I come up behind my coworker and start talking to him and all of a sudden the lady who would not let me check in says she was looking for me and would've let me into the room and checked ID later. Well lady, I was sitting in the lobby the whole time and not once did you ever make an effort to look for me. YOU ARE A LIAR and full of BS. Not to mention, you never checked for ID or paperwork later. This experience made me appreciate Hilton Hotels so much more. They have never hassled me and not let me check-in with the special rate. The rooms themselves were very nice, but I would never come back here because of the way I was treated.

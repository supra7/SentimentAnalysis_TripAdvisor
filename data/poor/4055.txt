Have stayed in several chicago hotels and this is one we will cross off the list and never stay there again. On reservation requested late checkout, upon arrivial requested late checkout again. My daughter was competing in a gymnastic event that did not get over with until 1:00pm, husband called hoted to reassure the late checkout, asst. manager said there would be a $75.00 fee. He had to leave the event. Noisy neighbors all night long, management did nothing, requested to be moved, all had to clear the room at 1 30am if we wanted to. (child already asleep) had to call the noisy room ourselves. Daughter had to be up at 6:00am. There is a charge just to use the pool. Not worth it considering the water temp, was cold. Staff was rude and did nothing to help our situation. Great view from room that is about it.

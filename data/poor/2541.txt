My husband booked a stay out at Auberge to celebrate my birthday. And though it was a very lovely place the service was awful!!!!! When we pulled up, then bellmen didn't pay us any attention. The person at the desk who checked us in, could care less about her job or the people who were asking questions. The boy who took us to our room flung open the door shuffled us inside and slammed the door on the way out. I couldn't believe it!!!!! Both my husband and I work in the industry and we were disgusted! We ordered breakfast in room, it was delicious, but again the room service attendant sloppily set out the food on our table. We decided to check out early due to the very poor service, and we had the same awful service at checkout. Because we were so stunned by the poor service all around, I wrote a long email to the General Manager upon our return home. I have yet to have any response from him and it has been three weeks. I cannot believe what great customer service has become, and the fact the GM wouldn't care enough to even respond to a guest complaint. It is ludicrous! We will never stay here again, I can't believe they have been rated so high. It disgusts me!

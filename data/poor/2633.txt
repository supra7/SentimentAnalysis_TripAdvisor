This is a great location in the French Quarter. The building has a lot of character and charm, but the room we were given was a windowless dungeon. It felt like a storage closet converted to to a room. The worst part of the experience is that our car was damaged in the parking garage. Parking is expensive ($25 per day). We noticed after leaving the hotel that the front bumber had been pulled off. It was clear that the attendant had manually put the bumper back in place to discguise the damage.

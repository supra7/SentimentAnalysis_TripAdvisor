Not clean, understaffed and awful service. Room smelled terrible, had to change. No doorman or anybody to help you with a bag. Valet parking a joke, nobody around, must find someone to park the car for $24 a day. Return to hotel after midnight, told to park on street and get car at 6:am because no valet on duty. Good location to musuems but spend the extra money someplace else and enjoy your travel. This place is a cash cow for owners, take out revenue, put nothing in.

After a full day at Sea World, we returned to our room, and our son noticed that his clothes was all over the floor, and the bag was missing. We thought at first that this was his own doing, however a search of the room did not turn up the bag. Odd.... Then we started getting concerned. Sure enough, our LAPTOP (inside a suitcase in the closet) had been stolen! The bad guys apparently got in, found the laptop, emptied my son's bag and used that to take the laptop away. Nothing else was stolen. We notified management and called police. Management's response was basically, "gee, sorry." Security did send up someone to read the cardkey reader, however for some strange reason, they couldn't access the server. They essentially blamed us for not putting the laptop in the safe (like anyone puts their laptop in the safe...they don't fit in most places anyway). We asked for some sort of bag in which to re-pack our son's clothes, but they couldn't even be bothered with that, and in fact, derisively told us that they couldn't just give luggage away. We weren't asking for luggage. We ended up packing him in a few laundry bags. Their insurance denied our claim (no surprise there), but no one ever explained how it was possible that anyone got into our room that day. Hilton corporate wasn't helpful, either.

DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL .The rudest staff i have ever come across. Also the most unhelpful. my friend had just arrived from 20 hours round trip from overseas and before going to his hotel wanted to meet me in my hotel room. the staff refused to let him in, which quite frankly was staggering. Despite our protests they would not even let him use the hotel restrooms. Their condecending and totally rude manner was appaling. In addition the room I stayed in was more like a prison cell and was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. I could strectch out and touch both walls!! The bathroom was so small i had to squeeze into the shower that had a non existent curtain allowing water to cover the bathroom floor. TRULY THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN

We were with a large group of folks who were in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl. Before we arrived, we were told one of the elevators was out so we'd all have to be patient when going to our rooms. We were assured the second elevator would be fixed by the following day. Need I say that this never happened and in reading past reviews I find out that for at least 3 years they have had difficulty with elevators. The lobby was fairly nice, so who would suspect that when you exited the elevator on your floor you would be hit with a horrible moldy stench that did not abate when you went into your room, in fact, it only exacerbated over time and its a non-smoking hotel. Cigarette smoke would have been better. We had a wonderful dinner at Shula's on Canal Street, then went back to our stinky rooms. By that time I was so tired, I didn't notice much, but when I woke up in the morning I had no problems noticing that I had NO hot water for my bath. I was kind of stiff from the bus ride and was looking forward to a hot bath. That was just not going to happen. Oh, did I mention that there was a bathtub ring? The water was initially lukewarm and went quickly to cold. When I told the manager that I had no hot water, she said..."Ma'am you are the only one complaining, we don't know why that happened." Unfortunately for her, I found out that EVERYONE had the same problem and nearly everyone was complaining. There's not enough room to continue with all the things about this hotel that was wrong. Enough to say...don't stay here.

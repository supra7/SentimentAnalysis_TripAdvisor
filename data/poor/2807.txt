First and last stay at the trendy Time Hotel on 49th. Only two small elevators for the entire hotel meant having to line-up in the cramped hallway and sometimes wait for the second elevator because the first was full. It's really annoying. The rooms are very small and we couldn't get the temperature regulated resulting in a room so hot we ended up sleeping with the windows open (they only open a small crack) just to get the temp, below 32c. Service in the restuarant for breakfast was non-existent. We had to ask for coffee, then for napkins and then wait a long time for the bill even though there were only three tables occupied. It is definitely not worth what they charge.

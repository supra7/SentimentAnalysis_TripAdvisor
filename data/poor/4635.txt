I didn't mind the location at first...I was trying to be forgiving because I didn't mind the staff...atleast the one's that looked happy. My first silent complaint was of course no air conditioning in the lobby and the halls...the non smoking king room I occupied was ok...until I slept on the bed and noticed the dip on the one side....then the cigarette burns on carpet and bedspread, I lifted up the bed skirt...box spring was from atleast 1950 broken......the wood part, and was replaced by plywood....I verbally complained..no one did anything...talked to Giselda...gen manager....was no impressed by my story and looked at me as if I was an alien....she did not bother to look in room 812 plants are dead in the lobby and bar area....it almost could of been an outdated convalesant home......the price, location and some staff......it was what I paid for.........

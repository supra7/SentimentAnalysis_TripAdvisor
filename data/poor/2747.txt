Now, i warn anyone who books here to beware! We booked a twin room with expedia and on arrival, we discovered we had a double bed in a poxy room which looked like it hadn't been redecorated since the 60's! So, i went downstairs to the receptionist, who basically passed all the blame to expedia, saying they can never guarntee twin rooms, and that we basically had 2 alternatives. 1. Pay $300 each and upgrade to twin rooms, or 2. use the "roll out matress"! Luckily, i'm not the kind of person who takes this kinda lame excuse, so i spoke to expedia, which took a further hour to sort out (in the mean time having to buy international call cards from the shop nextdoor because Hotel Newton's phone doesn't dial international calls)!! Luckily, we were upgraded to the Hotel Metro.. which was absolutely amazing! However, even if we were not moved by expedia, we would not have stayed in the hotel because it was far too depressing. Summary: Way out of town... only 2 stops on express train.. but 20 minutes on every other! Extremely unhelpful staff, drab 60s decor, the shoebox lift is a health hazard, rooms are tiny and claustrophobic..... Don't stay there!

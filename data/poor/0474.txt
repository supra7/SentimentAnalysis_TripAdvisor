I know why this place is so poorly lit - it is filthy. The hotel is overpriced. The staff was rude - if you could even get one of them to speak with you. The room itself was disgusting. the walls were dirty, the shower curtain had mold, the floor appeared to not have been vacuumed in quite awhile, the walls had scuffs and if I had to describe it in one word - it would be dingy. The only upside was the location but it took over a half an hour to leave our car with the valet when arriving, no one offered to help with our bags or even hold the door. I would never stay this hotel again.

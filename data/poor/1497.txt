place is clean, location is okay... but... BUT!!! it's not a hotel. it's a sex hotel. be warned! so, i waited for a couple of hours to check in since my flight was early and their check in time is at 3. The hotel keeper asked me to go to the cafe nearby first since they don't have a room available. then i saw people checking in and they were accommodated immediately. afterwards, i heard them transacting for either a 2 hour or 4 hour room at either the 1st or second floor. it's weird when you walk around or go out the hotel, people kinda stares at you-- like you've been a naughty girl. even though you are clearly not! plus 150 SGD a night is not cheap! just don't stay here. try santa grand hotel. its the one in between to fragrance hotels in the area. i dunno if they accept sexy time there. go check that out.

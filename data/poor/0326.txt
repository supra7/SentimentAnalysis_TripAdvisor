We booked this hotel through an auction site and ended up paying about $120/night. On paper it looked like we got a steal of a deal for a waterfront 4* Seattle hotel. Upon arrival we immediately realized that the hotel is probably having trouble filling their rooms through conventional means and are now resorting to auction sites to try and fill rooms. The entire hotel is decorated with cheesy ornaments and prints to give it an old run down log cabin type feel. It cold be used for an over the top comedy set to shoot movies like Dumb and Dumber. During check in I was told that my room rate will get me a 1st floor queen bed and that it will cost me $30/night to upgrade to a king on the water side. I declined and magically received a 2nd floor king bedroom on the city side for no extra fee. The city view can probably be more adequately described as a noisy rail road track view. Overall the hotel seemed more like a 3* instead of a 4* when taking into account the low quality toiletries and housekeeping. We tipped housekeeping every morning and received different service every day. The first morning they removed our dirty glasses and did not bother replacing them with new ones, they did not take out the garbage and left the ice bucket full of water with no replacement bag. This routine continued for the remainder of our stay. Inconsistent housekeeping means a lack of quality control which is supposed to be held in high regard at 4 and 5 * hotels. Overall the hotel was worth the $120/night but not a dollar more. We will not be staying here again and do not recommend it for any other travelers.

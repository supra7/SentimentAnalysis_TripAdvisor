This is an old hotel, which they proudly highlight. I get that it's old and I'll cut it some slack. Maybe that adds charm. But this is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. While the room was large, it was also filthy and smelled. The rug was stained, the bed was uncomfortable, the shades wouldn't close to keep the room dark, and there were strange noises at night. But the real crowning touch was the bathroom. My room used to be a very, very small room with a very, very small bathroom in the early part of the 20th century, apparently, and they made it into one reasonably sized bedroom (by modern standards) and two incredibly tiny bathrooms. I literally couldn't use the toilet in either one without putting one leg in the tub. What's amazing is they upgraded the faucets and such to modern, high-end equipment. They added Internet and on-demand movies (both didn't work in my room). But they left the old, old laundry hampers on the door from the days when you'd put your suit in the door for the valet to take out to clean at night. If this was only $100-150/night then maybe it would be better. But at $400/night it's highway robbery. This hotel should be gutted and completely renovated. On the plus side, the staff was very helpful and courteous. I can't save service was "good," though, because there were a lot of mistakes. Twice room service tried to deliver someone else's food to my door. They inexplicably deactivated my room key in the middle of my stay. We asked to get the Internet fixed in the room and they couldn't do it. Be afraid, very afraid.

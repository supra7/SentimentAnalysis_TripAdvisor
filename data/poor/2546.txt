What a horrible experience. Not only were the grounds dirty but the room itself was a mess- only 2 flat pillows, dirty sheets and the place smelled like horrible paint fumes. When I told the manager about the fumes-she could care less and told me that there was nothing she could do about the experience. She told me they just painted the day before and that it probably did not dry correctly. If that was the case they should have not rented the room out. I recieved my money back for the night with attitude! Needless to say I will not be staying there again....

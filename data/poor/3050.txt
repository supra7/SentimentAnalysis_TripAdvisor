Overall stay was pleasant through a busy weekend. Food is average, rooms are clean & waterpark nice. We left our valuables in the room safe the day of checkout with the intent of checking out of room via room TV prior to the 12:00PM checkout time. left 'do not disturb' sign on door. Arrived at room at 11:45 to find sign taken away. used my key to enter room to find maid finishing up. The maid gestured for me to leave; I tried to explain that i was checking out & getting my valuables, however, she did not understand english. She apparently left to get security & returned with 3 of them demanding my identification. I explained what I was trying to do, however, they still demanding ID. After showing the ID he stated they have a lot of security problems & he was protecting my valuables. Interestingly he had no paperwork to determine or verify my name, nor did he apologize after I suggested one was in order...just stating that they have a lot of security problems. I sought out the general manager who was not on site, but, did speak to the acting manager who apologized. not sure what their big security problems are, but, unfortunately its not a very nice way to treat a paying guest with his family. i've stayed in hotels around the world & have not been treated as though I was a criminal. The acting manager didn't offer any free meals or drinks considering the situation. The staff needs to speak the language of their guests.

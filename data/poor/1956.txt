Like to stay at historic hotels (Mayflower, Grove park Inn, St. Francis), but in this case "historic" meant last renovated in 1970...reserved in August for this trip, got a small room with non-working thermostat facing an airshaft (#969), was moved to smaller room when I complained (#998), was told it would cost $100/night more for a "better" room (I was already paying $199/night)...called around to book ANYWHERE else, unfortunately downtown was subsequently booked because of the World Series...nice public rooms, bedroom was the worst I've had in over 15 years of international travel!

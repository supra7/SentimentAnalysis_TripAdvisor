Not "top of the world" service. In this day and age you would think that a place like this would provide good service. I found the food and beverage management staff rude and argumentative it truly ruined my stay. There is nothing worse that saying the same thing over and over about the service and they hear what they want. We work hard for our money and I only want to spend it in a place that values the customer. They nickel and dime you, they treat the customer like a thief in the night. If you have a complaint, your only doing it to get something for free. They can keep their show tickets, their crude executive chef, terrible coffee, and horrible room service manager. I took every dime I planned to spend here to "Alize" at the Palms. Were the service was great and everyone enjoyed the experience. It was worth every penny!! I don't mind spending the money but no one likes to taken for granted and treated poorly.

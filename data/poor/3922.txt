My boyfriend and I stayed in this Sheraton property one night and immediately checked out the next day due to the total lack of cleanliness in the hotel. We had been staying in Wailea for a few nights and decided we wanted to check out Lahaina...big mistake. The carpeting in the hallway outside our room was disgusting with huge stains everywhere. The door to our room was dirty and the paint chipped. There was a giant roach crawling on the wall in the hallway. The bathrooms were 2 star quality at best and the buffet breakfast in the morning was totally sub par for the price. We could have stayed at the Ritz Carlton for $20 more...I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for the prices they are charging. This would be ok at half the rates they are charging.

We had a dreadful experience at this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone. Other reviewers have listed the faults in detail so I won't repeat them, but I wholly endorse all the criticism of the diabolical customer service and the extortionate fees for services that are normally included in the price of a decent hotel. We switched to the Signature at MGM Grand and it was a hundred times better.

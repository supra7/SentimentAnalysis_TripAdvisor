For $289 per night before taxes, hotel fees, valet etc it was like we were in a time travel to a Holiday Inn circa 1982. Literally. The rooms had not been updated in years and years and years. Everyone we talked to at the hotel had booked through Orbitz, Priceline etc and paid around $65. A much more reasonable rate but the hotel is still very tired and dated and worn out. Really put a negative spin on my first trip to the Big Easy.

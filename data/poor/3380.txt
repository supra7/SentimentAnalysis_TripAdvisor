We booked 4 nights at the Commander Hotel on their website for August 11-14, 2007. What an awful place. We checked out after only 1 night. The only good thing was the location (on the boardwalk). We had a queen bed which was very uncomfortable. The 19" TV was on the other side of the room and nearly impossible to lay in bed and watch. There was no alarm clock in the room, and when I asked the housekeeping staff about it they didn't even understand what I was asking. Although our room had a balcony (overlooking Phillips parking lot) the patio door and floor-to-ceiling windows were covered only by between-the-glass mini blinds. There were no curtains whatsoever, so the room was lit up most of the night by Phillips parking lot lights, and early morning by the sun. When we complained we were told that none of the rooms had curtains so we left. I will commend the hotel on refunding the charges, although they initially refused to.

This hotel reminded me of the youth hostels I stayed in when backpacking across Europe. And indeed it is fine if you expect bare minimums of things. It is clean, the front desk and hotel personnel are friendly. If it has been renovated it was a superficial job of paint and not a very good one at that. The most disappointing and shocking aspect was there was no elevator and this fact is not listed on their website. I arrived with baggage and although was assisted with it to my fifth floor room, I was not impressed with the small, dark hallways and stairwells and certainly resented the stair climb to and from. The room itself had comfortable enough beds and clean sheets, but no light except a harsh overhead ceiling fan lamp (the fan didn't work). Air conditioning was left to a small window unit which sounded like a jet engine throughout the night. No fans or vents in the bathrooms. The concierge service proved not to be helpful as to locations of business services or things like what time the Starbucks opened down the street. For a bed and shower and a younger person, it is adequate...for anything other than that, look elsewhere.

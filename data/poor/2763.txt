My daughter and I stayed at this Time Square hotel in late August/early September on a shopping trip to New York. I have been to New York several times as I used to travel there monthly on business a few years ago. I have stayed at high end hotels, (such as the Pierre, Trump, Soho Grand) and mid-range hotels. This was by far the worst hotel that I have stayed in while visiting New York. The rooms are small and there is no view of any kind (these are not major issues for me). However, the bathrooms are filty (this is a major issue for me). The first room that we got was dusty and the bathroom had mold around the shower stall. We asked for another room and the same thing with that room. We checked 5 rooms before we got one that was acceptable. There is absolutely no reason for this. I went out and bought a bottle of cleaner with bleach and cleaned the bathroom myself. I left the bottle for the hotel. On the plus side the front desk staff were excellent. Very patient and accomodating. It is obviosuly not there fault.

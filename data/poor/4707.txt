This room was a disaster BROKEN EVERYTHING even the toilet was smashed! Tub was creaking, bed was horrible, found medication under blanket which led me to believe was not clean linen, tv didn't work rpoperly, and ac unit was pure filthy and loud, staff admitingly placed us in thsi romm knowing itbhad problems and offered NO assistance when we checked out! I would not recommend this place to anyone!

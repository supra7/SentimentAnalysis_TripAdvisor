We spent our first night in Maui at the KBH and were so thankful we only had to spend one night there. We arrived from the airport at 10pm to find the lobby staffed by only one person. After checking in, we were given a confusing map and sent off to find our room. It took us 20 minutes, carrying all of our heavy luggage, to reach our room. When we finally did, I inserted the key... and found other people sleeping in "our" room, their luggage all over the floor!!! We hurried our way back to the front desk and told the man what we had seen. He seemed completely unsurprised and unfazed and took about 30 min. to get us another room. He again did not offer us assistance finding the room and we again lugged all of our things through the confusing maze of buildings. Our new room wasn't occupied, but it was two double beds when we had requested one king our queen. The "complimentary" coffee we so desperately needed the next morning was not there and we had to call down for it. The thermostat was falling off the wall, although it did work. The Kauai wing (where we stayed) was filthy, dated, and had the slowest elevators ever. We were so happy when we got to our condo, the Maui Eldorado, where we spent five blissful nights and soon forgot our hellish experience at the KBH.

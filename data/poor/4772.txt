Yes, bedbugs. We observed bite marks AND a live adult-size bedbug. Deadbolt lock was pulled out of the door at the screws; old fashioned metal room key-- no electronic cardkeys; room door did not meet the casing or threshold; television cable dangling mid-air, not properly attached to any surface; no television remote; only 4 t.v. channels; radiant heat noisy; room was way too hot; our colleague's room was drafty and cold; the community bathroom was clean, but the rest of the hotel was not; bathroom door lock was very difficult to operate; beds were sunken in the middle; no chair in bedroom; no place to set suitcase

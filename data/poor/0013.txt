First off, stood in line for nearly an hour JUST to check in to my room. Finally get the room key, to find out on top of the over $200 / night stay I had to pay an additional $30 just to park over night in their garage! Being as it was an hour wait to get the key, my husband had already been directed to park the car, on level 6, with no elevator, so when i got out of the line we had to walk up 7 floors empty our car and carry ALL of it down the stairs to take to our room! Even though I was told "valet" parking and luggage would be included in the price of parking. Get to our room, the key did not work. Thankfully there were 2, and the other did. The room was ok. The furniture and bed was nice, SMALL old tv, nasty bathroom, and it a constant "buzzing" sound from the water running on the floor above us. Got zero sleep. Paid nearly $300 to spend less than 10 hours in a loud, dirty hotel with NO extras. No coffee in room, no refridgerator in room (other than the locked mini bar fridge), No continental breakfast, over all: So not worth it!

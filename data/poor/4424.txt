We went to las Vegas on a quick weekend trip. We did not have to many choices available to us, so we decided to try stratosphere. We had never stayed there before but decided this would be the best time. We were very disappointed from the start.Checking in was a joke, our room was not available, the reservations agent was very rude, and dis-courteous. After we finally made it to the room after a 21/2 hour wait we were disappointed. The room was dirty, old and plain looking. Having stayed at Skylofts this place was a major down-shift. Being American Express Centurion members we are use to a higher level of service this resort has really missed the mark. A waste of time and money.

I am writing this to alert any and all people planning to stay at this hotel that the security department in this hotel is horrible. If you want to feel safe and want to know that your belongings are safe, I highly suggest you stay in a different hotel. My belongings were stolen, after I filed a claim, it took over 5 five phone calls to get a phone call back only to be advised that my claim was 99.9% going to be denied since the hotel is not responsible for items left in the room. Be careful, if you leave something behind, apparently, it is okay for housekeeping to take them instead of turning them in.

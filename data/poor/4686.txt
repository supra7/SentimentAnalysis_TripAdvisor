This apartment was not as advertised and very grubby. The owners claimed it was due to be decorated, but that is easy to say after I complained. There was no mention of it before and I requested a partial refund which they did not provide. I was there for my wedding anniversary and we could not wait to get out of the place. I have taken pictures to show what it was really like. If they say it has been redecorated, DON'T TRUST THEM. My pictures show the entrance, filthy stair carpet, graffiti on wall, signs with sticky tape, the door can hardly open into the bedroom, the bedroom view and worst of all the bathroom (disgusting).

The rooms are dirty and smelly. The toilet is shared at the floor and is always dirty. Some rooms have a shower, which consists in a box installed directly on the carpet floor (needs a pump in order to ensure water flow!). Breakfast is not good and there's not much amount of food. For that price you can definitely find much better accomodation in Berlin.

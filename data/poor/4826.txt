IT WAS HORRIBLE. We went to san francisco to have some great time and it wasnt great at all. The people where mean. One of the receptionist guys even insulted my son. If you go to that hotel you will regret. The bedrooms were not comfortable at all, they were dirty, small, a lot of noise. And the restaurant was awful. It was so horrible that I dont want to return to San Francisco ever again. You suck Chancellor Hotel on Union Square.

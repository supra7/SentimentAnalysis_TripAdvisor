We flew in and out of Vegas with a two week trip to Southern Utah in between. We decide to stay at the South Eastern Ave Hampton because it was close to the airport and advertised shuttle service which would make it easy to return the rental car and then get some sleep. We waited 35 minutes at the rental car pick-up station (with three phone calls to the Hampton, all assuring us the shuttle would be there in less than ten minutes)---we finally took a $20 cab ride to the motel. The next morning the shuttle could only take us to the airport at either 5:00 or 6:00 so we again caught a $20 cab----please factor this cost into your stay if you plan to use the shuttle.

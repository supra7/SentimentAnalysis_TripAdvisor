Boring, overpriced, and stuffy. Don't visit this hotel unless you are over age 55. It is not for any younger crowd, definitely not a hotel for children. The breakfast menu had a good selection, but way too overpriced. Rooms were small for the price..........I guess you would pay big $$ just to have a cot in this place. The spa was a high point of the visit, but I can stay in Denver and go to a luxurious spa. Maybe I should have.............oh well. I would also advise against going to Kapalua during the fall and early winter. It was rainy and drizzling everyday, had to jump in the rental car and go to Lahaina just to catch some sunshine. Next time, I will stay in Lahaina or Wailea on the other side of the island.

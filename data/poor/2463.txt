We have stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 2 years and have loved it. I am not sure what the problem was this time but it was a major disappointment all around. The room was dirty, cleaning staff was horrid ( I use to be a maid in a large hotel) and had total attitude. We asked the woman to come back because our son was napping, she got annoyed and said she had to leave at 3 pm. I said ok then leave... I mean really how is that my problem. The next day we had a do not disturb card in the door (again napping child) and she knocked on the door. I was livid. Then she did a terrible job cleaning. The carpets were nasty sticky. The restaurant staff was so slow we sat there for 6 minutes and asked someone to get our waitress who had Been standing at the bar waiting for her drinks for at least 3 minutes, she looked right at us and did not move... We waited another minute and walked out. We walked out of the bar 3 times from lousy service. One day the bellman Aaron literally stuck his empty cart in our elevator as the doors were closing even though there was another one right across the way open and empty. It was a snotty rude move. I don't know what has happened there, it just felt like the staff are all cranky and unhappy. Lastly, getting a seat at the pool is going into mortal combat. Good luck with that. We have loved this hotel and have been repeat guests for a long time but our experience was so bad all around we will be trying a new spot. Oh, one good spot, the spa, best pedicure ever.

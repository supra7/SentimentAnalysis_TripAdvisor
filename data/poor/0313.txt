We arrived here expecting it to be great, we were excited about having a balcony over looking the water. When we checked in the lobby is beautiful and staff was friendly. We were in room 410 which is a junior sweet on the top floor, room was small but nice. We then went to look at this amazing view we had, and as we walked out on the balcony we realized it was in very poor shape. The wood was rotten the screws were not in all of the boards because they had rusted out, which made the floor will scary to walk on, As we started looking around we noticed the balcony next to us had a tie strap holding the rail to the entire fourth floor. I then called management and they informed me that they didn't know their was a tie strap holding the balcony rail up but they would send their engineer up to look at it. In the mean time we ate at Six Seven it was good. When we got back to are room I called back down to management who this time was very rude and said the balcony was safe and we should have no worries. We are not used to staying in run down hotels so we left that night an checked into Pan Pacific. It doesn't have a water view, but we had a safe balcony with city view, nicer room, and staff would go out of their way to help you.

We stayed at the Edgewater Hotel's "Waterfront Premium Room" for our anniversary in December 2007. When we arrived, the parking attendant was polite and courteous. We checked in smoothly and that's where the problems started. 1) The water pressure of the shower was terribly weak. It was not a shower, it was water dripping out of the shower head. 2) The bed sheets were not clean. There were clearly human fluids present. 3) The plug for the bath tub was missing. And it took 20+ minutes for room service to bring it. 4) Constant noise coming from the hallway. I think the room was next to the utilities room - a lot of water pressure noise and consistent beeping sound. It was enough to wake me in the middle of my sleep. 5) TV reception was bad - rendering the 40' flat screen meaningless. The only good experiences I had at this hotel was when I arrived, and the service I received in breakfast. The food was not even that great. I submitted a customer feedback form both online and via writing as I checked out; but the hotel never responded. I felt it was a total waste of money ($500+/night).

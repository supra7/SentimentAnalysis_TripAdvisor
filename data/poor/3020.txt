This hotel is by far the WORST I have ever stayed in. It's an overpriced albatross. In the shower (where the bathroom tiles are falling out - I have pictures), the water temperature changes without warning and you go from okay to being scalded then to freezing. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights the hotel throws drunken pool parties to 3 a.m. and the rest of the hotel cannot sleep (my friend was three floors up and was kept awake). During these drunken parties regular hotel guests cannot use the pool nor can their children. After three days of this the pool was closed for two days so they could clean the leftover gunk from the pool water so we still couldn't use the pool. The room temperature is hotel controlled not individually room controlled so you freeze or boil at the hotel's whim. The pillows are harder than BRICKS and when you politely request a softer pillow you are told the "all hotels have their shortcomings" but that is ALL this hotel has - SHORTCOMINGS. The staff with the exception of the maids and two other people are the rudest and nastiest I have ever met. One hotel employee took a special interest in the comings and goings of my daughter and myself and moved into the room across the hall from us and was caught going through our garbage! I have politely and repeatedly attempted to contact management about my experience to prevent other guests from going through such a deplorable experience and they refuse to return calls and the desk clerks are crude and nasty and refuse to even give me the general manager's working hours! What is this a matter of national security? Sleep in your car before you sleep in this hotel.

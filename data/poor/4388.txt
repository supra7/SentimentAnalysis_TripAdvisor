The location was at the far end of the strip. Not near the monorail so we had to take the bus which wasn't a problem but the concierge had us go across the street to catch the bus which landed us way far away from where we wanted to go. Long line to check in at 11 PM. Fire alarms going off in the middle of the night with no explanation or apology and rooms were not cleaned until 6 or 7 pm every night. Will never stay here again. Bellagio here I come!!!

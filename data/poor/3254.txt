Steve Wynn apparently has his first failure on his hands. Why else would he authorize his entire front desk staff to use cheesy laminated photographs of his hotel rooms  strategically shot to showcase views  and encourage them to blatantly lie and enhance the truth in an attempt to squeeze hotel guests for $25 or more extra per night beyond the rate they agreed to pay? Outside of Las Vegas, we call this BAIT & SWITCH. At Encore, they'll tell you that the non-smoking room you reserved is not available, but for an UPCHARGE, you can not only have the non-carcinogenic space that you reserved and have a right to, but a better view. Or, they'll tell you that their nightclubs are VERY LOUD. How loud? So loud that the room you booked will be thumping until 4AM. So . . . for a minor UPCHARGE, you can have a room on a higher floor (with a better view!) and save yourself the misery of being kept awake half the night. Did Wynn really build his new hotel with paper thin windows and walls? And if he did, does the music really need to be so loud? Are nightclub guests more coveted than hotel guests? The poor management of this property has infuriated numerous guests to the point that they will not return. Short sighted attempts to squeeze $25 more per night out of guests who fall for the trickery is unethical at best and illegal at worst. It's a sad, sad day that someone of Mr. Wynn's status - and such a beautiful property as Encore - has stooped so low. This reviewer will never return to this immoral property and encourages all readers to stay at one of Mr. Wynn's former properties, now owned and operated by MGM Mirage, including Bellagio or The Mirage, or one of the three hotels at Mandalay Bay. DON'T GET RIPPED OFF!

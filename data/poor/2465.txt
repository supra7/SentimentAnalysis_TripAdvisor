Checked in - large purple stain on rug - bedspread stained - room not dusted (dustballs) - fingerprints everywhere - white loveseat was gray and black and stained - bathroom smelled like urine and mildew - receive lifted on phone had black bugs crawling in and out. I was stuck on a group vacation in Maui at this hotel. The resort looks nice when you walk in...the rooms are filthy. I took another room - downgraded to two doubles from a king - bathroom did not smell like urine but the filth was everywhere. The second room had sugar spilled by the coffee maker. The sugar did not get cleaned up the entire week we were there. The floor had potato chip crumbs that were also not cleaned up the entire week we were there. I used a towel to hold the hairdryer as that too was very dirty. I cried the entire first night I was there. Slept with the lights on every night and kept my suitcases zipped for fear of what crawled around. The staff will only recommend trips/tours if they do business with the company. I suggest researching things to do before arriving in Maui. The hotel is dirty but I do have to say the staff is friendly. If you go here - you are stuck until your plane leaves. Don't ruin your trip. Maui is not cheap to visit.

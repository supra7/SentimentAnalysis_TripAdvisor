This was my first and last stay at the Stratosphere. When we arrived in our first room we noticed the trash cans were never empty and the toilets were not cleaned. Let us just say stuff was floating inside. We called the front desk to report this and they decided to move us to a cleaner room. We are now in our second room. We had requested a roll-away and after waiting patiently for a half hour we called down to see what was taking so long to which they said they don't deliver them to the room we were in. No one bothered to tell us. I was steaming at that point so I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. After speaking with her we were moved to a third room. What did they offer for our troubles? A breakfast buffet not to exceed $40.00. For three people?? Mind you this is happening at 11:00 at night. We're tired. Finally we reach a decent room our bellhop called down to request again our roll-away and even waited till it arrived. Things were starting to look up but no, when turning on the faucet the water smelled so bad I had to buy bottled water to brush my teeth, house keeping refused to give towels when we saw them in the hall unless we called down to house keeping first for them first and when they did clean our room they did it half way. Beds were short sheeted, there were three women staying in one room and they would leave ONE set of towels. They only good thing was the bell desk. They were prompt and courteous. I will NEVER EVER stay here again.

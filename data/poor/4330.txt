Worst hotel I've been too! Stayed in a deluxe with two queen beds. Poor customer service. They had no wifi included, a charge of 12/day/device! Registration was difficult to locate. Concierge was not helpful or friendly. The room had a view of a wall, garbage from other stays were still present, plates from room service outside our doors were not picked up for 2-3 days! Had the option to upgrade but for 20/day so did not. Was a ripoff. Really far from the strip (about 30-40 mins walk), walked a long way but the area is ghetto and dangerous. Saw two fights in the open, panhandlers asking us for change-even within the hotel casino!!Take the Deuce bus $7 for 24hrs ride all day.Only benefit was cheap room service, can get something as low as $8. Overall, I'd say either pay more for the Vegas experience and be closer to the strip or go cheaper to a small hotel like a travel lodge close to the strip with free wifi, if on a tight budget.

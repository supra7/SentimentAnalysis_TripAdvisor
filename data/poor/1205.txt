We booked a 4 night stay at the Pantheon Inn in Rome for July 26 thur 20th 2009 with 5 other couples. Upon arriving at the hotel and dragging our luggage up 4 flights of stairs since the elevator was broke, (yes the hotel lobby is on the 4th floor, somthing they fail to mention upfront) we were informed that the was only room for 4 couples of the 6 and the other 2 couples would have to stay in another hotel of their choosing. I said this was unacceptable since we were traveling as a group and I went to the hotel Abergo Santa Chiara a block away. (very nice) The desk clerk then informed me I would have to pay for the first night, even though they didn't have a room for me. Since my return, my credit card has been billed for all 4 nights, which I have disputed. I have tried to contact the hotel but they do not respond. Neither does the web site I booked it through, Easytobook.com I have sent them numerous emails and all I get back is that they are out of the office, even though I sent the emails during their stated office hours. Not only is this hotel a dive, they are CROOKS

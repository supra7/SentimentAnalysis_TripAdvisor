The hotel is old, moldy and overal dirty. The room carpet smells like old cigarrettes. The doors are broken, paint is cracked and the bathroom is filthy. The receptionist looks like coming form a 50s B movie.The rooom was so bad that I ask to change rooms. She answer that it was booked as is and the rate was non refundable. If it was not so late I would look for some place else. I stayed one night and left with getting my refund for the other night. This place needs management or just close it down. I prefer to pay 20 dollars more and stay some place clean.

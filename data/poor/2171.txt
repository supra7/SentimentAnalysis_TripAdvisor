Frequent business traveler. Starwood Preferred Guest. I was originally placed in a room in the South Tower (Club Level). In addition to the room being filthy, the heater was broken, the TV was broken, and the toilet was clogged (yes, it had been used). I was moved to another room in the South Tower (Club Level) that was much cleaner, but the sheets were ripped and the toilet was broken. I was then moved to a "renovated" room in the Center Tower that was nicer (although most of the TV channels were not clear). Now, I can understand when the house keeping forgets to clean a room or even flush a toilet, but the main reason for my negative review is how the hotel staff treated me. They were nothing short of rude to me and treated me as a nuisance. As an example, during my second day, I was contacted by the hotel staff (while I was in my conference) to immediately report to the registration desk. When I arrived, I was informed that I had failed to check out at 12p. I explained to the registration clerk that my reservation was for two nights and that I was not due to check out until the next day. The clerk informed me that because my reservation had a special room rate the first night, but not the second, my reservation was split into two confirmation numbers, which in turn required me to check out and then check in for my second night stay. The clerk then proceeded to check me out of my room and then check me in to the SAME room (all the while having a snub and argumentative attitude). In summary, I do recommend this hotel. Besides the rude hotel staff and dingy accommodations, the location of the hotel is in a shabby and dirty area. I did not feel safe walking to a nearby steakhouse at night.

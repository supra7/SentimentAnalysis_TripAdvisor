I could not agree more with the April 12th reviewer. My wife and kids (ages 9-15) visited 4/10 thru 4/14. VERY nice staff, everything seemed clean, but it's a small property with a small pool and small family suites. We were on the 1st floor, (family suites are only first floor) and it was tiny. The patio area is behind plexiglass walls, (either a security issue or to shield you from the wind, or both). You feel like you're in a compound. This hotel is on a cliff and the beach is 30-40 feet drop down some steps. There is a beachwalk that is nice and very long with plenty of restaurants to choose from but the surrounding area looks a little seedy. Some of the homeless hang out near the public bathroom next to the property.. (It was and education for our kids.) Fitness center is a room off the underground garage with no windows...they should have just skipped the investment. No restaurant or bar on site. I too booked based on tripadvisor and the reviews are way off on this one. At $539/night it was smaller than Embassy Suites and not any nicer. I could not help but sit there the entire vacation and think about how I was not getting a good value for my money. Our room was worth maybe $275/night tops!!

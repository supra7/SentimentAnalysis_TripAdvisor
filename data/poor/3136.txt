I booked this hotel based on other reviews and having good experience with other hotels by Joie de Vivre. But my, was I disappointed: - Rooms were noisy, especially from guests walking upstairs. - The rooms were cold, cold, cold and heating was down but they chose not to disclose it. My colleague got a heater, but I apparently checked in too late to get one. - They had lost my reservation when I arrived (although they could see it in their system). The clerk suggested that I was lucky they had a room, not sorry that they'd lost it. - Reception area and halls resembled a typical upscale motel. On the positive side, it is a good location and rooms were clean. I've traveled the entire world, but this was one of my worst nights of sleep ever (I feel suddenly tired just thinking of it).

Stayed in this hotel for one night only, thank goodness. A friend booked it for us and warned us it was basic but basic is too flattering a word. He had a windowless "dungeon" in the basement while we had a double overlooking the busy road outside. There was scaffolding at the window which made the room even darker and more depressing. It also meant that that the window had to be kept closed when the builders were working. We are pensioners, and perhaps because of this, the receptionist kindly helped us to carry our cases up the narrow, steep staircase. The room was the smallest we had ever been in. We could not stand up together, there was not even a shelf for watch/ clock etc and only two hooks. I got the wall side of the bed which meant that going to the loo in night entailed crawling off the end of the bed into the foot of space full of cases and bags. The bathroom was tiny and the water from the shower flooded into the bedroom. When you consider how long architects have to study for their qualifications, it beggars belief that one of them designed this place with no regard for comfort or function, never mind aesthetics! Clearly making money is the name of the game here. I dread to think what would happen if there were a fire in those confined spaces. We could not wait to get out. The thought of spending more than one night there was grim. Perhaps younger travellers could cope better with the lack of comfort and space but needless to say we will not return, nor will we allow aforementioned friend to book us a hotel again. There is cheap and cheerful and cheap and nasty. This place was the latter!

I paid $275+taxes for 5 nights at the Palmer House and I can honestly say it was a complete rip-off. It started off bad when they refused to give me Wifi access eventhough it was included in my terms and conditions when I booked. They wanted me to pay the usual $30/day wifi access fee which is ridiculous. You would think if Im paying in excess of $1200 I would at least have wifi access. The rooms are 3 stars. They havent been renovated since 1988ish. The carpets are blanched for overuse. The room smells of mold. The wallpaper was peeling. I felt I needed to search for bedbugs. The bathroom was mediocre. The lobby itself is 5 stars, the rooms 3 stars max. Dont pay over $150 for this..ripoff

Upon arrival at the hotel after 4pm, when checking in we were informed that our room was not ready as it was not clean. After some time they were able to find a room that they stated was clean. This room was very small, dingy and dirty. The bathroom was repulsive with the wallpaper-pealing, tile dirty, stained and in need of replacement. The shower curtain had mold on the bottom of it. In general I travel a great deal and stay at all kinds of hotels to include Motel 6 that were MUCH cleaner and nicer than this place. The main lobby is very nice but beware the rooms are pretty tacky. It's time for an update to these rooms. I will not be staying here again.

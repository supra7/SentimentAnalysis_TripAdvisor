Our recent stay at the Aston Maiu Lu was rather disappointing. We took advantage of a 'sale'. The rooms looked absolutely nothing like the pictures on the Internet site. The 'Standard Garden View' suites which we stayed in are in serious need of demolition. Several 'bandaid fixes' have been done which only make it worse. It appears nothing has been updated since the early 60's. The tub and shower were repainted once but the paint has partially worn off to reveal all of the scrapes,gouges and layers of badly placed grout. The shower head was not attached to the wall. The walls in the bedroom have been textured so they collect dirt. Several hucks in the baseboards, hastily patched, then roughly painted over. Around the perimeter of the hotel area are numerous empty, unusable buildings in various stages of degradation. I have to admit the employees at the hotel did their best to accommodate us and gave us a better room for the last two nights but the very old parts of the facility need to be demolished and rebuilt.

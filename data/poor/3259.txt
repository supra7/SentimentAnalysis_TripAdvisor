I have stayed in hotels in AC that had nicer suites and customer service then the encore. The rooms were small for the money, the food in the hotel was nothing special, and the service was awful. On Friday night there was no hot water, we called down to complain and they said that I was the only room with that problem and they would send maintenance up right away! I waited 45 mins and nobody came up. So I called down again, and they told me that everyone was having that problem and that I could go shower in the spa. They could have at least told me they weren't sending anyone up! The hot water went back on about 3 hours later. The next morning at 8 we got a message saying the hot water was off again in the entire hotel, including the spa. They said it would be back on by 1. Well we checked out at 4, and still no hot water. I was furious, all our dinner plans were ruined because we were unable to shower for a day and a half. When you pay for a hotel in Vegas, you pay basically for a nice place to get ready. Not just to sleep. The front desk was very unhelpful and rude. All we got was a late checkout and 50 room credit. Besides waiting for a 1/2 hr for the maintenance man to come, (and never showing up & not telling me)..I also waited about 30 mins for a security guard about a noise complaint at 4:30 am in the hallway...and he never showed up as well. Basically this hotel has terrible customer service. They don't follow through with what they say and don't know how to handle problems at all. I think the guests deserved a little more than 50 dollars for such an inconvienence....don't stay here!!!

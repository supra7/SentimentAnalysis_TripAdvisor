I booked a three night stay with a popular online service. It gave the San Carlos a 3.5 out of 5. The rate was about $60 less than a much better name brand hotel around the corner. When I arrived I was told I did not have a reservation. I assured the counter person I indeed had one. They were insistant I did not. I produced the confirmation number "hmm, that's not our number". I produced the booking receipt and asked for the manager after additional explaining and 20 minutes she had to make the reservation on the spot. I know this hotel had a grand history and boy are they doing their best to keep it just like it was in the 50's. Just a short list of deficiencies; Uncontrolable shower temp. scald to cold in milliseconds. No heat or cooling control. They say just open or close the vent. So 170 rooms are treated as one. The original elevators are old and creaky and I think they were the first one west of the Mississippi. And slow! They even post inside the elevator that they are subject to breaking and to be gentle. The walls have been pained so many times that it's hard to tell where one wall starts and the other ends. Even so the sound of the next rooms occupants was interesting. No room service If they promoted this monument as exactly what it is " a chance to stay in a really historic hotel with 1928 detail". And play up the ghost thing even more than they do now, some masochistic patrons would love it. One positive was the wireless was actually fast and free. Pay a little more and Avoid this classic, old, rundown, overpriced, uncomfortable relic.

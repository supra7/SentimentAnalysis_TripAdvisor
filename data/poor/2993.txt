This is the worst Staybridge Suites that I've ever been to. Some are very nice but this isn't one of them. It's obvious that they have updated some things but not others and it's the things that have not been updated that were really bothersome. Maybe other travelers had better rooms than I but I cannot believe that anyone would give this hotel a good rating. The carpet, bedspread, sofa, and kitchen stool were all dirty and stained. The kitchen appliances have been updated but not the cabinets and those cabinets are horrible. They are worn, appear dirty whether they are or not, scratched and I'm guessing that they were likely installed in the 1980s. The same is true for the bedroom furniture - terrible condition. The bathroom (toilet and tub) area is very small and looks like it's never thoroughly cleaned as you can see dirt, debris and mold in the corners (I took photos to back this up). I had to kill a cockroach in the bathroom on one night, something that I have NEVER had to deal with in any hotel at any other time. DO NOT STAY HERE.

You must wear flip-flops around the pool. The in-laid pebbles in the concrete will rip the soles of your feet. It's a good thing I brought lots of band-aids. The swim-up bar is very nice, but I was amazed, as I sat sunning myself for 6 hours, I did not see any adults leave the swim-up bar to use the rest room. WOW, What magnificent bladder control !!!! ,If you wish to ride the bus to the boardwalk ,it's about 35 to 45 minutes,depending on all the stops. Rooms need updated, bathrooms look old, cleaning was sporatic. You need more outside spray stations to get the sand off, maybe then it won't be on the bottom of the pool.

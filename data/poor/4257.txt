-The business center of the Hotel Lost my package. Value of the pack was 2800$ In spite of trying to contact Risk Manager( R.T.Germain) repeatedly, they never got back to me and put me in a round mode until I give up and get tired. Security staff made me make a report twice my case nr DL20100789829. They assured me that they get back to me and whether find my parcel or claim it from insurance. After returning to the country of my residence Holland, I made over 100$ phone bill in order to contact these guys but they never got back to me. To make the long story short I lost 2800$ and nobody takes responsibility. I contact Hotel staff daily. Business center tells me I have to contact security, security never gets back to me. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. Except the place of the hotel which is in the middle of strip, everything else is horrible.

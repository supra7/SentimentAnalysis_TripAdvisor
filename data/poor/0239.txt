We wanted a hotel that was near The Childrens Hospital and we got it. But lets see...the hot tub was green and the pool was not well maintained. The rooms were nice...I will give them that with a lot of amenities I didn't expect in a basic room like stove and dishwasher. But the bathroom was TINY!! And the beds, they put me in the hospital because of my back. NO JOKE!! They are THE WORST!! The TV was bad it kept messing up and then to top it off the teams that were in the place was not supervised well because they kept knocking on our door at all hours and running off. And a call to the front desk did not provide results. SO my recommendation for travelers is to AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!! And the review below about the elevators yah I agree. They have three elevators in the hotel and the ONLY one working brought you to the parking garage and you had to hike in to do anything!

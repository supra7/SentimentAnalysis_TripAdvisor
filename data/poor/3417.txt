I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I thought I'd go here because the website made it look better then some of the other dives I've stayed in in Hollywood but boy was I wrong. I tried seven, yes seven, times to change rooms to no avail. The carpet was very old, red high pile from the 60's or 70's that concelled who knows what in it. The beds were very old, concaved and I could feel the springs. I got upset enough that they changed out one of the beds and I had the misfortune of seeing the old box spring and mattress without the bed linens, that was frightening. I spent the first night sleeping with a light on because I was sure the bugs would be crawling out of the woodwork once I went to sleep. My room was also facing Franklin Street which is very noisy. The furniture had cigarette burn marks and I could hardly turn on the lamps above the bed because the knobs were worn and about to break. I stayed here four nights - only because I was attending a conference nearby and I could not find any other hotel availability in the area. Next time I need a cheap sleep I'll opt for the Motel 6 nearby.

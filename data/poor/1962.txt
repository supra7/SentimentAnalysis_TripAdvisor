I've visited Boston several times and have stayed at a few of its hotels, but I recently stayed at the Boston Park Plaza and, after my experience, would hate it if anyone suffered the same fate. Firstly, I had to change my room as soon as I arrived: it was small, dark, cramped and, worst of all, filthy. I changed rooms pretty quickly. The next room was bigger and more airy, unfortunately it was still pretty filthy: paint chipping off the wall and collecting on the floor, stains around the sink etc. It wasn't until the music from downstairs kept me awake till 12:30 that I decided I should move rooms again. The person I spoke to on the phone was lovely and said I could change rooms in the morning. I packed all my things again in the morning and went downstairs, only to be greeted by one of the rudest people I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. He was totally unhelpful, seeming to think I wanted a free upgrade rather than a quieter room. He offered me a much smaller room, and when I said I wouldn't be happy with that he said he wasn't prepared to offer me anything else. He refused any further assistance so I was left with the only option of accepting that smaller room. When I finally agreed I was told that I'd have to take everything back to my original room as the room wasn't ready yet - he didn't bother to offer to store it. I only found out when I returned that he hadn't bothered to reserve me this room, but luckily another person on the front desk said it was no problem and actually managed to find me a similar sized room with ease (thank you to them). When I finally got in the room it was fine: old fashioned, dark, small - but quiet. This must be the worst hotel in Boston. I will NEVER stay here again - and until their staff learn some manners and they redecorate properly, I don't think anyone else should either.

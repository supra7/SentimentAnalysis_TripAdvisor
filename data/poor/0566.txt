Wouldn't Stay Here Again Wouldn't recommend this hotel at all. Rooms need to be decorated. Whole hotel is in need of renovation. Cleanliness not too bad but could of been cleaner. For the price I paid I was extremely disappointed and would of expected better. Located a considerable distance from downtown too.

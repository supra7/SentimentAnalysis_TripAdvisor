10. Long Check-in Lines - We arrived at the hotel around 9:00 pm. There were five people in front of us and it took 35 minutes to check in. We were astonished that only two people were behind the counter. 9. Dated - Outside of "Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill," everything in the hotel is outdated: the rooms, casino, restaurants, etc. 8. Timeshare Salesmen - Harrah's places these salesmen right beside the elevators. This means every time you go to and from your room, you get heckled by them. They are rude, obnoxious, and treat you with sarcasm as if they are doing us the favor by heckling us. 7. Old People - It feels as if 80% of the people at the hotel are over the age of 60. Everywhere you look there are old people, many of whom smell. 6. Cheap Slots - I realize the economy has not been friendly to Vegas, but that doesn't mean you must make all the slots stingy. Don't bother playing at Harrah's, I would go over to Wynn or MGM Grand. You'll get more bang for your buck. 5. Slow elevators - It took longer to get to the sixth floor of Harrah's than it does the 20th floor at The Mirage. Let's speed it up Harrahs! 4. Pool - Where did they get this pool setup, Motel 6? 3. The Room - Tube TV, rock hard mattress, small shower, no view. 2. Fashion - Ladies, black shorts with black tennis shoes with white socks with a baseball cap does not look good. It's Vegas, not West Virginia! 1. Price, Price, Price - For the same price, you can stay at Treasure Island, Flamingo, Bally's, MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Luxor: all of which are far better. We paid $39.99 for this room, and if I had to do it over again, I would have stayed somewhere else. Unless your over the age of 60 and smell funny and wear black shoes with black shorts with white socks and a baseball cap, avoid Harrah's.

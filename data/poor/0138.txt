I had stayed here a number of times over the past four years, then I showed up with a reservation and they said they were "overbooked." How does one overbook a hotel? It seemed like a Seinfeld episode: "Anyone can take a reservation. The key is keeping it." And even after I had stayed there for many days, they did not care. If you have stayed there before -- like I did -- they have changed. Don't trust them.

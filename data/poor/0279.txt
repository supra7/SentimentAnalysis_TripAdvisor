The elevator told the "WHOLE" story of what I was in for once I exited....Draped with a brown diamond sheet to cover the gross inner walls, once I exited and entered my room I found it to be musty, moldy, with stained carpets and not a place that I would ever recommend to anyone........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pros: The Location Cons: We don't have enough time to cover all the "Cons" Take it from me.......Stay 10 miles out of the city for the same price at a nice~clean hotel.....I know I will from now on because the 6th Avenue Inn is not what the web site makes it out to be......"BEWARE"

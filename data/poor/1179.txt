I stay in hotels 60-90 nights a year, so I have a pretty good perspective on how a proper hotel is run.... this is not a well-run hotel. They cater to the cruise passengers coming and going, so they have a real slam-and-jam attitiude knowing that you probably won't ever return...so why should they care? The cleaning staff were very ineffective- fingerprints, stains, crumbs, and hairpins were there to greet us when we arrived. (And this was an upgraded suite because I brought 80 associates for meetings all week.) *In spite of claiming "renovations", this hotel was merely painted and carpeted...it's still a 70's building with loud AC units and tired infrastructure. To exit to street level from your room, you have to take a slow and old elevator to the lobby and then yet another slow elevator to the "Motor Lobby" *Most staff are very slow and apathetic *Food quality is poor: a lot of the food is pre-packaged or not prepared on site, and the coffee is made from coffee concentrate, not really brewed coffee. *Internet in sleeping rooms very slow *Cable TV has a lot of channels, but watching it on the 15 year old TV (I thought they said they renovated?!) was problematic with static and bleed-over from the music channels. *There is no security mechinism in place to stop bums, hustlers, and pizza advertisers from wandering the hallways *The restaurant forces an 18% gratuity.... no incentive to provide good service. When we ate lunch on Saturday afternoon, we had to listen to three staff members talk about hair styles, extensions, and color treatments.... very inappropriate. Summary: It's tough to get good service and accomodations in Miami AT ANY PRICE, but you would do better to search elsewhwere.

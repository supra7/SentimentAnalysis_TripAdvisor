Hated this hotel OK, it was cheap, but I have stayed in cheaper places all over the world and none of them have been as dirty as this hotel room. They serve breakfast in the deli next door and the plates, cutlery and glasses were really dirty too. The staff are a little odd (think Lurch from the Adamm's Family) and there is just something sinister about this hotel that you can't put your finger on. I felt uncomfortable for our entire stay. I was so disappointed because it looks so nice on the Internet and from the outside.Also I would just say that if I was going to San Francisco again (which I absolutely loved as a place)I would not want to stay in that part of town. I live in London and have lived in some very dodgy places in London, but I have never felt as uncomfortable as I did around the Touchstone Hotel. The location looks good on paper because you can get to Macys and all the shops v quickly (which we did) but I would stay the other side of Union Square going towards the business district. It just felt nicer over there.

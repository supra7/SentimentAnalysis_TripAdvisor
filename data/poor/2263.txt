The front desk is Rude and the note efficient at all! They don't acccomadate any request even though it was already listed on the online reservation. The tower room we booked online was not given to us even though we paid for one. we got ripped off. the bath tubs were scary looking and the shower heads so low, it was hard to take a shower if you were tall. the beds were on the soft side. the rooms and hall ways had horrible smells. the only good thing was the very friendly maid. the walls were thin, you can hear things easily, even when the room above you has the shower head on. Don't stay unless you are dirt poor and have no place to sleep.

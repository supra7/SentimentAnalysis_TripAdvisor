Please do not stay here if you do not love animals and their smells and do not like roaches. I stayed here with a group of five people and had read the mixed reviews, but booked the hotel because the average review rating was pretty good. The first hotel room we checked into had a horrible smell so we asked to switch rooms. The second room we checked into smelled alot fresher and was alot cleaner than the first so we were happy with that room at first. That is until we went out to dinner and came back to find the kitchen filled with roaches!! We were out of there and went to stay at Comfort suites on hotel circle which was a much better hotel(very clean and no roaches, smoking or animal smells.)

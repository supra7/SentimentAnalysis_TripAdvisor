We specifically asked for a quiet room, never having stayed there, and the room we were given was down the hall from a pool that they keep open until 11, and a video game arcade that never seemed to close! This drew every unescorted kid in the place to our hall, screaming thumping and chasing around, and to make things worse this place has a central 6 floor high atrium ceiling, aka echo chamber from hell. Unfortunately we didn't know all this until that night, by then too late to move to another hotel. The rooms are dinky, the double bedded ones have one chair laughably squeezed by the window, and a nasty split bathroom door that will cause you harm during a night time bathroom run. Oh, and the little compartment labelled "refrigerator"? It's only a cooler, so if you store leftovers in there you're in for a very upset stomach the next day. And watch out walking out the main entrance, the valets whip cars backwards onto the side walk without looking back, and you'd better hop to to avoid being hit. Too bad, the location is great, but it's like trying to stay in the middle of a grade school playground, only louder and more rude (the kids crowd around the elevators on floor 3 and never board, so good luck!).

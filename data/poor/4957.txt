I am actually a timeshare owner with this resort. I am stuck with it since I would not sell it even to my enemy. Every time I stay there, the stay is terrible. The rooms have a stench that a whole can of Fabreeze cannot cover up. Every room I have stayed in has had roaches or some sort of bug in them. They are never truly clean and the managers act as if they do not care about your comfort at all. I will say that if you make a big enough stink about it you at least get some of your money refunded to shut up. However, the cost is not that high so I would rather just get better service. They say they have renovated some of the rooms and I have stayed in both the "not yet renovated" and the so-called "renovated" rooms. They are both disgusting with that moldy horrible smell and second hand store furniture. I do not believe the owners know what renovation looks like. If I could dump this property, I would. If you are the type of person that spends most of your time on the strip returning to your room to get a quick shower and power nap, then this is the place for you. If you are like me and want to enjoy you stay in your room as well, stay somewhere else, anywhere else. The Motel 6 that rents rooms by the hour has better rooms.

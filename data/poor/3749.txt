The Amabassador to the Rats The Ambassador Hotel has mice. Hungry mice. They came into our room while we were on the beach an ate a bar of Hersheys I left on a table. They only left crumbs and a few mouse droppings as a sourvenir. When we complained to the hotel desk they gave us the typical Ambassador response which is basically no response. I was expecting some sort of refund and a different room, but nothing was offered, not even an apology (obviously they knew about the mice problem because they showed no surprise in their face, then again, nothing seems to surprise these people). The rest of the hotel is mediocre and not even worth mentioning, we booked it through Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays because it was the cheapest, so we were not expecting the Hilton. The pool is a joke. And yes, there is noise from trash collectors in the morning. I wanted to say that you get what you pay for but the rodents could have done more damage, specially if you have a baby. The employees are retarded but smart enough to try to slip an extra charge every chance they get. In conclusion I would say, the Ambassador posses a health hazard for most people and a pocket book hazard for all people. Avoid it if possible.

When they say it's located IN times square, this is a LIE. It is a few blocks from "the" times square and is extremely small. The front desk is rude, we called for a travel kit (as the sign in the bathroom said if we needed it to call) and they did not give it to us. We waited about 45 minutes after calling about 6 times and still didn't receive it. The "lobby" is literally the size of my bedroom and the rooms aren't any better. They are very very small, can barely fit your luggage. We ended up taking the stairs most times cause the elevator was always full or taking way too long. After the first night we immediately changed to the Renaissance actually located IN times square, and had a VERY enjoyable stay.

Horrible, horrible experience. They claimed I checked out a day early, didn't have my reservation. I actually had to bring my laptop down from my room to show them the reservation, as the person they sent to get the paper copy didn't give it to the manager (I was not allowed to use the computer behind the desk, and the desk help claimed that the business center did not have a printer). They wanted to charge me $499 a night to "rebook" by reservation, even though I had prepaid. My key card only worked once throughout the entire weekend. The manager claimed that she would comp me my next stay, with an upgrade, but I have not heard from her - she said she would send me an email. To top it all off, when I checked out, they gave me someone else's bill! Oh, the room itself was fine, but definitely not worth the hassle. They're slogan of "whatever, whenever" is pure bull - they can't even get the basics right.

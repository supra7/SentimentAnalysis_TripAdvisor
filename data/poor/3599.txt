Horrible Place We didn't actually stay in this hotel because - when we booked it directly through the hotel, they did say they had limited parking available. The girl actually told me, however, it was very easy to park on the street and that most of the residents in the neighborhood parked in their own garages so at night parking was easily available. Being familiar with this SF neighborhood, I doubted this, but booked anyway. I called back later and was told there was no on site parking, but a lot was available across the street for $20. When we arrived - very early in the morning - on the day of our reservation, we noticed the lot across the street was about 3/4 of a block away across a very busy median strip- type street. So, we decided to find another place, knowing we were hours earlier that the usual 6pm cancellation time. When I had booked this hotel, NO mention was made of a concellation date or penalty for cancelling. We had already found another hotel with parking a block away and called to cancel. They charged our credit card anyway, even tho' I know they filled the room that night. I would never stay here and definitely do not recommend it!!!!

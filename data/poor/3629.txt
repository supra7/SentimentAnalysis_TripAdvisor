Almost a jail cell My husband and I planned a weekend in the city as a pre-Valentine's celebration. Upon arriving at the hotel, we had to go next door to the deli to check in. What struck us as strange was that as soon as we walked over to the cashier she immediately knew who we were. It was almost as if we were the only ones with reservations that night! Once she gave us our keys and we went upstairs, we were turned off by the odd smells and dark, creepy hallways. We walked into our room and it was so unbelievably small and dirty, that it reminded us of a jail cell. My husband notified me that he made a special request for a view. We looked out the window and on the fire escape directly outside were old coffee cups, and directly below us was a dumpster. Our view was of broken windows looking into a parking garage and a dirty alleyway. We immediately made arrangements to stay at another hotel and returned our keys to the cashier at the deli (since the front desk was unattended). We will never stay here again!!!

I had to pay an inflated 140pn due to the tube strike - all other nearby hotels were full. The room was basic but clean though the bedding looked worn. The road outside was VERY noisy & the reception couldn't move me as the hotel was full. Breakfast was in an underground windowless room with a dominant TV blaring - the food was un-appetising, I didn't bother the second day. I won't stay here again.

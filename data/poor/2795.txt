My wife and I stay in NY about every 7 weeks for a weekend. I have stayed at this property before and would have told you it was wonderful, but boy have things changed. First I understand the property is under new management so that may explain some of the problems. On arrival we were told that their once very lively and entertaining lounge was closed down by the BD of Health. Next the phone in our room was broken, the television was broken, the computer modem was broken and last but not least the air conditioner was broken. In order to call the front desk I had to get an outside line and call the hotel directly to get any help with these problems. The television sensor was broken and it took an engineer to actually figure it out. It then took an engineer to install a completely new modem and the engineer was never able to figure out the a/c. Bright spot the engineer was a great guy we became fast friends as a result of all our contact. Also Kevin the doorman was great and should probably leave for a better gig. At over 400 a night this is certainly not the place to stay

Disappointing - I agree with absolutely horrible below; we must have had the same room. I might have given this place one more star had it not misrepresented itself as a luxury boutique property. The lobby is nice, but the rest is like Ralph and Alice's place in THE HONEYMOONERS. Exposed pipes, too many coats of paint, cracks and peeling paint on the walls and ceilings; trash on the fire escape outside our window (which I removed). The bathroom is tiny, and decrepit. Worst of all, we had a confirmed reservation for a king bed deluxe room; we were given the tiniest room with 2 single beds. So much for the romantic weekend. We asked to be moved the next day, and were offered a smelly smoking room with a king bed. After raising our voices, they happened to find a nonsmoking king-bedded room. Why the hassle and lies? There have got to be better choices than this place. It needs a major overhaul.

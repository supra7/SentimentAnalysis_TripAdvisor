I went on a paid business trip for three days with this hotel. I checked in with three of my other co-workers at the same time. We each gave our credit card so they can hold a $60.00 deposit. When I woke up the next morning, my account was drained. The Hotel Deca charged me for my room which was already paid for plus other service fees.They only could offer well it would be back in your account in 3 to 5 business days!!! No apologies at all, I was 2000 miles from home with no money to eat or anything. Thank God for my co-workers who loaned me some money. Finally I was able to talk to a competent person, the last day of my trip (still with no money and service fees from my bank racking up) . She offered me a free breakfast and a complimentary shuttle ride to the airport since I didnt have any money. Or at least I thought, but two and a half weeks later my account was overdrawn again by this Ridiculous hotel at 11:30 at night. I couldnt believe this crap. WTH, after almost an hour on the phone with my bank setting up a fradulent charge and puttting in a claim , I was able to talk to another rude indidvidual who said"look I dont wanna waste your time cause there"s nothing I can do. I then gave him all the info. my bank said fax them so they can take the charge off and he said he didnt have acces to a fax machine. Can u believe that. Im going to be sure to talk to my HR, and let them know this is not a good hotel at all. The work ethics and morals of this place is real low. Oh and P.S I wasnt the only one out of our company who had problems, just the worst!!!! The free Wi-Fi was horrendus, kept freezing up, my anti-virus spyware kept detectincg malicious activity that would harm my pc. No pool, No spa & for 140 a night. Please...I can go stay in the O.C for that price with a pool, and a hot tub, and free breakfast every morning of your stay, free shuttle, excellent food at the restaurant and a real fitness center. Save your money go somewhere else....

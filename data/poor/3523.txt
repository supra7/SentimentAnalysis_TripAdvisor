This has been the worst hotel I have ever been into. It is not stilish to start with, as moroccan style is much more luxurious and sophisticated (please go to a nice riad in Marrakech and you will notice the difference straightaway!!) Aside from the would be stilysh lobby, the rest of the hotel looks like a motel on the highway: the "style" has disappeared, the rooms are incredibly small, the carpet is quite dirty, bathroom are less than essential and last but not least the walls are so thin you can hear everyone sleeping on the other side of the hotel So overall for the price it charges, you can get much much better hotel in a much much better location. So don't go there never!!! It will spoil your holiday in NY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

On arrival at night the first impressions of the hotel seemed fine, but realised why they took the web picture at night as in the morning everything looked shabby. The breakfast area was in the atrium and felt like you were in a prison block (not that i have been in one) and was basic, as was the food. The waitress looked about 90 and was wiping the tables with a rag and bucket of dirty water and at one point dropped the serving tongs for the bacon on the floor and picked it up and put it back in! When breakfast finished at 9.30am they could not wait to get you out. The rooms were nice enough but the bathroom was small and the ventilation poor. The pool looked dirty and uninviting and the gym area was squashed in one corner. They were also carrying out a refurbishment, which we were not told about and was very noisy if trying to sleep in.When we complained and asked for a reduction they offered us a $50.00 voucher to eat at their in house restaurant, which no one went in!

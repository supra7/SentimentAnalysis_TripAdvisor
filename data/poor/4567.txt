pre-paid, walked in at 11:30pm to find out.... they have no rooms available, sorry!!! then I find out from the guy at the front desk that they do it all the time.... overbook and sell out. so... they "walked" me to another hotel (a nightmare of a hotel) which they paid less for then what i paid them... wait, did that make sense??? yes! thats what they did! I pre-paid $151 plus tax - they paid $139... then I find out from the front desk lady at the "new" hotel that I am not the first one today!!! So..... STAY AWAY FROM THE FELIX!!!! PS - went back today to speak to the manager which mysteriously was not there while the valet told me she was. I am not making this up!!!

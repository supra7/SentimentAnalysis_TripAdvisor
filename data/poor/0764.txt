I really can't believe all the positive reveiws for this hotel. We searched a few months ago on where to stay for our honeymoon, looking for online reviews, travel guides etc and decided to spend our 2nd part of our honeymoon at this hotel. However when we first arrived the lobby decor was decked out in old carpet, displays that looked like it hadn't been changed since it first open and when we got keys to our room, we were gobsmacked! There were tiny bugs, no bath, old safe (which btw we had to pay to use as well as the car park) sticky furniture, the list goes on. I have spent days in travel lodges that were cleaner! We got moved to another room which was a bit better however our view was of the contruction yard. After two days we moved to the Sheraton, 100 times better! I wouldn't be so angry if I payed alot cheaper to stay in Ka'anapali beach hotel but i didn't, the rates were only a few dollars cheaper than the 4 star hotels nearby. If your young, modern etc don't stay here, pls! I understand it is a family, traditional hotel, that doesn't mean cash in the profit and don't update the hotel since the 70s.

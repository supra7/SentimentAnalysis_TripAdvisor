the room we booked was "pavillion" - steer well clear as they look like run down motel rooms and very unsafe environment. we made our minds up when stepping out of the lift realising how run down they looked. we opened the door just in case they were nicer inside - but alas they were worse. We went straight down to reception and had to pay $10 per night extra for an upgraded room in the tower. Although they were better, the picutres on the website are nothing like the real thing and must have been taken decades ago. The worst thing about this hotel is that you cannot get to the lift without going onto the casino floor and then being gassed by the stench of stale smoke. your clothes stink by the time you have left the casino from the lift. I would never ever recommend this hotel dispite the pictures it is definitely not a nice place. There are better hotels for the same price. The staff were all very unhelpful and unfriendly.

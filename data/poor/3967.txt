I don't understand all of the positive reviews. Before leaving on this trip, and after reading all of the glowing reviews, I was pretty confident that I was going to a top-notch resort. Boy was I mislead! This resort is completely awful on more levels than I can mention: a) the food is awful, b) the beach is awful, c) the hotel lay-out is awful, d) the service is awful, and e) the pool is awful. The awful service is what killed it for me. When I go to an all-inclusive resort I expect excellent food and drinks. The food, in particular, was horrible, and anytime we'd go to one of the restaurants something that should take 10 minutes would take an hour - it would be at least a 3 hour ordeal for any meal. For such a "highly rated", "exclusive", resort this is unacceptable. And I must note, this wasn't just an issue for my boyfriend in me... I was there for a wedding, and EVERYONE experienced crappy service, food, and drinks. In April I stayed at a MUCH cheaper all-inclusive resort in Mexico... it blew this resort away. The only good thing going for Azul Fives are the rooms, which are very nice, however, I'm only sleeping there... so who cares?! In general, Azul Fives has a nice website with nice photos... but trust me, in reality, this place is not that sweet. My advice is to stay at an all-inclusive that doesn't have condo owners and requires everyone to have the all-inclusive package. A resort that is set up for all-inclusive hotel guests is better set-up to meet your vacation needs.

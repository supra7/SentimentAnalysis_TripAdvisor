The Holiday Lodge Hotel on Macleay St, Potts Point was the worst place I have stayed at in my life, I travel every month all over Australia and this place was by far the worst. This place is so bad, I would rather stay in a hostel, and in fact I have stayed in a number of hostels and they were far better than this place. The service, what service, no service, you turn up and the door is locked, you ring the bell and no one turns up. They photo copy your credit card details, so beware of future un authorised deductions. The rooms are really dirty, and cramped, the beds and towels are dirty, cleaner, THEY DON'T HAVE ONE, they get people off the street who can't afford to pay to "clean".

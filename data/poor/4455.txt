There were BUGS IN MY BED! Unfortunately, I am allergic to insect bites, and this spoiled my whole vacation, of which Las Vegas was the first stop. I had booked and paid for the room on the Southwest website, so I could not get a refund. The man at the front desk was apologetic (but did not look very surprised), and offered to move me to another room. But the overall look of the place made me doubt if they had any rooms without bugs. The carpets were dirty, the room smelled really bad, and the air conditioner was incredibly noisy. A truly disgusting place. I checked out in the middle of the night and moved to Golden Nugget a few blocks away.

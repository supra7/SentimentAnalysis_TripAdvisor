After reading all the positive reviews and looking at the hotels website we decided this would be the perfect place for us to start and finish our holiday. How wrong were we. Upon arrival the lobby told its own story. The carpet and stair carpet were absolutely soiled and appeared not to have been cleaned foe many a month. The receptionist just went through the motions of asking me to complete the paperwork. Now for the room. What a disgrace. Two of the doors had holes where it appeared someone had punched them, chewing gum stuck in the carpets and the so called air conditionong unit just covered in dust and fluff. The wardrobes and drawers smelt and were dirty. The bathroom and kitchen no better. We immediately complained and were offered another room. This was not much better but a little cleaner. Unfortunately on the bedroom window we had the lovely view of a climbing plant very much dead. The bedroom lamp was not working whereupon I had to change the bulb myself. As it was late we decided to stay has we had no real choice. The next morning checked the cupboards in the kitchen and found leftover food from previous occupants. As for the so called breakfast included in the price was nowhere to be found. Finally discovered it by the complimentary coffee, a danish pastry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were to return for another 5 nights but this was cancelled without hesitation. The staff were totallly unhelpful and appeared to have a couldn't care less additude. Even when checking out I had to ask the receptionist to move their own car that was blocking the only exit to the road. All in all a total disappointment and I could not recommend this hotel to any other traveller until it has undergone a total overhaul.

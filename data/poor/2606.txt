This hotel is not pet or people friendly. Our nine pound, non-shedding, well-behaved dog cost almost as much to spend the night as it did our four humans. We were told on the phone that the pet cost would be @ $75, but it was $150 on check-in due to "deep cleaning" after each pet visit. Really? Our "pet room" was filthy. Stains on the carpet and upholstery, dirty baseboards, leaking faucets, and worst of all, smoke smell was prevalent in our room. Our safe was broken, but after waiting for the security staff forever to show up, we finally gave up on that. There is no grass anywhere on the property to curb your dog. How can they claim to be "pet friendly"? The only bright spot was the valet staff. They were friendly and helpful.

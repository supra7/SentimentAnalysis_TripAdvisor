My wife and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle the night of November 7th. The rooms are pretty nice, but the walls are not good for sound proofing. In the room next door, the guests there had 3 LOUD quarrels that kept us up. Apparently, the police were called and at 4:15AM they finally quieted. While the hotel is not to blame for their quarrel, they should at least have tried to make it up to the guests that were inconvenienced. Thinking that they would at least apologize was my thought, but no such luck. When i brought it up to the desk clerk at check out, she merely agreed that it was loud and sent us on our way. Terrible customer service! I will never use a Warwick again.

Priceline Should Remove This From Their Selections Of Hotels We stayed here in September -- bought it through priceline... I agree with the other rater, it's not near the airport. In fact, it's a pain to get to. Checking in was a MESS --- an airline had cancelled and apparently this is where airlines place their stranded passengers at times. It took well over 20 minutes to check in.I'm surprised priceline keeps this hotel in their hopper --- as it turns out, it's no cheaper to book it through priceline for a good deal then it would be to shop directly with other hotels in the area. I just ended up 'accidentally' purchasing another night here -- through priceline. I had fogotten about my September 2006 experience. I'm scheduled to stay there one night on a stopover in March. So.... I'll write again after that adventure... hopefully it'll be improved!

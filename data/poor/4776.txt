This so called hotel was one of the worst places i have ever rested my head. WIth stains on the sheets and a television with only four different channels there is no need for a remote because there will not be one in your room. Also they do not tell us about the noises our heating system makes. honestly the only good thing about this hotel better hostel is the surrounding, it is very nice and safe. The rooms are as big as my closet at home. There is also a great view of the brick building next door. Heat cuts off after 12am.Another great aspect is that u get to share a restroom with at least six other rooms. But they do have wifi that you have to login to every five minutes. So if you are reading this and have booked your reservation to stay at this wonderful facility you should know that you are screwed because they have a three day process to cancel your room and also do not have a phone to contact them. So i hope you enjoy your stay at the royal park hotel of f hell.

Blooms. Essex. UK. Visited April 2007 We booked this hotel based on trip advisor reviews and some travel books. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Our ocean view room was hugely expensive at $400 but because of the price and reviews we were expecting something luxurious. It certainly wasn't. The view was great but the room and the hotel was very tired and needs updating. Our room was musty and the bathroom was tiny with the shower being something from the 70's. We had previously stayed in Las Vegas at $100 per night in a room bigger and better. The breakfast was fine but what a small and dingy room. The fitness centre was a joke. Not big enough to swing a cat in. Outside of the hotel is a toilet block so don't have a room on the left of the hotel as you will look out over it and the surrounding area is full of wooden shacks with quite a few homeless and young people partying. The staff were very pleasant but our stay was ruined as we felt the room was only worth max. $200. If you go here do not spend any more. I can't stress enough how it didn't meet our expectations. In fact we left early as we were so disappointed.

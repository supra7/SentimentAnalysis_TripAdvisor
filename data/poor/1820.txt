This was my third and last stay at The Marriot Copley. the first two stays were not great but I loved the location so gave it another chance. since we are in Boston almost monthly for business. We checked into a corner room on a high floor. The room was not clean- The bathroom had hair in it that was not ours, a toilet that was not flushed, and no towels. In addition there were several finger or toenail clippings on the carpet beside the bed- which led me to beileve the room was not vacummed. We called down to complain and after about an hour someone called back and offered cothe okies and milk to my children to make up for the mess- Obviously not what we needed at that point. Then at 4 am the service elevator which is located behind the room opened and closed almost non stop for about an hour- When we called the front desk the manager on duty dismissed our complaint and stated this is a busy hotel. The next day we were finally given a new room. Moments after leaving the old room I realized I left expensive new boots in the room. It took at least an hour to get someone to open the door of the old room wich had by this time been "cleaned" and occupied. Ofcourse the boots were gone! After speaking to several manager I was told they can not be found. Aside from the above the matresses are old and sag in the center, the furniture is old and chipped and bathroom has plenty of mildew!

Well I am not sure where I need to start. I was very excited when I booked this place because it seemed like a great location and cute and cozy. NONE OF THE ABOVE! I rented the suite up at the top. It's the one when you go all the way up the stairs to the left. Don't get me wrong I understand these places are old but this was way too much.. When we got up to our room there was cobwebs all over. The smell inside smelled like burnt flesh if that is even a smell. I had to call them 3 times to come and see about the smell because it was THAT bad. They had to put "air" cleaners in the room. They had 3 hooked up. They said we could keep them the entire weekend if we wanted, because that is a relaxing vacation. The air didn't work, it was HOT AND STICKY. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. There was hair all over the counter and the towels were stained and nasty. Let me go to the bed. It STUNK so bad that I refused to lay in it. I was actually scared that the sheets were not even clean. LONG story short, I was planning on staying here for 3 days and after 5 hours there I checked out and went to the HILTON, where I had a clean room and NICE people. BTW, did I mention that when I explained to the lady that I wanted to check out because of all these reasons she REFUSED and said I was LYING. I still had to pay 300 dollars because she said now they wont have a chance of getting anyone in the room and I caused them to LOOSE money. NEVER AGAIN.

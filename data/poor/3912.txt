One of the worst hotel experiences ever...and on our honeymoon too! Zero customer service. We felt like were were treated like a number. Even though we reserved a room with a king size bed, they gave us one with two double beds. When we asked if there was something else available since we were on our honeymoon and had requested a king size bed, they simply said they were sold out. I asked if they could check with another Starwood property like the Westin down the street, and they said they'd get the phone number for us. Gee thanks. The room wasn't too good either. The fixtures were cheap, there was mold in the shower, and the door hinges were almost rusted out. It was also very loud in the hallways and from the balconies. The food was overpriced for the quality. (One star for the bread pudding at breakfast - that was good.) We got much better meals at the Westin down the street. The flat screen TV was nice, but we didn't got to Maui to watch TV.

If you plan on attending a function at the Key Arena, the location of this hotel is awesome. If you want a nice comfortable room then this is NOT the hotel for you. The rooms are super small, totally outdated and somewhat dirty. I felt like I was in an old run down apartment building that was converted to a hotel room. Our room (208) had trim coming off the wall ( and would have been dangerous for children) the pipe that runs through the bathroom gets really hot and can burn you and the furnace is older then dirt. The bathroom was awful and if you are super tall or any bit overweight you seriously would have a hard time fitting in there. The light over the bed is so close to the bed that you can hit your head easily and the bed is the smallest queen size bed I have ever slept in. To make matters worse we asked for a wake up call and it never came, meaning we almost missed our ride to the airport. When I asked why the call never came all the girl at the front desk could say was "oops, sorry about that, I just got here". We seriously stayed out as long as possible so we didn't have to go back to the room, it's quite depressing. We asked if they had bigger rooms and they said all the rooms were the same size. Don't recommend this hotel for families and especially children. If your just staying a night to attend the arena then it's doable but I won't be back there!!!

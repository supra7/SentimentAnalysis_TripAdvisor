When I heard that Hacienda Tres Rios was a eco-friendly, sustainable resort, I was so sold on the idea that I overlooked many of the bad reviews. In hindsight, I think I would have chosen a different place to stay. To be fair, there were some nice things about the resort - they have handmade sopes and quesadillas for breakfast, the service and food by the pool is amazing (pizzas in a wood burning oven, steak sandwiches), the cenotes on site are beautiful, rooms are ok. However, if you are going to do the presentation as part of the marking package, I would just say either pay the extra to not have to do it or just find a different resort. Although they initially told us it would be a 90 minute presentation and you can leave anytime after that, it was actually a three hour presentation and they DO NOT allow you to leave after 90 minutes. Regardless of whether we chose to buy it or not, we were still guests and I expected to be treated as such. They were very rude, made snarky comments about how we don't "have any money" and then stormed off and slammed the door in our face when we told them we didn't want to buy. The food at the resort is not great, room service food is worse. If you're going to see the beautiful turquoise waters, this is not the hotel to see them from. Also the location of the hotel is about 15 min from Playa Del Carmen which equals a $20 cab ride each way that can really add up if you want to get away from the terrible food. We went on a free kayak tour of the cenotes that was supposed to be for an hour, it lasted about 30 minutes. I would never come back here again.

Stay far away from this hotel!!! I booked through expedia and liked the pictures...very deceiving. The interior is not very nice to start and my whole experience ended up a nightmare. Initially, I wanted to check-in early which, when I called from the airport, was told would not be a problem. Got to the hotel and one of the towers was closed to to a pipe bursting. Ok, not their fault. So I wandered around for a couple hours and came back. Checked in (after a long wait with many other disgruntled travelers) and got to my room which I found did not have a working television, just snow. I called the front desk and was told there was no estimated time that it would be working if at all during my stay. I decided to give it a couple hours and went out. When I got back at midnight it was working. The next morning I ordered a "healthy" room service breakfast and ended up with yogurt that had already expired. To top it off the staff was lazy and not helpful. Instead of being appreciative and apologetic, I had to prompt them to fix things that went wrong, like "can I get another yogurt"? After a discussion and much prodding, I was promised a room credit for one night which I have never receieved, even after I asked about it at check-out. I was told I would have to speak to the person who had promised it to me who wasn't there instead of just having the credit on my bill. After I was home I was just happy to be away from that horrible hotel. Honestly, I think a Motel 6 or Best Western would have been cleaner and more comfortable. Not only will I NEVER stay at the Westin Seattle, but I will NEVER stay at ANY Westin hotels this experience was so bad.

We stayed in this hotel before our cruise and the room was ok. Upon return from the cruise we wanted to stay one night before we headed home. Room #107 was terrible with a moldy ceiling and water that dripped from the room above onto you as you sat on the toilet. This hotel has gone down hill from when we used to stay with our kids when we went to disney world. Avoid this place like the plague.

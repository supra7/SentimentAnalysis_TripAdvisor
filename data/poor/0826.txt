i booked this for some guests, it looks very nice from the pictures but it is not as it seems. Rooms are too cramped and the surroundings of the building are horrible. there is absolutely no customer service, i rang today in their opening hours which is 9-5.30 (at approximately 5.25 and they had already closed and i had to use the emergency number which just told me to leave a message. as my guests really didnt like it we had to move them to a different hotel. Would definitely not recommend for a joyful travel experience allthough i guess the price is ok

This place is a nightmare! Employees stole from us, there was a jamaican dealer who was staring at us like she wanted to kill us as we walked by. Then there was a hip hop party blaring in the room next door. We complained and they asked them to turn down the music they did for maybe 10 minutes and then blaring again finally asked to be moved at 2 am since they were not going to make them stop. I know Vegas is noisy but you would expect an extremely loud party to be dealt with. Believe it was an employees party as all their security seemed to be thugs as well. Also the smell of the rooms is sickening. You have been warned!

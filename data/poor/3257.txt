We booked our reservation at this hotel 1 month in advance and we booked a 2 queen size bed room. When we arrived we were told they sold out of their 2 bedroom queen size bed rooms. So four guys had to pack into one room with one king size bed and a couch. We spoke to management and they didnt do anything for us. They didn't care, they offered nothing. The service was horrible, and the casino was dead. Don't believe the hype of this hotel, the food is way over priced, the drinks are watered down, and the rooms are simply plain. DO NOT STAY HERE.... WHAT a waste of time and money, I will never stay here again, nor will my family and friends. Christina who is the manager, is very disrespectful and doesnt understand customer service.

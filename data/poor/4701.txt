We knew the risk we were taking when we booked a $40 room in an older hotel. It was supposed to be "Superior King Bed Room" with a refrigerator and microwave. There was no refrigerator or microwave when we arrived. The very nice front desk clerk told us we could put anything we wanted into the refrigerator in the office. Who would put food in refrigerator that they couldn't see? GROSS. The smell in the room was SO BAD that after an hour in the room, I became physically ill. The entire carpet was wet, which is probably where the smell was coming from. We were moved into a room with double beds, which was uncomfortable for my husband and I. The smell in that room was barely tolerable, but I fell asleep with a wet rag over my face because it was so late that we didn't think we would be able to find another hotel. The next morning, I asked for a refund for the price difference between the room we stayed in and the room I had PAID for ($10 for the refrigerator/microwave and $10 for the room). The best the manager would do was a 10% discount, which wasn't even close to the price difference in the rooms. We even had to jump through hoops for that small amount. IT'S NOT WORTH THE SMALL SAVINGS YOU WILL HAVE! Spend a few extra dollars and avoid this disgusting hotel!

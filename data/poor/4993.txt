*the rooms were tiny *uncomfortable *we had luggage and we had to drag them up 3 flights of stairs *claustrophobic * the orange wall in the room made us want to puke * we took the room with the window and it felt stuffy! Cant imagine the room without windows! Many of you may ask, why the fuss, didnt you know about this already? YES we did and fell for their trap (lowww tariff)! However we wouldnt have minded spending a little more and staying in a comfortable place in hindsight!

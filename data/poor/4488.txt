We booked here thru AARP Expedia for three nights. When we arrived after midnight in Las Vegas (flight delay!) the hotel clerk told us they had no record of our reservation and made no attempt to find us a room elsewhere. The hotel staff were rude and obnoxious. Expedia did nothing to get us another room. And then I found out when I got home that they charged us anyhow!!!!

Out of the bathroom going to bed, I was sure I saw something moving on the carpet. Switched the light on: nothing. Switch it back off. And waited. Waited there in the dark. Then I saw it again. Gosh it was quick. I got one shoe slowly without breathing. And, yes, eventually I managed to smash it. Nice specimen I captured (see picture). Overall it's a nice place to be if you're into entomology and/or like hunting rather than sleeping.

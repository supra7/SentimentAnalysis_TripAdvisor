Dont waste you money on this hotel For a start this hotel is completly overprice from the room down to the bar. The rooms are dark with little light and only a view of a brick wall from you window, the food wasnt great, the evalvator was out of order, It has virtually no facilities you could almost fit the bar in your pocket and it is the only facilityin the place. I would strongly recommend you to spend your money on a more worthy hotel in new york city.

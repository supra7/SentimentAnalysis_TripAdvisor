You can tell this place use to be a crash hotel by the looks. They have fixed it up, but it's still a dump; the sink and towel rack supported with 2x4's, cigarette burnt marks on the furniture and blanket, pervasive cigarette smell in the room, veneer chipping and falling off the furniture,etc. The worst part is the down and out is still crashing at the place. Your neighbor could be the crazy who talks to himself or the John solicited by the hooker standing in front of the joint. Do not go to this place. For the same price you can go to the 6th Avenue Inn a block away.

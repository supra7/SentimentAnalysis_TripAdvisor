As a business traveler, I spend over 200 nights/year in hotels. I usually have great luck with the Candleood chain. Irving, TX and Temple, TX are awesome, but this one in Memphis made me think I was in an old Holiday Inn. First off, the room was filthy when I got there, and it had been cleaned...! Food drippings from a spoon were all over the stove/cooktop. The fake wood floor had not even been swept, let alone mopped. Pieces of food and paper scraps all along the edge of the kitchen floor.. The carpet had not been vaccumed. The back door of the building had a place for your keycard, but the door was never locked the entire time I was there..! Some security.!!! The keys quit working before 10 AM the second day, and I still had another night to go. The refrigerator had not been wiped out or sterilized.....something sticky and red was on one of thw wire shelves. The ice cube dispenser was full of ice cubes...usually at all hotels the ice catcher is emptied after each guest. 3 or 4 large bags of trash sat by the trash can by the elevator ALL weekend. I met a man in the hallway by the fitness room and he did not even say "Good Morning" on Monday morning...I found out he was the manager....!!! I guess it's time to head back to the Residence Inn chain...where I'm not afraid to walk across the floor barefoot.....

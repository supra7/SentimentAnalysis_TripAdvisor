I am a professional stewardess and have an industry standard amongst some of the wealthiest people with the highest of standards. The rooms have no sufficient or functional storage area... The rooms are not cleaned properly if at all with room service and the staff are inconsistent with being respectful and helpful. The rooms had a mold in the roof and the lighting was not safely done. It does not have a flow nor do the staff really seem to be in a groove as a team nor for the guests. Too many different directions going on there which leads to chaos and detachment. The lobby smells of bleach as well. Hopefully, the NYC W Hotel will invest more in the cleanliness and service in the future. I would not recommend this to anyone nor would I ever return.

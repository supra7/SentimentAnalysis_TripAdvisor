well as a user of online dating sites I am quite familiar with people who show up and look nothing like their picture... This is one of those such dates. The images are VERY different to the reality. Maybe 10 years ago when this place opened it looked fresh and sweet but now its in need of a revamp and rework!! I was in a "Superior" room. (no. 53 for those who care) It measured 8 feet x 10 feet. There was no place to unpack The window blinds had to be kept shut because it looked out into another window on the back. The aircon was pitiful and LOUD!!! The bathroom was tiny and wasnt cleaned particularly well. As a bald man I tend to notice long black hairs all over the place and can safely say - they arent mine!! Now thats not to say that it was totally awful - you get free wifi and the staff are really friendly... Unfortunately this doesnt compensate for the $240 a night rate I ended up paying!! Its the last time I'll let someone else book a hotel for me :)) I wouldnt stay here again...

I stayed here using amercian express points which limited me to Westin hotels or Sheratons. As my reason for being in NY was to visit a friend on the east side, this was the closest. I hoped the reviews and pictures I saw were limited to lone room. alas, not the case, unless I was lucky enough to get the same room. The bathroom so poorly laid out that the toilet was so close to the sink I had to lean my arm on it to fit. Wallpaper was peeling in the bedroom. The hallways were dark and poorily marked. The carpet in the hallways was ripped in places and uneven. I was using a cane at the time due to a recent ankle break and it was only due to my extreme attention to the walking surface that I was able to avoid tripping. It is an accident waiting to happen. I felt no connection to the staff, they were not unhelpful just impersonal. I stayed again in Jan. under protest. I had a suite this time. the bathroom was very small though the toilet a little better placed. The hallway remained dark and uninviting, the staff impersonal. My experience here was in sharp contract to the W Tuscany where I stayed in Dec. of 2007. We had two rooms, both great, the staff very helpful and attentive. The W Tuscany I would definitely recommend .

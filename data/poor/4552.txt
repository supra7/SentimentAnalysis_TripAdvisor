Beware, beware!!! The hotel offers a very nice atmosphere and choice of food for brunch but no-where do they tell you what it will cost you!!!! Outside at the entrance they advertise a 20 Euro breakfast. We went in, selected a few things from the brunch, were offered a lovely fresh drink, selected a few small items on a small plate and when we received the bill, found we had been charged 38 Euros each! - not even a glass of cheap Champagne was offered to justify the price. Not a surprise now that the one hotel partner/owner was enjoying a bottle of champagne on his table - the place was packed and he was due to earn more from his brunch charges than from the rooms!!! I hope that you go there, try it and leave without paying :)) Revenge needed!!

Whatever you do - don't stay here. It is filthy, disgusting and tried to ruin our visit to Singapore. Even with a budget, we decided to leave after having paid for last night as we couldn't stand it any longer. We wondered about catching something and also wondered if we might be dirtier coming out of the bathroom than before going in to shower. Reception staff we very nice but it is disgusting. Extremely noisy, plastic covered mattresses made it hot, especialy when covered by sheets with holes in them. What more needs to be said - nothing - don't bother. Pay a little bit extra and enjoy your visit.

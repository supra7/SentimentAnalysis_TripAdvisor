I was prompted to write this review after my worst hotel stay ever! This was not even a one-star hotel, I wish there was a lower rating than one star. As soon as I walked in to the hotel I couldn't wait to go home. The room was extremely small, no room temperature gauge and there was about an inch between the carpet and the bottom of the door so I had to put a towel down to keep the space out. I agree that this is a great a great location, but there's also a Hilton right down the street.

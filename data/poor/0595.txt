We missed a connecting flight in Seattle so the airline put us up in the Quality Inn. It was not a pleasant experience. It took 45 minutes for the van to come and pick us up. It drove right past us the first time...didn't even slow down to see if people were waiting. After several phone calls to the reception (who couldn't have cared less) the van finally stopped to pick us up. The rooms... horrible. Our rooms were so cold we ended up grabbing all of the bedding off of the 2nd bed to use on the one we were sleeping in. I turned on the heater and had to shut it off because the smell was so bad. My associate and I had adjoining rooms and both of us ended up doing the same thing and sleeping with our heads under the covers to try and stay warm. About 5am all you could hear were people walking around above you... and it was so loud. Really bad floor creaks and you could hear every foot step. I have travelled all over the world and stayed in some pretty nasty places, but I just could not believe an airline would put their passengers in this place. There are much better places to stay near the Seattle airport.

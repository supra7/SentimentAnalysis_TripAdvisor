We stayed 3 nights at this resort. They gave us a room with 2 double beds on the 2nd floor with the garden view. Basically there is no view at all and very dark. We complained and they gave us another room with the king size bed on the 2nd floor on the other tower. But we have to promise to switch to another room the next day. So the next day I asked to review the room first before we move. Again they gave us another garden view room on the second floor and you will hear the sound of the waterfall which is so noisy all day. After a few pick, I rather choose the mountain view room on the 9th floor facing the parking lot which is less noisy. We heard lots of guest complain to the front desk during our stay. After all I do not recommend this resort, we walked to to Sheraton resort which seems much better even the pool area is not as nice as the Westin. The staff at the front desk is not friendly except one lady called Grace whom let me look and choose the rooms the 2nd day. Beware ! They treated you like second class citizen if you buy the package from the internet and will give you the worst room on the lower floors only.

Well first for the good news about NYC, the city was packed with people. All hotels were full,, which surprised me because it was August. With everyone finally coming back to NYC gave me some problems trying to find a hotel for our last minute trip to NYC. I tried all my regular hotels, Essex House, St. Regis, Palace Hotel, Four Seasons, ALL FULL! So my last resort was the W on Lex., all of the other W's were full also. The fact the W had room should have been a warning to me. I checked in and was told I wouldn't a non-smoking room. By this time it was midnight, and my Starwood preferred gold status didn't mean bubkus to the rather rude lady at check-in. So up to the smoke filled floor, and somehow I got rather lucky as the smell of smoke wasn't that bad. I called downstairs to ask for a mini refrig. to be delivered to my room. The Whatever Whenever person told me no-Lovely. The room was approx. 200 square feet. When I pulled my comforter off the bed, I noticed a cigaarrette stain on the mattress-Oh how GROSS- The bathrooms at the W should be called room for one person, preferably a small person. The next day we were moved to a suite-It was so very depressing. The furniture in the living room needed to be renovated, and the room smelled like mildew. I was looking forward to a nice long hot bath. Walked into the bathroom and it was the same size as the first room, with no bathtub. The bed-this must have been a joke or something. We own the Heavenly Bed at our house, the bed we slept on that night was anything but comfortable. We would never stay at this property again.

A grand lobby, but this hotel is showing some wear and tear - renovations seem to be taking place with elevators & etc., so perhaps this is being resolved. Clean rooms, although small - they are typical for a big city like Boston. My issue with the hotel was that it was hands down the LOUDEST place I have ever stayed. Paper thin walls. Between a room two steps from the elevator, and several wedding parties that sounded to have a great time (but were coming and going until 4 am) there was no sleep to be had. I would not stay here again - it was an expensive splurge to be awake all night, and I eventually checked out at 5am to head home and get some rest.

I walked into this VERY SMALL room and knew right away that I wanted to leave. I immediately called the front desk and demanded to check out early with refund. They told me to call the web site I booked through and talk to them; so I did. They told me the hotel would not allow me to check out early with refund. The hotel did move me to a slightly larger room, but not much better. So I had to stay in this very small room for 2 nights, which I paid a lot of money for. Worst value in a hotel ever in my life, and I've stayed in many hotels over the years.

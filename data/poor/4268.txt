We waited in a very short line for over an hour for a terrible buffet at Flavors in Harrah. It was listed as one of the best buffets and things must've changed a lot since that review was written, because the hostesses/servers would only let one table in whenever one left like a club or something and when we complained, they didn't apologize, they actually said we were welcome to leave. After already having waited an entire hour of our precious vacation time and when I said that I didn't want to leave after waiting all that time and I just wanted to know why they had it set up like that (having worked in restaurants myself and not understanding this concept) they called security on me. However security agreed with me and just stood around to prevent the rest of the line from bursting out into a riot. Then, once we finally were seated, we were treated to the worst sushi I've ever had in my life, poorly rinsed crab legs, butter that was little more than grease, overcooked chicken and a terrible layout. If you're looking for a variety, go to the buffet at the Mirage, it's definitely much better and you won't have to wait in a ridiculous line for no apparent reason.

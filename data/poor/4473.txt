We got there after a 22 hr drive and expected to get one of the newly renovated Queen rooms. It was renovated but they were full size. The air conditioner had 1" of clearence between it & the bed. A/C didn't work, was falling apart & they put us in a non smoking when we asked for smoking. We changed to a smoking room the next morning but it was a 1/4 mile walk to the back of the hotel. As we were moving into our new room, so was our new nieghbor...a hooker & everything she owned. At least she was kind enough to post a "WELCOME" sign outside her door so her customers wouldn't get lost. Between her fighting with her roommate right outside our door & the long winded 4am conversations 2 ft from my window with her pimp, I got no rest at all. When we checked out, there was another hooker & her pimp trying to check in but there was some confusion as to who actually owned the car they had to list on thier check-in sheet. Stay FAR AWAY from here!! Tiny showers even a "little person"would have difficulty with, missing light fixture covers & roaches. Save your $$$ and go elsewhere!!!

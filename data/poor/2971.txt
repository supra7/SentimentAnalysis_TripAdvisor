We have just returned from the Magic Castle. I booked it on the excellent reviews this place has been given. Check it out on Google Earth first! No-one mentions the Helicopter flights from beside the hotel or the go-cart racing clearly visible on the map. The furnature and rooms are old and stained and the carpet sticky but if you can see past that the staff do keep the place clean. Every day we had clean towels and sheets and the staff were all really helpful and friendly. However our room had ants, bedbugs and cockroaches. The location is great for Disney only 10 mins drive to Downtown where you can park for free and then use the disney buses to get to all the parks etc. The free shuttle ended over a year ago. The breakfast is what you would expect for a cheap motel but there are many excellent places within walking distance for food and a huge Walmart just a few mins drive or 15 mins walk away. You get what you pay for but I have stayed in many motels in the area for a similar price but of a much better standard. A member of staff told me that some of the reviews of the motel, on this site may not be genuine and if you stay there you will find out that could well be true. This area always has plenty of rooms available and as we walked along the road many places were advertising room for $10 less per night. Next time I will go and check out the place in person before I book.

Ok, the location of this place is pretty good. The people that worked there were nice enough. I kind of felt sorry for them for working in such a dump. I stayed in one of the back buildings, not the ocean side ones. Honestly I booked it because it was the cheapest I could find and wanted to save my work money. However, there was a mandatory amenity fee which was reasonable for what you got, especially since they don't charge for parking, but it shouldn't be mandatory. I could have lived without it. If those charges had been in the initial price I would have stayed elsewhere. So if you expect the cheapest, expect what comes with the cheapest. For me it included a pillow that reeked of urine, a shower that had what looked like years of soap scum, an A/C that necessitated using ear plugs to sleep, and what was likely the worst bed I ever slept on. Also, our room was supposed to be a single queen bed but instead had 2 beds which wasn't so romantic--on the plus side it actually allowed one of us to sort of sleep. It's nice to see the manager responds to reviews and I feel bad for her. I'm sure she is in a tough position trying to manage what is basically a dump. Then again, if it wasn't, I'm sure they'd charge a lot more. Overall it was no big deal because I was there for work, but if this had been some big vacation I had saved up for I would have left after the first night.

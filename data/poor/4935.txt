My husband, I, and another couple book a 2 bedroom at Summer Bay to celebrate our 1st anniversary. When we arrived they had already filled their 2 bedrooms and had to give us 2 one bedrooms for the first night. This is even after we called and told them we would be checking in late. We were in the main building this night and we were asked to come back down in the morning and they would move us to a 2 bedroom. After 3 hours of waiting the next morning to be moved they set us up with a smoking room without asking if this was ok. We ended up having to wait longer. When we were finally place in a 2 bedroom non-smoking room we were not told there was a shuttle to take us to the "newer" facility. So we walked, through construction to the very back of the complex. Wanting to just get settled in we soon found out the hot water was not working properly and the shower was stuck between bath and shower because the knob had fallen off. It took three calls to get this fixed. I knew before we went that they were under construction, but not to the extent of what it truly was. The place is a mess, and while this will most likely be a very nice place to stay when they are finished it is far from that right now. And you will no longer be near the strip. Be ready to take their shuttle service, which was great at times, but not always so. And if you do have any issues, do not expect the staff to be helpful. Especially if you have booked your time through RCI. One of the front desk managers was extremely rude to my father in law and basically said he wasn't going to do anything for us. I suggest waiting until they are completely done with the renovations before staying here.

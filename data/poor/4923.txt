This is the type of place that you are afraid to let your feet touch the floor in. They don't even have real carpeting, it is some kind of burlap/velcro material that you stick to when you are walking. It's like something you would put on a makeshift porch of a trailer. The air conditioning doesn't work and the room is about 85 degrees right now. Yes, I am currently in it suffering all of it's horrors. Don't trust the pictures...I don't know how they made it look so nice online. And there is nothing cozy about it. It makes you wish you brought your own linens! In fact when I did a search on this hotel Google prefilled the words "bed bugs" after the name...I am not even going to click on it.

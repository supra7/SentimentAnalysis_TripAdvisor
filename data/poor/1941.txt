Sorry to say we were just in Boston for a convention hosted at the Park Plaza. Lovely building, the lobby is charming and nostalgic, lots of history. However... the rooms were quite small, and the bathrooms are in serious need of remodeling/renovating, with exposed pipes, etc. Now for the bad news!! As we were getting ready for bed, we noticed a small bug on the pillow. When we pulled the covers back, we found another! The mangement quickly offered us an upgraded room with our first of a several night stay to be free. However, the bellman told us the hotel had bedbugs brought in by a group from Venezuela, TWO YEARS AGO! We were told that in order for the hotel to completely eradicate the bedbugs from their hotel, they would have to completely empty the hotel of guests and bug bomb the entire building... probably not a profitable undertaking. We immediately checked out and went elsewhere (Ritz-Carlton).

There were many problems... 1. The air conditioning. It ran constantly, and smelled like cheap air freshener. I tried to turn it off, and after a while, the smell subsided. But once you open the door, it resets, and the air turns back on!! Very gross smell!!!! 2. The ceilings are way too low. I am almost 7 feet tall, and had to duck to avoid hitting the fire sprinklers and air vents, etc, on the hallways. I now they are trying to maximize vertical space, but my god, what about us tall people! 3. The casino has such a low ceiling also, that the smoke is trapped closer to people. It is the smokiest of the casinos on the strip. I noticed in all the other casinos that I walked thru, that the smoke level was well less then 1/10 as much everywhere else! I will never stay at harrahs again, mostly because of the smelly air conditioning, and smoky casino... if they didn't have these two problems, I'd deal with the ducking, but cannot because of the other problems.

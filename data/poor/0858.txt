This hotel is a hub for Americans coming in and out of Afghanistan so it is occupied with at least 3 to 4 Americans in the room. There's always sooooo many people in the Lobby and standing outside that it is unpleasant to just simply walk into your room or stand outside to get a cab. The rooms are big but basic and the service at the hotel counter was below average. I recommend choosing another hotel and also the Internet is overpriced and don't work up to par.

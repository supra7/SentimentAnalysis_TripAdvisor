I decided to give the Place one more try. Had been there just after Katrina, and found it dirty. Blamed it (maybe) on lack of staff. Well , as I stated before, it has a nice atmosphere, when you first look, but when you are up close, still, the diry, moldy, mildewy place it was a few years ago. The furniture and carpets are getting shabby, and the place smells like mildew. Nice location, but nothing more. I'm back to cookie cutter, as the regulars like to call it, because, I'd rather have cookie cutter and clean, then plain old dirt.

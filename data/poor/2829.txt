They didnt have the right room that i had booked, claimed they weret familiar with the 3rd party i billed thru (cheap o air) then tried to re-charge me for the rooms i had already paid for. they said it was cleared up and took my cc for "incidentals" and to this day 2 mos. later are still attempting to charge my card for the 2 rooms. its a long time consuming process im working on to get the charges deleted!! rooms were dirty robes old dingy and not soft at all!! no more W hotels for this girl!

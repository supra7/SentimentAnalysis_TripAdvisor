I had my purse stolen at Alamo car rental within the first hour of arrival at Maui. When I checked in to Hyatt, my stay was prepaid, but I didn't have a credit card to present to them for meals, etc. Even though they were able to verify this information with my credit card company and the police report, they treated me like a criminal!!! The credit card company even assured the Hyatt that they were overnighting a new card to me c/o the Hyatt! I've never been treated so badly by ANY hotel! I was humiliated, and they ruined my entire vacation! The grounds are great, but the rooms are not worth the price.

Not sure about you, but where I come from "boutique" hotel means something different... Had a confirmed reservation for a Superior Queen room and didn't exactly get what I paid for - the bed was a Full and still not sure what, if anything, was Superior about this room or establishment in general. Room and bathroom are tiny (even by NY standards), the extra blanket provided had someone else's hair all over it. If I was charged the correct amount I'd say you get what you pay for. Seeing how I was overcharged by $150+, this isn't really the case. Still trying to get through to the front desk to clean up the money mess. Their message has been saying "all lines are busy" for the last 20 minutes and it's 8:45am? STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I did not expect a Residence Hotel. To start off the parking is terrible. You need four separate security devices or keys to get into your room, parking etc. The bathroom walls were yellow streaked from steam and dust hung from the door header. The artificial plants on the bed night stands had not been washed or dusted in years. The "beautiful breakfast" is a buffet style served in a basement room. Uck. We walked to a nice restaurant for breakfast. For the money I would stay in Bellevue or another uptown hotel. I will not go back to this Hotel.

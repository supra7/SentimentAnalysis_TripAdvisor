Not Good Not sure what everyone else seems to love. My room was damp, the AC was incredibly noisy, part of the ceiling collapsed in the bathroom, the walls were paper thin (could hear the traffic/dump trucks cleaning dumpsters all night) and there was a strange moldy odor throughout my floor (the 5th). If you are looking for a great Boutique hotel in NYC, try the Hudson.

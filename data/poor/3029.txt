I travel a lot in the United States and Europe, for business and pleasure, and was shocked and appalled at the state of this property. The carpet was stained, the sheets were too small for the bed (and, thus, kept coming off), the television reception was snowy on all but three channels and I had to move the furniture to find an outlet. Alone, these issues would have been tolerable - however, the bathroom was worse. The sink, toilet and shower/tub drains and handles were either rusted or oxidized, the tile was cracked and the grout was black with mildew, and the tiny plastic shower head offered a trickle of water pressure, along with a permanent sign underneath that warned patrons "a decrease in water pressure is accompanied by an increase in temperature". In addition, my three colleagues had similar problems with their rooms. My home was built in the 1930's; I have a great appreciation for older architecture and, generally, a high tolerance for the unknowns that can happen in these types of places. This place was disgusting.

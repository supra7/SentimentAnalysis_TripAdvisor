I booked a room at the Hotel San Carlos since I was traveling for the gov't and I could get the government rate there. Boy was this a mistake. I would have gladly paid the difference to stay at the Hyatt or Wyndham instead. I stayed at this hotel for five nights. I booked a suite, but when I checked in they tried to give me a different room. After some back and forth I was able to get the suite. Thankfully the suite had a refrigerator --- I later found out from my colleagues staying there that the regular rooms don't have refrigerators. This is pretty significant when it is 105 degrees and you want to be able to drink something cold. Plus the suite is much larger than the regular rooms. However, I was located a few floors above the pub that plays live music at night. It was VERY loud and the floor vibrated. Also there is a bar across the street that broadcasts music out into the street. Thankfully I had a ear plugs that was the only way that I was able to get some sleep. Also, the walls are like paper and I could hear a party going on in a room across the hall one night plus noise coming through the vents. Since the have central air, you can't control the temperature. I found it a bit hot and stuffy the first few nights. The carpet felt pretty dirty and the bathrooms were very old and dingy. I smelled cigarette smoke on the last few days. The hotel is supposed to be haunted, but I didn't experience anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps the noise scared the ghosts away. The front desk staff was not particulalrly helpful. Plus the area surrounding the hotel is a construction zone that is extremely noise throughout the day. The area is a bit questionable and I did not feel comfortable awlaking around alone after 8 pm. If you are attending a meeting at the convention center, do yourself a favor and spring for the Hyatt or the Wyndham. I sure wish I had!!!!

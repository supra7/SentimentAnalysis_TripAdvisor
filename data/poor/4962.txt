WOW... this is hands down one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at in my entire life. My group had a flight canceled so we had to stay here. First off, it was the middle of summer & half of the a/c's didn't work at all - they just blew warm air. The place smelled like an ash tray, nothing - and I mean nothing - in the place was clean - everything felt sticky, everything in whole hotel was at least 20 or 30 years old, the carpet & furniture in each of our rooms were full of stains - all 20 years old or more and Lord only knows of what - and to top it off the shower & shower curtains were stained with mildew & not even cleaned. Seriously, you could take a dump on the floor, rub it in, & no one would be able to tell the difference. Basicly, this is a hotel fit for a cheap prostitute but I don't even think that they would stay here. This hotel is why I will NEVER stay at another Ramada Inn - PERIOD!

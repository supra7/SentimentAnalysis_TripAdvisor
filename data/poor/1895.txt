Reading the previous reviews after staying at the Park Plaza, I can only ask, were we at the same hotel?! Stay at this lousy, dated hotel if you get an unbelievable low, discounted rate, otherwise there are so many better places to choose from... Good news: Yes, the location is a positive, accessible to so many attractions and restaurants. And the beds were very comfortable. Bad news: Everything else. We had to switch rooms, as the first one had a radiator that banged and hissed nonstop. (not that you can really control the temp. anyway). Second room, also on the 12th fl (St. James and Arlington St. side) had windows that leaked and blew cold air (on a frigid winter night), almost welcomed when the heat roasted us, but they'll also let you know when the garbage trucks and freight trucks made their deliveries throughout the night. Knowing that the high-end condo building, The Heritage, is right across the street, and from times visiting there, you'd have no idea you were on a busy street, I'd say the Park Plaza needs new insulated windows. What I'm trying to say: we didn't get much sleep. (also walls between rooms are paper thin, you could hear the toilet flush next door) And the baths are ridiculously small. The size of a toilet directly next to a pedestal sink next to the shower. At night and the next morning, the shower was barely luke warm. I could go on... We had a great dinner right across the street at Davio's, but the night at the Park Plaza will by our last. Definitely!

They messed up our add-ons, but apologized I'm writing this to help other TripAdvisor users, not to grind any particular ax. I recommend not ordering any additional items through the hotel's website, or if you do, call ahead to make sure they are following through.My wife and I were staying at the Casablanca for our tenth wedding anniversary, which the hotel knew. When I booked our stay, I ordered (as a surprise to my wife) add-ons that the hotel offers on its website: a bottle of champagne, a bottle of red wine, and flowers to be waiting in our room for our arrival. The total price of the add-ons was about $150.The items were a no-show. They apologized when I pointed out the omission, and offered to make the champagne complimentary and deliver the flowers the next day.We ended up cancelling our stay, so I won't comment on the hotel other than to say that everything else seemed very nice, the location is fantastic for Times Square access, and the staff and management were genuinely upset that they had made the mistake, apologizing many times. They tried to make it right, and graciously agreed to cancel our reservation.I believe that the Casablanca hotel probably deserves all the great reviews it gets on TripAdvisor and I don't discourage anyone from booking this hotel (except the add-ons). MY overall experience was unquestionably Terrible but I can easily see why everyone else has liked it. I hope relating my experience is helpful to you, the TripAdvisor user, if you're considering the add-ons.

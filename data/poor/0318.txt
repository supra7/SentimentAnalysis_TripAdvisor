I reserved this hotel through priceline and I should say it was one of the worst 4-star hotels I had ever seen. The decoration was not to my taste, which is not really a big deal. The main problems were: 1. The sink in the bathroom, the water would not go... so it would flood in less than 60 sec of running the water. 2. No bathtub in the "DELUXE" king bed rooms. Imagine we paid extra to upgrade the room from normal queen to a DELUXE king... :( 3. The water pressure in the shower did was very very weak, never saw such a weak shower in my life. It took me 30 minutes to get all the shampoo out of my hair. 4. The TV remote did not work. 5. The TV cabinet door would not stay open to watch TV. We had to stuck something in front of it to keep it open. 6. No coffee table or dining table or nothing. We had to eat on the bed... Very hard with the little one. 7. Very noisy. Every time the neighbours opened or closed their doors it was like they were in our room. We could hear everything in the hall ways. 8. Very expensive valet parking (but to be fair, we knew that before we go). $33+taxes for each day. But when priceline gives that to you you have no choice anymore. 9. Was not worth the $80+taxes (per night) we paid priceline, and $10+taxes (per night) for upgrade. I cannot imagine who would pay their regular $200+ prices for this low quality. Completely unsatisfied. (Staff were nice and friendly though). I totally loved the Silvercloud lake union and wished I would have stayed there. Stay away, specially if you have young kids.

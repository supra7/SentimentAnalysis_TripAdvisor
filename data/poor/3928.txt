I booked a reservation with the Lahaina in for February of 2008 April 27th of this year. Subsequently, my husband and I have had an economic hardship and had to cancel six weeks after we booked. The Inn feels it is necessary to charge an outrageous cancellation fee of $150 even thought they have ample time to rebook the property. I tried to resolve this nicely with the inn by offering to pay any charges they might have incurred by processing our reservation but they felt the need to keep all of the $150. It is in dispute with the credit card company and it is illegal to charge excessive cancellation fees and then rebook. I should have checked this website before booking, the feedback speaks for itself! Don't book with these guys!!!!!!

I go to NYC once per month and the W Hotel on 49th and Lexington is a close walk to my office. I love the location and the hotel lobby is fun. However, the rooms are tiny, so small you cant even walk around the bed without slamming your toe into the wall. Each time I go there (been there 4 times in past few months) I dread opening the hotel room door. I keep hoping that since I am a frequent businesss person and am a premier member of the Starwood guest program, things will improve. But they never have. I need to find a new hotel chain that has more options in NYC unfortunately. This is not a family, kids friendly hotel.

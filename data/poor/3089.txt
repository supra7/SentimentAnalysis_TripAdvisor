I reserved this hotel on the internet because of the website and the reviews. I was extremely disappointed when we got to our room. It had a terrible odor, the "kitchen" was a piecemeal mess. The plumbing under the sink was exposed - no cabinet or covering. There was a small old stove that looked like it was falling apart. The lighting was terrible. There were holes in the floor under the carpet throughout the room. The furnishings were old and worn and the room was not very clean. It looked like a renovated studio apartment that was not completed. We checked out the next morning and found a very nice hotel over the hill for less money that was clean and had everything it advertised. I will never stay in a Pacifica Hotel again!

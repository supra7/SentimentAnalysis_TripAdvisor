Readers, I severly warn you to never stay here!! I booked my rate online, went down, to Boston checked in, everything looked ok.... The next morning they had raised my rate $200 and refused to lower it even though I had the confirmation email!! I will never stay here ever or any other Marriott if possible because of their total lack of responsibility. It has been almost two months and I am still trying to find a way to get them to honor the rate booked!

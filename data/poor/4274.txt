Stayed January 3rd - 7th. Booked a "Deluxe room", advertised as upgraded with Strip View. Nasty room, in Mardi Gras Tower (M524) on 5th floor with view of air conditioning and kitchen extractors, next to elevator/lift shaft (remember Vegas is a 24 hour city, and therefore so are the lifts) and so 24 hr noise. Given Styrofoam cups for coffee (very Super 8 style). Reception staff not interested in room change. PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE. Other places are better. This hotel chain (and they own 7 or 8 in Las Vegas) needs to look seriously at it's customer service, so check out hotels out of this chain first.

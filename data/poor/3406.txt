When I stayed earlier this year (February), the tiny shower had mold and mildew. So, this time (July) I asked for a different room with a clean shower. They gave me a different room, but the tiny shower still had mold and mildew. Still worse, the hot water in the shower came out only as a trickle. A great place if you want to take only cold showers in a dirty venue. Also there was no ice cube tray in the small refrigerator in February and again in July. If the rooms were as clean as the lobby, this would be a good place. I suggest you check out the bathroom BEFORE you sign on the dotted line.

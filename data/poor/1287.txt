One of the worst, if not the worst stay in my life. I should have continued on, but I was stupid. So close to the railroad track that the sound kept me up all night. Up from 1 a.m. on. The place was dirty, the ice machines did not work, the check-in clerk did not know anything about the motel, the floor was wet. The morning clerks were horrible.

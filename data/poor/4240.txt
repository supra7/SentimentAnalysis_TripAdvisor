Stayed at Harrah's from July 31 - August 4. Our luggage was claimed by somebody else (this hotel didn't even check ID for something this important but they were sure to check it if I was buying a $2 cup of coffee). Harrah's didn't even offer us a toothbrush - they sent things to "risk management" who of course sided with the hotel. No apologies, no help in getting our stuff back, no compensation - lost suitcase with all clothes and toiletries as well as our airport carry on bag with a Nook and mini-computer. When asked if we should call the LVPD we were told we didn't need to worry about it, their security would handle it. We stupidly believed that they were looking out for us. When we finally went to LVPD four days later after Harrah's could not give us a straight answer - the cop told us that we should have called immediately when it happened. Harrah's is liable but since we waited there was little they could do other than take a report. It amazes me that this hotel would care so little about trying to help out their guests in a situation like this. I will never stay at Harrah's or any other property owned by Caesar's Entertainment Corporation. It really makes me sick that a big hotel chain such as this can care so little about guest satisfaction but it will not make a difference in their turnout. Be very wary about this hotel, when looking through reviews I found a number of other ones about stolen items.

We stayed at the Pension Picasso for a long weekend after reading a few reports posted on varius web sites. It is cheap OK and bang in the middle of the Rambla but If you plan on visiting Barcelona do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else. The external door at night is surrounded by prostitues and pick pockets. The staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude the safes don't work in most rooms and the shower on the floor we stayed on has a step down past a large open window that is damn right dangerous. The allyway at the side is noisy well into the morning. The photo's on most sites of this place are nothing like what you get when you arrive.

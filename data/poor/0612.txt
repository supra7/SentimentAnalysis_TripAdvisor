Radissson Hotel, the very name conjures up lux and comfort. Be careful with this one though. Yes, very convenient to SeaTac, only 2 minute shuttle ride. But, downside is huge. She is old and worn out, probably constructed in the 1960's. Tear it down and start over. Or do a total makeover, but dont use the name Radisson in such a shamely manner. This hotel is dead in every way, except for the front desk staff and shuttle bus services, who were very courteous and friendly.

Where do I even start!!! The place was very dirty, the beds were from the 60's. We had the worst trip of our lives and left after two days!!! The staff was very nice but the hotel has not been updated since the 70's. I walked into the restaurant and walked out, it was so dirty looking. My overall experience with Ocean City was bad and I would never go back!!!

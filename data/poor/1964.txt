We booked a deluxe room at this hotel through Expedia back in October 2003. On check-in, which had massive queues and unhelpful check-in staff, were told that we could not have a king bed as per the reservation but was forced to take a room with 2 queen beds and no appology. The room was in no way a deluxe as per the photo on Expedia but a standard Economy room. We telephone reception and were told that our room was a deluxe - they lied !! The room was small, shabby, paint peeling off the doors and walls - downright awful !!I strongly recommed that you choose alternative accomodation to the Boston Park Plaza, and would prefer to stay in a hostel rather than this dump !

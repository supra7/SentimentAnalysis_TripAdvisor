Are You Kidding Me? I dont know how many times I said this on my trip to Phoenix while staying at the run down San Carlos. This property has seen better days. Rooms are extremely small. My bathroom could not have been bigger than 6' x 6'. By the way it required a 18 inch step up to get to. Watch your head. By the way watch out for the hot water that comes and goes as well. Glad they warn of that. They dont warn you of the green oxidized faucets or prison toilet that you will be using. If you like cheap, no frills, and do not require heated water then this is the place for you. By the way there is little opportunity to adjust the temp of your room. Vents blow air and radiators come on 3 times a night. The best part of the experience is checkout. You will appreciate the next hotel you stay in so much more and will have a new appeciation for living in small spaces.

I stayed only in 2 W in the world so far: W Taipei and W NY on Lexington. Having been very pleased with the one in Taipei (see my review for W Taipei), my expectation for NY was high. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing ! The only 2 positive aspects of W Lexington is the good response we get from Whatever/Whenever (usually fast and efficient CS response) and the Concierge and the location. Negative are: - the Spectacular room we got has nothing spectacular => very tiny room (only 1m large around the bed), no particular atmosphere, used carpet, tiny tiny tiny old bathroom (max 2.5m2 - you cannot be 2 persons in the bathroom at the same time - there is simply not enough space) - the noise at the Reception area is always TOO loud => are we in a disco or is it STILL a hotel? - the heating system is somewhat antic => impossible to customized the temperature of the room. - cleanliness of the room can be improved, especially in the bathroom - impossible to sleep without earplugs. The windows are antic so no isolation from street noise. All in all, this is really the last time we are going to this W.

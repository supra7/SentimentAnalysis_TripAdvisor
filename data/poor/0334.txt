I had my wedding reception at the Sorrento. I also paid to have 10 guests stay overnight at the hotel. We received TERRIBLE service. When I called to complain to the coordinator regarding the service she never responded. I again contacted her citing my complaints...no response. I tried four times, I never received a call back. They totally ignored me after they had my money. My specific complaints: They threw away my wedding bouquet, did not have piped in music as they had promised, no alcohol was given for a toast, which we previously arranged (our best man had to go out and buy a bottle so the groom and I had something to toast with.) They had horrible decorations in the room (think jumbo disco balls on a plastic Christmas tree with fake white snow on it). Decorations that I gave to the hotel to use were never returned to me. The front desk clerk was curt and seemed like she had somewhere better to be. My family worried about my choice in having such an important event at the Sorrento because the Sorrento elevator is very tiny and slow, downtown Seattle is too far away to walk from the hotel and the inside of the hotel smells stagnant- like moth balls are dwelling somewhere. I chose to overlook these details in favor of what I thought would be intimate and romantic. I did not expect the undesirable service. I will never return.

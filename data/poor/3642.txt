Not sure what this hotel is with only six rooms per floor. Paid $299 per night and had great expectations given its location. It is one of three hotels crammed into one building. Nothing is good about this hotel but the location. Tub had dents, carpet was worn, furniture broken. There are only two elevators for more than 30+ floors and they seemed broken all the time. The front desk staff were helpful but the remainder of the staff was a joke. Tiny lobby and down hill from there. The "breakfast" is help in a back room the size of a closet and not worth the time to look at. Mostly juice and a machine that makes rubber pancakes. There are better hotels out there. AVOID!!!!

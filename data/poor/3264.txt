Total disappointment. It began with the woman checking us saying over and over You are staying for 5 days?! Wow. Thats a long time! Progressed to the room itself. Nicely appointed but unbelievably limited in drawers and closet space. A couple of tiny drawers for each guest? Half a closet? Oh look theres a huge console in the bedroom! Whoops  just a nice oversized wrapping for the mini bar. The centerpiece of the room is a huge flat screen TV. Which is nice if you are there to watch TV but who goes to Vegas to watch TV? The walls are  as has been reported in other reviews  super thin. We were awakened around 1AM Saturday night by a group of young women in the room next door screaming and laughing. I called the front desk to complain. To illustrate how bad the noise actually was  I held the phone up in the air for the woman at the front desk to hear for herself. Thats next door?! she asked me. Yes mam, it sure is. They did respond with security at the door within a few minutes. But even security ringing the bell and the conversation he had with the guests next door was fully audible from our bed. But what made us check out 3 days early and move to the Bellagio is that when you go to the pool and ask for an umbrella the charge for it is $250! Which by the way was more than the price of our room. There had to be some mistake. Nope. Unless you are a Tower Suite guest with access to the VIP Tower Suite private pool  which provides umbrellas free of charge  expect a room charge of $250 for the umbrella. Desert sun? No shade? And $250 for an umbrella? Wow. We checked out and moved to the Bellagio where we were given an umbrella by the pool free of charge. But it does make me wonder if the Encore has no trouble skimping on basic amenities like umbrellas by the pool for guests who arent high rollers what other basic amenities  that we cant see  are they skimping on as well? Ugh. I dont even want to think about that one!

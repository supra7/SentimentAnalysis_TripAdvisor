I used priceline and paid $52 per night thinking I was getting a 4 star hotel. WRONG way WRONG!! The room was so small there was nowhere to put our luggage. You can't begin to understand how small these rooms are. If I had been bidding on a 2 star it would be different. The sink is so shallow you can' even get your hands in their to wash. However the room was very clean and would be ok for a single traveler and that is it.

I stayed at The Park Plaza for a long weekend to see a baseball game. The rooms are SOO small. Only one person can fit into the bathroom @ one time. And forgot about putting all ouyr personables into the bathroom. There is just a little ledge to put everything. My one major problem with the hotel is that I am missing one important item. There is a tiny closet in the room hidden behind the door. I left 2 items in there, which is my fault. However, I received one shirt back, but I am missing one Red Sox Jersey. I had to call the hotel back 3 times before they were able to give me an answer. The staff was so unhelpful and unwilling to take any steps to remedy the situation. They simply transferred me from person to person. I take responsibility for leaving my items, but like many travelers out there, it happens. It would be nice to know that if items are left, you will get them back. Especially when you call right away to make sure housekeeping can get to them. With so many hotels around, I'd never stay here again!

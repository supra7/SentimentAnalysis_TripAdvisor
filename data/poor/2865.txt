Overall, this hotel was disappointing, especially after the much-hyped "renovation". We were "upgraded" to a higher floor, although the shoebox of the room led us to wonder what the original room would have been. The pipes in the ceiling were also a very classy touch and made the room feel like it had been converted from an electrical closet. The heartbeat restaurant was closed and the whiskey blue bar downstairs added about a $20 tip onto the original bill after we left a generous cash tip. After a $60 hidden parking fee, the parking valets took our car for an 8 mile joy ride somewhere only to return the car with the service engine light on. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!

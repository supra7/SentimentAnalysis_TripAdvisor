My friend and I stayed here for one night and it was one night too long. The only reason we booked this place was it was close to a show we were attending at the Knitting Factory. We knew it was not a luxurious hotel, but for $135+ a night, we expected better. The slider door to the balconey did not lock. The doorknob on the bathroom door was very loose and looked like it was going to fall off. The pipe in the shower where the shower head is attached was rotten and exposed. The refrigerator did not work. The towels were thin, small and rough. There were no irons, hair dryers -- nothing. Also, we were told we were in a "renovated room". I'd hate to see what an old room looked like! The gentlemen who checked us in was, however, very nice. He let our friends (who would be meeting us later) park in the hotel garage while we attended our evening event. We appreciated that very much. This place is creepy -- I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone! If you want a cheap, run down place that is close to Hollywood Blvd., and all it has to offer, -- then this is your place, but don't expect much at all. We found the hotel to be creepy, old, dirty and run down.

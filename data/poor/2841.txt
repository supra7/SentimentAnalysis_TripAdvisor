We were a group of friends and we took 3 different rooms: single, double, triple. The all were the same (very small) size but the price difference was huge. The lobby looks really cool. Modern design, lights etc. You step in and there is a W(ow) effect. It ends when you try to check-in. Rude and cold personal doesn't seem to care. The W(ow) disappears right after you open the room door. The rooms were extremal (D)irty, the furniture worn and old, on the lamps spider nets. The same for bathroom. All rooms looked like grandma's attic. There was missing the card with prices from the minibar. When we opened the water standing by the bed (not knowing that it isn't free like in other hotels), we the got charged. Even the hotel flayers at the room were old and (D)irty. The only positive is the location. Price/value is very bad. You can find much better hotels in similar location for lower price.

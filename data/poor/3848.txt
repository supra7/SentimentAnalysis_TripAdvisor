Basically this place was built in the 1960's and left as is until today. Bathrooms, carpet, wallpaper, paint, windows and linens, it is probably all still original so you can imagine the condition it's in and how it smells. We checked in, could immediately hear the tv's on both sides of the room and couldn't believe the lousy condition of the room. After passing two sketchy looking security guards, we went for dinner and a beer and decided there was no way we could spend the night here, it was just too disgusting. It's not hard to find a better deal for a much nicer place, just do your research. The only plus was that the front desk clerk was very friendly, I feel bad for him that he represents such a dive.

I would not stay here again. All I ask for is a bed to sleep in and hot water to take a shower. Well let's just say, yes I had the bed and thats about it. the shower curtain had blood stains on it, not even a pinch of hot water. The water was cold and it doesn't help when it trickles out of the shower head either. Was getting ready to go out and was blowing drying my hair and the power kept going out. Apparently 2 rooms next store to each other can't blow dry at the same time? And I woke up on the morning of checkout and I had a bug crawling on my pillow. That was it for me. The girls at the front desk were not nice nor considerate when I called the desk for assistance. 200 bucks a nite and I can't even sleep when I got home from the bar because our neighbors had to be out side smoking weed and drinking at 3am. I understand your on vacation but be considerate of others around. I guess you get what you pay for. I just think some improvements need to be done.

They steal from you Our camera, bag, lenses, and film (worth $900.00) were stolen out of our suitcase from our room. The owner never came over to us to apologize and we had to call the police ourselves. We checked out after one night but the hotel charged us for two nights!! They haven't even responded to my credit card company in regards to the extra nights fee. They have not responded to the California Better Business Bureau letters, to which I have put in a formal complaint as well.

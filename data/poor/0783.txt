My husband and I spent half of our honeymoon (July 10-13)at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. I was apprehensive booking the hotel and should of listened to my gut. However, I figured we would not be in our hotel much so I went ahead with the reservation based on the location and the price. What a disappointment! Our room was one step above a Motel 6. The "partial ocean view" was a joke, and we didn't see any "aloha spirit". The location and beach were wonderful and the hotel grounds were not bad. I didn't have any issues with Mixed Plate restaurant and the last day we ate at their other restaurant and received very good service and food. My advice to anyone who is thinking of staying at the KBH is DON'T! Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else. Even if you are not in your room much you will want a nice place to come home to after a long day of sight seeing. Going home to a small, outdated, musty smelling room is not my idea of paradise!

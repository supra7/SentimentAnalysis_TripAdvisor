I made reservations at this Philadelphia, PA Center City hotel for one night on a Saturday. When I arrived, I was expecting the hotel to be clean with professional staff. My first negative impression of the hotel came with my encounter with the desk clerk. He assigned me a room which I was not pleased with and said that only one other room was available, which I didn't believe because of the inactivity in the hotel lobby. Both the original room assigned to me and my request for a different room where unacceptable for the $139.00 room rate. The interior of the rooms were in below hotel standard conditions. The bathroom was similiar to a roominghouse bathroom. The bathroom or the room itself didn't seem sanitary for my conditions. The interior of the lobby of the hotel didn't impress me. The only staff I saw at the hotel during my first visit was the desk clerk.

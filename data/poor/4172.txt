After our first visit a few years ago when everytime I used the hair dryer or curling iron we blew a fuse I swore I wouldn't go back. But we heard the new owner was putting some money into it we thought we would give it a try. Worst idea ever. First room we were in was 86 degrees. After having air on 3 hours only went to 78. They came and looked at it. By the time we got back from dinner 4 more hours it was only 77. So 9:30 they moved us to a smaller room that was 76 degrees. 11:00 called them up AGAIN. Looked at it and said ok is that better. If my husband wasn't feeling sick and asleep I would have left then. So the entire night it never got lower that 75 degrees. If I had paid $40 for a roach motel I might have expected no AC But when I spend $200 I would hope AC works. And if they put any money into the hotel I did not see it in either of the 2 room we were in. And the hallways were even hotter.

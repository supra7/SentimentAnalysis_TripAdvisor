We found the hotel so shabby and sad that we had to leave two nights earlier than planned, desperate for some sleep and heat! The room was very cold and dim. There were no lights on the bedside tables, one towel per person, no heating whatsoever (it was snowing outside!). We didn't sleep for the whole night because we could hear very distinctly every word from the neighbours' conversations! Don't waste your money or health on this hotel. Oh, by the way, the location is terrible too, way up north...so you'll end up spending a fair bit on taxi rides!

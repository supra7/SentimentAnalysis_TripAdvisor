Sadly, all of these bad reviews are correct. We ended up at the Clift because there were a lot of events going on in San Francisco the weekend we went, and every where else was booked. We hated it. The furniture in the rooms is really cheesy and cheap. Our friends' room was supposed to be an upgraded room, and when they saw our room, they realized that not only was their room smaller, but the bed was even smaller (a queen instead of a king). After a lot of complaining at the front desk they finally got a different room, and it was fine, but I wouldn't have called it upgraded. Our friends also got gift certificates for the restaurant there, and when we went to use them we were told that there was no way they could get us in, they were completely booked. After a little more complaining at the front desk, they did let us in, but it turns out we would have been better off had they just turned us away. Everything is extremely expensive, so I thought it would also be extremely good, and it WAS NOT. It was so bad, I had a couple bites of each thing and left hungry. It wasn't just marginal, I could not eat it. My friends and I sat wondering if we just ordered the wrong things, or if everything on the menu was that bad. Breakfast there is good though, not fantastic, but good. The service is not great, the whole place is kind of snooty and cold. For the price of the Clift, I would expect much, much more. When I read the bad reviews before we left I was still optimistic, thinking it couldn't possibly be that bad. I was extremely disappointed to discover that the bad reviews were right on.

Date:10/30/08 My hubsand and I are timeshare holders at the Avenue Plaza. We have been owner since 07/1999. I called two days ago regarding an exchange . The Manager said that we could not book an exchnage due to all rooms were booked up for the year at the Avenue Plaza. I told the manager that we had floating weeks for the year . He said it was nothing he could do , that we had lost our week for the year and many other holders because they did not book early in the year. I told him that I have never had a problem getting exchange and was never notified that we had to bank a week early into the year . I ask him what he could do in order for me and my hubsand to get an exchange to another resort. He said we could call RCI and purchase their plan . I ask him how much was the plan he said he did not know. My hubsand and I go through Intreval International for our vacation. and was never notified that we could use other timeshare holder for exchanges. I am reaching out to all timeshare holder that are being jerked around by the Avenue Plaza. I would like for the Vice President and other VP's of the resort know how their customers are being treated.

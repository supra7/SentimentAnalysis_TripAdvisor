This is the first time I've ever given a 1-star review so let me explain - the room didn't have a/c so we had to have the windows open, then the Loud family from texas decided to have a party in their room next door and we heard every word and laugh through the open windows, and then we discovered that the smoking tent was right below our balcony so we got all the smoke. I called the front desk and they didn't respond. And then in the middle of the night I was woken up by a group having a party on the beach. I didn't sleep much that night. The next day, after a little discussion the front desk eventually let me switch rooms (but said only because I booked directly with them?). We then got a very nice remodeled room with a/c that was farther on the point and was quiet and beautiful. (and they charged me an "upgrade" price) It's too much of a risk to stay here after traveling all the way to Hawaii - you might get an awesome room or you might get one that sinks your vacation. Napili beach is fantastic and fun and this is probably the nicest place on Napili Bay. Next year, we're staying somewhere else and will just visit the beach for the day.

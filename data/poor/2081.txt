I arrived late on New Years Weekend and was given a tiny "studio suite" - the rationale being that I had asked for a king bed on my profile. The idea that a "studio suite," i.e. a regular room exists at an "all suites" hotel is baffling. In fact, the idea of a "studio suite" itself is entirely counterintuitive. And the thought that the front desk would give that terrible room to a loyalty member who had a wedding and brought 50 people to an omni property less than 6 month ago is absurd. I trudged back to the front desk after seeing this terrible room and asked for an actual suite - and was given a beat up, dirty, crappy room. Maybe that is how all the rooms are but it was not for me. We had booked using credit card points and since it wasn't costing us out of pocket, we almost just left. I wish we would have. The hote was the height of mediocirty. The staff was rude - I asked for new pillows and got a lecture on how there should be some in a musty bag in my closet. There were, they were feather and I had already checked. I was so disapointed that I had to take a walk late that first night. The only bright spot were the guys at the front door - we asked for directions and they were friendly and we needed cabs and they hailed them. Nothing special or personal but not incompetent like the rest of the hotel. Little victories. Maybe if i was in chicago on business and i had meetings from early morning until late at night, staying here wouldn't be the most depressing thing in the world. but coming for pleasure, stay anywhere but here. I wish we would have check out - it was the most "unspecial" lackluster stay at a hotel I have ever had. No personality, no charm, no personal service. Just blah. An aging, sagging, boring hotel.

EVERYTHING costs extra here. I chose this 4-star hotel in the loop because of the location, amenities listed on the booking site, and the comfort provided by a 4-star hotel. However, every amenity comes with an extra cost. The "Fitness Center" is actually their Spa, and use of the Fitness Center is an additional fee. The Pool is only accessible via the Spa, and you guessed it, is an additional fee. The Internet access? $20 a day for "high speed" access. The staff are excellent and kind, but the Hotel seems more concerned with emptying your pocket of every nickle and dime they can find than ensuring a comfortable stay.

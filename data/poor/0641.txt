This was my 2nd trip to a Secrets resort (first trip was last fall to Silversands) and will never go back. DO NOT attend the "Unlimited Vacation" pitch no matter what they offer. It's a total scam and they will tell you it takes 90 minutes......it doesn't, we kept telling them no and they just kept bringing more people over to us and putting us down. It was very hostile and the sales agents and their managers were extremely rude (direct quotes "you people are stupid and riduculous not to take this offer"....."oh come on, you make enough money to afford this", etc). They snagged us in with a $200 spa gift certificate which of course cannot be used with other offers. Also, this resort was very crowded. The pool space was very small (lots of shallow pools to put your feet in which are warm by noon). The beach is very pretty but not alot of umbrellas.........be prepared to roll out of bed very early in the morning to secure your spot by the pool or beach and then get back from breakfast asap!!! Not exactly relaxing. We loved Silversands and didn't sit through their "pitch"....the beach isn't very nice but tons of pool space and you can get away from the crowds if you want. We started to see how all of their offers, excursions, etc are "bait -n- switch".......this place is clean, stafff is nice (the sales people are part of a totally different company) just be aware of what your walking into.

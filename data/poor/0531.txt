I booked a room for this hotel through the Choice hotels website, for stay over the christmas holiday so I could be close to my family. I have stayed at many Choice hotels, but NEVER like this one. On Christmas eve Morning, I heard my car alarm go off and ran to the room window to see the hotel van trying to move forward in snow & ice conditions away from my vehicle. They had backed into my car and caused damage. I requested insurance info and they (the van driver & front desk clerk, foreign accent, female) refused to give it to me until I got a Tukwila police officer instructing them to do so. They were RUDE, and VERY disrespectful to the customer and when I asked for the manager they said he was on vacation. They said I could "fax" him. I got two different names for the manager (Parnit & Phil). And to top all of this, they even denied hitting my car--what kind of hotel is this? Choice Hotels should shut this hotel for the sake of it's business name--DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL, or will be very sorry you did, I know I am.

Stayed at Harrah's on 5/31-6/2/07. Room was wonderful, a little above average than most. AWESOME location--direclty across the street from Ceasar's Palace and the Forum Shops. What KILLED this place for me was that at 1:00 a.m. EVERY NIGHT, an outdoor nightclub started booming and carrying on. I was on the 11th floor, and you could hear the lyrics and the bass noise was felt in our pillows. It kept us up for hours both nights, despite our complaining, the front desk told us that "it was a nightly occurance" and in the Mardi Gras tower, we're we were staying, it was normal AND THAT THEY TRY TO BOOK YOUNGER FOLKS in that tower, and they don't seem to mind". We're in our late 30s, and would NEVER EVER stay here again due to the noise. BEWARE!

Our 8th trip to Las vegas and we stayed at Harrahs for a second time.The hotel is really showing its age,very dated interior and many unacceptable situations that occured make me have to write this for others.We had no power in the room for 7 hours the first night and the front desk said we had been notified-we were not,my wife uses a breathing apperatus to help her at night and it was a unpleasant situation.The next morning I went to the lobby early only to have the fire warning lights and sirens going off with a announcer saying they were unsure of what was going on,I didnt know if I should take the elevator to the 25th floor where my wife was or use the steps when they announced we THINK we have it as a false alarm. The 3rd night we tried to get the steak and egg special for $6.95 after 12:00 midnight we were seated and sat for 15 minutes when I asked on of the busboys if there was a waiter available,of course he didnt speak english,as he walked away I understood his spanish as [--] the rich whities as he spoke to his coworkers.We spoke to the head waiter as we left and she said you are just too impatient,there was only 8 other people in the place,it was now 26 minutes with no service.The manager the next day said he doubted MY story. The slot machines are dated,most several years old along with well worn carpet and chairs that were loose and tore. There are so many NICE places to stay on the strip for the same money ,we will NEVER stay at Harrahs again as I sent them a letter explaining all these situations and they did not respond even after a second registered letter was sent and they received it Las vegas is hurting for business everywhere and this is unacceptable management by Harrahs.I shouldnt but will mention the fact I was hit on by a prostitute in the casino and twice right at the doorway towards casino royale. NEVER AGAIN HARRAHS!!!!!!

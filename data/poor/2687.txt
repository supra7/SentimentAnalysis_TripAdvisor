We travelled all the way down from Ontario, Canada to stay for a week at the Frenchmen for our honeymoon in early May. We had booked online, thinking that the room depicted on the website was typical of all the rooms they offered. Instead, we found ourselves in a tiny room that was barely big enough to hold our three luggage bags. It had a double bed, not a queen. There was a crack at the top of the door and the only window in the room was a small one in the tiny bathroom. The room had a strange odor and the carpet seemed damp. The balcony we had to walk on to get to our room was old and was not sturdy. We did not stay there that night and we were not refunded for that night. They offered to switch rooms for us but couldn't accommodate us the entire week. The staff was friendly but beware if you're looking for a nice hotel.

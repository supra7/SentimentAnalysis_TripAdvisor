I've stayed a Harrah's a few times and while it's not the cleanest or newest hotel, the location was good and the price not bad. My most recent trip changed all that. I left the room for lunch leaving a my necklace in a drinking glass sitting near the bed, thinking I would put it on after lunch. When I returned 2 hours later the maid had come by and the glass and my necklace were gone. I was heartbroken as the necklace held two very sentimental charms. I went to talk to security who had me fill out a report and told me to call the next day after they had a change to check with housekeeping. When I called the next day the person in security told me "I don't eve know why you're bothering to call" and basically hung up. I also called the Risk Management office after 72 hours as listed on the report but no one every answered and even after leaving voice mails I never received a return call. We ended up putting up the "do not disturb" sign on the door and not allowing maid service in for the rest of the trip for fear of what else would be stolen. Finally I got a letter in the mail that basically said they weren't at fault and thanks for visiting. While I agree I should not have left my necklace out, even for 2 hours, I think the service I received after the fact, or lack of service was unacceptable. The price and location aren't great enough that will will put up with theft and poor service. I go to Vegas every year and I know where I won't be staying again.

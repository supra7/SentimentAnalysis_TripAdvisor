One should be able to get budget accommodation further from town centre that is more bearable. How bad are the hotels rated worse than this place?! It is cheap and convenient but i cringe if i had to use the toilet. I didnt even have a shower as i rather stayed dirty! maybe a room with a bathroom would have been better as you wouldn't have to deal with other people's wee and puke.

The resort itself is attractive enough: very large rooms, beautiful grounds, and a neat, family-friend concept. HOWEVER ... we had many issues with the resort, their services and their personnel. The rooms had bugs, bad lighting, and in at least 2 roms, a disgusting mildewy smell. The tubs were stained, surprisingly for a "new" resort. The resort mgmt (group director and tour coordinator) were clearly motivated only by financials: they steered us toward inappropriate tours, gave vague information, withheld key details, and were inflexible when changes were required. They dealt with problems with evasive rigidity, with NO focus on customer service. Many of promised services were not available as advertised: watersports were only available on one of our 5 days - despite the weather being perfectly fine. One of the major pools was essentially closed, including it's bar. Only one restaurant served breakfast at all. The activities were lame - aerobics, dance lessons, and "shows" had a markedly high-school hour feel. The beach is rocky and largely impassable. The food was acceptable - breakfast and lunch were basic, although the dinners were more upscale and tasty. I love Playa del Carmen and will definitely be back - but never again to the Azul 5s.

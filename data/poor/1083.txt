In November of 2003 My Father and I stayed at Penn Tower due to it attachment to the Medical Center. The location is the only thing this hotel has going for it. The rooms and hallways are rundown and dirty. There is not a restaurant in this hotel, therefore no room service and I didn't see any vending machines. We had to walk across the street to Mcdonalds late at night to get something to drink. Ridiculous. This hotel would be lucky to get $39.95 a night if it was not attached to the hospital. A total rip off for families already stressed due to health issues. Very Sad.

This is a dump. Do not stay here. Drive to Adolphus and get a better room. It's old, outdated, smells bad, dirty, and has tiny little beds they call a queen but is clearly a double circa 1920. This hotel needs to be demolished theres no hope for renovation. The pictures are totally misleading. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!

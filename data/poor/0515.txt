I came here for business, so internet access is important for me. However, it turned out to be a nightmare: their 802.11b network keep on dropping, (5 times within a hour) and I have to call the WiFi company ( they use the service from wayport) by myself. During my two day's stay here I spent at least 3 hours over phone to talk with them, and the feed backs are: sir, there might be somebody using microwave .....sir, why not move your laptop around the room, sir, you are in seattle so I cannot do anything from here, sir, I have been talking with you for 45 minutes, ...(not my fault!), and I have to change my room to get a better signal. I am sure nothing is wrong with the WiFi on my laptop (I am a WiFi expert) and actually one of them admitted they have trouble with their network and give me one day free service, but the next day they denied that they have any problem with the network when the problem came back again. This service is not acceptable. I think this hotel is making a big mistake by choosing a bad partner. I tavelled a lot but had never experienced anything like this. Service is OK. Front desk is nice. The restaurant is good, but need more choice for dinner.

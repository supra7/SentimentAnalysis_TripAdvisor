We stayed one night in this hotel and that was enough to make us never come back. The staff is arrogant and obnoxious. The rooms are small. When we stayed there, there was no hot water in the whole hotel for the whole day, which is unacceptable for a 4* hotel. The lift was also broken, about which the staff could not have cared less.

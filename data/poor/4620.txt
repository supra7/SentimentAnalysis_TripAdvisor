I had a reservation at another hotel and they "transferred" our reservation to this hotel without notifying us at all. We were sad and angry to have to check into this beast. Tiny, stinky, paint peeling off the walls, stains on the carpet, broken tiles, burned out lightbulbs, need I say more? If all you're looking for is a place to crash after a night on Bourbon, this may be fine. If you have any sort of standards whatsoever, it will not meet them.

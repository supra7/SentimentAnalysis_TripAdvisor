Pay more and you'll thank me later This place was the epitome of an old run down hotel. The beds were rock hard, the tv was too dark to see and there was no remote to change the brightness. The room overall was decent but the curtains, furniture and comforters were stained. The hotel was understaffed and seemed confused. The food was not good and was prepared an hour after it was supposed to be available. The wifi was the only real positive. I'd recommend paying about 30 bucks more and you will get a much nicer place. I wouldn't' stay here again under an circumstance.

This place was horrible, if you have time to change your reservation do it NOW!!! The place is dirty and nasty, where do i start. We walk in and the room stinks badly and we start looking around there are big black stains on the carpet, a big rip in the couch, the fridge sounds like a 747 ready to take off, the silverware was sitting in a tray on top of the microwave. After 1st shower had to call maintenance to have tub snaked to remove 6 inches of standing water. Everytime someone walked by your room it sounded like the window was going to fall out. But the best of all was the couple that was having sex in the courtyard between the 2 buildings in broad day light!!! Real family friendly. You have to park your car in an alley with no security. This place looks like they took a low income housing developement and tried very unsuccessfully to turn it into a resort...what a joke!! The stucco was coming of the walls on the outside of the building, there were holes in the building. The Vegas monorail runs right over the top of some of the buildings and our firends said it sounded like it was coming right through their room. Really if you have any other options to not stay here take them!!!

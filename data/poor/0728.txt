Bring your wallet to this hotel where they charge you $15.00 a day to a park your own car, $10.00 a day to have a microwave in your room, and $75.00 a day if you want to upgrade from your basic reservation so you can access breakfast and snacks in a PRIVATE club. I got charged for touching the snacks, and opening the minibar, evn though I did not use any of thier closely monitered treats. At registrion, they warned me that the snacks are on a weigh sensitive display so even moving them triggers an automatic charge. I didnot beleive them. This is a sad reflection of the greed that permeates the hospitality industry in Mauai which seemed more llike the "hostility" industry. I have complained to COSTCO Travel who booked my nightmare for me, and will contnue to tell everyone I know.

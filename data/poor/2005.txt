The one positive: It's in a great area. The negatives are endless: 1. Who has ever stayed at a hotel where the taxi entrance (the main hotel entrance) is two floors lower than the hotel lobby? Anyone? Which means you take your luggage into an an elevator, go up two flights, then have to take a second elevator to your room. It's ridiculous and minor league. 2. Wear headphones - stuff your ears with cotton balls - then put on background music because you will hear EVERYTHING - every word uttered - by people in adjoining rooms. The people next to us had their alarm clocks go off one morning and I could have sworn I set ours by mistake. 3. You get NOTHING extra: Coffee is charged to your bill if you just want to get a cup in the morning. 3. Cost of breakfast: Highway robbery - $22 for the buffet? You can't be serious! I have never heard of such a price. Go up the street and eat anywhere but here. I will say the beds are comfortable - but what good is that when you hear the people in the adjoining rooms. 4. Now for the health room/pool: A "luxury" hotel with no whirlpool? If you want to walk a half mile to the sauna or pool, you traipse through a long hallway of guest rooms, go down steps, and eventually find the pool in the middle of nowhere. Again, ridiculous. This is a greatly overpriced hotel - go anywhere but here.

I guess that I should have checked Trip Advisor before booking our stay. Our family had 2 nights in Las Vegas before travelling to the Grand Canyon. Since we were travelling with 2 children (6 & 8), I chose Trump because it claimed to be a 5 star property that was located off the strip. The fact that it did not have a casino was one of the determining factor. I presumed, incorrectly, that the hotel would offer comfort and safety. NOT. My 6 year old found drugs (bags of cocaine) in our room! Presumaby this room was serviced before our arrival? NOT. Obviously, I was horrified. When I advised the hotel manager what had happened, his response was simply, "Thanks for reporting the issue. We will need you to complete a security report."..No concern, no apology! When we returned, I responded to an email survey with detailed information on the incident---NO FOLLOW UP. I wrote a letter to Trump Headquaters regarding--NO FOLLOW UP... Be warned, safety, service and customer satisfaction is of no concern to Trump properties.

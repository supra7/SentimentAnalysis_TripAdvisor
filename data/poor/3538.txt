I decided to go with the more recent/favorable reviews of the hotel, especially since I knew it was being rennovated. I booked the hotel over Labor Day weekend and the room, although small with few ammenities appeared like it would serve it's purpose for two people in NYC for a short stay: a place to sleep. We awoke the next morning and as my boyfriend was showering, I saw something crawling over the sheet...a bed bug (I've seen Dateline, I know what they look like). I was horrified, squished it, and noticed it made a mark much like several other marks I then noticed on the bedsheets. I went immediately downstairs to complain and the front desk girl didn't seem surprised at all (similar to another review below). We were offered a new room. We took the new room, not wanting to make a big deal and ruin the rest of our vacation. I am now home a week later and COVERED in bed bug bites. It's incredibly common for bed bugs to stowaway in suitcases and come home with you to infest your own home. So, until the entire hotel is bombed for bed bugs, no one is safe, and it's obvious the hotel has no interest in fixing the problem. In addition, I've called the hotel twice regarding my issues and they have yet to return my call.

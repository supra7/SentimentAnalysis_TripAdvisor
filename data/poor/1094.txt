This is the most shocking hotel I've ever stayed in. I telephoned from the airport to book a shuttle bus and the receptionist was fairly rude and unhelpful. The rooms were not great, fairly grubby, but sort of comfortable. Breakfast was very limited, and you had to ask for everything: milk, plates, cream cheese, hot water. I was quite glad to leave, to be honest! The only good thing about my experience of the Fairfield was the driver of the shuttle bus, who was a really nice, friendly guy! There are plenty of other hotels close to the airport, I suggest trying one of those instead.

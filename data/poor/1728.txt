Great holiday... hotel was ok only down side was the terrible pull out sofa bed it was thin and smelt terrible another bed would have been better. And would completely improve this hotel. I Got family going out to this hotel June 2012 let's hope this problem will be sorted by then as there will be another unhappy customer

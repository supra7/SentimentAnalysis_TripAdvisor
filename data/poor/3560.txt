I stayed here for work, and given that I didn't pay for my stay and still feel the need to complain, must show how disappointed I was with the service I received. At first I thought everything was going to be okay - my room looked clean, and it was a decent size. Then I went into the shower and found a hair on the shower head. My colleague who was staying in a different room found a dirty towel in her bathroom, hanging on the door. In the bed, I found a couple of hairs as well - and a couple in the pillow under the case which was open on one end. Then came time to sleep - at 330 AM my sleep was disturbed by someone staying in the hotel who started banging on a neighbour's door. It took security forever to do anything. Never mind the fact that they started cleaning up the rooms around 630 am and with paper thin walls, the banging did nothing but keep me up. I ordered room service for breakfast the following morning, and was told it would be ready soon. Having waited at least 40 minutes I called back asking how long it would still be. I was told it would be there soon and was then hung up on. She called back a minute later to tell me it'd be there in about 5 minutes - guess she realized her job was on the line. For what it's worth, I did use the gym, which was pretty decent. But overall, I would not recommend staying here. If for some reason you do stay here and take a cab, don't tell the cab driver the hotel is near the airport (despite the hotel's name), as they'll drive you right to the airport and blame you for misdirection.

We probably hold the record for checking out of the Maui Lu in less then 12 hours after checking in. We booked it on the internet and booked oceanfront which we did get, but this was our first trip to Maui and expected so much more. The room was so old and dingy. When we checked in they gave us a notice explaining that they had recently had a problem with break ins and to make sure everything was locked. We ended up at the Maui Marriott which was much more our speed. (Who cares what it costs, you only live once!)

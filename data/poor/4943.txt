Our friends have this property as a time share and we stayed with them for a week. The first night they tried putting us in a REALLY old, smelly small room and it was unbearable so we requested to be moved. The next room 5-- (can't remember the exact room number) was OK. Nothing spectacular, especially given the price. The room location and size was excellent - directly behind the Imperial Palace, but that was about it - the following is a list of everyhting that was unacceptable to us (and we are not overly picky, just want a nice, clean room): - Bathroom had a weed GROWING out of the sink - Litterally! (I should have taken a picture of it!) Sink did not drain properly. - The shower did not have a head (i.e. a jet of water only coming from the pipe in the wall) - Bathroom was quite dirty and tub was so dirty we only showered (i.e. no baths) - We were suppost to have maid service twice in the week. We never got any maid service except we we called to request the towels to be replaced. - TV remote did not work - Windows had no screen - the only locks were the little metal clips you screw on and off. Not exactly high security. - Air conditoning worked...too well, unit would not shut off! We could chnage it to fan, or heat, or A/C but if you want to turn it off you couldn't! - Pool outside the room (attrium style) was small but nice except not heated. - Kitchen was poorly stocked (i.e. few plates, utencils, glasses, non-telflon cook pans....NO dishwasher. Fridge/Kitchen table was good. - Livingroom hide-a-bed was ok, comfy enought for a hide-a-bed. - Summer Bay does not offer any kind of breakfasts in the morning. Would not stay here again. If you do stay here - ask for the newest rooms available and/or ask to be as close to the Imperial Palace as possible - otherwise the back of the property can be quite a walk to the Vegas Strip. Don't expect much and you may enjoy your stay. I'd rather stay at a different property or a Hotel.

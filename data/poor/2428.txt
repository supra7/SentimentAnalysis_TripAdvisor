From the minute we pulled onto the property, it was terrible. It took forever and a day for valet to greet us. We had to ask for our lei. Our room was ten miles from check-in. Room was not clean. Beach is ten miles from hotel. Weather is terrible on this part of the island -- rainy and windy. No poolside service to speak of -- especially when compared to Four Seasons. The breakfast buffet had flies crawling all over the food. I thought I was on Candid Camera. But no, this was actually happening! We checked out and headed for the Four Seasons the next night. Absolutely no comparing these two properties. The Four Seasons is far superior to the Ritz Kapalua. But then many Fairfield Inns I've been in are superior to the Ritz Kapalua. I just wish I could give it less than one star.

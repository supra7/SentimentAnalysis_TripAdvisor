Dont waste your money on this place. I cant believe they call this place a hotel! It was dirty and depressing. The indoor pool (if thats what you want to call it), was more on the size of shoebox and had a dirty greenish look. The outside pool was dirty looking with sand and something that looked like fecal matter. The halls were painted depressing colors and had a musty odor. The rooms were so outdated. The beds were horribly unconfortable. This hotel is such low class, they are to cheap to put toiletries in the bathroom so they put soap dispensers by the sink and shower. The staff was about as cold as an iceburg. We felt very uncomfortable and couldnt wait to leave. Bates Motel from the Alfred Hitchcock movie had more charm then this place.

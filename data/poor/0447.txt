Do yourself a favor...dont stay here! My wife and I were going to a business meeting and after arriving we walked into the hotel only to be met wth a very strong stench of bleach. The hotel lobby is a mess and after checking in and going to our room on a very run down elevator, which there was no inspection tag in, we had a hard time opening our room door. After we opened it we could not get it shut and I mean we slammed it to try and still wouldnt shut. I had to go get the manager and show him and he gave some song and dance. The phone didnt work and management was aware of this. The bathroom looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks. We were told that if we spilled anything on the already stained carpets that our credit card would be charged another $250. The room stunk of bleach so bad that we decided to go up the street to the Quality Inn which we booked a new room. We went back and talked to a nice lady at the desk who was treated like dirt by management. She stated that she could not refund us any part of room charge. I have spoke with the man that runs the hotel. He refuses to refund any money. I will be disputing the charges with my bank and calling every day to get refunded. DONT STAY HERE!!!!

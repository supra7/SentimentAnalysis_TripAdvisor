Judging from the pictures and the number of stars and even the name, I had envisioned a retreat from my busy life. However, I was gravely disappointed. For the first three nights' stay, I did not have a functioning toilet. I made numerous calls to have the flushing fixed and saw that some were ignored. Pretty much, it took three days for the flushing to be fixed. They did not offer to put me in another room where it did flush. I have never stayed in a cheap motel that did not have a functioning toilet. So, you can see that my hopes were dashed. Further, the hotel did not replenish my toiletries and left only the basic shampoo and conditioner. This hotel should not boist about amenities. I used up the one postcard that was left in my room even though I was there 6 nights. I did not complain about this last problem because I had spent too much time trying to get a functioning toilet.

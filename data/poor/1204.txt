Our troubles started with trying to find the location of Pantheon Inn. We made at least 3 phone calls to the hotel to find out exact location and their suggestion where to park the car. Not much help was provided, but nothing sounded alarming at that point. One hour later we finally found a parking spot and found that hotel ( no signs downstairs, no indication whatsoever - hotel is apparently just a floor in a regularly looking building) . 4 flights up (no elevator) ... needless to say that we were exhausted and were dreaming to get to bed... "Not that fast!"... Pantheon was apparently overbooked and couldnt accommodate us despite actually charging our credit card for prepayment (over $300). We were told that we have to go to some cheap hotel near to train station (who knows Rome can tell the difference in location). No excuses, no applogies, instead we got very rude receptionist and angry manager (or owner) who refused to issue the refund to us or provide the letter that the hotel is in fact overbooked and can't accomodate us at their location. Nasty scene in the lobby! Just terrible experience - one of the worse in my busy traveling life - I never ever had anything even close to this .... No explanation was given why they didn't tell us over the phone that they have no room ...P.S. thank God we didn't bring our luggage upstairs ( remeber, it is high 4 stories up - no elevator).

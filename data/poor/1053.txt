Do NOT stay here!!!! I was looking for a place in center city that I could walk to most of the sites from at a good price. The location in relation to what I wanted to do is the ONLY positive thing I can say about this hotel (I cringe to refer to it as such.) It was so run down and used looking I was reluctant to even shower there. The bed creaked when you sat on it, the pillows were flat, the walls were so thin you could hear EVERYTHING in the hall all night, the toilet ran randomly in the night and was difficult to flush, the carpet looked dirty and had a spot of what looked like gum on it, there was a dip in the floor suggesting a covered hole, the chairs had holes in the fabric, the room was dim, the continental breakfast looked like day old donuts/bagels, rickety elevator you had to open yourself, the front desk people couldn't answer questions about tours, and the list goes on!!!!

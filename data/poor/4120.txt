Rooms were dirty and very outdated. Only positives were location and price. HOWEVER, we were charged with a completely random charge on my credit card claiming we took a "first aid kit" from the mini bar. Both my husband and I never even saw a mini bar in our room, and definitely were not drinking during this trip (ie: was not possible for us to do this negligently). I am pissed.

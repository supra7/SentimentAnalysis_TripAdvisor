First the pros--large suites; Cons--everything else. This hotel is absolutely miserable. Terrible location surrounded on three sides by hospitals, so one hears sirens all night. When there are no sirens, the highway is on the fourth side and nothing has been done to dampen the noise. There are exterior doors to the suites, single pain sliding glass doors to the balconies, and small air wall unit air conditioners that don't drown out the traffic. Don't be fooled by the pictures on their website--this clearly used to be a 1970s apartment building converted badly to a hotel. The cabinets were painted over and cracked granite countertops installed. Not a door in the place closed correctly--cabinet nor bathroom. The dishes in the cabinets were dirty with food still on them, there were not adequate pans, and the range was tiny. The pool was a joke--about the size of a four person hot tub and only three feet deep. The front desk person was curt and unfriendly. The parking is under the building, and the spaces were miniscule. Breakfast was pretty sparse also. Avoid this hotel when in San Diego; there has to be somewhere better.

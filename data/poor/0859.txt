The hotel reservation manager had a whole list of reasons why their "best rate commitment" did not apply, so we spent much more each night than other guests. Made us feel sick. Our attempts to address this concern were futile. Not good to book in advance. Go last minute with Hotwire. We will not return. Why? So many other better, more reasonable hotels to choose from. If you want a real 5 star--try Wynn.

We arrived at the Maui Prince in the early evening on a Friday night. My first impression of the lobby was very good, it was open with a garden with trees in the center with birds sounds filling the lobby area. Quite nice. However, after checking in I found that the rooms were below average for a resort in Wailea. On a previous trip, we stayed at the Kea Lani and it is by far more luxurious. The furniture desperately needed updates, the cleanliness was horrible. I pulled back the coverlet of one of the doubles and viola, a dead bed bug! I then pulled the coverlet of the second be and there were tiny black specks and another but smaller, perhaps a baby bed bug. We immediately notified the front desk and asked to be reassigned to another room. The staff was not at all friendly about our finding and told us that they did not have another double room. When I asked if there had been previous complaints, the front desk person told us no and had the nerves to say that we probably let the bugs in when we opened the door. Uh, we just arrived, less than 10 minutes and the bugs were UNDER the coverlet. And advised us that they just recently had their pest control updated. Then come to find out, their rates only cover for 2 adults per room. There was three of us and advise us of a $60 per night room for the additional person. They finally agreed they would place some airline employees in a king room and give us the double room. I feel as if they are going to charge $350+ a night, they should have been more accommodating, especially since it is their fault. There was an excessive amount of cob webs and bugs stuck near the base of the headboard and between the bed and the nightstand that I was hardly able to get any sleep. In addition, the beds were too soft and gave me back and neck pain. Their beach was nice and their service staff were friendly but I will never, ever go back to the Maui Prince and if clean hotels I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

This hotel was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayd at. Our negative experiences started immediatly at the check in. The people from check in where very rude, they did not make us feel welcome, they did not speak any english en finally i was asked to sign something, i usually dont sign anything before i know WHAT i am signing, the man at check in started to raise his voice with irritation because i did not sign within 2 seconds, when i asked him what is was, that i was signing, he just yelled at me that i had to sign.. that was all the english he knew.. SIGN!!!! Ok bad start.. we wanted to take the elivator, once we steped into one, the buttons where stuck and we had to switch to a different elivator.. I like my elivators to work without having my worried about getting stuck in between floors. When we got to our room, it smelled horrible, like the room was full of dust and no window had been open for weeks. The next day when we got back from shopping, we found out that our room was not cleaned. We mentioned to us that for next time, we should leave our room earlier so that roomservice can clean our room. I was stunned we go away for a getaway and want to sleep in, maybe stay in bed untill 11 and then go shopping. Roomservice apparently only cleans your room unless you are out of your room at 9am! The only positive thing about the hotel is the convenient location accros from a subway station. Other than that..nothing really. Will not stay here again. They advertise this as a 3 or 4 star hotel. I would not give it even 2 stars.

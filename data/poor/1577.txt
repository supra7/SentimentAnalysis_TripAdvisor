We were very dissatisfied with our stay. Prior to making the reservation online, we called to confirm if the King Suite with Jacuzzi had a separate stand alone whirlpool in the room or just a bathtub with jets. We were told it was a separate stand alone whirlpool in the room. We re-asked twice to make sure. This was our sole deciding factor on staying at this establishment over less expensive, closer, and higher quality hotels in the area. When we arrived, we found a dirty, bug-infested, dark room with just a bathtub with jets. Many of the light fixtures in the room did not function. The coffee pot outlet did not function and had to be moved to the bathroom to work. The room was noisy and had bugs. Our two keys often did not work in the door, and we had to go down to the front desk to have house-keeping let us in. The staff acted as if the was our fault and did nothing to try to remedy our situation. The check-in and out was fast, but the staff was not friendly in the least and did not crack a smile even once. Upon checkout, we were not asked how we enjoyed our stay and the attendent seemed bothered with our presence. We could have saved $50 - $100, even with choosing another room in the same hotel, but we were given false information. On top of that, the service and room was terrible.

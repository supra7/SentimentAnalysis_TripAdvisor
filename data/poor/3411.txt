Old, tired and dirty. The card for our room did not work, the room hadn't been cleaned when we arrived and over the next three days the maid come at 4pm to tidy up. No room safe and it was easy to climb our balcony to get in as the door didn't lock. The best of all was the bedbugs. Nothing like going home with itchy bites all over your face and arms. Stay away.

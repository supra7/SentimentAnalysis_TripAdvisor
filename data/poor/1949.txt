The pluses - 1. This is a historic hotel, 2. The location of this hotel is about as central as you could want in Boston. That having been said, the hotel is shabby (carpet stains, very scuffed furniture, dirty upholstory, etc.).The service is atrocious (ie. calls to the front desk to fix air cond. resulted in once being put on hold for 20-yes 20 mins before being disconnected-I was actually curious to see how long it would take them to field the call- also, we never got to speak to alive person on the phone, the air was never looked at and after a couple of moves we did find a room where the air cooled. They were quick about moving us. We've been to Boston many times and usually stay on Newbury St.at a little B&B about two blocks away from this place. Wanted to try something different - boy, was it ever but not for the better! This hotel reminded us of the certain kind of place that big tour companies book for large groups -those of you who've toured like this will know exactly what I'm saying -that's the best description I can give it.

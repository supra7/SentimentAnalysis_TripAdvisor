If your thinking of using this hotel or expedia please read before you book it! Traveled in a party of 7, should have been 8 to this hotel. On arrival discovered that room was in the name of someone who lost their passport and could not travel from the UK with us. Hotels response was instead of the 4 rooms we had paid for and were expecting we were told we could not have one of the rooms as the room was in the name of the person who dropped out! This was after an hour and a half in a queue trying to check in! Ended up sleeping on the floor of another persons room! Next day insisted on speaking to the manager who eventually gave us another room after an hour of calling expedia who were as useful as an ashtray on a motor bike. Their response for requests to sort it out was to tell us there was nothing they could do. Will be taking legal action on this one. The hotel is tired and expensive with not much to do. Service was slow and i didn't get a free drink until the third day! Location is bad as it is half way between the nice hotels, Luxor etc. and downtown, which was one and a half miles away. Don't walk it though as the area is very dodgy with plenty of massage parlors and tags sprayed on walls. Note while we were there Vagas had five separate school shooting incidents according to local news reports. Not a place for families. Don't wander the streets at night and don't walk down any side streets. Stay on the main street if you want to be safe. Treat yourself and stay in New York if you can. Watch out for the hookers who pounce on you if you are wandering round the hotel when you can't sleep There pimps usually sit in the elevator lobby's. Recommend you definitely give this hotel a miss and only use expedia if you don't want any customer service if you have any issues!

My wife,son and myself were supposed to stay here from saturday until monday this memorial day weekend. We stayed on the 7th floor--We could only stay one night--The room had a urine smell,stains on the carpeting and the couch--The toilet is so close between the wall and tub I actually had to put one leg in the tub to use the toilet.' The A.C doesnt work,the lobby was very humid and the elevators to slow for the amount of people--Im sure during its time it was a fabulous hotel but not now--Im sorry

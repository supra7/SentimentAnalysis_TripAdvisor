If I wanted to stay in a youth hostel, I would have. The primary purpose for my stay at Marrakech Hotel was cost and proximity to the local universities. Since I had only planned to sleep at the hotel I opted for an inexpensive stay. However, my mistake was that finding a cheaper hotel meant compromising hotel cleanliness. This is not a family place: Loud thumping music abounds from the time you open the door to the quick ascent of the stairs up to the main desk. The dim lighting hides the worn out, faded carpet. Apparently this hotel defines new renovated as a quick paint job and new shower curtains. Its only saving grace are the flat screen bedroom TVs. My second night I pulled back my sheets and found a huge, engorged bed bug on my pillow. I squeezed it, it popped, and showered my pillow with blood. I immediately took it down to the front desk to report it. Wondering whose blood that was and how many others would feast on me that night keep me up resulting in a miserable day of meetings that followed. The next night, again around midnight, produced yet again another huge bed bug. This time it was flat. It was hungry. I took it down to the front desk. The young man assured me this was unacceptable. Really??! Then someone who appeared to be the maintance guy yelled at me, "Hey, weren't you here last night? Why didn't you change rooms?!" Hmm, that wasn't offered and quite frankly I was exhausted and didn't feel like moving. But this second night I accepted another room on the other tower. I was promised a bigger room. Instead, it comprised of only a tiny alcove to house the suitcase stand. Don't compromise cost for convenience. We don't need to relive our college days. I paid over $1000 for the week when I could have spent a mere $400 more and stayed at a chain hotel that I know would not tolerate sub-par conditions. Its not all the same once you close your eyes,... you never know what comes out to feast on you at night.

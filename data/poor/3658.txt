Hotel has become a Motel 6 with FOUR SEASON PRICES The Hotel has not one redeeming Quality except for the location!Under new ownership returning guests don't want to return! We will return when they sell the hotel to someone else.The people who bought it knew how to ruin a hotel in less than a year. Every restaurant, every service was a disaster. Bad!

Stay far away.... My fiance and I stayed at the Fitzpatrick Manhattan Hotel for a long weekend. Front desk was friendly, never went out of their way to make you feel special, but friendly enough. Room was a little small, but good enough for what we needed as we planned on shopping our entire trip anyway. Had a terrible experience our last night at the bar. We were the only Americans there and were treated as if we didn't belong. Rude bartender with an Irish accent, was extremely short and couldn't wait to be finished with us to go back to chatting with her irish 'friends'. Didn't even bother finishing our drinks (which were expensive). If you aren't Irish, stay out of this bar, you will not feel welcomed!!!!

Probably the worst Hotel I've every stayed at. Luckily we were just using it as a stop-over on the way back from Paris on the Eurostar and catching a train from Euston the next day. The hotel is very convenient to Euston Station but that's the only good point. Our room was a family room in the basement and was quite small. The bathroom was grotty, had a loose toilet seat and no bolt on the door. The double bed was OK but the pull out bed for our two children was dirty and we had to make that up ourselves. Breakfast was a shambles. It was advertised as an 'all you can eat' continental buffet. There were no bowls for cereal, no cups for coffee, no juice glasses and no knives. If you needed any of these you had to ask and the staff would go and find a cup or two for you. They appeared to be very disorganised. There were baskets and bowls set out for croissonts, pastries and fresh fruits but they were all empty! So I took cereal instead - and had to ask for milk to go with it! In the absence of anything else to eat people were choosing bread or toast but that ran out as well. Luckily we had to go as we had a train to catch. Naturally I wouldn't recommend anyone should stay here.

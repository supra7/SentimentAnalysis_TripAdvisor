My little sister was married in the Old Red Museum across the street from the hotel Lawrence. So for convenience reasons we all stayed here. When we returned back from the wedding at 1 am we found the elevator broken. My sister had to walk up 10 flights of stairs in her wedding dress!!! Without so much as an apology from the hotel staff. After arguing with them my parents were allowed to put the gifts in a small closet downstairs, rather than carry them up to their room on the 7th floor! Even before the elevator broke it was going VERY slow. I personally waited more than 5 minutes with my children and all of our bags for the elevator to arrive. Then we complained to the manager the next day she was hateful. She did refund half of our room, but only have much complaint. She slammed the money on the desk and continue to type heavily on her keyboard. I would NEVER stay here again. The pictures online are very deceiving. I visited 3 rooms and not 1 was as nice as the pictures posted.

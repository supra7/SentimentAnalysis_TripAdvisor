I should have taken in all the little things people said about this hotel, as they all were true. The Cabana suite was nothing more than a room with a double bed and a pullout couch. I was under the impression that there were seperate sleeping quarters from the bathroom. You had to walk thru the area with the double beds to get to the bathroom. Absolutely no privacy for three adults. The price was $505 per night, we stayed 2 nights and the total was almost $1,200.00 with the additional fees. I shouldn't have assumed that the highest price would offer us the best. The room was outside the hotel, below all the rooms in the hotel and no access into the hotel except to walk a 1/4 of a mile into the main lobby. Had we had rain, we would have been soaked going anywhere out of the room. Upon arrival, seeing the room and smelling the room, I immediately asked to get a regular room. This was a non smoking room and smelled like a dirty ashtray. I was told they were full for the night and asked to be changed for the next night and pay for a regular room. I was told absolutely no refunds would be given to my c/c. The customer service was completely unacceptable. The room also had a continuous noise the entire stay. Similar to a boiler room and impossible to sleep. To get ice you had to deal with the walk to the main entrance and go to the 3rd floor. The vending machines on the 1st and 2nd were broken also. The in room coffee maker didn't work, the room offers no safe and we also expected a small fridge but they didn't provide that either! After 2 nights of this, we couldn't wait to check out! Don't go, it's not worth the money!!! I told the front desk I would be posting this if they didn't work with me on the 2nd night and they couldn't have cared less, so there it is.

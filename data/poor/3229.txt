What a joke! It is 12:30 a.m. midweek - windy and cold in Las Vegas and the outside nightclub is thumping "techo-music" non-stop (ever pull up next to a thumping car...it is as loud!)...called and asked for the hotel manager. "Kristin" said she could do "nothing, other than reach out to the nightclub...." She said it would continue until 4:00 a.m. -- she can...but has totally failed the customer... Steve Wynn -- you have a fancy infomercial when the TV in the room is turned on...your room looks nice...but it would be quieter to be sleeping under the freeway in L.A....and I am on the 20th floor of your "outstanding hotel"! What a joke!!! You talk on the TV about your "relationship" with the Dalai Lama - try having one with your paying customers...very frustrating.

My family and I stayed at the Summer Bay "Resort" April 8 - 14 and it was by far the worst hotel we had ever stayed in. I will admit, the lobby looks pretty nice and welcoming, but the rooms are terrible. If you've ever stayed at the main hotels on the strip, (Flamingo, Mandalay Bay, etc.) don't stay here, it's a major disappointment. We stayed at the flamingo last time and were expecting something similar this year, what a let down. Bottom line: If you are used to nice 5 star hotels, don't stay here. Cons: -Windows rattled everytime the wind blew -Loud A/C -Some "suites" are located apart from the other rooms across from run-down apartments -Rooms smell bad -"Swimming pool" is just standing water in a cement hole -You can hear everything that goes on outside just as if you were really outside Pros: -No Roaches (What a surprise) -Staff were friendly -They're demolishing that place.....

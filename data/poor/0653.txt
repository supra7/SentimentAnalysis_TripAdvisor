On a Monday evening, the hotel overbooked itself, told my my wife they didn't have a room for her (she had a confirmed reservation), and sent her to the Hilton Garden Inn by BWI, a location about 15 miles away and no commuting treat for rush hour. The manager never returned a phone call. Corporate Hilton said they were sending a certificate to apologize but over two weeks have gone by and we have not received anything. Feel free to make a reservation here, but don't be surprised if they don't honor it. Expect poor customer service.

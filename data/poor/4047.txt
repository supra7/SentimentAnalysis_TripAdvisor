Save yourself the agony! Hotel Blake in Chicago looks like an upscale modern hotel with all the up-to-date stylings and amenities any traveler could want. If your planning a trip to Chicago don't step one foot near this disheveled mess. As soon as we walked off the elevator we had a problem; the smell of an unidentified object lingered throughout the hallway for three days. Our room was missing a light bulb (that we still have yet to receive) our poor toilet paper dispenser looked as if it was ripped out of the wall and the sound of a jack hammer was coming through our vent. To make matters worse no one answers the phone! I have complained to several people (when they finally did answer) and a manager has yet to rectify the situation or let alone call me back. Oh and that great restaurant that pops up on the first page also doesn't exist. I guess that's just there for show. Spend the extra money and go to the "W" - It'll be money well spent. If you see this place RUN FAST!

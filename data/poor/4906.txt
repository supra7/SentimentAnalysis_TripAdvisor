We choose this hotel because of the indoor water park since we were traveling with 4 children ages 6-12. We reserved two atrium rooms for our party of 8. Upon arrival, we found the atrium rooms to be filthy!! In both rooms, we found some foreign objects in the bed sheets. There were dead bugs in the window sills and on the floor and overall the room was not clean. We reported this to the front desk, and they moved us to the tower rooms. They did NOT offer to move us to the tower room for the same price as the atrium room and were not willing to give a discount. The atrium rooms are $99 and the tower rooms are $149. Since it was already 4pm and we were only staying for one night, we decided to go ahead and move rather than find another hotel. The tower rooms were cleaner and we did not find any foreign objects or bugs but we were anxious to get out the next morning. We will never stay here again. This hotel was a waste of money.

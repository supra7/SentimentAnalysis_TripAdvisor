We stayed at the Aston Maui Lu for the first two days of our Maui vacation. We had one of the beach front rooms in the 400 building. I was not expecting much from the hotel, but it was truly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Think beat-up version of a Motel 6. Not that motel 6 is horrible, just low end - the Maui Lu was low-end and in major need of renovation. We had two rooms, both had clogged toilets, dilapidated furniture, and just an over-all run down feel. The pool was also strange in that the sides were not straight up and down, they had a weird slope which made it almost impossible to climb out of the pool without finding the steps - frankly unsafe for young children. When we arrived we immediately found we did not have enough towels in either room. When we called the front desk guessed why we were calling...duhhh fix the problem then! The location was fine - the beach and the hotel property has great potential, it is just that the facility itself is just completely run down. Anyway I would not ever recommend this hotel - ok maybe for $50, but surely not for $100 or more.

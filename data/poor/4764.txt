the hotel looked nice overall with the grounds and swimming pools were great with the 24 hrs swimming, but it was so over priced, it was criminal!! the food was boring and over priced, the staff on check in were very unhelpful, but problems were solved by manager who was very helpful! rooms were average and disappointing, expected a lot better, seeing as they charge the earth for it! the one major problems were being eaten alive by mosquitoes!! so be aware to have some repellent handy! Overall, i was very disappointed with the Biltmore, i wouldn't stay there again, make sure you have planty of spare cash as you're gonna need it!

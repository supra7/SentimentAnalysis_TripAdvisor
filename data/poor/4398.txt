Our reservation was for an attractive rate, however, after driving 8 hours we were confronted at the check in desk with a form I was required to initial approving an additional charge of $7.50. Not a lot of money but I consider their tactic very unethical and sneaky. We were tired and this was, of course our only reservation. I initialed the form because we were tired and wanted to go to a room and relax. The room was small and of the cheap motel variety. Not to relaxing. On the plus side, they had a good buffet. I well not stay at the Stratosphere again.

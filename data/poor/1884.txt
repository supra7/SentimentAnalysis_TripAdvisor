This had to be one of the worst stays in a hotel in my life. The air conditioning was not working. We were first told that it was being worked on. The next day the front desk advised that some rooms A/C is not good. Also said they had 24 hr room service...this was another fabrication. Not offered a different room or anything. Would NEVER stay again!

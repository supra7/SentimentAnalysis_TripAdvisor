Disappointing stay at the Marseilles Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Marseilles. Our stay started with rude, inconsiderate staff with the exception of Julian at the front desk. The parking situation was atrocious. We were not able to pull up to the hotel to unload our car because the restaurant manager had the front blocked by a pick-up truck. The manager refused to move the truck and stated that this situation was standard operating procedure. Shouldn't the staff accomodate the paying customers and not the other way around?? We were never informed that parking was 1/2 block away and cost $18 per day. Furthermore, we were promised a spot which was a total joke. Our room faced a concrete wall and was next to the elevator which was very noisy. I don't think the beds have been replaced since 1948...it was very uncomfortable with little support. The bathroom was unclean and tiny. The uncaring attitude of the staff trickles down from the owner to the management to the staff. We left a message for the owner on his voicemail and requested a call back which was never returned. The pictures on the hotel's website are very misleading. If you're going to South Beach...do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!

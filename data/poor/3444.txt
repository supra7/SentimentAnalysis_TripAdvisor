Unbelievable for a hotel of this supposed category Truly unbelievable to be awaken by construction at 7 am.As a previous reviewer posted it is outright dishonest not to advise guests.I spent $459 a night for a tiny room, this special wake-up call and increasinlgy indifferent service.I usually stayed either at the Omni or at The Regency.Guess who is having my business from now on

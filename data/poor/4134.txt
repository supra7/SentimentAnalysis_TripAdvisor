We picked the Whitehall because friends had raved how elegant it was. Unfortunately, that was some years ago and our experience suggests that the Whitehall is descending into shabbiness. Exiting the elevator on our floor, the wallpaper was beginning to peel from the walls and the carpet was deeply stained--downright grungy. Rooms tend to be small in this part of town, but there was no excuse for the dirty bedskirt. It was obvious that some prior guests had stained it with their shoes, there being little leg room if you sit in the chair to try to watch TV. The TV, by the way, was an old Zenith on its last legs, the picture alternating from red to purple. In the bathroom, the ceiling above the shower had numerous dark brown water stains. Rings upon rings of water stains. Disgusting! Forget about taking a bath. The stopper mechanism had been removed and there was no plug or stopper or any kind. Though the Whitehall touted its 24 hour room service on check-in, when we called at 8:30 pm, there was no answer. Though the bed ws comfortable, we left feeling that this hotel was definitely past its prime. We won't be back. There's plenty of competition within a few block radius.

My car was broken into and I had some things stolen. I know I shouldn't leave things in my car, and yes there were signs posted but sometimes people forget after a long day. When speaking with the police I learned that this was NOT the first time this had happend. The officer dusting for fingerprints said to me, "yeah, this definitly isn't the first time I've seen this parking lot." The signs posted tell you not to leave valuables in your car but all this does is waive any liability and tell criminals that there aren't any security cameras. After multiple break ins, I would expect the hotel to take care of their customers, but the staff was pretty apathetic about the situation.

you might as well stay in a playhouse We stayed at the Juliana during the summer of 2001. We were offered the summer steal deal. It was a steal-from us. We got a suite, But both rooms were sooo tiny. They use mirrors in their pamphlet to make it look twice as big. Everything is miniature in those rooms-the bed, the nightstands, the chairs, Plus there's hardly anyplace to put your stuff and the bathroom is also small. We went there with our family of four. Once the others were all seated, there was no place for me to go. So I stood by the doorway. The next morning I went for a walk and found another roomier hotel. I highly recommend it-the Shannon Court.

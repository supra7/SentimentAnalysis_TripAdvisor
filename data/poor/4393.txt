The customer service is terrible. They are rude and dismissive. I had people taken of my room, specifically telling them to change the key b/c they were not to be allowed in. I came back and hotel security had still allowed them in the room. Their defense was "There was not note in the computer specifically stating they were not to be let in." If I took their name off, and changed the key, do I really need to say more for you to do your job and not allow 2 random people into my hotel?

The rooms you see in the pictures are not what you will get at all. If you're a budget backpacker, this place is for you. If you are looking for a quaint but quality to room for $100, go to the Holiday Inn on 57th. Arrived and was put in the wrong room which was dirty and had construction worker tools all over the floor, when I told front desk they informed me that the website was wrong (um, not my problem). Moved me to the correct room which did not have the glass shower you see in the pictures (it doesn't exist in that building). Then I found out the outlets didn't work in the room either. Fed up I wanted to leave but was worried about being charged for the 1st night due to the cancellation policy. Spoke to front desk and told them that what is advertised online is not the service provided to guests upon arrival and front desk person AGREED WITH ME. I asked if I would be charged if I left and he said NO. Only to find out 2 days later that they did charge me. Disputed the charges with management and they have only refunded half of my money. This place is garbage.

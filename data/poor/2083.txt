The wife and our 11 month old daughter stayed here for some after Christmas/ New Years Eve. jubilation/shopping. From the get go this was botched. Everything i was told i was getting with my "package" was changed 3 times finally being told "you have no package with your room purchase". This was "rectified" by giving me what I was supposed to receive with the "original package" i was told i was getting. We stayed on the 19th floor and my room smelled as smoky as a bar. I called the front desk 3 times to inquire and i was told that it was coming from the 6th floor which was their smoking floor and since it was New Years Eve( although it was the same for 2 nights prior) they really couldn't do anything about it..Be warned. The food in 676 was very good and the staff were all very nice. It was far from what the reviews on the forum would have led me to expect.

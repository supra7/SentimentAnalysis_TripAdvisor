This hotel is the worst have ever stayed in!!! room 7smelly and poor ligthing rubbish on the floor, sheets & Pillow cases with blood stains on them. SHEETS not clean and the bugs in the bed i could not get out of the place fast enough. still itch now just thinking about it. i slept on top of the bed with towels on top fully clothed. Would not recommend this to any one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

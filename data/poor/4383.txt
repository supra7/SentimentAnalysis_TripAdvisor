I stayed at the Stratosphere Casino and Hotel nov 6 & 7th 2009 and found the place very nice except the parking situation . Parked in the wrong area which had no gates blocking it and my vehicle was booted and 3 large security guards forced me to withdraw $100 cash to have it removed , I felt extorted and reported it ti the Gaming Commission and in the future I will be staying downtown where the appreciate longtime customers .

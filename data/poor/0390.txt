My boyfriend and I stayed over Easter weekend and chose the hotel because of its location and parking. We paid about $70 USD for the room. It's central to everything, walkable to the market and neighbourhoods with good restaurants and the space needle. Aside from the location (and parking) it was not a pleasant stay. The hallways smelled of smoke, the room was clean but in need of renovation. At reception there was a sign stating that they don't rent rooms for the purpose of underage drinking (or somethign to that effect). The blackout curtains were completely ripped (I mentioned this and asked that they be replaced but they never were) and the pillows were covered in plastic. We were woken up repeatedly by late night partiers and a barking dog. When I went down to get the continental breakfast (muffins, fruit, coffee) I was joined by some pretty dodgy people who did not look like they were staying there. And then on my way back up there was an empty beer bottle in the elevator. We travel on a budget but I would have been happy to pay more for a quieter, safer feeling hotel. The Best Western across the street looked like it might have been better. If you're looking for a relaxing, low key place to stay in the city, this isn't it.

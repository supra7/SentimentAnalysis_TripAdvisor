It was a terrible experience. Things about my experience that I see in the reviews below: - THIS MOTEL HAS SERIOUS CRIMINAL POPULATION - THIS MOTEL WAKES YOU UP ON THE MORNING OF YOUR CHECKOUT STARTING AT VERY EARLY HOURS, MULTIPLE TIMES They kept sending the security up to my room to throw me out - right after i checked in (they assigned me to someone else's room) and then also when i was trying to check out )... it came to my attention that a serious criminal element has infested this hotel and so they are nervous that anyone could be involved. Perhaps some kind of drug ring or something? Although I'm not really sure but it was the strangest experience I've ever had a budget motel. Also, their wireless was broken. I will say that when the security came to my door on the final morning, they laughed when they saw me, saying that i did not look as dangerous as the front desk had described (WTF?). I was there for a wedding and I am a professional person, traveling alone. I was told that had i been spotted before hand, i would have been advised not to check in because its so dangerous there. Thank god the security was so nice, he even carried my bag to my car and admitted that they are not motel 6 employees. I cant imagine what would happen if you got a nut for a security guard who went psycho on you... seems like you'd have no recourse. This motel is not good location for families, middle aged couples or women traveling alone. I would also like to say that i was well aware of the redesign and had stayed here prior, which is why i booked a room here. the place has changed and people should take this seriously.

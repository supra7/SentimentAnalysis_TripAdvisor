I stayed at the Encore on a business trip this past week. Granted, business trips are not fun, but the atmosphere at the Encore was very cold. My rate was changed at check-in. Check-in took a very long time. I was told several times there were no non-smoking rooms available, then one magically opened up. This hotel charges (a LOT) for everything. If you pick anything up from the in-room refrigerator or off the snack bar, you have 60 seconds to replace it or else you will be charged. A large sign in the lobby warns you not to bring outside food or drinks to your room, and that bags/purses/briefcases are subject to search. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. The casino features $10 minimum tables. Anyone who rates this hotel highly should consider what was paid for the luxury atmosphere. Certainly you should expect nothing less, and probably a good deal more in terms of friendliness. the Marriott at least gives you a free bottle of water when checking in.

The reason why we chose this hotel was because it was supposed to have been remodeled within the last 6 months. This hotel fell well below our expectations. We booked through the hilton 800 number and was told the best rate we had to pay in full so we did that for two rooms. We were not told that it was a net direct rate and it was non refundable or non exchangeagble and we came during hurricane season. The staff upon arrival - a young lady was assisting us with our check in. Had no rooms available that fit our request that was booked and paid in full so she got frustrated and walked away. A gentleman by the name of Tori was exceptional in picking up the pieces to assist us with our check in at 1am (after our flight arrived). He was able to put us in two king rooms, but they were not remodeled, had poor internet service, were not remodeled, and smelled Horrible. The smell was so overpowering that as soon as you opened the door you could smell it in the hallway. We were told that these were the only king rooms that were left. So we made the best of the room and went down the street to walgreens and got some candles febreeze and lysol to disinfect the room and make it liveable for our stay. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. The resources such as the Internet could be better. Connectivity could be improved. The bar hours of operation could be better - if you are on vacation 4pm until 10pm are very limited and forces you to have to go elsewhere to patronize other restaurants and services. The selections are limited as well - with luxury prices, one expects luxury and at the very least premium selections. That can be improved.

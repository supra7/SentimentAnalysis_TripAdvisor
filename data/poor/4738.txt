Very dated, dirty carpet and drapes. Unfriendly staff. It must have been a beautiful hotel at one time. It is run down and extremely dated. I'm shocked that they can't even touch up the paint or replace the carpet. Don't waste your money staying here. We arrived at 10 PM with 2 starving children and were told the restaurant just closed and there is nothing we can feed you? I was told there is no free breakfast for Hilton Gold members because this is a resort not a Homewood Suites. Not a classy place, like I expected the Waldorf Astoria to be.

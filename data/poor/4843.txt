Not only is Harbor Steps right across the street from Seattle Art Museum (not a good museum at all), it's also nearby numerous strip clubs. Safety in the neighborhood is disappointing. Can't walk down the street without being verballly assaulted. There are perks, such as snack and internet, but so are other hotels. With this price range, there are better choices; such as W, right next to the Central Library. I'd prefer staying in a safer neighborhood.

During our stay we had to call the front desk several times about clean linens not being provided and bathroom not being as clean as it should. On our fifth day of a week long stay we noticed my husband's watch was missing, after calling the incident in 2 men came to the room and interrogated us on the value and description of the costly designer watch and they claimed the risk management team was unavailable and completed a form for them to contact upon our return home all the way back to Cleveland and if we wanted we could call them. We called on Monday when we were home and was informed they were still investigating. On Thursday we finally got a call from a Liz in lost prevention that informed us according to the law there is nothing they can do because they ask staff and no one took it! That the H***! No sorry, no offer of reimbursement and actually no remorse for the theft. I will never syat there again and will tell all and everyone I know about this inceident. This hotel cares nothing for it's patrons! Simply said "THIS HOTEL SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!

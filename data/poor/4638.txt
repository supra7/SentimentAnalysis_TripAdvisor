You read that correctly. I reported several problems with the bathroom: 1) Feces on the wall 2) Water is SCALDING hot 3) Toilet doesn't work After several calls, NONE of these were addressed or rectified. I had to personally use one of their towles and clean off the feces from the bathroom wall. Terrible service. Stayed two nights. They refunded one night. I am still NOT happy. NOLA was great. I love this city. This hotel was very poor.

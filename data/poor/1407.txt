Was very unimpressed. The website said "just minutes" from downtown but it's a lie - you have to take the bus, the train or a taxi ride to get anywhere remotely like "downtown". There is nothing around the hotel - not even a little breakfast place or cafe for some coffee. It's a very deserted and non-tourist friendly area. The staff were underwhelming, every time I went to the desk I waited about 5-10mins for service. There is a nightclub downstairs (again - not advertised on the website) and the walls are thin so if you're planning to get any sleep after about 11pm, good luck! Also, the place was pretty dirty and the 'breakfast' cafe on the ground floor was just awful - I would say middle-school cafeteria quality but that would be a compliment :(

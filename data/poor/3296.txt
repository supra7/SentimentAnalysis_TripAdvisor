My reviews tend to be on the optimistic side, so it means quite a lot that I'm giving this property only 1 star. I'll concede that the staff was decently friendly during check-in. But I booked my room before I'd heard of Tripadvisor, so nothing prepared me for the less-than-ideal experience staying there. Despite my requesting a non-smoking room, the previous guest apparently had smoked heavily, with the hotel making no attempt to flag it as perhaps inappropriate for a non-smoker like myself. There was no way to prevent the smell from getting all over my clothes, etc. After some polite complaints, I was given a 10% discount, but the front desk employee said he couldn't change my room without his manager's authorization (and the manager's shift had already ended.) The smoking issue aside, the rest of the property was also not in the best shape. There were faded logos for the Motel 8 chain, and my travel partner surmised that the hotel must have been kicked out of the franchise for failing their quality standards! Thankfully we had only planned to stay in Seattle for one night, as we were on our way to Vancouver, so we didn't have to look for another hotel. And I'm also thankful that I've now discovered Tripadvisor, which has allowed me to avoid properties like this while travelling in other cities.

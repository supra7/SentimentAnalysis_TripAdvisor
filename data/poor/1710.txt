I've been coming to this hotel fairly regularly for the last couple of years, but I'm afraid I've stayed my last night at this Marriott hotel. The overall experience has deteriorated to the point that I can't stay here any longer. The staff have become increasingly unfriendly, rude, and even abusive on occasions. This coupled with the decline in the rooms which are now dirty and ill prepared have forced me to seek out alternatives (next time its the Hilton).

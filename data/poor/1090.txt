My husband and I generally stay at Marriotts when we travel. We were visiting family after Thanksgiving and stayed at the Fairfield Inn as the other Marriotts near the Philly Airport were sold out. The entrance o the hotel seems a little like going into a prison but the front desk staff were nice enough.We rode the elevator up to our room on the third floor. The elevator was not well maintained. When we exited our floor and walked into our room I was very displeased. The navy carpeting was incredibly worn and totally filthy. We had two queen beds and the bedding did not fit properly. The room was incredibly bare bones and it gave me a lot of anxiety tosleep on the beds, however it was late and night and we were tired. This hotel is not up to Marriott standards. Well over a year later I'm still angry we stayed here. What a dump! There aren't a lot of good choices at the Philly airport but this is one of the worst. On a positive note the clerks etc. were all very pleasant but that does not make up for the awful hotel. Beware!

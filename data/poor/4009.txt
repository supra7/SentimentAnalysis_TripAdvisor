This hotel overcharged my bill and I pointed it out during check out and i was promised that it would be refunded right away but after weeks and over 10 phone calls to front desk/reservation/accounts/manager still not getting my money back. Beware of this hotel!! They use every opportunity to cheat and overcharge you. Watch your bill very carefully on check out and make sure you do not leave the hotel till everything is finalized then and there.

My grandma had stayed at the hotel previously ad had a good exsperince so had i one time before. But this time, the owner over charged us, later come to find the prices where marked right on the front desk, when we were checking out i said something about it and he said he could charge $170 if he wanted. Worst contential breakfast for the price we were charged un exceptable, and no refunds so we couldn't leave. very crappy rooms.

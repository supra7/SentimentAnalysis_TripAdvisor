Two friends and I (three young women) stayed at this hotel during June of this Summer. During our stay we were sexually harassed by the security guard on duty by the pool. Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room. The next day after I arrived back in Atlanta, I contacted the hotel and left a message for the manger stating that it was about sexual harassment at the hotel...I never received a call back. So then I contacted Corporate offices, and I was informed that the manager already stated that he sent a apology to me (LIES). The manger (Mr. Pellon) of the hotel did not give an apology, he just said he did to cover his own tracks. I had to chase down an apology. I JUSTreceived an apology on October 3, 2011. I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami. If this harassment has happen to you at this hotel also, please contact me because my attorney will be more than happy to take your case also.

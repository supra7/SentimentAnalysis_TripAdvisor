Yes the price of this hotel is very cheap but when it comes down to it you expect a good nights sleep out of any hotel. It could not be had in our room the mattress was very out of date and the springs could be felt throughout. The pillows had no life left...we asked for better ones and were told they are all like that...hmmm. We had a dog with us and were therefore forced to stay in a smoking room. The room smelled horrible even when we purchased our own air freshner to spray in the room. Pictures on the website are deceiving and shot from the best angles possible to make this dump look much better then it is. Also do not recommend this as a family spot with the class of people staying here.

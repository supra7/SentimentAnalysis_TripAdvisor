We noticed that the makeup bottle broken. Probably the housekeeping broke it. We came to the front desk that said that the hotel manager not here and we can speak with him only by e-mail. The first mail ignored, the second was with stupid excuse that the hosekeeping in vacation so i need to wait until she will come back to work (Dont you hear about TELEPHONE??!!) After two weeks that no one respond I sent the third mail that also roughly ignored. Stay away from this hotel. your personals belongings not protected. Horrible management! NEVER NEVER come back to this hotel again. Very far from Amsterdam center and located in scary neighborhood with homeless people

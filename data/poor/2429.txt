Besides the physical problems facing this hotel (it's located 10 minutes from the beach) the rooms are dirty (I had them move me three times - and each time the hotel put me in a room where the bed spread looked like it had been used to film a porno movie), the service is indifferent at best (they seem to think if they say "Aloha" or "Maholo" enough that will cover for bad service. The towels were ratty... when my wife requested an extra washcloth (to save money the hotel only puts one washcloth in a room) they asked her why she needed it! Add this to the food being overpriced and mediocre, the valet lost my car for half an hour, the fact they charge you $15 extra a day for a "resort fee" (doesn't the swimming pool come as part of the hotel?) the in room internet only works if you have a computer running Windows 98 or below(not above !!!), the business center closes at 6 PM (yet you can shop and buy overpriced garbage until midnight at the hotel's stores), this is a hotel worth avoiding at all cost. They should fire the staff, price things honestly (get rid of the resort fee), clean the rooms and maybe they will be as good as the Best Western.

We planned to stay for two nights, but left after one. The hotel was dated and dirty. Linens were old and dingy. The double beds were so old and worn that we rolled to the middle of the bed. They were VERY uncomfortable. The room was extremely small, with just room to walk around the beds. Road noise was high. The elevators are very old, and the sensors don't work properly. If you aren't careful, the door will hurt you. Watch out! The location is somewhat central, but it's ugly. All of the equipment in the "fitness center" was broken in one way or another. On the bright side, most of the staff was nice, but the manager made up for it. She refused to take care of a parking ticket their hired service issued despite the fact that we were guests and parked legally in a space in their garage. She said she could take care of it, but that she wouldn't. (Huh??) It made no sense then and still doesn't. We went to another hotel, which was clean, bright, friendly and cheaper! There are MUCH better options!!!

Man, the hotel is bad. I rather stay at local motels. Very dirty and it's not a great building at all. The only good thing is the beach across the street where it's not crowded. But, you can go to that beach even you stay at other hotels. Not recommend it at all. It's probably ok just for 1 night stay. Don't stay at this hotel!!

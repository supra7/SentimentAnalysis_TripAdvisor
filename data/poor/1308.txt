I'm living in this avenue hotel chicago right now at dec 12th 2008. this hotel has extremely bad service. I called them to bring two spoons to for my icecream so i called the house keeping to bring me two siliver spoons. A women answered the phone and said how many would you like? I said two, the women replied surprisingly "only two, are you serious (ridiculous tone)?" i said yes please. waited for 20 mintues and i called again for the spoons. the same women answered the phone and said "wait for another 15minutes ok?". Didnt eat my icecream at the end. i said thank you to the person who delivered the spoons to me and he grunted. Other thing is the minibar are autosensored. I took a diet coke out of the minibar. After realizing its $25 i put the diet coke back in.they still charged me the $25 without even drinking it. the little note that said $25/per drink is so tiny that you would normally skip to see. Overall the room looks nice, but the lobby is bad. the photos are overrated. Strongly not recommending anyone to come here. i rather go to marriot or peninsula (just right next door).

This hotel is gross. It smells like old people when you first walk in.There is no security,so cars get broken into all of the time.The carpet in the rooms are not clean,the drapes are outdated and old,the furniture looks like it was purchased from a consignment shop,there is no air conditioner on the elevators,the elevators break down daily,the rooms are NOT cleaned daily,it is sooo gross in that place.Their version of a work out room is a treadmill set up in one of the rooms.their version of a laundry room is 2 washers and dryers set up in a spare hotel room!

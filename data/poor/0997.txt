We stayed there last night and we're disgusted. we paid 75 for a triple room which was a case of cramming a double and single bed into a tiny room. Upon arrival we were starred at by a foreign sounding man at reception who clearly did nt want to be there. he shoved a piece of paper at me to fill in to check in. He then said we were in the other building so taken outside and pointed in the direction of a wooden door next to some sort of kebab house. we were warned to be careful as they accept no responsibility for any loss which set alarm bells ringing. we got inside where it was just 3 floors of corridors and went down to the basement where our room was. once inside, we found the smoke detector was stuffed with toilet roll, the last guests rubbish was left on the dressing table, the beds didnt match and the window didnt lock. the plug was clogged in the shower so kept having to turn it off to avoid completely flooding the bathroom. the tv had 1 channel which played across numbers 1-4 and 5 didnt work. outside the window was masses of rubbish, disgusting. amazingly when we came back from our night out we still had all our belongings which we really did not expect. the room was freezing though and the only bed covers were a sheet and a felt blanket so no good nights sleep. i would not recommend staying here...

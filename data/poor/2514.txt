Shocking disturbance kept us awake all night. The hotel was ok - has nice communal areas, large pool, free parking; and is in a nice location backing on to the beach and close to the restaurants. The room was small and the bathroom was very small and a bit tired. Our main issue was that a large group of younsters were staying on the same floor - they may have taken over the whole hotel for all I know. They were in and out of there rooms all night long - and we had a long drive the next day down to Key West so we needed a good night's rest. They were even playing American football in the corridor at 3 am. Our fault perhaps as we should have complained to the management and perhaps they could have taken action. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind young people enjoying themselves but our our 5 year old daughter was kept awake most of the night. I don't know why hotels - which accept families - put up with such unruly behaviour. I loved Miami Beach but would never stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone because of this.

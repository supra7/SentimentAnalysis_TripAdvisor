1) Stayed in one of the inner rooms. Not ventilated, and obviously very mildewy and moldy. Got a very bad case of ringworm as a result (it's like a yeast infection of the skin -- itchy, painful and takes longer to go away). Thanks Hotel 91. 2) The property is my the Manhattan Bridge... you can't get away from the noise; don't even try. 3) Don't look under the bed; they never clean there. Be afraid, be very afraid.

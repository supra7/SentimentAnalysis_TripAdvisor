This is the worst hotel in downtown Chicago. The rooms are ok (nothing great), they were remodeled and is now modern instead of classic. However, the service (staff) was ABSOLUTELY the worst. When I mean the worst, is something worst than Super 8. I called to the front desk because my remote control was missing and the espresso machine was broken. I got transferred to the kitchen. The lady had a really bad attitude and was even screaming at me. The coffee and remote control arrived over an hour later to my room and I even had to call twice to get them. Fairmont? No thanks, never again. I rather stay at Hilton, Starwood hotels, or Marriott.

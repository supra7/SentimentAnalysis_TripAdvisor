This is the most overrated hotel I've ever had the displeasure of staying in. We booked a suite the night of our wedding (thank god it wasn't a honeymoon situation yet, and thank god we didn't get there until late in the evening). Here's the breakdown of the major suckage; 1 - one of the phones in the room didn't work 2 - the carpet was coming up in several places 3 - the wallpaper was peeling noticably, and there was a hole in the wall in the bathroom, about the size of a fist. Nice.. 4 - the toilet was old and goofy. Not sure why, but it was goofy. 5 - the tv internet didn't work. Wireless keyboard and mouse worked. but not the service, so it kinda defeated the purpose.. 6 - we called house keeping to ask for a toothbrush kit. They said they would send it right up. It never came. 7 - national cheerleader convention.. munchkins everywhere. noisy munchkins all over a hotel that sells itself on elegance and sophistication and history. Total nonsense. My advice.. Skip this joke of a hotel unless you get a 2-star price, and bring your 2-star expectations.

We booked the Alexis for 1 night for our anniversary. What a horrible experience. We now live near Seattle but I had stayed there a couple of times when I used to travel to Seattle on business in the early '90's. I remembered it as wonderful! I don't know what happend but...... We had let them know it was our anniversay and had asked for a bottle of champagne in the room when we arrived. Nothing. It took them 1 1/2 hours to bring it. We had tickets for a play at 7:30pm. We arrived at 5:00pm and tried to order room service along with the champagne. We were told we could not get food in time to make it to the play which was 3 blocks away. We asked if at least they could throw together a cheese plate. No. We tried to get into the bistro downstairs....no room. We ended up eating stuff from the mini bar. Got back from the play around 10:00pm. No more room service and the bistro was not serving any more. The area restaurants were packed, so we ended up eating the rest of the food from the minibar. The room was awful. It was in the new area and had absolutely no ambience nor decor to speak of. The staff was completely disinterested and when we took our issues to the management, we received no response. We even wrote to Kimpton and received no response from them. I would not recommend this place to ANYONE any longer.

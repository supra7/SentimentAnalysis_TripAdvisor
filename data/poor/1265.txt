We decided to stay at this hotel for the same reason as just about every other guest who stays there. Because of this site. We actually overheard many other travellers tell the hotel management this specifically. But, upon arrival, we were immediately dissapointed. The staff is friendly -- that is clear. But maybe too friendly. After 20+ hours of travel, the hotel staff insisted on sitting us down in the lobby to tell us what we should do and where we should go during our visit. Instead, we just wanted to go to our room to decompress. This continued througout the entire stay, with the staff breathing down our necks the entire time. If you like privacy, this is not the place for you. You can't even pick up a piece of toast without someone rushing over to hold your plate for you. The rooms were tastefully decorated, yes. But they were very small, and our double bed was only two singles pushed together. You'd imagine that you'd get a real double bed for these prices and not wake up stuck in a hole. Also, our door had quite a large crack in it, and you could even stand in the hallway and look right into our bedroom and at the bed directly! Another thing of note is that the hotel is four stories high (five to get to the rooftop) and there is no elevator. If you are in any unable to climb flights upon flights of stairs, this is not the hotel for you. Last thing I wanted to note is that the lobby computer has the trip advisor site as their homepage. The hotel staff very much encourage guests to write reviews on the site, and this is probably skewing the results on this page.

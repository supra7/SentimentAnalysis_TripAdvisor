I would strongly suggest not staying here ever! It is three flights of narrow stairs up to the reception, where the receptionist didnt speak english and the one that did was not helpful at all. The place is very run down and lots of things could do with being replaced or fixed. The shower on our level was broken and you had to hold it up yourself to use it, out of the two toilets on our floor only one was useable. Our room didnt have a window and when trying to use the power outlet, sparks came out.

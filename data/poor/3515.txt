This hotel is just terrible. It is not in a fantastic area for a start, yes there is a subway stop right outside the door but its only the local 1 train so you have to walk 7 blocks if you want main trains. The building itself is the worst thing about the place. Firstly you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the reception, which is almost pitch black. The reception area itself is the hotels only redeeming quality but even this you would get in your average coffee shop. The staff are fine but fighting a losing battle when people see how bad the place is. The worst thing of all is when you go to your room. Depending which floor you're on you may need climbing gear and oxygen as there's no elevator. The stairways are cramped, dark and tatty (ripped carpet and flaky paint). We had a superior room which was the size of a shoe box with no space for clothes and a window looking at a brick wall. The a/c is too loud to keep on and the bathroom is just as bad. The hotel is also a hostel as there are shared bedrooms and bathrooms at the end of the hall. People will say it's cheap for NY but you will find much better for the same price. The one plus we had was that we got sick while there but the hotel was so bad we didn't want to lie around in it so it kept us out and about.

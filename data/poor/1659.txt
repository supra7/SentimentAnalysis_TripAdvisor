My husband and I stayed at this hotel the night prior and the night of our wedding. While we were away on our honeymoon out of the country, this hotel charged my card as well as my husbands (double charging us) not only for the rooms but also for damages that were in the hotel prior to our arrival (trying to charge my husband for over $1200 in preexisting damages). We were told the charges for the room would be a total of $650 and instead they tacked on an additional $140. All of our wedding guests that booked through our block did not receive the advertised amount, charging them anywhere from $50-100 more than what they said the rates were. The sales rep we have dealt with has continually been impossible to reach, rude and (I believe) is flat out lying to us about many of the things she brings up. The rooms all smelt of mold and urine, and most of the phones in the rooms don't work. We tried to contact the front desk about various issues to no avail. We never received more towels, another blanket, none of the rooms in our wedding block worked (none out of the 15 people staying there!!). The breakfast they provide was mediocre at best. A small selection of yogurt and toast, batter for waffles but no functioning waffle maker. The employees were all extremely rude and no help at all. They only have one functioning elevator and apparently have no plans to have this repaired in the foreseeable future.

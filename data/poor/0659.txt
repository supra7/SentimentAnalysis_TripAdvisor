First night there, noticed ants in my room. Called to have them exterminated. Woke up in the morning with red spots on my face that I thought were an allergic reaction to the detergent used for their sheets. It turns out that this hotel has BEDBUGS and I brought them home with me! I am now undergoing a long, expensive, difficult process of trying to rid my home of the bedbugs that traveled back with me. I am DISGUSTED.

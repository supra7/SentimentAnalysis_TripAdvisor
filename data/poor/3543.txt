This hotel has had at least three name changes - designed to mislead travel agents all over the world. The latest, Marakesh is just the same. A swanky foyer does not cover up: a lost reservation, dual street numbers, incorrect bill (only out by $300, but who's counting), a blocked toilet, stinky carpet, no lifts - after heaving your luggage up the stairs at the entrance, that's only the beginning.. Pack your own soap and a spare (ours kept disappearing). Floor of the bathroom (the size of a cupboard) floods and doesn't dry out - no chance of a bath mat. Mattresses not worthy of a dog with fleas. Enough dust, mould and years of grime to give anyone an allergy attack. Ripped greasy carpet, terrible lighting & a bad paint job - it still doesn't cover up the multitide of sins. We ended up stuffing jumpers under the mattress to stop it sagging. No vacum cleaners here - they use brooms!! Very dark, very dim corridors, poorly signed for emergencies. Despite everything, the cleaners were polite. The girls on the front counter have no idea how to use their reservation system. Internet access over priced and unreliable. The only saving grace is that its close to a train station. This is not a funky groovy hotel - just a sordid, sad hotel in disguise. There are HEAPS of other decent hotels that are just so much better. Don't bother checking in.

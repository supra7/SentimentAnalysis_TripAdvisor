Attitude We, a family of 4, have stayed at the Clift regularly for 3 years and greatly enjoyed its location, decor, and friendly staff. This March I tried to make a reservation to stay in our favorite suite and I was told that they do not and have never allowed 4 people to stay together in a suite. The reservations agent continued to insist that this was true even when I told her we had stayed there numerous times in the past and that she could look this up in her records. I asked if it were possible to take two rooms or two adjoining rooms. She made no effort to be helpful or explain the situation or call for a manager. I am appalled they would treat any potential guest with this attitude, much less a previous customer. We will not try again. I am writing this review 3 months later because it still irks me!

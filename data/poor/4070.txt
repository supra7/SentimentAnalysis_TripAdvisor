We had to find our own parking becasue their parking garage was full and pay over $40 to park in unsecure parking lot. We were charged twice for the hotel and the price was extrememly inflated. When i checked in my total was 159.99 and when we checked out I was charged 234.04. Not what I was expecting. The pool was disgusting, the water was freezing, and the pool was only half full. We had no wash clothes in the room.

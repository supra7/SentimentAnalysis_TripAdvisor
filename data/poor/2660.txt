BEWARE. I booked two night at this hotel a month in advance to take advantge of a special rate. We arrived at around 9pm after a long drive from San Antoino. We checked in and went up to our room, only to find a half naked man inside. I guess he had been given the wrong key but didnt correct it. We went back down and the hotel clerk gave us another room only it was not the queen bed that I paid for but two double beds. She did give us free parking for both days. The room was nice but in the morning we found a dirty washcloth haning on the shower curtainn rod and a dirty towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door. I told the morning desk clerk this and she was a bit rude. I also asked her to conferm our free parking which she did only verbally. Later in the afternoon I was looking online at my checking account and saw that this hotel had charged $75.04 to my account!!! I was told they made a mistake and that they will refund my money, however, the hotel won't give me a written confirmation of this. Where I come from this is called theft. If I had not seen this charge today they would have gotten away with my money. The staff has be very rude with me about this and I am really let down with this place. We check out tomorrow and I am a bit nervous to leave without having this resolved. The great location does not make up for the way I have been treated. My grandfather built 4 motels in his life and my mother still owns one of them so I know that this is not how you treat a guest. You might have a better experience here than I did but they are very bad at correcting their mistakes so beware.

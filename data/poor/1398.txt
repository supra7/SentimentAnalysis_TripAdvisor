First off, the hotel is on an uneven cobblestone alley way with funky gypsies begging you for money, meanwhile, you're dodging turds of feces on the ground to get to the front door. Next, the guest must find their own hotel room. So, nothing was explained about usage of phone, tv, AC, etc.. The electricity NEVER stayed on. Twice throughout the night my girlfriend and I experienced the outage which was confined to our own section of the hotel. When we told the man at the front desk, he seemed indifferent about the situaion, and, he even had the nerve to tell us, "Oh, somebody must've cut the power." Well, what did he do? Nothing except reset the fuse box, and parked his dirty behind back at the front desk. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob but certain basic things which we are paying for should be provided. Bathing in total darkness is not being snobbish! Oh, and finally, about the Wi-Fi, you're better off going to an internet cafe because it doesn't work. The only benefit is its close to Termini train station and two ristorantes down the alley way. Peace.

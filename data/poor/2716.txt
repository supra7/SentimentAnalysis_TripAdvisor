I stayed at the Middletowne Helmsley, for one night. Arriving at 10pm, there was no valet, had to go into building and find someone. They don't even have a real check in desk. They are redoing front area, so there were sheets on the floor, had to wheel suitcase over, and almost fell. After craming into small elevator, up to 5th floor, bell hop opened the door to one of the worst hotel rooms I have stayed in. Problems with the room included the very dirty and stained carpet. Beds were very uncomfortable with disqusting comforter/bed coverings. The 1980's 15" TV only had a couple of working channels. The remote did not work well, and there were no outlets available to plug in cell phone. There is no room service only order from delivery restaurant, which was at least nice they had local menus. There was an awful hamburger grease smell pumped into the room for half of the night, as well as the constant noise from the mini fridge. One of the main problems is there is no deadbolt on the door. It took a lot for the door to actually close, and only had a chain on it. Eaisly able to kick door open. Shower in the morning, got scalded by a neighbor flushing the toilet. Toiletries were good. "Breakfast" in morning was donuts and breads/bagles and coffee starting at 6:30am. I was down at 7am, things were quickly dissapearing. I would not have been so dissapointed if the hotel was labled as a hostel, or under $150.00. I would never stay there again!

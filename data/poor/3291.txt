I booked an executive king room for the night of 10/29/04 through Expedia. With this request it was advertised that I would receive a room with a jetted tub, separate shower, city view/corner room, bath salts, etc. Instead I received an ordinary traditional room with none of the above mentioned amenities. For all this I pre-paid $209.97 (taxes and service fees included) which was the price for the executive king and was never refunded the difference from a standard room. In addition I found the man working at the front desk to be unprofessional. When we arrived he was giggling uncontrollably and did not actually give me a map of the city when he himself offered one. I found the whole experience disappointing. I stayed at this hotel to be close to the Paramont theater. I will never stay here again. If you are looking for the same location and great service and value stay at the Grand Hyatt across the street.

Hotel is in a great location but the customer service is poor. On our arrival date we had reservations at Shulas steakhouse ( located in the hotel ) unable to find a hostess to seat us after 20 minutes of standing around we left. One day asked the front desk to have our room cleaned while we want on a tour, when we returned ( 3 hours later the room still had not been cleaned ). Went to Shulas on our depature date ( should of known better ) for the breakfast buffet, we had to practically seat our selves and had to enter the kitchen to request coffee and juice at the end of our breakfast had to enter the kitchen again to request our bill. When we finally checked out at the front desk our bill was overcharged by $ 500 , had to wait 20 minutes to straighten out. We are marriott reward members.

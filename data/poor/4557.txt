We've been to many hotels with 4 star and higher ratings. This wasn't one of them. I've stayed at nicer holiday inns! Rooms are tiny. You could lay in bed and touch the walls. Only one chair - a desk chair to sit in. Luggage sits on the floor - bed bug bait. One protruding coat rack from the wall constitutes the closet. And, since when did a plastic cup become eco-friendly? Also had a little attitude from the front desk when we asked for a larger room and were told "you already have one of the largest queen rooms". I would hate to see the poor soul who got the smaller queen room. Chicago has so much to offer in fine hotels. Sorry, Hotel Felix, you have lots of room for improvement. Maybe knock down a wall or two to make the rooms adequate for today's travelers. We left and checked into another hotel!

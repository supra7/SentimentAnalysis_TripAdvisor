I have been going to Ocean city for over 30 years and always thought the Dunes Manor was the shxx! So in July of 2012 I decided to stay there for 2 nights with my 3 daughters and my Grandson. To sum up my weekend getaway.. the room was very dirty I mean VERY DIRTY.. food under the bed, hairs left on the bathroom floor and spots and stains everywhere, including the sheets and towels!! The AC worked 50% of the time we were there. I only complained once about the AC and supposedly someone came up and fixed it. Like I said, it worked 50% of the time. The staff was extremely rude so my daughters and I decided not to complain about anything to them (other than the AC not working). I noticed on the 2nd day we were ther my poor 2 yr old g-son broke out in a rash?? I wouldnt be surprised if there were BED bugs in the room. The pool was very very small for such a big Hotel! As I mentioned this is a place Ive always wanted to stay and was EXTREMELY disappointed with my overall experience!! The restaurant was over priced and the food sucked. Oh, Did I mention I paid almost $600 for 2 nights for this dump??? If you are all wondering why I didnt complain is because I would rather get on every site there is to give this hotel a BAD reveiw and thats how I will get my satisfaction! If they gave me a free room for a week I WOULD TURN IT DOWN!! DIRY FILTHY DUMP IS ALL THE DUNES MAOR IS!! Beware folks, the pics are deceiving! I have already told all my friends and family about this dump and hopefully Management will get the hint and do something about it!! A motel 6 is probably cleaner than the "Dunes Dump"

Guess what as a VIP invited guest you get a crap view from your hotel, it costs me $ 1.25 for a local call, didn't dare try the internet service of $ 13.99/day, which is free in every other hotel I've stayed, a simple cheese omelet was $ 33.00 after all of the fees, no HBO or Showtime? But lots of TV about Steve Wynn. Dont touch anything in the fridge or the snack stand it costs a FORTUNE, I didn't play and lose enough money in their casino, (11 hours play in 3 days and a loss of + $ 4,000.00) as tracked and graded by my casino card which was wrong. I guess I'm not rich, enough for the Wynn hotels, dealers and supervisors are so hungry they have to go out with customers so they can eat>>>>>>>> I'm sure the next time I go back to Las Vegas my stay will be back at Caesars again. THIS PLACE IS A RIP OFF

We were needing a hotel room for one night to break up our trip down to Galveston for Spring Break with my wife and two teenagers. We had stayed in this hotel a couple of times before because it was a nice property, there's plenty of places to eat in the area, and their weekend price was definitely right.. The first thing that didn't give us a warm fuzzy was the warning posted at the front desk by the local police department referring to the rash of cars break-in's that had been occurring in the area. I made sure we got everything valuable out of the car and parked it under a light in the parking lot. The big problem was we had reserved a non-smoking room and when we checked in I made a point of asking the clerk if our room was non-smoking and he said "YES." When we got to the room it was apparent that the room had been smoked in at one time but it didn't really smell bad so we stayed. Early the next morning it became apparent that we were indeed on the smoking floor when someone in the adjoining room lit up and the smoke seeped under the door. Walking down the floor we could smell smoke so we knew we were on the smoking floor. We packed up really fast, ate breakfast, checked out and got the heck outta there! On my way out I walked on a different floor and saw that there was a sign by each of the room numbers on that floor indicating that it was a non-smoking room. Our room did not have the sign so that verified it. The thing that really bothers me is the clerk at the front desk lied to my face. It is unfortunate; we liked that hotel but we won't be going back.

I was bitten all over on my first night by bed bugs. DO NOT ACCEPT ROOM 507. And do not believe the plush looking website, the lighting is not atmospherically dark, it is just dark in an attempt to hide the shabby refurbishment job. We were staying for three nights, when we discovered that it was bed bugs that had bitten me (my partner squashed one which was heading his direction), they moved us to another room. We decided that we did not want to pay for the first and second night of our stay and they agreed that we would not have to, which was fine but further investigation has shown that they had had problems with bed bugs before. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

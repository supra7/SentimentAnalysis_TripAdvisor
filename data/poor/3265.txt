My family and I are frequent visitors to Las Vegas and this was our worst hotel experience! First of all, registration was very disorganized and took forever. I did a phone booking for a suite with double queen beds (which was clearly stated in the confirmation email that I received from them). However, I was given a room with one bed and it seemed like it was a big favor that they gave me an uncomfortable rollaway bed instead of another queen bed. To make things worse, the room keys didn't work....security took forever to respond to open the room & I had to stand in line again at the registration desk to get the keys re-validated. The bathroom floor was filthy...there was some gooey material that was not cleaned. I would not stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone.

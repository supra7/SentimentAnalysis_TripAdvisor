I cannot even comment on the rooms as I didn't even get that far. We arrived at 11:00 on a Saturday night--tired and anxious to crash. We dragged in 2 huge bags and no one offered to help. We checked in only to be told there was a flood in "our room" and they are sorry there are no other rooms available. They had both of our cell phone numbers but did not feel the need to notify us. They "don't call their guests" was their reply. Instead they booked us at a Holiday Inn Express 10 MILES FROM SEATTLE!!! We were told there were "no rooms available in Seattle for the night". Calling the staff miserable, uninterested and pathetic is an understatement. They basically shrugged their shoulders, huffed and puffed and seemed bothered simply by our presence. I've never experienced anything like it. TOTAL DUMP. In the end there "were rooms available in Seattle" and it all worked out elsewhere.

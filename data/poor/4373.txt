Upon arrival noone speaks to you or even makes eye contact! They see you with bags and no one directs you to front desk. It was our anniversary and on our check in info and no one said a word! Not even a smile! They just shove keys at you and point to elevator! The hotel pool is loud and trash every where! Drinks are outrageous and staff never checks on you! The pool closes at 830 and the hot tub is small and always full! The halls will have room service trays sitting out all day! There are also pizza boxes and trash in hallways! There are no grudges in the rooms! The walls are paper thin! It's Vegas so when the lady next door started moaning at 330 am I thought oh well! By 530 am I was outdone! The screaming and head board banging was crazy! So I finally had to bang on the wall to make them stop!!! The fire alarm at 700 am was the final straw! No one tells you anything so you don't no what to do!! I would never stay at this rude establishment again ! The only plus is good pillows and close to bus stop!!!

Friday check in 6:30PM Hilton Diamond Member--meant nothing--check in very impersonal , care less attitude. No consideration of membership status at all when given a room with 20 year old TV and paper thin walls. Friday and Saturday night--no sleep due to loud and out of control party next door. Called security on numerous occasions and all they did was ask the multiple people in the room to "please keep it down" . Parties on both nights went until after 2AM and this hotel could care less. Checking out of this "hotel or club" in one (1) hour to go home and get some sleep. I have stayed here in the past but will be sure to find alternatives in my 4-5 visits to Chicago per year.

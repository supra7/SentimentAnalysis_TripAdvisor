Rooms are very small, lighting is insufficient and for the price you pay I can think of many hotels in NYC that can offer a lot more and better value. I asked for a European Plug adapter by calling "What Ever When Ever" button on the phone, the lady on the other end said we are all out of them, wait till someone returns it and then we will send it to your rooms! I am sorry but this is not a service response you get from a W Hotel. For all I know the lady should have said " I am sorry Sir we are out but give me a few minutes and I will have one delivered to your room" When I complained at the reception, the lady at reception said "Do you want to speak to the Manager?" wrong answer again! if the staff had proper training and were empowered, she would have said "I am sorry Sir I will make sure that you get the adapter" last opportunity after I returned from dinner I thought, the lady at reception must have reacted and I am sure that by the time I get to my room the adapter is there! NO Chance.

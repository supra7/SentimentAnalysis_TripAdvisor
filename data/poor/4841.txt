I knew that this place was in downtown close to Pike's Place, but I didn't think it would be in a highrise! It was very convenient to be 3 blocks from Pike's Place and right across from the Seattle Art Museum. But parking a car in there parking garage was awful. It was very hot and cost $15 to park. My three sisters and I had a room with 2 queen beds and one rollaway. The rollaway was there but standing right in the middle of the entryway and standing on it headboard, not made. The room had no toiletties or towels and washcloths for 4 people. When we did get some toiletties it was 4 bottles of conditioner and no shampoo.Also the tiolet was dirty on the outside of the bowl with #2 on it 'Yuck" !! and the Bathtub tile had mildew stains everywhere, walls were dirty as well as floors. I guess they don't have someone come in and inspect the housekeeper work. The staff at the Inn was one guy at the desk and one houskeeper I saw the next morning. I also was disappointed in the lack of helpfullness or apologies for the 4 phone calls to request items that should have been in the room. Also on their website it says they have fresh baked cookies in the lobby and we saw none . I asked about they and they laughed at me. The breakfast was ok, oatmeal was very dry, cooking in a crockpot and there was a staff of 2 in the backcounter asking to put lids back on food.I was very disappionted in this place and reccomened not to stay here.

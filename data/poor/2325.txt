I stayed their for my honeymoon - and they threw an item out from my room through room service. I spent hours upon hours looking for assistance from them - they sent a security guard to the room accusing me of lying and rummaging through my personal belongings and under garments - then they ignored me till the end of my stay when Aaron who denied any assistance showed up with a phony smirk to say we can't do anything about it. Spend nearly $500/night for this level of service - NEVER again.

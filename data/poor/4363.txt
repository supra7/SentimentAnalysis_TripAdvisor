First off, let me start off by saying that they have a bunch of low lifes running the VALET parking and all of them dont look happy to be there. when me and my fiance checked in we were helped by some very rude receptionist that told me the room i booked wasnt available and that she would have to put us in a standard room which wasnt what i paid for, but we were driving for 5 hours from phoenix and i just wanted to shower and get a bite to eat on the strip. so when we got to our room the ac wasnt working correctly and the bathroom was horrid. the floor in the bathroom was cement (literally) and stand up shower, and the rug in the entry way was very stained. i called to the front desk and asked if we could be placed in a different room and they told me someone would be up to give me the new keys to the new room. about 1/2 hr later some guy delivered the news keys and walked away without asking if we needed any help or anything. the new room was OK, better bathroom and ac worked. I have to say that every single staff employee that works at this hotel including the store employees, mcdonalds, & starbucks all have a serious attitude problem. We found out other guests were having the same problem while we were standing online at starbucks. If you like being around dirtbags and in a screwed up area on the strip as well, then stay here. the next time we visit vegas we will definetly not be staying at this hotel.

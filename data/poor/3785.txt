Not what is advertised!!! Well the checkin process was not pleasant. Kept waiting and finally not accepting the rooms they tried to give us. Ok that was not satisfied but we went on with vacation. The spa does not work, and it has not been working for 6 months according to the maintenance person. When we asked the management about it, they had nothing but excuses. No resolution to the problem was ever received. I reccomend that you avoid this Hotel. There are many other hotels which are better values with things that actually work.

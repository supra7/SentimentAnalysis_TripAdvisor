this is more of a hostel than a hotel, the rooms were tiny, we were a party of 8 grown men and were put in two family rooms with 2 bunk beds and two singles to each room, the rooms were dirty the decor was shocking, every room in the hotel including the bar and dining rooms had artexed walls and ceilings. for a hotel with a 4 star tourist board rating it left a lot to be desired

If you plan to stay in this hotel, please read my review before you make a reservation. we stayed in Sheraton maui around thanksgiving for a wk. we booked the oceanfront room which is very far away from lobby area. I don't recommend for a family with small children to stay in oceanfront room. It takes about 3 elevators and at least 10-15 minutes walk to get to lobby. The next day after arrival, the weather was freezing cold. We came back to our room from swimming pool and found out that the room key was not working. I called the phone on our floor and no one answered. So, I have to take my two kids and walked all the way back to lobby. We had only swimsuits on and it was very cold. When we finally got to hotel, and there was a long line at the front desk. So I asked for help to a lady sitting at the information desk. This lady didn't even bother to get out of her desk. All she told me is that only the front desk people can help. I just have to wait in line for help. There I was with two small freezing kids. My kids were so freezing, and their lips turn purplish. The water from my swimsuit dripping down to the floor in the lobby. People passing by me were staring at me. None of the workers in the lobby offered to help us. I turn to look at the lady sitting at the information desk. She was staring at me, too. This was the most humiliating experience that I ever had in a hotel. I don't know how the people working in this hotel is trained in terms of customer services. I didn't expect this when I first booked the hotel. All I can say is that I will stay away from Sheraton Maui. We will come back to Maui for sure, but Sheraton Maui would definitely be the hotel that we avoid next time.

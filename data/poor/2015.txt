From the moment we arrived at this hotel it was a disaster. Upon arrival we were supposed to be given a suite for our weekend stay with family and friends to celebrate a wedding. The rude clerk at the front desk told us there were no suites available for that weekend. My son arrived an hour later and the same clerk gave him a suite! The dingy, dark room we were given had a faulty shower, the water could not be regulated, and was so hot it scalded us! The walls were paper thin and the noise level pretty high. The hotel worker's union had picket signs plastered outside the entrance of the hotel. The exercise facility was poorly equipped with broken machines. The lobby is located on the lower level of the parking garage with no sitting area and the front desk is on an entirely different level, very inconvenient for large groups staying together. The customer service at this hotel was extremely poor, we travel extensively for business and pleasure and have stayed at many hotels, we would never stay at a Hyatt again, nor would we recommend the Hyatt to family or friends.

I work in the industry and usually stay at my own mid-scale brand but my husband and I had a rare opportunity to get away without our children, wanted a little more upscale room and a comfortable bed! I had heard some great things about the Westins and their Heavenly beds so thats where we went. The Heavenly beds at this property weren't so heavenly! Both of us woke up both days with aching backs and hadn't slept very good. The other thing I was very dissappointed about was the lack of information on the website and my confirmation about the parking charges. $32 a day to valet your vehicle or $24 a day to self park but you have to pay every time you come in and out. REDICULOUS!!! Had we known about this, we wouldn't have booked at this property. I also thought it was rediculous to pay for internet. The staff was very amazing and helpful! I did send an email to the property complaining about the bed and the parking. The response I received from the Front Office Manager was less than professional and in regards to the bed he didn't even finish the sentence. Felt that they responded to say they did, agreed with everything I said and brushed me off. They did however offer to pay my parking the next time I decided to stay at their property - thanks but no thanks - I have very high expecations of hotels and the Westin (a 4 star property) did not come close to meeting them.

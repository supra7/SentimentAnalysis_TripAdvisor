Overall the room was great, but when I checked out I forgot my $250 jacket in the room, it was around 10:30 AM when I left, then I got back after the room was cleaned by the cleaning lady and the jacket was not there anymore, then I went to lost and found, and it was not there, I spoke with Glen the manager on duty that day, and I explained my story but all I had was a hey we are sorry about this and you can buy another one there is a store across the street that sells jackets. I was very upset to hear such thing form a high end 5 stars hotel. I cannot officially accuse the cleaning lady but it is also hard not to make your own idea about what could have happened. They clean each room and do not leave anyhting behind after each checkout, so there is no way this would have been left in the room. Also there is no way I could have lost it somewhere in vegas because this was a winter jacket that you wear when its very cold, so it stayed in the rooom the whole time I was in vegas, I didn't wear it the whole time I was there. So I want to mention it just in case the Trump reads this and decide to reply to my message. Bottom line this is a nice and luxury hotel I will not complain at everything just because I am upset with what happened, but the way Glen the manager on duty handled the issue was not what I expected, if I was them I would have at least offer the Client a jacket to go back home. Again I cannot officially acuse the cleaning lady since I didn't see her with my jacket, but I just made my conclusions, so do your own and make sure you check all your things. Have fun in Vegas...

please...if you are under teh age of 50 you will not enjoy this place. my husband and i felt as if we couldnt even talk at breakfast or lunch b/c noone talked and there were never any music playing so you felt obligated to stay mute. the place was pretty...but every resort in mexifo is pretty. i am so upset that we spent this much $ on a palce that wasnt even worth it! also, it cost us $50 roundtrip just to go in playa to have some fun....and 25 minutes one way! do not stay here...i could list a looooong list of things that went wrong but am only getting more and more angry thinking of it. bottom line---do not stay here, save your money!

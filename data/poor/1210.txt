We traveled to Boqueron Beach in Puerto Rico the week of 3/9/09. We were a party of 7. In condo, no dishwasher, not enough dishes and glasses, table held 4, 2 cup coffee maker, onsite beach as stated, NOT. Condo advertised as sleeps 8 privately and 10 max. The beach was public and colored flags flew indicating water quality, which translated meant high bacteria counts from previous weeks rain, swim at your own risk. Cold water in pool, no hot tub, no fitness room.

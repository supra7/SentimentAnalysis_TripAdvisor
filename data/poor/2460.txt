Having vacationed at the Marriott Kauai three times previously (and having a fantastic service experience), my wife and I thought we'd venture out to one of the other islands to see more of Hawaii. The Westin Maui Resort was an absolute horror. Service was slow bordering on rude. The food wasn't refrigerated properly - which led to my wife contracting food poisoning on the second day. It took over an hour to book an excursion. And the bar staff was more interested in polishing their beer taps than actually pouring a drink. Fortunately, we went to the Whaler's Village and had a completely different service experience at every restaurant and venue there. Even without reservations, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table. Bar service was instantaneous. The wait staff at Hula and Lelaini's was friendly, fast and the food was great. We're really surprised and disappointed with the Westin. You'd think with such a prime location and beautiful facility, they'd have their pick of the best-of-the-best in hotel management. Sadly, at the Westin Maui, that is definitely not the case.

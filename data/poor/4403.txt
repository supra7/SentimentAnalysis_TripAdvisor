Booked four nights at the Stratosphere for myself and 3 friends flying in from the UK to celebrate a 50th. The hotel sounded like a good deal and I requested a possible upgrade on-line before arrival. I would say the "room" upgrade is more of a "view" upgrade. Unfortunately, the room was far to small for four males (Two of my friends got their own room later that evening), there was no refrigerator, not enough towels etc., for four and a television set from the '90's. All that for about $500 for four nights...Plus an additional charge for wireless internet access!! Our room was close to the elevator which meant there was a constant stream of loud and/or drunk guests outside at all hours along with fights requiring security and police intervention. The front desk staff were unsympathetic when the issue was raised. Generally the staff were pleasant although the bartender was indifferent - when you could get his attention - and the gentleman arranging cabs etc., was outright rude when asked a question. To get to the "strip" you can either use a cab, monorail, bus or walk. To walk you must pass what seems to be an endless pile of trash and debris with waste of every description. NOT recommended. Prices in the hotel (and just about everywhere else) were higher than expected or necessary. I would suggest finding a more central location for a similar price and avoid this hotel if at all possible. Not Recommended at all.

Fooled me once, shame on you. I won't be fooled again. I'm a seven star player for 2 years now. If you have heard we are treated special, don't believe it and waste your time and money. So you think you are treated bad when you are a Diamond Player, just imagine how bad it is when you are ignored as a 7star. Staff here are rude, angry that you inconvience them with any question. Computer System broke down for 3 -4 hours, do you think they would credit you with they play, no way. I think the forgot about loyalty. I don't have to stay or play here anymore. I've learned my lesson and will be staying at an MGM property. They treat you like a VIP every time, not just your annual trip. Adios

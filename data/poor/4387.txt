Rooms not well maintained, desk not helpful, rooms not really cleaned daily. Stayed with kids and grandkids at this hotel and everyone wanted to leave. Went for a grandsons baseball tournament so 12 family's--none happy. Location is bad, not really safe to wander around after dark --lots of drunks etc. Absolutely no reason to stay at this hotel. Lots of much better options.

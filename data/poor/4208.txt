There's a lot of problems with noise in this hotel. The music coming from a bar across the street was heard up on the 10th floor, and my neighbors were extremely loud as well. Walls were paper thin, and I could hear everything. Good hotel if you're up for partying all night. Terrible place if you're trying to get any sleep. Otherwise the staff tried their best to be accommodating.

The pictures and some reviews make this hotel to be amazing. However when we came to our room it was next to the reception desk, was stuffy, small and was nothing like what was on the website. As we had paid over US$220 per night for a room we refused to stay there. We ended up staying at the hotel next door also owned and run by this hotel. See review for that place (White Swan Inn).

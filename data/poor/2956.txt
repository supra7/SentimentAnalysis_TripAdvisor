My husband and I, we have stayed here about 7years ago and were kind of frightend by the size of the room. This time we returned here with our daughter due to a business trip and the room size and certain services frightened us again. The doormen weren't efficient and welcoming, nor were the taxis waiting in front of the hotel. The reception was however very nice. Our room was small and as we travelled from Asia, we had more than 2 pieces of luggages. We could only have one opened, the rest we needed to have them open and stored under the bed. The ventilation in the bathroom was constantly on and so lound that we couldn't bare the door of the bathroom opened. The heater seemed not to work properly. The first impression of the lobby might be trendy, and indeed the room itself, however not the bathroom at all, was also in a trendy setting, however it is definitely not a family friendly hotel and absolutely not the room rate worth. The only positive point was that we were STARWOOD Gold level members, so we could stay in our room until 4pm, as our plan took off at 10pm.

This is the letter I wrote to them after my horrible experience: "I booked a king room on April 9th, one month ago, and organized my 2 days in NY around the Thompson LES. Instead I ended up in a horrible hotel on Wall Street and was told by your assistant to "not take it personally". Please explain to me how I should not take it personally when both my vacation and dinner party were ruined. I was told the guest who was supposed to check out "refused to leave the room". In all the years I have been traveling I have never heard of anything more ridiculous. Furthermore, this same guest was permitted to stay in the room knowing that another guest, who had a confirmed reservation for over a month, would be refused her hotel accommodations. The credit card number I gave to guarantee my reservation served what purpose? Not only was I turned away but I was sent to another hotel that was a nightmare. This alternative hotel should have been offered to the guest who did not have a reservation and refused to leave instead of me. Does this mean that rooms in the Thompson hotels are available only if the previous guests decide to leave? I'm sure you will agree how absurd this is." Just DO NOT GO Cristiana

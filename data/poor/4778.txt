I stayed at this "hotel" for my first ever trip to New York, and although I loved New York I did not love this hotel. When we arrived there was a stuff up with the room we booked, apparently the heating was not working in the room we had booked. So we were given a room with a shared bathroom which is not what I had paid for. I had booked a room with a private bathroom the room with the shared bathroom was freezing and we had to wear our clothes to bed (first time I've ever worn a beanie to bed) and to go to the bathroom during the night my boyfriend said to wake him so I would not go alone. The next day we were moved to our "booked" room with a private bathroom. The Bathroom right off the bat was filthy, scum all around the shower and sink I had to stand on a plastic bag to shower as I did not have any thongs (flip slops) with me as it was winter and snowing when we visited New York. The new room was also freezing and we had to stuff a towel around the air conditioner as we had cold air blowing in. The maid service that brought towels and changed the bed linen would come around and even though we requested privacy and told her we did not need new linen the maid would open the door whilst we were mid getting dressed! I felt unsafe staying at this hotel as the lock on the door was very flimsy, but because we had already paid to stay there my boyfriend talked me into staying and he slept on the side closest to the door. Not to mention the elevator was ancient. I would never stay here again the price for this place is ridiculous for what you get. Oh and one day when we arrived back to the room the wall was painted blue...

I've stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during 2012 eve and I payed 224 pounds, expensive for a single room. What to say; It was the worst experience I have ever had!!! thin rooms, strange smell, no lift, noisy, cannot sleep, lavatory inside shower, and the worst of all : I've found S-L-U-G-S many times in my room!!! (see the pictures) How this could happen in a "3 stars" hotel??? Who give this assessment??? even NO star is not acceptable, and I didn't talk about the very small breakfast room where you can't stand, and the content of their promised "continental" breakfast, very terrible!!! What a shame for London to have such hotels, I've been in many hotels around the world and really I've never ever seen this even in "Third World" hotels. Moreover, even after complaining many time (cause each night I found new SLUGS), NO SOLUTION. The manager (called "Ahmed" by phone) is never around physically and difficult to join by phone even if you ask many time the reception, the employed staff was very friendly and wanted to help but no solution: "We are complete, we suggest a room in an other hotel". Sound good... I went to the suggested hotel (which is financed by the same manager) and I discovered a very small room, smaller than the room #26!!! It is for rats not for humans. And the worst was the receptionist: coarse and threatening, UNBELIEVABLE!!! After this new very grueling experience, coming back to Notting Hill Gate hotel: Of course, no solution provided, as I have to stay in room #26 with SLUGS for an other night. The last night they finally changed it for an other room, it was the room #1. OK, can I breath and sleep?!... NO, it was in the basement, strange smell, very noisy, no WiFi signal, NO INTERNET ACCESS. I would prefer SLUGS in room #26?! It was an UNBELIEVABLE experience. How this 3 stars hotel could exist???!!!

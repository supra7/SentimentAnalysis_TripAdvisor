One of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. The room was too small for myself, my wife and child. The floor above us houses transients paid for by the city, and the noise went on all night. Outside was even worse- literally everyone on the street is a meth addict. We saw a child get horribly injured in the concrete playground across the street while her mother was occupied on drug business. The price was way too much for the room, even excepting the other circumstances. And everything was under construction inside and out. Avoid!

Extremely tiny rooms, so much humidity inside the rooms you can't barely breathe, you can see water drops everywhere because of the humidity, toilet doesn't flush properly. I stayed there for 3 nights and I couldn't sleep at all, the first night I was shivering, the second night we turned on the heating and it was so hot it was unbreathable. On the third night we found ourselves another hotel nest to central station and it felt like a palace. Themlocation was good, and the breatfast was ok, the lady and the man there were very friendly, but honestly, this botel is deterred, there's hardly any cleaning, it's uncomfortable, small, cold, humid, noisy(due to paper thin walls), and the list of negative aspects goes on and on and on...

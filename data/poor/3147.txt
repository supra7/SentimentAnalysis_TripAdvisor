I won't go back. The hotel was undergoing renovations during our stay and the elevator was often out of order or occupied by workmen. This was rather annoying, but not our major complaint.The bed was very uncomfortable - after three nights my husband and I were rather sore and sleep-deprived. Our room shared a door with the next room and we could clearly hear the guests beside us. The bathroom had shutter-style windows that let in all of the street noise and cold air. This made for a chilly morning shower! The street noises also penetrated the room via the air conditioning unit placed in the window. Although the Larskpur has reasonable rates and is in a good location we would never go back.

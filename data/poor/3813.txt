Run Fast From This Hotel Oh MY GOD This was the BIGGEST MISTAKE i have ever made. I am a Travel Agent and i am so sorry i stayed at this property. We checked in and was disapointed from the start the property is very old, the rooms are small and smell of mildew. We were woken up at 3:30 am by someone setting off the fire sprinkler system on the 12th floor which we were on and flooded the whole floor we had to walk down 12 flights of stairs just to wait outside the motel from hell for an hour before we were allowed to get our bags and moved to another room. The next morning i contacted our tour company and had them move us they moved us to the Aqua Wave which is in the same family only 3 blocks away and incredible we love that hotel the staff is freindly it's clean and we felt safe. And we did not find condom wrappers in the elevator like we did at the Aqua Continental i Will never ever ever book clients to stay at the Aqua Continental i can promise you that. It's not worth the hassle to go thru. And all this happened on our fist night there.

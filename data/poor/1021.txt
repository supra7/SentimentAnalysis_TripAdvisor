dont let trip advisor fool you into this hotel, just because of the rating i travel alot around the world and stayed in many hotels,usually 4 0r 5 star, and this hotel is the worst place ive stayed in. sure it looks beautiful,sure its a great location but its a noisy hotel,opposite from relaxing,the hallway floor from the outside of your hotel room is tiled which you can hear every foot step since they were too cheap to put a small separation from the entrance of your room. The maids would make loud noises in the morning cleaning so you have no choice but to wake up even if your tired. there is no concierge,worst service ever and they charge you an accomodation fee but for what???? who does that? worst hotel ever and you charge me 18 euros at the end,what a joke. the hotel was clean though so thats pretty much the only thing that was positive.Next time i go to rome,i will pay the extra money to stay at the st regis,This hotel is a fake and not relaxing at all.ps i forgot to mention the noise from the street is super annoying,especially when they like to speed.

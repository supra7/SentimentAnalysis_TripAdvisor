This hotel double booked us and it took us an entire day with a conference call to resolve the charges. We got shuttled back and forth with several uninformed and unconcerned employees--it took a call from our bank to the hotel to get our money back. The employees are not very bright and spend a lot of time socializing among themselves rather than attending to their responsibilities. The rooms on the north and east side have a great view and the location is across the street from Millenium Park and around the corner from the train. The shower and toilet were cracked, no ventilation fan, no small towels unless you ask for them. The room was not clean--found other people's used tissue. We had nothing but trouble from the start--should have known when we made simple reservations for two rooms and they couldn't get it together.

1)hotel was dirty 2) hotel was stinky. We stayed in a nonsmoking room but the sheets both nights had been in smoking rooms 3) bugs, most specifically spiders, roaches, and crickets 4) if you put the sign on the door asking FOR cleaning, the housekeeper automatically assumes the sign means "don't clean" because....why? she can't read? (Hotel manager explained this to us) 5) seedy characters - lots of panhandlers and people walking around at night 6) the train is EVERY HOUR - and it isn't 1000 yards away 7) next to a very overgrown lot and several abandoned houses, dead end streets, etc.

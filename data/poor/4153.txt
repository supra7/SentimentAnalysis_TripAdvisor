We were very disappointed with our experience. We typically enjoy staying at Holiday Inn Express. Our room was very clean but it was incredibly small. The four of us could hardly move around. A family with small children and all of the neccesary items would never be able to manage in a room that small. The beds were horrible! The mattresses were very soft and worn out. You could hear every sound in the motel and outside. The bathtub/shower was raised by about 4 inches. So be prepared. It is a very big step up and back out.

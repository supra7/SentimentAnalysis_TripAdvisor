There is no way to describe how AWFUL this hotel is. Everything about the places is out dated. The furniture was was so stained, I do not want to imagine what was stained all over the chairs. The fitted sheets did not fit and would slip down when trying to sleep in the "very uncomfortable bed". After the sheets slip down an reveal the mattress, you will find where past guest have written messages all over the mattress. You will hear other guest either entering or leaving their rooms, talking in the halls and rooms, televisions playing all through the night. And the trolly is never ending. I advise you bring ear plugs - and even those will not block out all the noise you hear. The price of the rooms may look good - do yourself a favor and book at another location even if the rate is a little higher. If you book at the Parc St. Charles you will get what you paid for - a CHEAP place to stay.

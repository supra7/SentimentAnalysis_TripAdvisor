Let me start off by saying I never write reviews or complete surveys however my experience at this hotel was so awful I feel it is my duty to inform others about this place. My overall complaint is regarding the grounds only, the people were great, and in a way I feel sorry for them. They know the property is a wreck but they do they beat they can with what they have. Now let's get to the property. It's old, old,old. I mean you can tell this place was a happening spot back in the 70's but fast forward 30 plus years later, that same decor from back in the day just does not work. The room we stayed in was a suit. It also was dated. On top of that it was filled with exotic bugs that I had the pleasure of killing. With a 15 month old in tow, this was not cool. He was confined to the bed. I could not enjoy the Maui breeze becuase my patio was occupied by Gecko's who obviously had reserved that area first. They comment about the birds in the previous review is spot on. It felt like I was in central park. The noise they made was more than anything odd. On top of all that we found out the next day that the property was in foreclosure. Augh mystery solved. Bottom line do nit even think about staying here. If you do stay here and you wonder why it is so quiet, it is probably because you are there by yourself. FYI I am writing this from my iPhone at the Four Seasons which is about a mile down from the Maui Prince. I now feel like I am on a vacation again.

You've got to be kidding. We have stayed in the best and worst of hotels/motels through the years. We've stayed here 3 times prior to this, but this particular visit was worst I've ever seen in my life. Upon check-in the fellow who was checking our car, was rude beyond belief....we had to literally beg for a cart for our luggage. Two days later we rented a pool-side cabana, and then we're in the pool, look up and see three people (security people) advancing on our cabana and entering the area...all other guests eyes are on us at this point.... we had brought a bottle of McCallum Scotch because the waitress said they did not have it available at pool-side. Mind you, this bottle was tucked in the cabana, not anywhere near the pool itself. No posting about the bad Karma this would bring us....we were practically "under arrest" partiucularily by the head of security - a pistol packing mamma. Rude...beyond belief. The customer serive at the Biltmore is sad, sad, sad, sad. We spent over $3,000.00 for 3 days of bull from every end of the spectrum. Our advise - stay the heck away from this place. There are other beaufiful places to stay....this isn't it.

I booked this hotel because it was one of the few hotels in Manhattan with rooms available. Now I understand why they had rooms available. Next time I'll stay in New Jersey. First, the lobby is tiny. Nothing more than a desk with two people behind it, a small table, and a concierge tucked away in a small corner. The lobby couldn't have been more than 15 feet by 15 feet. The check in was slow, and even with two groups in front of me, I had to stand in the doorway, as there wasn't enough room for me to fit in the lobby. The rooms aren't much better. They are very small, even by Manhattan standards. (And be sure not to get an ADA-compliant room if you need to work - those don't come with desks). The room was clean, although one day the housekeeper forgot to give me towels, which I did not notice until after I was finished with my shower. The fitness room is even smaller than the lobby and the guest rooms. It has two treadmills and one elliptical machine, and a small set of dumbbells (although not enough room to use them). My head almost hit the ceiling using the elliptical. I hadn't stayed in a Wyndham for quite some time, so I was dismayed to learn that I had to choose between either receiving a morning newspaper or receiving points for my stay - I was not allowed to have both. This is incredible for a major hotel chain, but the employees could not have cared less. Overall, this was a very bad experience, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

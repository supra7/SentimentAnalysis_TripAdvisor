Just return from a 4 days stay from encore. My room was on the 56th floor with a great view of strip. The room is somewhat dirty at first. The tub look as if was used with muddy bottom. The TV remote was sticky with food residues. Since I dont use the tub and TV remote was easily cleaned with a wet paper wipe, the above condition did not bother me. I am giving this hotel a one star because you would not be able to have a good night sleep at this hotel. The music from the newly opened night club surrender was so loud that even at 56th floor I was not able to sleep at all. The worst thing is the music stars at around 11 pm and last past 4 am. When complain to the hotel staff at 3 am, only solution they offered is some ear plug. Stay away if you want to sleep at all. Stay if you want to stay up all night and some free music.

Could Not Wait To Leave You cannot judge a book by its cover, that is for certain! The Touchstone has a very cute exterior, and that is about all. We indeed did have to wait for the manager to come over from the deli to check us in, the elevator was rather prompt though... kudos for that. The room we were assigned (queen bed w/ an extra twin) was so tiny. To top things off they tease you with a ceiling fan that does not work, the window unit AC did not cool, and the telephone in our room did not work. Oh, and to top it off the beds were horrible. After speaking with the manager he said there was nothing he could do as the house was full- but to make the best of room we had on a busy night in the city. Neither my partner nor I wanted anything further to do with this place and checked out promptly the next morning witout even trying the complimentary breakfast. I seriously think that I've stayed in hostels back in college that were more hospitable than this place. Budget or not I do not recommed this place to anyone.

The service was terrible - the front desk staff was indifferent to the point of being rude. The express elevator bank broke down, and the remaining elevators took forever. The Bliss spa they promote so much was a write off, as it closed at 3pm on Saturday and was closed Sunday. The lobby was beautiful and offered free apples, taffy and lemonade, but the rooms were awful -- room 612 where we stayed had wallpaper peeling off the walls in the bathroom, and no full length mirror anywhere in the room.

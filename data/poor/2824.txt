so...3 nights for $2000 in total, for a tiny room, view over a car park, air conditioning that makes more noise than a formula grand prix and just very basic basic service. ok, the location is pretty central but this is a total rip off. even the shampoo smells very cheap. their motto of whatever whenever is a total joke. they should start with basic amenities. marc

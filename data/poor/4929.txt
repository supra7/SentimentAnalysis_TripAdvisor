February 3rd, 2011 we arrived at Summer Bay resorts to celebrate my thirtieth belated birthday and we were to stay until Sunday. We check in, the people are nice and friendly. I think after my day that's good. We get into the room and it's colder in there than it is out side so we try putting on the heater and the fire place and the room is filthy and there is an annoying chirping sound. We wait to give the heater and fire place some time to warm up, but call the front desk to ask about the chirping and they came up and put in new batteries. After and hr and a half we have them come up to fix the other problems, they did come back up to fix it, but after realizing it was not fixable, they gave us another room which the fire place didn't work in it and we called 2 complain they were supposed to send someone up, we waited for an hr and called again, my friend got hung up on and it was too late in the nite to care so we went 2 bed. in the morning we tried takin showers and the water was freezing cold, so i went to talk 2 management and was given a upgraded suite. This one had no problems in it, it was clean and nice and everything worked for us. we enjoyed the free shuttles, they were very helpful and we enjoyed being picked up at our rooms to be taken to the free shuttles. The place was under renovation, which didn't bother us, but the problems on the first and second nite make me and my friends not want 2 ever stay again.

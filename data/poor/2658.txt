We must have stayed at a different hotel during jazzfest than the other reviewers. Our stay was terrible. The room was dark and dirty and smelled. The bed was very uncomfortable and the bed linens were torn in several places. The staff seemed indifferent but just could have been overwhelmed because the place was full. Loved the location but there are so many better places to stay in New Orleans. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

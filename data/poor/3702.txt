moved to another sheraton... rec'd hotel booking through priceline, confirmed with hotel prior to arriving, category would be gardenview. have admired hotel for years on past vacations, never looked at rooms! upon arrival front desk clerk, rather loudly, announced that we would be receiving gardenview room as our resv. were with priceline. i told him i understood that. had to wait until after three, as that is check in time, we could not check in prior to that time, because he said cleaning staff had not released the rooms yet, that was a first for me! we were given a key to a courtesy room, common room with other people as well. there were only two other people in the room, must be everyone else was lucky and their rooms were ready early!! when we do have room assigned it is overlooking parking area, far cry from gardenview! the rooms with true gardenview are in category called Royal gardenview. Ended up speaking with the manager and requested if she could to transfer us to sheraton waikiki, thankfully she agreed to do so. i told her i know that she did not have to do that because we did go through priceline, we actually had no recourse, so her help was greatly appreciated. not only was the view horrible, but the rooms tiny, bathroom postage stamp size, and furniture was a wreck, general decor nasty!!

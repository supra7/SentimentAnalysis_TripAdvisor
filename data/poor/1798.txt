I stayed at the tides motel this past weekend for one night, (Thank god). As my friend I checked in to the motel, the night manager Lavon told us to try to keep it down during our stay, which we politely obliged. Only a few minutes later while taking our luggage up to our room, lavon yelled at us and said that we are walking on eggshells with him now, because we sound like a "Herd of elephant" walking up there. Wow! could not believe this, my friend gave me this look and said we cant put up with this already, so I ventured down to his office and asked for another room since this one was directly above his office. He proceded to tell me that there were no other rooms available, and that we shouldn't be doing alot of walking around the room anyway since it was so small, and that he likes renting it out to elderly people because they don't move around as much.He went on a rant for awhile saying that he works more than 16 hrs a day and that he will not put up with alot of noise. I told him that I read some reviews about him on trip advisor but rented anyway with an open mind, but I can now see the reviews by other people were spot on, this guy is on a power trip. When I told him that, he responded by saying him and the owner of the tides motel do not care about those reviews because they do not mean anything anyway! So since I got there late I just figured I would ride the storm out and check out as early as possible. I felt like a little kid in the room tip toeing around the room trying not to upset big daddy Lavon. It was the worst stay i've ever had anywhere in ocean city, and I have been going every year since i was 10, so 30 yrs! Checking out of the tides felt like freedom, I had so much anxiety staying there because of lavon. Never will I stay here again, or recommend this place as long as lavon is manager!!

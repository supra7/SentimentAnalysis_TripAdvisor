We have booked the Hotel Opera Roma for 2 nights stay on 28 & 29 Mar. When we checked in, the hotel staff told us that we were needed to switch to Hotel Sonya, their sister hotel, since their computer system and air-condition was out of order. We have no way but to accept their offer since we have paid the room price to the booking online. When we claimed for the price difference from the hotel, the staff said that they've upgraded us to the superior room in which was not. We also discovered that we were being cheated since the staff in Hotel Sonya told us that they quite often exchange guest in between them.

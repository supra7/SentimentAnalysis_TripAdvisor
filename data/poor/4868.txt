When i booked the hotel online, i thought that the pictures looked fantastic and that for the price of 129 Singaporean Dollar, it shall be good value for money. However, when i got there, the room was so small and the staff were very unfriendly. The Chinese man receptionist told me "go and look la" when i asked him for directions. I am still wondering what la means in English. Last but not the least, people were checking in for periods of two hours. I had trouble sleeping at night as there were plenty of noises in my neighbor's room. I just could not close my eyes at all and i was wondering when that woman or the guy next door will get tired. That was my experience.

Staying at Eureka was a rather unpleasant experience. Rooms are cramped and offer just basic facilities. Even drinking water is not offered free. We asked for a wake-up call and the Front desk refused. A free airport pick-up was confirmed in writing but did not arrive. The worst part was the rude and unhelpful attitude of the staff. Check-out time ws 12 noon and they kept bugging us every 5 minutes from 11 AM onwards to vacate the room. Strongly suggest NOT to consider this Hotel in future.

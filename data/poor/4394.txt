it was the worst stayed ever!! first they lost my reservation, then when we got into the room, it smelled like throwup and even had a big wet spot on the floor, so we had to change room, then in the other room, the bathroom wasnt clean!! and on the last night there, the TV shut off and wouldnt turn back on!!!

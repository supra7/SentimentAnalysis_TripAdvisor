Thought I'd be doing myself a favour by booking into the Intercontinental, how wrong was I? The lobby area looks quite nice, but when you reach the rooms you are magically transported to the late 1970's early 1980's with the cigarette smell (in the non-smoking rooms) lingering like it has been around since then. The service was sloppy, no late check-out for gold members because they were "fully booked" I could never imagine that hotel would get fully booked. Of course I stayed at a bargain rate of $69 a night, so maybe I'm asking a lot, but I can't help thinking this place was not even worth that - there must be some wonderful hotels in New Orleans - but do yourself a favour and avoid the intercontinental, bad management and poor service means that this is a disgrace to the IChotels group.

We went to this hotel to visit Tsunami and were dressed for it. After finding no 'self' parking, we tried valet. They took our car and parked it. We went inside to Tsunami, but we were turned away because my husband was wearing Tiva's, but otherwise was dressed nicely. Then, a few days later, we call ahead to clear our 'dress code' attire. This was on a weekday. We weren't aware it was closed every day except Fri/Sat. The person confirmed that what we were wearing was appropriate (over the phone) and said NOTHING about it being closed that night. We arrived to find no valet parking for the club, so we went to the hotel valet and were told that Tsunami was closed. There was no "I'm very sorry that the person you spoke to didn't tell you" or anything like that. He just walked away. We initially had booked this place for our honeymoon, but after reading the reviews about the staff, the management, the snobbiness, etc., we are so happy we cancelled in time. Wouldn't ever go there in the future.

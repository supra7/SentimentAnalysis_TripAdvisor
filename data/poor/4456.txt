We booked this room becuase of the web site adversited and that the rates for what the rooms were described where resonable for someone booking online. We arrived to the location and from the moment we were driving in the parking lot I felt like I was in Dowtown Los Angeles. We were surrounded by homeless people who looked like they were on drugs. We hurried up into the hotel to check in as we taught it be safer. That was not the case. The hotel was dark and gloomy like the walls had gone BLACK from so much cigarette smoke. I could literally not breathe. The people in the Casino also looked like mostly old drunks or homeless or both. I hurried to get my friends to stop them from checking in, but we were obligated to pay the night since we had booked it on line. WE DID NOT STAY. We decided it was just NOT SAFE. Our first loss in Vegas but you could not have paid me enough to stay there for the night. But after reading a few reviews of how cheap the rooms where for only $30.00..On line we were charged $120.00 a night.

First off - I never write reviews, good or bad, so this is the real deal... I stayed here and had multiple terrible experiences. I travel and stay at hotels over 100 times a year and this was easly my worse stay. Parking staff were great. However, the hotel manager (a women) and restauratnt manager/staff were rude, made assumptions about guests, and treated us like 3rd world citizens. If I ever have a choice, I would not stay at this hotel again. Honestly, I would pay more to stay at a less hotel not to be treated like the staff made me feel here. Simply described, my hotel experience here was the worse of my lifetime and I will not stay here again - I do not make assumptions about guests and I rathe be treated with respect, therefore I will not stay at this hotel ever again.

This is the worst place I have ever seen. The "restaurant/bar" area building had long been closed down and the windows were boarded up. So we are at a RESORT without any services- no food no beverages! The pool was dirty and crumbling. The rooms had bugs and worn out furniture, Its not what a resort in Maui should be. It is more like a homeless shelter.

I was due to arrive into Euston at 10.30 at night for a meeting the following day. The room was pre-booked by my company and paid for by credit card. I telephoned the hotel in the morning to confirm.Arrived at the hotel they told me they had let the room as it is their policy to overbook rooms. No apology, no alternative, very scarey indeed. Ended up at midnight on a friends floof as all the hotels were full. I will never use Travelodge again. I was appalled by my treatment. There were 3 other people I met also treated the same

End of a wonderful trip saw us land here. In a nutshell - rude bell staff (note I will not tip poor service and bad attitudes just because you expect it), rude front desk staff and staff who had to be kept out of the room - you may have been desperate to clean it but check out is 12 (and no later). This hotel has the smallest hotel room I have ever seen in the USA. Poor beyond words. Great location but that's all it's got going for it (don't be hopeful from the grand entrance and internet pictures!)

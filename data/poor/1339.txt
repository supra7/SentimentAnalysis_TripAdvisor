We booked this hotel online. We arrived dog tired at 5 am. It took the receptionist a couple of minutes to even look at me, he then denied they received the booking. I showed him the confirmation and he never accepted it, and instead offered a suite for an extra 75 derhams until the afternoon. We accepted, and while he was getting copies of our id's, a girl walked to the information desk, and he gave us the keys real quick and asked us in a very rude hand motion to go to what supposed to be a suite. When we walked into what we thoght a suite, it turned out to be the same exact room we booked!! We didn't want to go downstairs again as we were really tired. In the afternoon when we were going to check out, we asked to speak with the manager. After waiting for him for about 15 mins, he said that they actually received our booking, and apologised for the behaviour of the receptionist and said he had no right to be deceptive. He offered we stay there for another night, but one was more than enough. I said your apology is useless as long as you did not do anything about anything.

Disappointed in Omni I've been staying at the Omni Berkshire for business every week for 9 weeks (our company has a preferred rate). It is such a disappointment that I thought I should share my experience on here. The biggest complaint is about the front desk service and concierge service. The front desk staff are unapproachable and unfriendly. On two different occassions they have sent me up to a room that was not cleaned (beds not made, one smelled like armpit). The concierge is not very helpful. My colleague asked them to look up the nearest Prada store and they said it was somewhere on Fifth. No directions, no can I check the hours for you, only a its' on Fifth somewhere. The only friendly staff are the doorsmen (at least they smile) and the repair guy.A major issue with the hotel right now is that there is major construction right beside it. They start drilling and banging at 8am - so don't try to sleep in! When you reserve or check in, ask for a room away from the construction -- this will help a little bit.The rooms themselves are ok, but not what you'd expect from a luxury hotel. In some rooms the phones have a bad connection, the electrical socket on the lamp is broken and I've had to have someone come up to fix the tv twice (a nice and friendy fellow).If I had the choice, I would not stay here.

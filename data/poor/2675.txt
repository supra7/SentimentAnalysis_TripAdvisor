What a disappointment! After reading the Small Luxury Hotels recommendation, along with Conde Nast referral, we were shocked to be given the most 'tiny' room, #15, with shabby bed linens, dirty upholstery, and the room was so musty that they had brought in a dehumidifier!!! When we complained, we were told that our internet rate of only $150 didn't allow us to upgrade!!! Parking was an additional $25!!! The Soniat did not even provide coffee!! (But they wanted to charge an additional $25 for coffee, juice and biscuits!) We walked to Cafe DuMonde and enjoyed ourselves nonetheless. We will not ever recommend this property, nor stay here again. The owner, 'Miss Francis', by the way, is the mother-in-law of the Chef at Gautreau's, so if you ask for assistance, this is where you are funneled! The overall attitude here was rude unfortunately. Not a good experience. Next time we'll go to the Fairmont, or a small, more friendly property such as the Bienville House. This wasn't a good experience.

I stayed here for one night, and it was awful. The occupants in the room above mine were walking around and the floors are so thin that you can literally hear everything, amplified. Every step is roaring creak and anything that moves makes so much noise in your room. The bedroom doors don't fit the frames properly, so a florescent glow comes through the openings and stops you ever getting real darkness. THe toilet was running water, unflushable, the guy from reception took of the cover and we had to use it by jiggling with the mechanics of the flush. Between the noise, the light, and the sound of another room's toilet which must also have been running, I couldn't sleep all night. it's cheap, yes, but what's the point if you don't get any sleep out of your stay? I don't mind basic, but this was awful. Never again.

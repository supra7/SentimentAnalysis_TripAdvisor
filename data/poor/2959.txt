Where to begin... -Tiny but trendy room -Room overlooked the car park at the back. The people parking the cars honk the horns of the cars as they drive up each level. A lovely sound at 8am!! -After checking out, we joined the hotel taxi queue out front. There was one couple in front of us and the doorman was in the street talking to a cab driver so we assumed he was getting that cab to take the couple in front. He was taking some time and we were in a rush to catch a plane, so we walked a few yards ahead and saw a free cab which we hailed. The cab driver was putting our luggage into the boot when the hotel doorman came shouting at us that we had jumped the queue, called us bad mannered and started taking our luggage out of the cab boot. The couple waiting were signalling that it was ok for us to keep the cab but the doorman was having none of it. The result was that the cab driver drove off and we were left standing with our luggage in the street. We then screamed back at the doorman who got us another cab. I have not returned to NY since as this is my lasting memory of W Hotels and NY - what great service - NOT!

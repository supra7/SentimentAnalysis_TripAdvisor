I didn't stay at this hotel but I passed through here to check it out. I met up with some friends here and a VERY RUDE employee of Encore just blatantly yelled at us, "MOVE IT! YOU CAN'T STAND HERE" WOW seriously!? This experience represented your property terribly. Why would you hire such rude employees in the hotel business?! What ever happened to "customers first" in the hospitality industry?! There's a much more appropriate way to tell people that they can't stand somewhere, Encore and that is "Excuse me miss, sorry but people aren't allowed to stand here because ____." I was seriously so shocked I didn't know how to react to that employee. A bit of advice Encore, work on customer service if you want to be top in the hospitality industry. Highly doubt I would ever want to stay at this hotel.

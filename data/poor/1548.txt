I reserved this hotel via Hotwire. I ultimately had to demand a refund from Hotwire after only about three hours at this hotel, and I checked out and reserved at another hotel. The Internet service didn't work -- and the front desk clerk didn't seem to think that it was her issue to deal with. "I don't fix the Internet," she told me. I asked to speak with her manager, and it took him more than 2.5 hours to call back. The room and the hotel hallways have an old attic smell about them, and the entire hotel is a bit dated. I wouldn't stay here or recommend it unless you're on a shoestring budget and it's the only option.

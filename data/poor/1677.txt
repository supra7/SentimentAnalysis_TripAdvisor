Don't Even Bother We were really excited to come to stay at the Lexington because they were supposed to be really great, at least according to their website. We had even planned on staying in the one in Houston while we built our house. Those plans changed when we saw the place. The first room we got was a smoking room (even though we asked for a non-smoking room). It was filthy. There were cigarette burns in the carpet and something black all over the fridge. We wanted to go to a different hotel but they said that since we were in the room we would be charged, even though we basically walked in and walked out. They did move us to a non smoking room. It still had burns in the carpet but at least it did not smell like stale cigarettes. There were holes in the bedspread and the carpet was dirty. I wouldn't let my kids walk around bare footed. One of the kids was going to sleep on the pull out bed but we were told that we were not to use it because some little girl had broken her arm on it. They gave us one sheet and one blanket for two kids. They didn't even have any pillows! I've stayed in some really lousy hotels before but this one takes the cake. When we complained to the manager their idea of compensation was $10. Actually, that was about all that it was worth.

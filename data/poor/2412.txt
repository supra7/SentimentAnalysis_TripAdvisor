This hotel is terrible. Save your time and money, stay away from the Rtiz in Maui. My husband and I wanted to plan a romantic getaway for our anniversary..we immediately thought of the Ritz. We hadn't been to this particular Ritz, but we had stayed at others in California. We were shocked. Check-in was painfully slow, very strange considering we were the only people checking in. Then there is the room, or should I say rooms. The first room we were given was dirty, the sheets were stained. I understand the hotel is dated and needs renovation, but there is a difference between dirty and dated. We asked to change rooms. An hour later, we were in a room that smelled of urine. We again found ourselves waiting, this time for an hour and a half. The third room had terrible stains on the carpeting. We asked to cancel our reservations. Of course, this took another hour. This hotel is not a Ritz, it's not even a Ramada, it's more like a Motel. I will say this, the grounds are beautiful...Too bad the rooms and staff need to be changed. If you are planning a trip to Maui, stay at the Sheraton.

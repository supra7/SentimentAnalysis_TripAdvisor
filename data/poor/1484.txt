The reviews on Trip Advisor generally seemed positive - a nice lodge style hotel in a semi rural setting. Overall I was disappointed with my experience. I turned up at about 7am as my flight from NZ landed very early (about 5:30am). The lady on the front desk gave me a look of "what are you doing here?" when I showed up hot and sweaty with my luggage. Not welcoming at all. Being jet lagged I tried to get some sleep in the morning but this was difficult as the cleaners are extremely noisy. They seemed to spend all their time yelling at each other (including a man, perhaps the overall boss of the cleaning and housekeeping staff, who kept on saying "now listen to me, this is how should be doing it" very loudly!). My room was very basic, you might even say budget. The breakfast was very very average. I expected a nice retreat. I got a very basic hotel, with noisy housekeeping staff, which is in the middle of nowhere and awkward to get to.

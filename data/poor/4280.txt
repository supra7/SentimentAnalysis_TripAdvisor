Do Not Stay Here. Staff is terribly rude, rooms are small and ugly, pool is very small. Had to have the door between my room and the room next door fixed because they didn't lock. The tub would not drain when taking a shower, never did get that fixed. They charged us $5.00 for opening the frigerator, which I found out later by my Wife that there was nothing even in it. No coffee pot in the room and no free Wi-Fi. This is in my opinon the worst hotel on the strip and I have stayed at four of them so far. The staff alone is reason enough not to stay. I actually had a manager that didn't even acknowledge me while at the information desk and the old lady at the information desk was so rude and seemed to not even care about the issues I had. I can not believe the experience I had at this hotel.

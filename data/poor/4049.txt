I booked 3 nights at Hotel Blake for my friends through Expedia website. The charge was on my credit card. However three days after my friend left Hotel Blake, he found his credit card was also charged with same amount. Nobody contacted him or me for this mistake which cost him around extra $600 USD. My friend and I went to Hotel Blake receiption for explanation, the staff was soooo rude and impatient. His name is Chris. He made the mistake and even teased us by saying: Wow, you really need this $600 dollars, poor you! We got really angry. I tried to talk with Hotel Blake's manager, but they were helpless. They asked me to deal with Chris only because it was him who did this mistake. My friend and I were really really disappointed. We will NEVER book Hotel Blake again! Wish all travelers to be careful of your bills when checking out!!

This was THE worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my entire life. I was on a trip with a few friends from work during Chicago's WONDERFUL St. Patrick's Day festivies. However, the Hotel Blake put a major damper on one of the best times I had in Chicago. Note: We called the morning the day we were to check in to inform the hotel that we would be arriving very late. However, one of my co-workers had a confirmation number and they assured us that this was not a problem. WRONG! We had a group of 4 men and 3 women and booked enough rooms to accomidate for this. When we arrived at the hotel at approximately 11:00pm, we were informed that there were NO ROOMS AVAILABLE. We were all in disbelief that this could even happen! We told the woman helping us who we had spoken to, and she said that she had already left for the day. To say the least we were all furious! After about 1 hour of complaining they handed us 2 key cards. We ended up with 2 rooms each with only ONE KING SIZED BED!!! They did not offer to move us to a different room when available, but made us simply "make due" with what they had given us, or lose out on our money. A refund was out of the question to them. Not only did our rooms not accomidate us, but down the hall there was a MASSIVE water pool (perhaps from bathtub leakage above). The water remained there for the 3 nights we stayed there. Nobody ever came to clean it up, and the housekeeping attendance mearly "worked around it." They were very rude to us when we checked out, literally throwing our paper receipts to us. They said nothing about inconveniencing us, no apologies were made, no discounts were given. I found only 2 good things about this hotel: 1. The decor was very pretty 2. There's a Starbucks on the corner (but you could have that at just about any hotel in Chicago!!!) SIDE NOTE: Personally, my family is a stickler for things being AAA recommended -- this hotel was NOT! NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!

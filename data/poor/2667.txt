Im a New Orleans local and have traveled all over the world. I have never experienced such disrespect until my visit to the Soniat House. I knew that this was a beautiful hotel. I went to visit the hotel to use as a possible location for my wedding. I'm getting married in the quarter and need a get ready / honeymoon set of rooms. The Soniat House is one block from my wedding venue. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely rude to me. He made fun of the way I pronounced something. He told me I could view the hotel suite through the Internet, not in person. He made me feel small and unimportant. Yes, this is a beautiful hotel - but I recomend spending your hard earned money at a place where they appreciate all patrons. This hotel charges entirely too much money to treat people with such disdain and disrespect. Please utilize a hotel that has more gracious hosts.

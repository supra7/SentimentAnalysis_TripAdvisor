Just returned from a week at the Whaler. Before renting this property people should be aware that the pool is way too small to accommodate everyone. The garage is full of water, huge puddles. The overhead beams are cracking and falling down. Most of the units are in sad repair. Very dated. The only positive thing about the Whaler is its location. Fortunately we had friends at the Sheraton and we were able to use their pool. Never did go into the Whaler pool. Too crowded. Very overpriced. I would never go back.

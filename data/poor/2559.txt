36-42 Norfolk Square, London W2 1RT is the location for an establishment calling itself the Continental Hotel. Don't even think about staying there. The hotel should be closed down by the health and food safety people. The place is filthy dirty with excrement encrusted toilets. The rooms are undecorated, the walls and carpets are filthy. water cascades from above (yes cascade not just drip) when the people above use the shower. Hot water is strictly rationed, extra charges are made for the loan of an extremly small hand towel. There is much evidence of shoddy unfinished building works everywhere. The breakfast is a joke prepared by obviously unqualified staff. How on earth they manage to cock up tea/coffee and toast (thats what the advertised breakfast is) is beyond me but they manage to regularly serve cold coffee and rock hard or pale toast, the concept of toasting bread is beyond their comprehension. The Staff on reception are pleasant enough spending all their time fending off complaints, The catering and cleaning staff have no understanding of either catering or cleaning and some of them become abusive to customers who have the courage to complain. Fire doors are regularly propped open ("because it is easier to work that way"). The place should be shut down it is a health and safety hazard and is creating a very bad impression of the UK for visitors arriving at Paddington station.

Found a great deal and reserved 3 rooms (3 separate reservations) for christmas night through travelocity. Stood in front of the front desk for 3 hours because they only found 1 of the 3 reservations, which all have confirmation numbers and were made within minutes of each other. No explanation of what happened. Poor customer service, both the staff and the manager are not helping. No meals/coupons, whatsoever. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E. The only great things about Harrah's are its great deals and its location. But as you can tell from my experience, the great deals may not be all that great, especially if it happens to be on a busy day.

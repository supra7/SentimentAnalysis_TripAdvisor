Noisy! The Andrews Hotel was not as advertised, but I guess you get what you pay for. Parking was a problem and not because there is only a valet service. There are parking zones in front of the hotel that shares the block with two other hotels and a laundromat. At times there were a number of patrons in the street using the few parking spots. Inside the hotel itself the walls are rather thin making it quite noisy later in the evening and early in the morning. The hotel staff seemed aloof and the management was sparcely available. I highly recommend spending $30 eleswhere in Union Square that has parking and cleaner rooms.

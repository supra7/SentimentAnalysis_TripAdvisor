I stayed at the Fairmont during my recent 3 week stay in the US. The Fairmont's carpet and furnishings are pretty knocked around, and the shower cubicle in particular was revolting - ancient tiles which were starting to come loose. The room also wasn't particularly clean. The foyer area is looking pretty dated. The whole hotel needs major reburbishment. I certainly wouldn't stay there again.

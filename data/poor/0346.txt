As a surprise holiday gift our daughter booked and paid for our stay at the Westin based on it's reputation, location & referrals thinking she was treating us to high end comfort and relaxation. What a disappointment for her, and for us, when she saw how "shabby" the rooms were for what she paid (over $200/night); worn out carpeting, & stale cigarette odors, inpatient employees. Even though our daughter lives part time in Seattle, we checked with the concierge for some tips, he made us feel like we were taking up his time. The cafe was only option for breakfast where we were treated rudely and inappropriately. On our final day we had no hot water for our showers, at 10:00 a.m.! These complaints were voiced to uncaring ears. At this cost of the room, or any cost, there is really no excuse for this type of experience.

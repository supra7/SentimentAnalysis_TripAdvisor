The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. The location is very convenient to the CTA lines & some key attractions. Other than that, there is NOTHING to offer. There are way better hotels within a few blocks of this hotel. My biggest complaint is about the internet or lack thereof. The fact that internet is not free (even in the lobby or the Starbucks downstairs) is unacceptable. In my experience having had wonderful past stays across the country at IHG, Kimpton, StarWood Hotels (for example), finding out that the internet in this hotel was not complementary & that there was no wifi even in the lobby in the hotel was unacceptable to me. Some more unpleasant surprises were that the use of the business center or fitness center were also not complementary, but in fact completely overpriced. I found this hotel to be a rip off which NICKELED & DIMED for everything. in principal I was against paying for these things which are free in every other hotel in my past experience, not to mention necessary for business travelers. I called a few hotels nearby, including The Kimpton because I was planning on switching hotels & confirmed that they not only offer free wifi, but also a free fitness center, free Starbucks coffee in the lobby and a free wine & cheese every evening in the lobby. I will be taking my business there in the future.

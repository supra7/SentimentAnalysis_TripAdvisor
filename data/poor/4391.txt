booked a suite at the stratosphere, based on internet reviews and pictures... rate was great so i guess beggers cant be choosers, but room was straight out of a bad B gangster movie, the smell was terrible, and the view... on the parking lot despite being on the 18th floor. beware when you prepay on line, they still hit you with a tourism tax upon arrival... we checked out, now at the Terrible's clean, cheap and super friendly!. one more thing, the restaurent on the top of the tower is way over rated and hyper expensive. 180 USD for 2 for your basic meat and potatoes and a couple of glasses of wine.... view is great, but you get the same with a cocktail at the lounge.... oh, and also wifi access is 11USD... free at the terrible's...

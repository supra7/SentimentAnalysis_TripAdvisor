Awful awful awful Place smells, ceiling has large cracks and holes, caving wallboard, rust spots, moldy stains. Bathroom toilet hadn't been cleaned for years, had black stripes in it, I asked for sheets to be changed, they were dirty. I was afraid to get under the covers the first night. We had items stolen from our room, lizards were crawling in the room because the doors didn't really close properly. Entire facility had large holes in ceilings, dirt everywhere. Our room was carpeted, someone came in with a handmade broom and made some cursory sweeps with it; I don't they they have vacuums, you can imagine what's living in those carpets. Bathroom mirror is clouded and impossible to see (which may be a blessing). Large crack in outside bathroom floor running across the tile on the floor. all bathrooms are outside. Has a nice size pool; tiles are loose, some missing. Chairs by pool have nails sticking out, in complete disrepair, two cushions for 4 chairs with heavy staining. I will never forgive my travel agent for putting me in this dump when there are so many options available.

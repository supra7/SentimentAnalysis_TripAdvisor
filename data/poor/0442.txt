I deserved it because I had the chance to read many bad reviews about this place... the factor was the price, but the place is not that cheap either, for what you have to go through. Just few facts: We arrived there to find out we had no reservation (?!?). Many minutes later, the reservation "re-appeared". Not sure what happeded. Next morning, we wanted to have breakfast (included) but only some apples, bread and muffins were served. I asked one guy at the frontdesk about butter but he responded: "no butter, no"... I guess he doesn't speak English. Later, at 11:00 we got a phone call from frontdesk "Hey, you staying? if not, checkout, 11:00 o'clock, bye" -- hehe, wow. And it doesn't end there, 'cause 10 min later one guy knocked the door and walked in when I opended... hahaha... wow! my girldfriend was so upset she got into the bathroom to avoid the guy. the guy checked for the TV remote, check on the fridge and even look over the sheets of the bed (can you believe it? and we were still there!!) So, if you are staying in Downton Seattle, I recommend going to The Moore (european style, but closer to downtown) or pay a few more bucks and stay at the Travelers Inn or Days Inn, not this pseudo-hotel... you don't deserve this.

Horrible and unsafe Hotel for any Price I ended up in this hotel for 2 days as I had booked thru Priceline. Based on my experience, I will never book a hotel thru priceline again.I had requested a ground floor room 2 weeks before going to the hotel and was confirmed one over the phone. However when we reached over there, we were given only 1 king bed room instead of 2 queen bed room and that also on the second floor. The Front deks was totally unresponsive.As soon as we reached the second floor, the odor was overpowering in the corridor and the room. They have a central A/c and Heat and you cant select it. They had heat turned on even though it wasnt very cold. Since we turned the heat off, there was no air circulation in the room. When I checked the window, there was no safety latch and any body could open it from outside. The front desk offered to change the room but the 2nd room was even worse. There is no internet in the room, no microwave(I requested for it multiple times as my child was sick), no refrigerator, no complimentary breakfast. Worst thing is that the management is aware of all the shortcomings but dont give a damn about it. To top all this, they had a wedding ceremony in the hotel and the noise from the dance floor kept us up all night. Next morning, we noticed flies coming out of the air vent. That was it. We immediately checked out of the hotel even though we were booked for 2 days. Moved to the ramada Inn near by which was way better with no issues.

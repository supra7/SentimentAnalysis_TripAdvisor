Not a great start to this visit. When we arrived to check in ( at the time we were told to when booking the room ) and our room wasn't ready. The guy at check in was very nice so not too big of a deal. We wasted an hour or so and finally were able to check in. Once we got to our room we were very disappointed. The room was nothing as described during the booking process. The room was very small, smelled bad, and the view sucks. Not to mention the disgusting stain my wife found as she turned back the covers on the bed, don't wan to even think about where that stain came from... I called the front desk to complain and was told I would have to come down and speak to a manager, which I did. The manager took care of the issue and put us in a suite that closer resembled the room description given during the booking process. SO everything is "all good" right....Not for long...I decided to walk to the circle K for cigarettes and on the way back was bombarded by guys trying to sell fake drugs to tourists...After politley denying all these guys a guy comes up to bum a smoke, which he saw me purchase and as I pulled them from my pocket $40 fell outta my poket and faster than I could even blink this black guy came out of nowhere and grabbed the money and ran like he was running from the police. I tried to chase him, but he went to a dark alley, and let's face it $40 just isn't worth my life. Will I return to Vegas, you bet....Will I return to the Stratosphere? HELL NO!!! Stay away from this side of the strip, very bad vibes, very shady people everywhere... Do not let money fall out of your pocket, you will get ROBBED!!! Lesson learned!

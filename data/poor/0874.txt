I have never written a negative hotel review in my life but my recent experience at the Trump hotel Las Vegas was hands down the absolute worst hotel experience I've ever had. We checked in late Friday night after driving from Southern California. Upon arrival we received great service and the check in was quick. However, once I returned later that night, I found that I was locked out of my room. I returned to the front desk and was told I was locked out because we had brought our dogs. I said I posted that I wanted a dog room on my Expedia reservations as I had on prior occasions (we always travel with our two small well-behaved dogs). I asked to speak to a manager as locking patrons out of their room in the middle of the night is completely unacceptable. Apparently the extremely rude front desk associate was the manager. I told the management that I wanted to get back into my room but she literally would not reactivate my key. I was upset so walked out of the hotel to call my brother/lawyer who had just dropped me off to come help me get into my room because she wouldn't allow me in. Needless to say, after about 45 minutes of negotiating at 5 in the morning, we were finally begrudgingly allowed back in.

We decided to stay here since we were bringing children. We have always stayed at the four season but thought the children would enjoy the hotel. We didn't expect the same service or accommodations. However, we were shocked that the hotel reminded us of a motel 6. The food was horrible. The pool and beach was a nightmare. The system to get a chair on the beach was exhausting. Go get a wrist band, wait in another line to get a piece of paper to get in another line to get a chair set up on the beach. The whole process took about an hour each day. The beach was so crowded it was ridiculous. The rooms were old and dated. We were in a handicap room which left us half of a normal closet size so I never took anything out of the suitcase. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The kids love the beach and really didn't care that much about the slides after they went down a few times. i can highly recommend the four season please don't make the same mistake we did.

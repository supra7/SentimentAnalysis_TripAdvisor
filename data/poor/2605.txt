I was completely satisfied with my stay at the Intercontinental until one month later, when I received a red light camera violation at the corner of Poydras St. and Carondelet St., an intersection one block from the hotel. I'm sure I'm not the first to receive this additional $125 fee compliments of thier fine valet service. Unfortunately, as an out of town visitor, it's cheaper to pay the fee than appear for my court hearing to protest. I'm currently "working" with Intercontinental to get reimbursement for the traffic violation. I contacted Intercontinental immediately after learning of the violation, and they mysteriously did not have record of my stay. I'm sure the record will appear when I appeal the credit card charge. FYI, every car that uses the valet service will be driven through this camera monitored intersection by a valet driver. Valet is mandatory at the hotel, as there is no option for a parking garage or public parking in the vicinity. The camera angles do not clearly show the driver, just the car and license plate. Therefore, proving that it wasn't me behind the wheel may be impossible. Budget an additional $125 for traffic violations if you choose to stay here.

i chose this hotel because its good location and very cheap. so even some of the reviews were bad, i would still like to give a try. however, after this experience, i will always trust review. we stayed there for4 days. room is small and old, but it looks clean. however, the fisrt night, we found lots of bed bugs on our bed. we were so scared and could not sleep. when we talked to hotel staff about the bed bugs, she was not suprise and care about it. her reaction looked like this is a very usual thing. after changed the room, the were no bugs, but we were so scared so still could not sleep well that night. then in the next day morning at 8:30am, someone came to fix the room and made a lot of noise next to out room, so we sould not sleep anymore. this happened following next 3 days morning. we were travelers and eveny night we came back hotel at midnight and tired. then at 8:30 every morning we woke up by the loudly noise next to our room. the hotel does not care about customer feeling. next time i will spend more money to stay a better hotel. please do not stay in this hotel even it is cheap, but it is the worse hotel i have never been

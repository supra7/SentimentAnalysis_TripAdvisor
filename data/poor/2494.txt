I've stayed in some pretty questionable hotels before, but this one might take the cake. My brother and I stayed at this hotel mainly due to the location. The hotel was difficult to find due to the Airport being under construction. We circled the terminal a good 2-3 times before finally getting into the parking lot of the hotel. You could see the hotel, just couldn't get in. The check in process took a long time (30 minutes +) considering I had the confimation numbers. They couldn't find my reservation, even though I had made it online (through Regency) days before. When we got to the room I immediately noticed that the door to the room had been kicked in at one point. The deadbolt wouldn't lock and the swing lock was completely missing. The peephole had also been filled with kleenex since that was also missing. There were sleep number beds in the room, both of which were broken. The bathroom door had also been kicked in and wouldn't latch closed. There was mold on the walls and in the hallways around the elevator. We also had no hot water for showers in the morning. Most disturbing was the presence of what appeared to be prostitutes in the lobby (12:30am). I'm 9 months pregnant, had I not been staying here with my brother I would have left and found a different hotel. Something else worth mentioning. The Memphis airport is the main hub for FedEx flights, which leave between 10pm and 5am. If you're staying here bring ear plugs.

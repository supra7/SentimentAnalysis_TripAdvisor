This place is bad, bad, bad. It is extremely overpriced for what you get. I had an 8th floor room facing Interstate 8. Good luck getting any sleep. Shame on you Doubletree, how can you justify charging top dollar for a room on the freeway side? You should provide earplugs for guests that are subjected to this horrendous noise. In addition, apparently their restaurant never got the word that there was an issue with serving fresh spinach. I completely lost my desire to finish my meal. When this was pointed out to the server, the cost of the meal was removed from my bill. The service in the bar was extremely poor. There is no other choice for dinner. You may want to eat elsewhere or face going hungry. Overall this experience doesnt even deserve to rate below average. If you dont need to stay here dont. A host of other better and less expensive lodging choices abound in San Diego. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. I will next time.

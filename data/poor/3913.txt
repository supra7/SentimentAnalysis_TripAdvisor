We have just returned from a 7 nights stay at the Sheraton. We are frequent travellers to Hawaii going to different islands and this is our 3rd visit to Maui. We have stayed at the Hyatt, Marriott Ocean Club, and the Kannapali Beach Club and thought we would give Sheraton a try because of Black Rock snorkelling. Boy, are we so diasppointed! This is the 1st ever Hawaii vacation where we experienced absolute no Aloha spirit. Upon arrival, we were being moved back and forth 3 times between the bell hop and the front desk just to check in. The front desk told us we will be welcomed by the bell hop with leis but there was none. We were really surprised that there was no music in the lobby, no flower center pieces like the other hotels we have stayed before, no friendly smiles, and staff were not at all interested to help. It is like we were left to find our own way to our room with absolute zero service. It was such a let down! The room we were given had an air con vent issue which the front desk could not resolved but they were decent enough to assign us to another room. The room was drape and old, definitedly needs updating and better decor. The swimming pool had algae growing on the sides of the black rocks and there was a musky smell. This is also the first time where we noticed that the garden ponds had no fishes throughout except for some tadpoles and 4 small koi fishes. It was very disappointing as we are so used to seeing beautiful botanicals and koi fishes swimming everywhere in the ponds. Would definitedly not come back even if it is free. This is a 4 star hotel but feels like a 1.5 star. I would highly recommend staying at the Hyatt, Marriott or Westin which is also on the same stretch of Kannapali beach.

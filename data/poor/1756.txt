My friends and I stayed at the senator apartments, which is owned by the Royalton hotel for beach week and we weren't expecting much due to the fairly cheap price we had to pay. The hotel has a strict policy about checking in early and the front desk lady was SO RUDE about it! So my friends and I had to wait until 3pm to check in because supposedly they had to prepare and make sure everything was cleaned for us. When we checked in and entered the apartment, it was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!! They made us wait that long and it wasn't even clean AT ALL! The bathtub had mold all over it, the beds were bedbug infested, the sink was clogged, the couches smelled like smoke, the refrigerator and oven were dirty and stained, and there were flies flying around everywhere!!! There was also a throw up scent that never went away during our stay no matter how much air freshener we used. We SPENT THE NEXT 2 HOURS cleaning the place before we could even relax. It was TERRIBLE. We couldn't even enjoy our first day there with all the waiting and cleaning! The WORST part was that the apartment looked like it could fall apart very quickly!!! The only thing that got us through the week was the entertainment that Ocean City had to offer. We were rarely in the apartment. So I leave it as a WARNING. If you love to clean during your vacation for an entire day just to make the place livable, then this is the place for you. If you would actually like to enjoy your vacation, DO NOT under any circumstances stay at the SENATOR APARTMENTS owned by the Royalton hotel!!!!! It is not worth your money, no matter how little you pay. I suggest you spend a little more staying in the Burgundy Inn if you're vacationing with a group of friends. We truly regret not putting in extra just to stay there.

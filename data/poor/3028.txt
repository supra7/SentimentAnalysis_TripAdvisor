We booked and paid in advance through Expedia. On arrival at 9pm, we were informed that they were overbooked and had no available rooms. There was a second customer being told the same. We were given a room at the Ramada, which is clearly lower cost and standard. No refund offered or given. Reception staff were very aloof and very slow.

Am and have been a Starwood member for a few years. Sheets were horrible, hav ent experienced something like that since the 80s. Pillow wz honestly worse. Hate to say the sevice was equal. Dear friend with us had flown in her wedding cake, we checked it in with app 10hrs til the celebration. The hotel not only crushed the beautiful cake but didn't offer any more than we're sorry. Very Sad!

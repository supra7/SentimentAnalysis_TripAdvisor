At night you have thugs in the courtyard LOUD, yelling & arguing very threatening and intimidating. The security guard will walk thru and acts like he is afraid of them! I am afraid to go get something out of my car at night. You sign a form agreeing to a 9pm curfew but these gangster types, thugs and prostitutes hang out on the grounds and are very loud and obnoxious. This is the scariest hotel I have ever stayed in and I have traveled a bit for work I am not on the first floor and can hear the yelling over my television-its THAT bad. I can't imagine staying here with children. This place tells you the office is open 24 hours a day and they have good security-NOT. Tried calling the office tonight-no answer, walked down there and it is closed. The thugs have the place until daylight. I am going to offer the courtesy of a warning to fellow travelers- I wish someone had warned me!!! Leaving to tomorrow and no they do not refund-no security no refund. I will walk away from the money my safety is worth more than that.

After reading the divergent reviews of the Inn at Queen Anne, I decided to take a chance and make a two-day reservation for my nephew and myself as part of a one-week trip to Seattle and Oregon. I have been to Seattle many times on business and/or personal trips as I love the city and it's many offerings. The Queen Anne neighborhood is adjacent to the Seattle Center about a dozen blocks North of the Central Business District in an eclectic neighborhood. This is about the only good thing I can say about the property. Seattle is experiencing record heat and only half the rooms have air conditioning. Not only did we not have an air conditioned room but the celiing fan must have been over 10 years and worked about as well. Furniture was sparse as were the beds. The kitchenette was a 15 year old eyesore with possibly the first microwave ever made with a dial timer. The bathroom was small but clean and furnished with nice amenities such as unique soaps and lotions. However, the showerhead was literally installed at five feet (chest level for any normal size person). Breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, muffins and pastry with no fruit or cererals. After one steamy night even with all the windows open, my nephew wanted to go to an air-conditioned with wi-fi internet to finish a summer college course he was taking. My nephew who is a US Marine just returned from a seven month tour of duty in Iraq's Al Anbar Province said he would have rather stayed in his Ramadi barracks (which were air conditioned) than this hotel. As a world traveler, I agreed and we checked out.

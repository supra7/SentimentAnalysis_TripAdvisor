After extensive research and such high recommendations, my fiancee and I booked this resort 5 months in advance. We planned to stay from Feb 22 through Feb 27, 2009 for our honeymoon. One week before we were supposed to depart for our magical trip to relax and have fun, our travel agent notified us that the resort booked a wedding party which was allowed to bring 10 kids on the "adults only" resort for two of the 5 days we were to be there. We decided to tough it out and keep what we dreamed of in spite of the inconvenience and not receiving what we paid for and were promised. Three days before our wedding and departure for the resort, our travel agent contacted us again and said that there would now be over 25 kids on this small "adults only" resort for three of our five days. We decided that there was no way we could allow this to happen to us. The resort refused to provide any concessions for our inconvenience stating that the resort was completely booked. Apparently, the people allowed to book the wedding and have kids on the "adults only" resort took precedent over all other previous reservations. Luckily, we had booked everything through a travel agency and they went above and beyond to arrange a last minute change in resorts with very significant upgrades. Thanks to those hard working agents, we had a wonderful honeymoon at the Excellence Riviera Cancun. I would highly recommend anyone going to the Excellence Riviera Cancun any day and avoid the El Dorado Maroma at all costs. EDM is nothing but trouble and will do anything to inconvenience anyone as long as they get paid by some well-to-do people who want to buy the resort out. One final note, we really did not want to give the EDM a one-star rating here. We actually wanted to give them a zero-star rating for their failure to live up to their promises and attitude given to guests who were inconvenienced.

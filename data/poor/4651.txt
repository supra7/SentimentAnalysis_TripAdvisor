This Hotel is run by a couple of scam artists. Charged 4 times the normal rate during Mardigras week, and then had the audacity to charge another $25.00 for their garage parking (They dont have a garage, just a vacant area across from the hotel..Was told when I booked that parking was free, and then saw online that it was 15.00 per day, but then charged when I arrived at $25.00 per day due to a "special event"..Complaints did no good, the old man at the desk basically said pay it or dont park. breakfast was poor, cold, toast and coffee only...Stale bread is quite a treat 1st thing in the am!. The room was dirty, floors never vacummed during our stay, and had to ask for clean linens when we arrived as the bed still had used sheets on it--extreemely gross....Customer service is not here for sure..Take our advice and stay away from this one..Better rooms are avail up on Royal and canal streets..

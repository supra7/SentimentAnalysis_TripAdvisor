It was one of the most dirtest placest I have ever stayed in . The room smelled like wet clothes left in a washer. The floor wasnt vacumned. The curtains smelled worse than the bathroom. They only change sheets when asked. The hallways look like they have never been cleaned. It needs a total re-haul. The pool is disgusting. The game smelled like chemicals. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY, we checked out early and couldnt wait to get a shower and washed all our clothes whether we wore them or not!! YUK YUK YUK

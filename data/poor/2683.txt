Front door slammed constantly (actually shaking the bed/building/room) from about 4 AM on. No sleep for these travelers. There were also all sorts of truck noises on street outside window (room 200 faces the front) THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. No sleep despite our "white noise machine". No hot water in sink so had to wash face in cold water. Dust bunnies on wall next to heater. Mattresses was comfortable though, even if we couldn't sleep. My husband researched for a long time to find a suite. It was our 20th anniversary celebration. He finally settled on the Frenchmen when he was promised (and prepaid) for the King suite. Upon check-in, we were told that the heater was broken in the King suite and that we would be given a room on the front by the street. The staff was friendly, though, and we had free wifi .... it's just that you pay for a hotel to sleep. If only for a few hours.

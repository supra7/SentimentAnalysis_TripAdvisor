OK let's start: -the worst hotel I have been to since I am a member of tripadvisor and I review only half of the hotel I visit. -70's like room with stainy carpet. -Turn on your A/C and you listen to an airplane's engine start. -Most of 2 stars motels on a freeway have better bathrooms. -Wonderful view on a busy and noisy motorway. -Almost not existent lobby and very sad indeed. -The evelator issue is far from been solved, so plan 5 minutes each way to go to breakfast (just OK). -Told me I didn't have breakfast included because the system was down, so I had to show the copy of my reservation. System down also when I l left and got the bill by email. I am a member of Priority Club but I swear that I will be very happy to give up some points next time, I mean, it's plenty of hotels in downtown Seattle....

I have been staying in this hotel from last 3 months.... the management of this place have been promising good internet facilities but it really really sucks ur life out...the net get disconnected very often.. if you are a working professional and have to work from home then not the right place to be...repeated complaints to management about poor service of internet falls on deaf years... The other facility in the hotel is good... i have not faced any other major issues...

The problem with Harrah's is the smokey casino. Almost everyone smokes. Everywhere. And to get to your room? You must go through the casino. It's unbelievable. Remember: 2 hours in a casino equals 6 months of second-hand smoke exposure. To risk your lungs to that smoke is a very bad health risk. Also, you have these illegal immigrants right outside Harrah's door trying to solicit everyone for call girls. They actually cut me with one of their cards - and they grinned sheepishly. If you must go to Las Vegas (and I can't think of any reason other than to gamble and 98% of all gamblers lose their money according to study after study), you should stay off the strip. Visit the Hoover dam if you must, but I would stay clear away from the casinos.

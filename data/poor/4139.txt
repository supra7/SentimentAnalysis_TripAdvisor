I made reservations for one night through (---). I prepaid and rec'd a confirmation notice from the WHITEHALL. After driving from Little Rock, AR to Chicago and arriving at 10pm to check in with my confirmation in hand, I was told by McKenzie at the Whitehall front desk that there was no room for my family. They had a guest extend their stay. She attempted to send us to a 2 star hotel down the street which we drove to in desperation, but wouldn't let my dog spend the night in the hotel she found for us. Therefore we drove back to the Whitehall, again told that there was no room for us, wouldn't refund our money which we pre paid and then she and the night time manager got very rude with us. We had to drive 3o minutes outside of Chicago to find another hotel, we checked in one finally about 1:30pm. The Whitehall staff does not care about the paying customer. I would not recommended staying there to my worst enemy. A good business person would have told the guest requesting a longer stay that there was a pre-paid customer checking in that evening and that the room was needed and they should find alternate lodging, NOT the person arriving at 10pm believing they had a room to stay in.

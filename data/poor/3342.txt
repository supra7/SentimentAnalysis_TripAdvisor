This is a dirty hotel. Rooms are tired and need remodeling. The unadvertised policy of not allowing outside alcohol in your room (you have to buy it there) is just greedy. I doubt it's legal either. Can you imagine the maids searching your room for a bottle of illegal beer? There are better places to spend your money in Ocean City.

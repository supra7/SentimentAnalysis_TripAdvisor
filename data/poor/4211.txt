I booked a room over a month in advance, through a travel website. When I arrived at the Se to check in, I was handed a letter, and told that I was staying in another hotel quite a distance away. They said that the travel website had overbooked them. I find it very hard to believe that when I made my reservation over a month prior that they had no availability, as my reservation was confirmed. I specifically booked at the Se for the location, on 5th near all entertainment and dining. I had plans to meet friends at a restaurant right down the street for dinner. The hotel I was redirected to did not have any restaurants open at night, and there were not any bars/nightclubs nearby. Basically it was near nothing in the way of dining/entertainment. So, we ended up having to pay for a cab to go out to dinner, when we could have just walked up the street if the Se had honored my reservation. The front desk people could not have been less concerned about the inconvenience that this switch caused me. The Se should not participate with outside booking sites if they do not plan to honor their commitment. Shady business in my opinion.

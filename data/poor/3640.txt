Will never stay there again I stayed at the Touchstone for two weeks in October 2003. The manager was very rude. You had to wait 30 minutes before the manager would come down from his room to help you. The hotel lobby is in darkness by nine pm and you have to use your key to get in. The rooms are very small and you have to use a plastic knife to turn the TV on. Some of the other guests looked like street people and drug pushers. This hotel should be rated -.05 instead of 3.

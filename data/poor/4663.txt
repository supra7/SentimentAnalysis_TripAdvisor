I have stayed in many place in New Orleans. This was the worst. The Avenue Plaza is in need of a renovation. The elevators are very slow. The staff is unfriendly to the point of rude. The room we stayed in was in bad shape. The kitchen was completely unuseable. The one good thing I can say is the location is great. Street Car away from the French Quarter and to uptown.

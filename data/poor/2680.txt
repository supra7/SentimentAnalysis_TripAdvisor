My wife an I booked this place based on a quick check on Tripadvisor, for a lay over on our way home from Texas. based on the overwhelming good reviews, and the fact that we wanted to stay close to Frenchmen St., we booked this hotel. Upon our arrival, it was obvious that what they show on their web page and what you get are two separate things. This place should be in the worst places in America to stay. It comes complete with cockroaches crawling on the floor. The place is old and not in very good repair. The room is so small that there is no chair or table in the room, so there is no where in the room to set down except on the bed. The mattress on the bed is soft and lumpy as are the pillows. The bathroom, once again is so small there is not even a counter to set anything down on. The floor in the bathroom and shower has been painted over in an attempt to cover up the mold, but the paint is peeling off exposing the mold under the paint. The air conditioner never did get the room comfortable, even though it ran all night. To top all this off, I received a call to come home early, as my elderly mother had gotten sick and had to be put in the hospital. When we informed them that we would be checking out the next morning, no mention was made that we would be charged the entire stay. The normal is that you can cancel with a days notice, which we gave them, but they say they have a 10 day cancel policy. Since I have returned, I have checked the other reviewers that have gave this place such glowing reviews. If you are considering booking this place, I suggest that you do the same before booking. This place needs to be put out of business. It is a health hazard, as well as practicing unethical business practices. If you would like to see actual photos of the rooms, email me and I will send them to you.

I got at room so small that if you walked in ju had to go backwards to get out. Mt company had booked a doubble room for me. Water from the toilet ran out in the room, the telefon didn't work and the heating didn't work. The hotel brought a electric fan but the cleaning lady turned it of. When you walked in the corridor there was a big hole under the carpet. And its an axpensive hotel as well. DONT SELECT THIS HOTEL

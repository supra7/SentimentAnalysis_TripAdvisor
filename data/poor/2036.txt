This hotel was not what I had expected. When you enter the lobby it is not bad but avoid going into your room. The room had a very strong odor coming from the hall and the room was horrible. The doors in the whole room were cracked and rusted. The bathroom had many problems as well, there was gum on the floor and there was a ton of mold. If you take a shower it will take an hour just to rinse off the soap. The water preesure was very low and the shower head looked like it was supposed to be in a motel than a four star hotel. The location is pretty good but other than that this hotel is not good.

This hotel is a complete mess. The rooms and the bathrooms are very small. The wc isn't very reliable. The room is and stays filthy. With your fresh towels you get long dark hairs for free. In some rooms the temperature is as high as in a sauna and it isn't possible to adjust the radiator. In all the rooms the streetnoise and the noise from the lounge are incredibly loud. Don't expect any sleep...and yes there is no lift. The management keeps that a secret.

We took this hotel only because our original hotel (Avon) decided to give away one of our rooms and tried to persuade us to share. We looked at one of our rooms and assumed that the other would be similar. How wrong can you be? The general appearance of the hotel was shabby, but clean. However, when we entered the second room late that evening (number 15, which was on the third floor) it was so tiny that the basin was in the room, leaving no space for either a wardrobe or a chest of drawers. The black and red carpet had more black than when it was made, the inside of the toilet was brown, the toilet seat was broken and the counterpane was covered in stains from top to bottom. When I went downstairs to complain, I was told that I should have looked earlier and offered No 17, which was on the fourth floor, but the receptionist could or would not tell me whether it was any bigger. "We've got 100 rooms. How do you expect me to know all of them!" was the helpful reply. Luckily, my son had been given a triple, so I slept in their room that night - I didn't fancy climbing four flights of stairs to find another pigsty. I was given a ground floor room the next day (different receptionist), which was at least clean. Don't hold out too much hope for the continental breakfast. It is toast and marmalade and either tea or coffee. However, I must point out that the breakfast room and what I could see of the kitchen were spotless and the girls there very pleasant. By the way, I have given this place one mark, but only because the form did not allow me to put none! The only saving grace was the price, but even that did not make up for the room and lack of service. The place needs gutting.

I stayed here for two nights in October 2011, and will never return. The noise from the streets is a major problem, and enough to keep you awake all night long. The wafer-thin windows desperately need addressing, and to make matters worse, the curtains didn't fully close - meaning that bright light was shining in all night long. In addition, the front desk staff were unfriendly and not welcoming in any way. This is way overpriced and not worth a moment's consideration.

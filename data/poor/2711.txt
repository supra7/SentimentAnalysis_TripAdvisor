Well, first let me say that we knew we'd get what we paid for as far as room size. It was extremely small, but at least it was clean. We usually stay at nice hotels but were trying to save money this time. We have learned our lesson though and will always pay more for a quality stay. Don't even think about making a complaint to the manager. Our air conditioner froze over and we had a miserable night's sleep and not only did not care or offer compensation - she made US feel stupid in front of a lobby full of people for not knowing how to "properly use a window unit." She was incredibly rude and we are currently going to the higher-ups to get this resolved. I'd pay more to stay somewhere where people actually care about their customers.

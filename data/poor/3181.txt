Overpriced with bad service Avoid this place at all cost. It is located in San Francisco's Tenderloin District, one of the worst crime ridden areas of the city. Don't believe the type about its fashion designed interior or its proximity to Union Square, it is not safe to walk around at night and the rooms are tiny and dirty. This place is nothing more than a glammed up residential hotel. Also, don't believe the positive reviews on this site which were undoubtedly posted by the management. You can find much nicer hotels at much more reasonable rate than this place.

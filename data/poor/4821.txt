2 and 1/2 Star Quality at Five Star Rates This establishment trades way too much on its location but pales badly compared to the Fairmont and couldn't come close to the Mandarin, Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons. We paid over $300 a night for a high floor corner room on a Club Floor with Golden Gate (barely) , Alcatraz and City views. The view windows are 2 old casement windows with not much view. The 'Club is in an old banquet room on the Lobby floor. The Club Floor is the same as the other floors-no secured access and no upgraded decor. The Club Floor room was badly decorated and just old. The bed linens were stained and dirty and we had them changed- but quite disgusting. There is no 24 hour room service as the night operator so rudely informed us. The staff was mixed...some were very accomodating, others were just putting in their time. The food was plain...heated mini-quiches and tiny heated frozen eggrolls were the stars of their evening food presentations in the Club lounge. Not even a How was your stay when we checked out- just a do you want to leave the charges on your card- NEXT! We stayed in this hotel a few years ago and its gotten worse, not better...sad to see. Overloaded with cruise ship tourists. We belong to Intercontinental's Ambassador's Gold Club but we won't be staying here again! Our advice? Stay at the Mandarin or Four Seasons..at least you'll get what you pay for!

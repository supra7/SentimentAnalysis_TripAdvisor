Be sure to check your car BEFORE turning it over to the valet parking and ask to see the resort half of the ticket. If they damage it, they merely mark the ticket to show pre-existing damage and there is nothing you can do. They never marked the ticket the ten times we parked there, EXCEPT WHEN THEY DAMAGED the right front panel. When we complained they showed us that the damage was marked on the ticket. Since you don't get a copy of the condition report, they are free to mark up the ticket after they damage it. Other than that, the rooms are average, the food is mediocre, many of the staff are dispirited since the bankruptcy filing. There is evidence of deferred maintenance. This property was acquired by the Blackstone Group, a $50 billion hedge fund at the height of the real estate bubble. They have taken the property through bankruptcy to reduce the enormous debt, but it seems they are out to milk every dollar they can from their guests before the property loses its cachet as a world class resort. If you want to spend $1000 a night in Wailea, try the Four Seasons next door where most of the guests at the Grand Wailea go for world class food (if you are going to spend $300 for dinner for two, it ought to better than mediocre). It's a beautiful resort and you ought to walk through it on your way to the Four Seasons next door.

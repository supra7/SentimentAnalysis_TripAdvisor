Worst place we ever stayed at Our hotel room at the Ambassador was shabby and run-down. The paint was peeling off the walls, the carpet was filthy, only a small bare light bulb over the sink in the bathroom. The TV did not work - all stations were nothing but snow. There was one station that one could see if you could see through the snow and the wavy white lines. We told the front office people twice about this and both times they promised that it would be fixed but it never was. Our wakeup call each morning was at 5 a.m. with the noise of delivery trucks, slamming of doors, and the annoying beep, beep, beep sound that trucks make when they back up. Just as we were about to go back to sleep, it would start all over again. We asked to be moved to an other room but they would not accomodate us. This was the worst place we have ever stayed at. We also had trouble with the parking key they gave us to get out of the parking lot - the one you insert that lifts the gate handle up. This happened three times that the gates would not open. We had to push the assistance buzzer. The third time it happened my husband pushed the assistance buzzer but no one would respond. I finally went inside the hotel where there were 4 people behind the desk but not one of them paid any attention to when we pushed the button for help.

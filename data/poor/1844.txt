The initial impression of this hotel was fantastic. Gorgeous lobby, location centered exactly between the two planned activities over the weekend, and a unique room set up. Two bathrooms was a plesant bonus. HOWEVER.... The air conditioner/heat didn't work and soaked the floor. Housekeeping didn't thoroughly clean the room. The Keurig had two used pods in it. The garbage had someone else's smelly socks in it. Don't want to think of what else might not have been cleaned. The staff was less than helpful and didn't apologize when issues were brought to their attention. No one offered assistance with the luggage. Valet told me it would be ten minutes to get my car. I gave them more than twenty and they still hadn't gotten my car. Overall the location of this hotel should place it in high demand but the staff, cleanliness, and overall experience are disappointing. The only low point to my entire trip to Boston was this hotel. Didn't bother to try for any amenities as they were ridiculously overpriced. Also if you'll notice management's responses to all the complaints on this site are the same. They aren't focused on the actual complaints. They are a copy and paste job. I've emailed the hotel directly with my complaints. We'll see what they say.

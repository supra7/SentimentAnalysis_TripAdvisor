We stayed here in July 2004. One of my worst hotel experiences ever! The walls are paper thin. We were awakened every morning by the people next door's alarm clock at 5:15am and the proceeded to hear every single word of their conversation as if they were in the same room as us. We could hear their phone ringing, knocking on their doors. We had a lovely view of a dirty alley way. The casino, because of it's age I'm assuming, reeked of smoke so bad that I couldn't wear my contact lenses downstairs. The bed was uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to leave so I could get a decent sleep! The pool was nice but closed way too early, but I think most hotels have pools that close early. The Carnival Court outside was fun though and seemed to get a good crowd and definitely Harrah's is centrally located. You get what you pay for....

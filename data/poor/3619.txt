Disgusting! We have never had a similar disgusting experience as we had recently in the Touchstone Hotel in San Francisco. After stopping the car, we were molested by a bum requesting money. Check in went ok, elevator was in a miserable condition but our room marked the highlight, a youth hostel being a luxury suite against this. The room looked horrible, the bed covers consisted of two single sheets trying to hide what was within them: a stainy, disgusting piece of cloth calling itself a bed cover. This piece has not seen a cleaner for years... Another pestilent ingredient of our room was the shower curtain: it is difficult to describe the color of the stains on that curtain... yuck! The TV Set was not showing a clear picture, the knobs were broken and the remote did not work, the overall condition of the room was miserable.So we can not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is dirty and the central location does not make up for that. The international staff seemed at least anxious, a simple breakfast was included in the price of USD 99 per night plus tax.

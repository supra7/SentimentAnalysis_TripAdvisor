We have just got back from New York and felt that i should immediately write about this hotel. It is a dump. The furniture looked like they had been to the tip to find it. It smelt awfull and the stains.... God knows what they were. We didn't hang about to ask. The whole place was vile. Don't be fooled by the pictures. It,s nothing like them. The room had a damp smell to it, the wall paper was off the walls, the bathroom was smelly and mouldy. I was so upset that i burst into tears. We went to reception and asked for another room and they gave us another room which was exactly the same. The porter said "You'll like this one, it,s alittle better". Yeah right. As we were adamant that we wouldn't be staying there we complained and asked to be moved to another hotel. They did that but we had to pay for that night plus cancellation charges. They moved us to the Helmsley New York which was amazing. Would recommend that to everyone. The only good thing about it was walking out and going to the other hotel. Do not stay here. Hope you find this helpfull.

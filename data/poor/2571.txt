Arguably, one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in in my entire liife. 1 cockroach in the room, a TV remote gone missing, a leaky (and loud) A/C unit that leaked water all over the bathroom floor, an elevator that should be condemned, a desk staff that is amazingly unhelpful and unremorseful, an amazingly dingy room, the weakest hair-dryer ever assembled. It's not just us -- every time we get into the elevator, we hear tales of other complaints (no phone in one room, light bulbs out). Trust me - this is NOT 3.5 stars.

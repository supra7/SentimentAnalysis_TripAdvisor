First of all I will state the few good things about this hotel, lovely pool area and beautiful green lawns and palm trees. Free wifi in rooms and thru out whole property is very reliable. Now for the bad points : No restaurant at hotel and nearest shops and restaurants are an hours walk away. If you want to catch a bus they run hourly so try doing that three times a day. Hotel is very isolated so if you don't have a hire car which now I know you really need on Maui you will have to catch buses everywhere which can be very time consuming. Front desk staff were not very friendly and didn't give any information about the hotel on checkin. We had to drag our suitcases up and down a hill to get to our room and we weren't offered a luggage trolley which I thought they must not have but I noticed later they did. Rooms are very old and extremely musty smelling. They are quite run down with old loover windows, archaic air conditioners that are very very loud at night time. If we were not able to hire a scooter to get us back and forth for meals I definitely would have checked in to another hotel in a better area no matter how much money I lost. I wouldn't recommend this hotel or location to anyone . We spent a day at a lovely town called Lahaina where I would loved to have stayed and would recomend.I'm not a fussy person and this is the first hotel I've stayed at and have really disliked so do yourself a favor and don't stay here.

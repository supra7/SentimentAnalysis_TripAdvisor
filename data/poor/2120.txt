The hotel has a nice atmosphere, much like the Hyatt Regency, however the hotel rooms are old and dingy (just an old feeling that you can't quite shake off). The customer service is lousy (which is very surprising) Although it's a prime location and the lobby is exquisite, the hotel itself is nothing more than a glorified Motel 6.

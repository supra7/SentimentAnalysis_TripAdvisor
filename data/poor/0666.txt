Before going to Rome, I've read on Tripadvisor that staff of the Boutique Hotel Trevi is unexperienced and they do not care about people. But this didn't stop me, because I couldn't imagine why guests would need their help so much. Now I know why. Although this hotel is situated 20 meters from goargeous Fontana Trevi, my stay at the hotel was horrible. It was february and +8 degrees at daytime, about 0 at night. So it was cold outside and to my surprise inside hotel also. The staff showed unexperienced and not welcoming from the first minutes, but I didnt pay attention. I went up to the room. It was very, very small, the size of an elevator, I think, and in the room it was very cold. In the bathroom it was just freezing, because the heating thing (not sure about the word in english) was cold. So The climate-control on the wall in the showed +15 degrees in the room, I turned to 30 and fell asleep for 3 hours. When I woke up, the temperature in the room was just the same. I went down and told the staff - I am leaving to do sightseeng, please do smth, so that when I return I could live in that room. 7 hours later I came back. The temperature was the same. I called the night reception, they said - nothing to do. I asked to bring the heater, they didnt have one. Plus there was no extra quilt in the wardrobe. So I went to sleep all dressed - sweater dress, poncho - all my clothes. In the morning I wanted to take shower - I couldnt. I was still freezing in the bathroom. I went to breakfast and caught their a woman, a manager and told her about my terrible night. She said - ah... room 406, I know, sorry. So that means that everybody knew about my problem and did NOTHING. That night was horrible. I felt like sleeping on a street, dressed and freezing. And that was, by the way, a 4 star hotel. They just dont care about guests. The breakfast is also of poor quality. I wish I chose some other place to stay or slept on a street.

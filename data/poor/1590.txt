The rooms are run down and so is the Hotel. Outside their windows are mark with years of weathering and inside the hotel was outdated 1980s motif. The staff, including the doormen, where all stuffed shirt who tried to make you feel as though you were a second class patrons if you missed a tip. The front desk folks, including the manager, just didn't get it. In the rooms (we had two) the furniture was scratched and the lamb shade was cracked. The bathtub flooded each time due to it being clogged. The toilet kept leaking and the overall fit of the room was just ok. No HD TV and limited channels. Maid service was good. The best part of our stay was the restaurant for breakfast! What a layout, second to none. Friday night was a Prime Rib buffet that was just fabulous! The wait staff was tripping over themselves trying to please us! Incredible! Overall, watch out you will regret this decision.

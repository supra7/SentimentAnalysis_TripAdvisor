We arrived at the Hotel for a one night stay prior to taking a cruise. Difficult to find anything positive about this hotel. Reception run down and 'tatty' looking. Despite the presence of a concierge/porter there was no offer to help with our bags. As soon as we entered our assigned room we were amazed - and not in a positive way. The bathroom was so small that the washbasin was in the room - even the smallest cabin on the ship (144 sq ft.) managed to get this in the bathroom. The room was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and the sheets were rumpled and appeared not to have been changed since the last occupant. We immeditely booked another hotel by phone and left, informing reception of our dissatisfaction. Even if we had been offered another room we would have not stayed there under any circumstances. I am not usually so negative about reviews but this was the worst place for it's star rating we have ever been in. The 'additional details/ratings' are so sketchy as th hotel was in our opinion so bad we did not actually stay there.

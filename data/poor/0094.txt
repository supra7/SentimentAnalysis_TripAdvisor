We picked up a coupon book from a rest stop and discovered that all the motels we tried had reason not take them, including this one. So we paid a whopping $80.00 u.s. to stay in this god forsaken place. It smelled bad, the T.V. barely worked, the wallpaper was falling off the wall and patched elsewhere, the mattress was old and sagging (very sore backs in the morning), the toilet wouldn't flush unless we played with the handle for a while and the in wall heater under the window was broken so we had a floor heater sitting on the floor in this already very tiny room. A few doors down from us was a group of young men who were there explicitly for partying. They were yelling, running back and forth (by our room), thowing plastic ice buckets and hanging off the banisters, on and off, throughout the night. I did not sleep. Being from Victoria we started our trip at 4 a.m. so we were very tired and ended up here because we had tried so many places and just got tired of looking. We visit Seattle several times a year and have for tweny-five, but we decided on that night that Seattle just isn't worth it anymore. I cringe to think what $80.00 u.s. would get me in Victoria.

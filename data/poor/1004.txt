We had booked to stay at the Hotel Lidos, which from the reception area looked clean and OK for that price. But we were told we would be staying across the road at the Park. There was a strange smell, possibly damp, as soon as entered. The room was on the third floor - no lift - and when we got there we found the tiniest room imaginable. We had booked twin beds, but this room had a double. The bed had not been made, the dirty coffee cups were still there and that was just the start. The en-suite shower just about had enough room for that a toilet and a basin. No hot water to the basin by the way. The curtain did not pull across and had been jammed behind the open window to let some light into the room. There were cracks around the frame ( see photo) Best of all, you had to climb across the double bed to get to the far side. Good points? The towels and bed linen were clean when we returned at night. A horrible place

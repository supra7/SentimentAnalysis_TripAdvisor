The disaster began upon making our reservation. The person who took our reservation was very curt and seemed like she had better things to do. When we tried to check in at 3:00, we had to wait for them to finish cleaning our room. The hallway had a strange odor and when we got to our room the cigarette smoke overwhelmed us. The bathrooms were reasonably clean. The window overlooking the shower was covered in paint meant for privacy but somebody had chipped away part of the paint so one was exposed to neighbors across the way. We felt violated. Our first day there we were not provided with a privacy/cleaning request door sign to alert the staff that we needed new towels etc. When we went to the front desk to request one of these that other rooms had hanging on their doors they simply gave us a plain piece of computer paper to hand write out our request and tape it to the door! It was ridiculous. In addition to this we did not receive any clean towels, once again being forced to make an unncessary trip to the front desk. Fortunately housekeeping did bring us clean towels shortly after this request. Television remote did not work. When we checked out they didn't make us feel like our stay was valued. Overall I would not recommend staying here unless you are basically strapped for cash.

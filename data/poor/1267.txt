We pulled up in the parking lot and were immediatly concerned by the trashy looking guys hanging out on the parking lot, one of them actually had a tire iron in his hand, not a good sign. We had pre-booked and didnt know what to expect. We soon found out. Upon trying to find our room, we had to force our way around the nearly naked man sitting on the balcony outside our door. Upon entering the room we were shocked that this place had not been shut down. How anyone could charge people to stay here is beyond me. I would rather stay in a box on the street, at least then the air would not smell like sewer. Holes in the walls, dirty bed, bathroom, and carpet. We have stayed in alot of motels all over the country, and have never seen anything like this. We were in the room about 2 minutes before leaving the room keys on the bed and walking out back around nearly naked man. Luckily our car was still on the parking lot with all tires and wheels attached, no joking that was actually a surprise. We ended up staying at a much nicer motel closer to Graceland, we couldnt wait to get showers after just a couple minutes in this trash dump. PLEASE, I BEG YOU, DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

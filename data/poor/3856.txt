The pictures of this "resort" are very misleading. First of all, most of the units are not beach front and have no view of the beach. I travel about once a month or so and this is the first negative review I have felt the need to write. We were treated extremely rudely by the staff upon check in at 11:00 PM. Be careful about booking on a travel service because there were many charges we weren't told about until check in and more at check out. When we tried to talk to the manager about the charges we were told the manager would not talk to us and is too busy to be at the lobby. The outside grounds are wearing down and old. The rooms were very much sub-par. Two of the people staying in the room were bitten numerous times by bed bugs! The room had poor ventilation and the bathroom had none. There were bugs in the bathroom that was in dire need of being remodeled. When booking we were told it would be central to everything. That is only if you have a car- I would recommend looking at hotels further down kihei road for a much better location. We did not use the beach on the property one time, but rather had to rent a car to drive anytime we wanted to do something. I stayed at a resort quest property last month in waikiki and had nothing but good things to say. I was very unpleased.

We stayed here for our recent spring break with our two boys, ages 6 and 8. Of course , the big draw is the water park but my boys did the slide and lazy river a few times and then preferred the smaller , quieter pools. Keep in mind, the water park is very spread out..if you have small kids , you will be constantly running around from slides to river to wave pool and back. But the biggest disappointment was the food. Honestly , everything we had was terrible and the prices were crazy high. I think the majority of food served here is prepared via microwave. If the prices were more reasonable, I think I would've accepted the mediocre quality, but the prices are about the same as resorts such as JW Marriott which are in a different league altogether. The lobby grill was also a disappointment...for instance, I had a grilled chicken ceasar salad that was nothing more than bagged, prewashed romaine with a small portion of rotisserie chciken on top. The service was very slow and for several nights, they were out of the draft beer my husband wanted. Next time, we will stay in Scottsdale at a true luxury resort.

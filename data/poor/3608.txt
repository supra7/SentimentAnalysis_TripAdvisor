I certainly echo the other comments about the lack of customer service and the unprofessional front desk. This hotel persistently does not honor confirmed reservations and attempts to send those customers that it turns away to substandard hotels such as the Hotel Fitzgerald. In addition, its personnel falsely claimed that there were no other hotels available in San Francisco when Hotels.com was able after a perfunctory search to locate a number of available rooms in the area.

Horrible management I was immediately disappointed from the moment I went to my room. I called and spoke with a very polite front desk agent about the room. I explained to him that the walls were paper-thin (could hear a normal conversation next door clearly, word-for-word) and that the room was very, very small for the $245 I spent a night.He told me he'd have management call. I spoke with the desk manager, Ben, and he was incredibly rude. He was not accomodating and said there wasn't much he could do if we weren't happy. Though the agent was more than helpful and apologetic, Ben was nothing more than useless. Clearly, you can tell he is not at all interested in his guests and is just there to make money.Unfortunately, I will not be returning due to his attitude and lack of effort. Otherwise, I think i could have really had a good vacation. Never seen a manager with such a lack of responsibility and disregard. I'd love to see him go through the same problem at another hotel on his vacation!

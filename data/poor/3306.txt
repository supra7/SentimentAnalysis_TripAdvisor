This place is just awful - it smelled, the whole building is old and rundown, and the "Free breakfast" was prepackaged Danish or muffins & coffee if you got them by 7am. The bathroom was small, old and ugly, and the shower was a trickle. THankfully we spent almost all our time out of the room and were exhausted enough to sleep. We had to buy room freshener because it smelled so bad. For the same budget, stay at the Ramada - a much nicer facility, which we will return to before ever doing the Travelodge again.

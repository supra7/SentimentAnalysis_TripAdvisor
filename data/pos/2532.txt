We stayed here for one night and thought it was an excellent price for the comfort and convenience. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, the views were great and it was convenient to many shops, restaurants and attractions. The bathroom was small (toilet & shower) but the sink/vanity area was spacious enough; parking was a bit spendy but that's to be expected downtown. Very nice bath products as always with the Hilton.

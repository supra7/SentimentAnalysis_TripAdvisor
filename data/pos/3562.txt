Hip Ambiance, High-quality Accommodations, Handy Area We spent a Girls Weekend at the Andra and loved our stay there! The trendy ambiance immediately greets you as you enter the hotel  the inviting fireplace and then the comfy chairs where you can order from the adjacent bar. Our room was great  luxurious beds, a roomy sitting area, and those unique Swedish Voss water bottles! Best of all is the location  close to downtown and also right on the edge of Belltown with its great restaurants and jazz bars. The customer service was stellar  from the valet taking our car to the helpful front desk people to the welcome note that was waiting for us in the room. The Girls give it a 2-thumbs up!!

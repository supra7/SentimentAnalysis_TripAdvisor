Stayed two nights in the two story townhouse. Nice comfortable living room downstairs with wet bar, upstairs bedroom and bathroom. #702 was I think the best room possible, on the 7th and 8th (top) floor in the corner with windows on two sides. The views of Pike Market and Puget Sound could not be beat. Fun to cruise the market and be back at your room in two minutes. Entertained some friends in the room before going to dinner, everyone enjoyed! Beds were like sleeping in a cloud!

Stayed 3 nights pre Alaskan cruise last year. Hotel was good, just as expected. Decent location. Excellent beds. Lovely room with view over the city. My only gripe is that Seattle had the most panhandlers we have EVER experienced anywhere. In the world. It was disconcerting at times as some were aggressive and pushy. However, Seattle was great. We especially enjoyed the Underground Tour and riding the Ducks!

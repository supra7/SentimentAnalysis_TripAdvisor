Stayed 3 nights at the hotel with my extended family. The location was great - we were able to easily walk to Pike's Market, the monorail to Seattle Center, and even to Safeco Field. We were in the new tower, and the room was immaculate, including an LCD, attached to the wall, TV (we didn't watch it much, but it had a really impressive picture). Health club was OK, as was the indoor pool, whose best recommendation was that it was on the 35th floor. The construction mentioned in earlier reviews is basically done, other than some areas near the restaurant (which we never used). There was a small problem in our room (one of the 2 beds was not stable), but the hotel fixed it promptly and took $20 off our bill for the trouble. I would definitely recommend the hotel.

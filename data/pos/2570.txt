I stayed at the Hilton Seattle in one or two week increments from April 2009 through March 2010. (I did make it home for a few weeks including the major holidays!) I enjoyed my time there greatly. Excellent service - many of the staff learned my name fairly early on. Outstanding Executive Lounge - food, staff, and happy hour. Excellent fitness facility - 3 treadmills, bike, 2 other cardio, free weights, and several machines. Rooms were comfortable with great beds. Location allowed for easy walking anywhere in downtown. Parking was available at a monthly rate that was much reduced from what the total daily rate would be. All in all, it was the staff, lounge, gym, and location (in that order) that I liked the best. I only had one minor issue my entire time there that was handled very well. (Had a water leak in my room in the middle of the night. I called the front desk, got dressed in my workput clothes and headed to the the gym as it was open 24 hours. The staff visited me in the gym a few times to provide status and had the room ready for me to get ready for work by the time I was done with my workout. I changed rooms after work that day. Entire matter handled very well!)

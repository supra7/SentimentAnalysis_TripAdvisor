A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle. We spent two nights here and found the room and staff to be great. The communal showers were immaculate and we never had to queue. The breakfast was also great. There was a bit of street noise coming from below (we were on the first floor) but there were ear plugs in our room. I would also highly recommend the bar (Cyclops) below the hotel.

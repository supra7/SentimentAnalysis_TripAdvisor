At the end of a three-week trip, I booked this trip for one night for our anniversary. Upon check in, we were upgraded to the Deluxe Water View suite (Room 810). When told of the upgrade, I commented, "Happy anniversary." We checked into the top-floor room and had a magnificent view of the Pike Market and the water. (Not a bad view out the side window either.) The giant windows allow you to see the lights from anywhere in the room and seeing the giant neon "PUBLIC MARKET" when walking around or sitting at the table was very cool. For all the places we have stayed, this is one of the three that stand out for their incredible views (a penthouse in Hawaii and a top floor along the Vegas strip being the others). Finally, the service was exceptional. The staff heard the comment about the anniversary and congratulated us. However, after checking in we left to go to dinner and upon return found a very nice chocolate cake and a hand-written note of congratulations. This short stay is one we will definitely never forget. We did not order it, but their room service comes for a couple of very elegant and highly rated French restaurants next to the hotel. You would be hard pressed to find better food on any hotel's room service menu.

This was probably between a three and a half star to a four star hotel. Guest services were outstanding, we had two employees ask if we needed help between walking in and getting to the hotel desk. We ate at the hotel's cafe on the 2nd floor for a quick bite after checking in and found the steak sandwich to be the most tender we've ever tasted. Hot water in the bathroom was almost instant and the towels were nice and thick. We paid about 100 a night through priceline and I think parking at the hotel was 21 dollars a night. Feel free to ask any questions.

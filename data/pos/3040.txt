We travelled to Seattle over Labour Day weekend with friends after getting a weekend deal on Sheraton's website. This place is top-notch - excellent location, great staff, beautiful rooms. Typically I am a budget traveller, so this was a fun splurge. The only thing that sucks is the cost of parking, but that comes with staying right in downtown Seattle. I would stay here again in a minute. One thing - if you want to use the pool, make sure you can stay in the tower with the pool. It's at the top of one of the two towers, and if you're in the tower without, it's a pain to go all the way to the lobby, over, and back up again.

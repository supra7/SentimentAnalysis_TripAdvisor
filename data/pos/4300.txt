My girlfriend and I stayed here last night - leaving our men at home. Checking in at 3pm takes quite a long time with all the people lined up. The hotel was so packed this weekend! By the time I checked in, I was told that my reservation for 2 queen beds was not ready so I was offered an upgrade with a king size bed to a nicer room with beautiful view of the city and puget sound - no extra charge. Sofa bed was also available. Bed and pillows are so comfortable! CONS: Ice machine was not working on this floor. Elevators are slow and frequently packed. Frig in room is packed with VERY EXPENSIVE refreshments. We made mistake of rearranging stuff so we could store some limes. Found out $30 later that frig was on sensor so it automatically charged us for each thing rearranged. Then we read the fine print on the refreshment card which warned of the sensors AND they charge $7 if you use the frig. PRO: I called Westin, explained what happened, and they reimbursed us for all charges and didn't charge for the $7. They must have thought we were country bumpkins!! HA HA!

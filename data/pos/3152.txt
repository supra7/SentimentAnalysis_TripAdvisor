We booked this hotel on hotwire and the rate was still high...$200 per night. When we arrived at the hotel, my husband and I requested a king bed. We were asked to pay an additional $20 per night to have a king bed in the new tower. In addition, parking is $35 per night. So, just expect that you will pay a bit more than anticipated if you have special requests. On the good side, we ordered room service the first night which was delicious and delivered in 10 minutes! Room service is expensive, but that is always the case in hotels. Our room in the new tower was lovely and spacious with a great view of the city. We enjoyed the complimentary starbucks coffee. However, they put out "snacks" to tempt you to spend more. After the first night, I woke up early due to time zone changes. I decided to go to the gym. It does not open until 5:30 AM and there is no place to have coffee until then. The elevator won't allow you to access the 35th floor (location of pool/gym) until 5:30, so the front desk staff suggested I take the stairs. Well, the door on the 35th floor was locked so I almost got locked in the stairwell. The exercise room is good, but small. The pool was fine, but full of children. The jacuzzi was warm but the jets were broken. We loved the location of the hotel and enjoyed the convenient shoppoing and dining. Try the Tap...restaurant across the street. The food was reasonably priced, delcious, and they offered 160 types of beer on tap (not my thing, but interesting). We would stay at the Sheraton again, but would have open eyes about the expenses.

Stayed at Inn at the Market November 2011 for a Seattle Seahawks game. Spent 3 nights. Was truly the best location and best hotel I've stayed at in Seattle. Literally steps from Pike Place market make it perfect for early morning coffees overlooking the Sound. Was cold when we were there, so the deck you could sit on overlooking the Sound wasn't used, but its views were excellent. Valet parking was fast and efficient as well. Rooms were modern and clean as well. Great to be right on Post Alley as well and steps from Kells Irish Pub. Go there for great local bands. Also, we paid for the cheaper rooms and still had a great view of the Sound. Not sure why I'd pay more, but I'm sure it would be worth it. All in all, perfect hotel, perfect location.

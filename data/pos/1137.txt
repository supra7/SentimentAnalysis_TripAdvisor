My husband and I spent four pleasant nights at the Ace. My husband and I were checking out Seattle for our future move to the area. I was a little wary because of some of the previous reviews, but I was totally pleased with my stay. The rooms are sparse, but just fine. It is aesthetic over function. My husband said the bed was uncomfortable, but I thought it was comfy. The mattress had a thick pad on top. I liked the wool blankets. The shared bathrooms were very clean. No need to bring soap, shampoo, or conditioner: it's provided. Plus they pipe nice music in! For breakfast they have a great waffle maker, plus granola, yogurt, toast, juice, and good coffee. Overall it was quiet, clean, pleasant, and fun. Okay, yes, the hallway lights are on until midnight and do shine into the window above your door. Seems a little silly. They should dim them at 10ish. And the younger people at the desk are uber-hip and unfamiliar with the nuances of hospitality- but they are all friendly enough. The exception was Ed (the manager, perhaps?) who was awesome. I asked him a million questions and he gave me great advice. They ask you to put a door hanger out requesting housekeeping service (instead of just doing it unasked), even though there is nowhere to hang your wet towels in your room. None of these were reasons to not stay here. Overall, it was a great deal for a room smack in the middle of Belltown. It was better than I expected.

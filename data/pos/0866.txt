I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to everyone, we went through the reviews before booking a place to stay in Seattle and I am so glad we did. Before we arrived at the hotel I contacted David Watkins, the manager, to ask if he could possibly arrange that our daughter, who had booked separately, could be accommodated in a room as near to ours as possible. From that point forward we had several email exchanges with both Mr Watkins and Noelle, the concierge, giving us advice and tips about our stay in Seattle. By the time we actually arrived we felt that we knew them so well! Our rooms were close together as requested and they were excellent, very clean and spacious with the most comfortable beds. Because we were celebrating our anniversary a bottle of champagne was in the room when we checked in, a lovely touch. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and couldn't do enough to help you. There was not one thing that we would change with this hotel. The location could not be bettered, a few feet from the market, and with lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. We loved Seattle and the Inn at the Market and we will be going back again as soon as possible. Believe the reviews here, they are correct and you will love it.

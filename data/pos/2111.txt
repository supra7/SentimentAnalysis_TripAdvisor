I loved this hotel even though my husband had his reservations about it at first. He did NOT want a room with a community bath (which are cheaper) so I booked a suite for a little over $100. It was quite large, 2 rooms, brand new sofa, furniture, minimalist decor, little kitchen, TV, clawfoot bathtub, comfortable double bed, and freshly painted. We had a great time walking around the Marketplace and surrounding area. The desk clerk was very helpful, telling us where to park (across the street $15) showing us how to catch the free bus to ChinaTown and how to get back. We even went to hear live music next door at the Moore Theater! If you want a place with character, and not a generic chain hotel, this is the place! Do be aware that there is a significant amount of homeless people, panhandlers and dope dealers, but I find this element in most major cities in the U.S.

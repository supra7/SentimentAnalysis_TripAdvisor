We were very happy that we stayed at the Marqueen. Very large rooms, full kitchen, sitting area, great bathroom; it was a nice place to rest between out-trips. Well located near downtown, and the Queen Anne area up the hill. We stayed on the street side on a weekend night and the room was far quieter than you would expect from a city hotel on a busy street. Lots of amenities near by, which is great if you plan to use the kitchen. Old building with lots of character, but lacks an elevator. As clean as you would hope an apartment you were moving into would be, but not sterile like the downtown business hotels. Staff were consistantly helpful.

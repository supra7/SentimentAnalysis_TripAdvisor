My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights prior to our Alaska cruise. We booked it through Hotwire. Our stay was more than we expected. A great room. An upgrade to the 29th floor and very close to Pikes Market. It was only a $10 cab ride to get to the pier. We purchased a roundtrip ticket on the Airporter to the Sheraton. Then took a cab to and from the pier. It saved about $15, which isn't alot, but it was very convenient and the bus drivers are much more friendly than the cabbies. All-in-all, if you wnat to be close to the downtown action, this is a great hotel to pick. It was definently a 4-star for us.

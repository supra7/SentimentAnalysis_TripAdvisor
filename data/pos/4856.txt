I booked this hotel for an interview at UW. Out of all of the hotels I had stayed recently, this is one of the best, especially for the price! The staff was more than friendly, and helpful for everything I needed (take out restaurants at 10 pm, shoe stores, shuttle information) The room is very comfortable with 2 queen beds. The bedding comes with both synthetic pillows and feather pillows for your preference. There is a small desk. Wi-fi internet. As I had to be at the hospital at 7:15 am, I reserved my shuttle the night before. I would definitely recommend this, but be aware that you need to make that clear as the driver may not come until 7:10. The front desk was also very helpful in directing me to the main street near the hotel where there were many shops/restaurants. There is a afternoon tea, but I was not able to partake of it. The breakfast is nice with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, baked goods, hard-boiled eggs, and make your own waffle station (which, I might add, was pretty good). The nice part about this hotel is that they also have a free washer/dryer for the guests. You can bring your own laundry detergent, or they have packets for sale at the front desk (2 for $1 with dryer sheets included). I would definitely stay here again. The only thing is that this hotel is not downtown, however there is the hotel shuttle that will take you downtown and bring you back, as well as the UW shuttles.

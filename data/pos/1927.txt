I am a little late posting had a great experience and had to share. I had my first business trip to Seattle and stayed at the Mayflower. What a great hotel! Arrived a little early and room was not ready but they held my luggage and recommended a great burger joint down the road. Once I got in my room I was so happy I picked this hotel. The room was so cute! A little small but nice. The bathroom had Aveda products which I thought was a nice touch. I highly recommend this hotel!

So unexpected. We booked for a VERY reasonable price and I was not expecting much at all but was very pleased with our choice. The breakfast was great for being complimentary - we never went hungry. They had u-make waffels, sausages, toast, bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, apple and orange juice, coffee/tea and fruit. The rooms were a nice size and clean - never had any problems with this place at all and if we were to go back to Seattle we definitely would stay here again!!! It was rainy outside the whole time and they had umbrellas for the guests:) Great for the price for sure!!!

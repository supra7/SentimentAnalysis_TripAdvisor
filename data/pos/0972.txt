After reading many, many reviews on this website, I contacted the manager directly to see if he could assist me in making plans for a short 2 night stay in Seattle for our wedding anniversary. He promptly responded with an offer that I couldn't pass up! This past weekend my husband and I stayed at the Inn in one of the town house city view suites. The hotel & staff were amazing! We absolutely loved this hotel and will for sure be back in the future! I have already told many friends and family that next time they're in Seattle, this is "the" place to stay! When we first arrived, there was an anniversary card and a special dessert for two waiting in our room! It was delicious and such a nice gesture! Typically we would go out for a nice anniversary dinner where ever we happen to be. At the Inn, there was a set of dishes for two in our room, so both nights we decided to get takeout and bring it back. Fixed up our plates and headed to the deck on the 5th floor. Amazing view and plenty of space! Even though there were other guests out there, everyone had their own space and it was wonderful! The room was very spacious and super clean! Two big flat screen tv's... bay windows that look out on two different streets, one with partial market/water view. The location couldn't be more ideal! Steps from Pike Place Market which is always one of our favs when in town for a visit. Thank you Mr. Watkins & thank you to your staff! We really enjoyed our stay at your hotel and can't wait to come back! This was definitely an anniversary to remember!

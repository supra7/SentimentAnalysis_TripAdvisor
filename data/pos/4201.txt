I have been staying at this hotel for fifteen years every time I am in Seattle. The rooms may be a little dated but the following attributes make up for it; a. Fantastic habor views from many rooms. b. Large suites. c. Central location with great restaurants, shopping and public transportation all around. d. Wonderful staff especially the concierges. e.Nice health club. f. Comfortable lobby g. Reliable business center Only complaint is that they need to bring back the all you can eat sushi restaurant that made many a memorable lunch and happy hour.

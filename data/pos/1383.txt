Recently spent the weekend with my girlfriend at the Inn at Queen Anne in Seattle for the Jet City Comic-Con. First, the location - everything you want or need is nearby; a couple minutes walk from the Space Needle, not far from the Pike Place Market (20 min walk or so), a 24-hour grocery nearby, lots of places to eat, and other neat stores and such all within easy walking distance. The rooms are not huge or fancy by any means, but clean and quaint and have a fully-equipped kitchenette and small refrigerator, so you can save even more by preparing your own food. Gas stove though, so you may have to ask for matches from the front counter. Since I mention them, staff are friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Hair dryers are available at the front desk, there's an ice machine and a laundry room; you can either wash your own clothes in their coin-op machines, or spoil yourself and use their laundry service, which is not cheap. Earplugs may be necessary for light sleepers, as the area is quite busy, and the A/C unit lets in a lot of street noise. We had no problem with this, but some might. Parking is cheap at $15 per night, but not very convenient, as it's in the underground garage at the neighboring Marqueen Hotel. It's valet parking, so they can have it ready for you on request, but you have to walk the block or so to get it. This was a non-issue for us, as we didn't need it all weekend, and felt safe knowing it was secure in a locked garage. There is coffee available in the lobby, which is adequate for a caffeine fix, but those with more discerning tastes might just want to go to the Starbuck's immediately around the corner. It's admittedly not everyone's cup of tea, but we enjoyed it enough to make it our go-to place to stay when we next visit Seattle, and to recommend it to all our acquaintances who are considering visiting the city.

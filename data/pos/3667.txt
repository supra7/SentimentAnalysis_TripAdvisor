Came down to Seattle for a shopping and sightseeing getaway. Looked online for hotels and after reading lots of reviews decided on the Edgewater for it's location and quality. We were not dissapointed. The price of the Valet parking may be a bit much, but it was worth the peace of mind not having to worry about safe parking as we made our way around downtown on foot. Loved the Premium Waterfront Room.

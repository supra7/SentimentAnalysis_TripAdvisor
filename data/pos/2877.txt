We flew to Seattle for the weekend as a quick get-away and were so pleased that we did. This is a very clean,well maintained property. Although we arrived early we were provided with a room on the club floor as reserved. The club room offered good quality snacks in the evening and great choices for the morning. It was a great alternative since the hotel was sold out and we did not experience the waiting lines at all the nearby dining places. There was a beautiful display of gingerbread houses in the lobby. The restaurant downstairs was excellent. We had the prime rib for dinner. The best I've had anywhere! Across the street in the mall was a wonderful italian place on the second floor called Paliminos. It was very crowded due to the theatre time at lunch. Shopping is at your finger tips-Nordstorms, Macy's etc. The Market was three blocks away. Alll in all it was a wonderful weekend at this property.

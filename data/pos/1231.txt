Nice hotel. they put us in a regular room on floor 26, the fire detector kept "chirping" so they offered to move us to a room on the 15 floor. We were like, no we are on vacation you are not penalizing us the view bc something is wrong with this room. The lady was not nice or working with us at all. So we just said forget it, we had dinner reservations for my birthday & decided we would deal with it when we got back. This time we stopped at the front desk and a guy assisted us & moved us to a room on floor 27, which was fine. My opinion is if you ever need assistance at a hotel go to the lobby front desk where other guest are so that they will assist you appropriately. Parking was very very expensive but probably normal for that area. Overall it was a nice stay for the week, we had no other issues. We ordered room service one night bc we were tired & it was good. we overlooked the interstate & i would assume it is louder on lower floors, we could still hear traffic but it was faint. They have a nice gift shop on the premise with lots of Seattle "stuff." We met several people that were staying one night & then leaving for an Alaskan cruise.

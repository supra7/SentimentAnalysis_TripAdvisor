We stayed for 3 nights after a cruise and arrived around 10 am. Our room was ready for us, no waiting around. Reception staff were knowledgeable and friendly, especially as the hotel was busy with the International Lions Convention. We had no problem with noise from outside or inside and our room was at the front of the building. The rooms are quite spacious, with a fridge and coffeemaker. The beds are really comfy and the bathroom spotlessly clean. Great location for shopping, Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle (we walked there and took the monorail back). We were able to use the computers free of charge to do on-line check in and also print out our boarding cards - amazing considering what you have to pay for this service elsewhere. We used the lightrail to get to and from the airport, another amazing bargain. We only used taxis to and from the port. The subway is less than 5/10 mins walk and there's also a lift - useful when you have luggage. There was no pressure to vacate our room although we were ready to leave on time and our luggage was stored free of charge until we left for the airport. We only used the restaurant once for breakfast and were happy with what we ordered. Again, the staff are friendly and helpful.

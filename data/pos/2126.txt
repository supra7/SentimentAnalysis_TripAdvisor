We stayed at The Moore for 3 nights- couldn't have had a better time. The building is old and extra charming, loved the staff, and the wireless network. Great location right next to the Pike Place market, the Moore Theater, and lots of cute little independant shops. Nice views and so cheap I couldn't believe it. The bar downstairs has some excellent decorations- check it out.

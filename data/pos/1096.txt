I travel to Seattle area a lot: to watch a baseball game, to go to a concert, or just to hang out with my friends. This is my second time staying at this hotel, and I can't be more happier. Free parking and Wi-Fi internet saved me about $50/night. Staffs are exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the hotel is very close to everything downtown. Rate was cheaper than any hotel in downtown area. Room was very clean with everything we needed. We all thought this was a great fun place to stay; in fact, we'll go back every time we're in town.

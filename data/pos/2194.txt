Knowing nothing about Seattle, I checked on Trip Advisor for a well-located and not too expensive hotel. Overall, the reviews were very good and the location which is of utmost importance to us seemed excellent. It actually surpassed our expectations although the room was abit small. However, Seattle has so much to do that we were rarely in the room except to sleep. The staff could not have been nicer, the room was quiet and we were right across the street from the amazing library with buses (free from 6 AM to 7 PM) all around us. But since we are big walkers, we rarely took buses except occasionally since the hills are pretty steep getting back from the Waterfront. And the very elegant Fairmont was just one block away so this is in one of the finest neighborhoods in downtown Seattle.

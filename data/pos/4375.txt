Loved my stay at the Westin. Hotel staff, front desk, valet, food & beverage and concierge were all excellent. Used Priceline for a two-day stay over Valentine's Day. Asked for and recieved an upper floor, north tower room with great views of Elliot Bay and the Space Needle. Room was modern, well equiped, large enough to be comfortable for two, nice granite bathroom with huge tub and double shower heads - nice amenities. The location of the Westin is perfect for exploring downtown, shopping, dining and short walk to Pike's Farmers Market. Two block walk from hotel to Assaggio's Italian restaurant - some of the best italian food this side of Milan. Also - Top Pot, the semi-famous donut and coffee cafe is right close by. The Conceirge went above and beyond, got us a short notice reservation at El Gaucho. Super good steak house. I highly recommend the Filet Mignon served on the flaming sword, tableside. Very cool - and the Concierge actually bought us dessert. That's service.

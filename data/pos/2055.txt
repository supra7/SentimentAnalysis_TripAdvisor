You really have to hunt to find a buget-priced place in Seattle. This place was mentioned in my Lonely Planet guide, and got good reviews on here, so my friend and I stayed there 2 seperate nights in September. For about $110 US a night, this place was an excellent choice. The staff were laid-back but pleasant and helpful. The neighbourhood wasn't too rough, and it's very handy to all the major attractions of Seattle, especially Pike Place markets. The room was simple yet excellent. We had two double beds and a private bathroom (you can go without a bathroom in your room, and use a shared bathroom for less $) The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the beds comfortable and immaculate. The room was also spacious and you could open the windows a little to let in fresh air. One of the most lovely things about the hotel was the presentation of the bathrooms. The towels were plentiful and were folded into fan shapes- a really nice touch! Only one drawback- it's a older building, so there was no air conditioning in the room (though a powerful desk fan was provided.) If you're one to suffer the heat, be advised, it could get quite stuffy in summer. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you're on a bit of a budget.

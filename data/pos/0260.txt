As usual, my stay the the Kimpton hotel, this time Hotel Monaco in Seattle, was excellent. The staff is great, friendly, very helpful, and the hotel itself is luxurious and comfortable. Especially enjoy the free wine tasting each afternoon, and comfortable beds. I recommend any Kimpton, and the Hotel Monaco was a treat!

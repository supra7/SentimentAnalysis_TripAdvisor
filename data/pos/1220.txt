The Crowne Plaza is a exceptionally nice business type hotel in a great location for touring Seattle. It is close to light rail from SEA TAC airport (3 blocks uphill to hotel); Within walking distance of Pioneer Sq (5 blocks); Waterfront piers & state ferries (6 blocks downhill); Agrosky tours; Seattle Aquarium; Ivars Fish Bar; Pikes Place Market etc are within walking distance. There is a free bus system from 6am-7pm on 3rd Ave (2 blocks) which runs almost to the Seattle center & Westlake where you can get the Monorail $ to Seattle Center. The rooms were clean, beds comfortable; service excellent & very helpful concierge service which I expect from a 4 star hotel. breakfast may or may not be included in rate; paid parking. Internet is not free! Hotels are expensive in Seattle so you need to shop around. This hotel usually runs $200+ but you can find a good deal online. I paid $182 including taxes for 2 double beds.

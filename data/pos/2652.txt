We stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle in August for 5 days and have to say that we would come back. We were unable to check in as we arrived early, but the staff were kind enough to check our bags and deliver them to the room when we checked in. We were on a limited budget, so our room was small, but comfortable and we only needed to ask for more pillows, blankets, etc. and they were delivered promptly. The bed was very comfortable, sheets clean and soft and the bathroom and rest of the room clean as well. We just wondered how those strange handprints got on the ceiling...? The breakfast is fantastic, but don't forget to bring your breakfast tickets! The pool was nice and open 24 hours and there is a great looking gymn available. We didn't use the gymn... hey, we were on vacation! but I saw others enjoying it. If you don't want to rent a car or pay for a taxi, you can walk the 2 blocks to the space needle and take the monorail downtown, where you can walk anywhere or catch a cab for a few less dollars. Just remember the monorail shuts down at night, so don't get stranded downtown. All in all it's a clean, comfortable place, wonderful all you can eat breakfast, not doughnuts and coffee like others and in a good location for a reasonable price. Ricky is the man if you need anything! Hi, Ricky and staff and thanks for everything! Christine

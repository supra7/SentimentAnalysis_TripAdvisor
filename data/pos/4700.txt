This property was all good . . . even the skywalk connected self parking from the north tower was a treat for a change at just $16.00!! Donno where other reviewer parked. The 43rd floor room was quiet, relaxing, spotless and with a marvelous view! Bed and bath were as advertised . . . heavenly! Elevators rapid and quiet. The staff was prompt and courteous Having all this at the discounter price of $90.00 was truly having it ALL! A perfect long Memorial Day vacation in the Emerald City!!!

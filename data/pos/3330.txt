I recently stayed at the Andra for a weekend visit to Seattle. It was my second stay at the Andra in the past three years, and I would definitely return. Convenient location close to restaurants, shops, and the waterfront. Stylish and comfortable rooms. Did not hear any noise from neighbours or from the street outside.

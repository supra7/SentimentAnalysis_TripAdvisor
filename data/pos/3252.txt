We depend a great deal on this web site when we choose hotels for our trips. Trip Advisor didn't fail us this time either! Great value! The room was spacious. We had a choice between a room with a tub/shower combination or a shower stall alone. We traveled with another couple. Their room was as nice and bright as ours. The staff was great! Very efficient and helpful. There is a restaurant on location. We ate breakfast there and dinner there one night. Excellent place to eat. Great atmosphere. Within walking distance to Pike Place Mkt (even with walking up and down hills). Also within walking distance to the Space Needle - flat terrain. We came into town from the airport on the Light Link Rail line. It cost less than $3 per person and took about 1/2 hour. We took the train all the way to the end of the line which is WestLake Center. This hotel is about 3 blocks from Westlake Center. We walked from there to the hotel. Very happy with this hotel!

We are a couple in our 40's. Stayed for 2 nights. Went to Pike Place, Space Needle, EMP, and various malls and restaurants. Getting around by bus/monorail is very easy. City buses (not monorail) are free until 7pm in the downtown area. Bus stops are located across the street. Go to concierge to get a map and have all this explained to you. Taking the bus is great if walking up and down the hill is a problem. The Renaissance --- Pro's: - Clean, modern room - Great location - Friendly and helpful concierge - Easy check in/out - Booked through Priceline ($128/night) - Comfortable beds - Good toiletries (Aveda) Cons: - Some traffic noise, but it didn't bother us. - Pool was closed. Note, that it is fairly small. - Bathroom door is a sliding frosted panel door, not a pocket door... this door slides from the outside so not exactly very "private". - The two bottles of water in the mini-fridge aren't free. Not knowing... I drank two bottles, but the charges were removed from our bill no problem. - Hotel Parking - $37 (incl tax). - Street parking $4/hour, free after 8pm We arrived at the hotel around 8pm (spent the day at Premium Outlet) - we parked on the street free overnight then moved the car to the hotel parking the next morning for one night. Worked out great to only have to pay for one night of parking! All in all, I would stay here again.

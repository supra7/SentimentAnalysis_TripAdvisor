I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in March whilst in Seattle for a shopping holiday. The weather was atrocious (wind, rain and even snow) but the room was cozy and clean. Check-in was quick (room wasn't ready) but they kept my luggage and I was able to go for lunch unencumbered. Lovely afternoon wine tasting in the lobby between 5 and 6. A little stingy with the appetizers but it was a nice way to unwind before dinner in front of a roaring fire. The windows open in the rooms so it is nice to get fresh air at night. Robes to use hang in the closet and if you're an In-Touch member you can pick something from the mini-bar. (Cashews were lovely!) I had booked a King Premier room with a $20 food credit per day. It worked out nicely for breakfast at Tulio. Tulio is a lovely restaurant and even though I have been traveling to Seattle for over 30 years I have never eaten there. On my next trip I will make a point of dining there! Front desk was very accommodating and let me have a late check-out so that gave me time for a long walk around Seattle before leaving. I would definitely stay here again!

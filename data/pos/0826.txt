we stayed at the Inn January 2ns through 7th, 2011. It was the most amazing stay. The hotel was decorated so well and the courtyard is exquisite. Our room was a 2 level suite and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The bed was the most comfortable bed EVER. The staff was always available for anything we needed. Our room faced the water and as we were 1/2 block from Pike Place we could watch the early morning fish deliveries and ferries arriving and departing. The location is perfect and we walked everywhere. Definitely we will come stay again.

My family stays at this hotel whenever they come to visit me in Seattle. The rooms are very nice, updated and clean. The beds are VERY comfortable with down comforters and plush pillows. The higher rooms have amazing views of downtown and the waterfront. If you are in Seattle for shopping, theater shows, or to explore Pike Place Market and the waterfront, I would highly recommend this hotel as it is only a couple blocks from great downtown shopping (Nordstrom, Macys, Pacific Place, Westlake Center, etc.) and about six blocks from the market. It is also very close to the Fifth Avenue and ACT Theaters. This huge hotel also has a brand-new second tower and Daily Grill restaurant. The only drawback is parking is valet only and runs you about $27 per night, so if there's any way you can leave your car at home I would recommend that. There are also some overnight lots a few blocks away but they are a bit of a hassle. Some great restaurants - Palomino across the street has great Italian food and a great happy hour and drinks. I would also recommend Specialty's Cafe and Bakery on 5th and Union (two blocks away) for great lunch and breakfast food.

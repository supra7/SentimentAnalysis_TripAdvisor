We stayed here for my daughters graduation at University of Washington and it was a perfect location for all the fun downtown and a quick drive to the University district. There were steep hills all around so if this is a problem for some people a cab is readily available to take you wherever. Rooms were clean and very comfortable. Beds were great and view from our bedroom was really nice. We would stay here again!

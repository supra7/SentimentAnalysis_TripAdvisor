We stayed at the Renaissance on 31st May, after arriving from UK, we were departing the next day on an NCL Alaskan Cruise, so we were booked into this hotel for just one night. Overall for a nights stay it was fine, fast check in, great room with lovely big comfy bed (just what I needed after a long haul tiring flight), big flat screen TV, great bathroom. We ordered room service which was delivered within 20 mins, and was of great quality, we were so tired we just watched TV, ate our food and went to bed! In the morning check out was fast, and we walked a couple of blocks north to a lovely shop which sold everything and had a cafe attached to it - had mocha and muffin for breakfast before going back to the hotel to be picked up and taken to the port. The only downside to this hotel I think would be location, it isn't right in the centre of the shopping area, so if you want to do shopping stay nearer to that area (recommend Grand Hyatt).

This was a special trip so we booked a "water view" King room. Fabulous!! Floor to ceiling windows that opened onto a view of Pike Place Market below and Elliott Bay beyond. The room was large with plenty of storage space and comfortable furniture. And the bed is the most luxurious I've ever slept in--helped, of course, by high-quality bedding and fluffy comforter. Every single staff person we interacted with was friendly and helpful. I had occasion to talk to 2 young men during our stay and they both said that they were proud to work for the hotel because of its fine reputation and quality. That says a lot about a place and about the management. If you're considering a stay at this hotel I encourage you to look at the website. It's an accurate representation of the facility, the rooms, and the attitude. I suppose that the location---right across from the vibrant and fascinating Pike Place Market--might not appeal to everyone, but we loved it. Within 2 blocks of the hotel you can find a choice of good coffee shops and a terrific French Bakery. There are a lot of hotels that deserve an "excellent" rating, often for different combinations of qualities and circumstances. Our experience at The Inn At The Market ranked it among the best hotels we've ever stayed in.

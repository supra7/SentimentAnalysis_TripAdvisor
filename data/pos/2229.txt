First of all this is an old building and right in the middle of downtown. If you have any issues with noise bring earplugs or suck it up and stay further out. I really liked the hotel alot and feel I got a great stay for the price. The rooms are small but clean and nicely decorated. I intially got a noisy room near the center of the hotel but when I mentioned this to the desk they kindly moved me to another room since there was space avalable. The whole trip all the staff was freindly and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay and I have to say it was soooo convient to all the sites. We walked alot and when we drove it was fine. The garage is cramped and behind the hotel about a half block. Amazing I read reviews that peeps complained about that. If you cant walk half a block then no use in staying on downtown anyways. Over all I think this was a excellent choice!

This hotel is in a perfect location. Walk outside the front door and your at Pike's Place. Walking distance to everywhere, you won't need to rent a car. The staff was helpful and warm. The hotel has a nice atmosphere with the fireplace, waterfall outside and the views are wonderful. I highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't stay anywhere else. Not one negative thing to report.

We stayed at the EHP during the coldest days in Seattle and had a great time. The staff was very friendly and helped us with bus routes, and light rail, and places to eat nearby. The hotel is in a convenient location to Pike's Place Market, and shopping if you wear good walking shoes. The room was small, but clean and warm during the coldest nights of the year.

I chose the Moore Hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and was very pleased with my choice. I wanted a hotel that I could get to easily by rail from the airport, and the Moore fit the bill. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a bit of a view of Pikes Market and the waterfront. The front desk is extremely helpful, Robert and Tracy were awesome! They helped with bus schedules, restaurant recommendations, and loads of general Seattle information. The room was a bit chilly, but the front desk was quick to offer extra blankets, so we were very comfortable. Even though the rooms do not have a small refrigerator, I bought some cheese at Pikes that the staff was kind enough to store for a couple of days in their refrigerator :-) We were not interested in a hotel with a fitness center or big restaurant, so the Moore was a great option for saving a bit on the room rate so we could enjoy more activities. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I will stay there again. Another tip - consider buying the Seattle City Pass!!!

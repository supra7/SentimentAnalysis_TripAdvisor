My daughter and I stayed here in June of 2010 and found it to be almost perfect for our needs. It was close to City Center, which was very convenient, and was easily accessible by public transit, which was important to us as we didn't have a rental car. The room was small, but had a large closet for our things and a kitchenette. There is a grocery store nearby. We saved a lot of money making our own breakfast and snacking on leftovers from dinner. The place is a little on the funky side, but really cute, and we felt very welcomed by the staff. We weren't bothered by the lack of an elevator, but that should be taken into account if anyone you're traveling with has trouble with stairs. The only drawback, in my opinion, was the fact that the bathtub didn't work. It wasn't that it was out of order- it clearly wasn't meant to function as a tub as there was no plug or tub faucet- just a shower. A nice bath after walking all over Seattle might have been nice.

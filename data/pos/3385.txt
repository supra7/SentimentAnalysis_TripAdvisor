I commute from the SF Bay Area to Seattle for business at least half the year, and every week, I choose to stay at the Hotel Andra. Why? Because it's damn near perfect. The service/reception is about the friendliest/most helpful I've ever experienced, and never fails to help me out should I ever need anything. The rooms are modern and clean without being sterile. Room service includes both food from the phenomenal Lola Restaurant (part of the hotel), as well as Serious Pie, the excellent pizza joint across the street. You're walking distance to both downtown as well as to the Space Needle and other prime Seattle attractions. I'm going up to Seattle again tonight, and for the first time in months won't be staying there because I failed to book far enough in advance, and I can't tell you how bummed I am. I know that any other place I stay will pale in comparison. Can't recommend the Andra enough.

I was a bit wary about staying at the Seattle Sheraton after reading multiple reviews about construction in the lobby and bad service, etc but since my friend & I had Pricelined it and won the bid of $120 per night, we had no choice. And much to our delight EVERYTHING was very good! The location is perfect: Pike Place Market is 10 min walk away, shopping, food, buses are all within reach. We had no issues with the front desk, everyone was very helpful and friendly. It IS a very busy hotel but very spacious lobby that made nothing seem confining. Our room was in the Pike Street tower which I believe is actually the older side which has not been renovated but we couldn't really tell the difference. The room was highly comfy, clean and quiet. There is a pool & jacuzzi on the 35th floor and use of internet (although only 3 stations, so you may have to wait your turn) on the 2nd floor Business Ctr which we used during our 5 day stay. I would definitely stay at the Seattle Sheraton again.

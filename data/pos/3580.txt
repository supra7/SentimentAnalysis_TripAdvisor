I agree with all the nice things that have already been said about Hotel Andra - its perfect location, its gorgeous lobby, its attention to details...Everything is close to perfection. Even the elevators are nice! You really feel in a comfortable place when you walk in, especially in winter. We had a free upgrade from our room to a junior suite - which was a very nice gesture and even though the suites are not huge, it's more than enough for two people. The furniture is modern with clean lines, the bathroom is more retro but has still all the amenities. They provide you with a lot of thick towels and bathrobes, a definite plus on my list!! And the lightning is amazing. But what I will definitely remember is the bedding. The sheets are soooooooooo comfortable, it was hard to leave the bed!!! I would definitely recommend Hotel Andra to anybody who would visit Seattle. I can't wait to go back!

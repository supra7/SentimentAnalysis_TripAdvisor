Everything about this hotel is terrific but for one thing and that is the comfort of the bed. It was quite hard and uncomfortable. However, the location was perfect and so was the ambience. The room was quite roomy and lovely. Everything was sparkling clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. There is a deck on the 5th floor that overlooks Pike Market and Elliot Bay. There were rarely other people there and the view and feel of the place was wonderful. I recommend a stay there even though the bed in our room made for a tough night sleep. I would stay again.

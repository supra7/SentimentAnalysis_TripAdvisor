We stayed here for one night on a Christmas shopping trip. The location is great...very close to Macy's and Westlake Center. The hotel itself was terrific. The staff went out of their way and were extremely friendly. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Many superb restaurants in the nearby vicinity, including Lola's downstairs where we ate dinner. We will definitely stay here again!

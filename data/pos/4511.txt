We chose the Westin because of the combination of price (AAA rate), location and accommodation quality. We were initially a bit hesitant due to some TA reviews stating the hotel was showing some wear and tear. Upon arriving we didn't notice anything like that at all. Our room was on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor and was clean, comfortable and quiet with two double beds. The only quibble with our room was the placement of the television which was at an uncomfortable angle to view when lying in bed. Service from the hotel staff was courteous and professional, including the front desk personnel and concierge. Our room was promptly cleaned everyday although we never saw the cleaning staff. One morning we left for breakfast and returned a bit over an hour later to find our room already cleaned and serviced. Location is perfect for downtown, close to the Westlake Mall, Pacific Place, downtown stores, the monorail, Pike Market and convenient to Qwest Field. The underground bus line, free in the downtown core is a great way to get to the stadium. There are many good restaurants in the immediate area and we walked to every one during our visit; Serious Pie, Shiro's, Lowell's and Elliott's Oyster House. We enjoyed our stay at the Westin and would not hesitate to book a room there for our next visit to Seattle.

We stayed at the Inn at the Market for our anniversary a few years ago. After all this time, we still remember it very fondly and would love to return. The service was amazing. We had last minute car problems and the hotel came to our rescue, so we wouldn't miss the reservation. We loved being referred to by name when coming into the lobby. The conceirge was also fabulous. Yes, the rooms were small. However, they were very well appointed and I loved the city view. I happened to be in the room during housekeeping one day and the maid said to be comfortable while she brewed me a fresh pot of coffee, then poured and delivered it to me in the bone china cups provided in the room.

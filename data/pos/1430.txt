The Inn at Queen Anne is a great place to stay. Where else can you get a nice room with a kitchenette and walk in closet for under $125. a night? All the staff was top notch - from the maintenance men working outside the building to the desk clerks to the shuttle drivers. They were all very friendly and helpful. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and if we visit Seattle again, we will definitely stay at the Inn at Queen Anne. Thanks!

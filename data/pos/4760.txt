I have stayed here befroe and it was not so good, but Now it is the greatest. They have done alot of changes there, like new beds and new carpets and lighting in the hallways including painting of the halls and the breakfast room is so much better now instead of being in the office area. The employees Realy take care of their guest and it shows in their attitude when helping everyone. Their curb appeal in front of the hotel in a mass improvement over what they had before. I am going to stay there again in the future soon as I will be traveling to Seattle alot in the future. I will mention them to ALL my familiy and friend's to stay there if they want to feel special and pampered.

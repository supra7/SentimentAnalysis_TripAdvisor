I stayed at this hotel by recommendation of a business partner and it was fabulous. It has wonderful historic charm and is in an amazing location. After valet parking our car, a ride up in the quaint elevator, and quickly unpacking, we were able to walk to pikes market for diner and some sight seeing. The rooms are well decorated to preserve the history. Note: historic does equal small so if you need lots of space or have several people to stay in a room, this is not for you. I certainly wouldn't pick this room for my large spouse as he would complain all night about the small space and small bed. But I LOVED it. In the morning, I took a quick walk around downtown and appreciated the central location of this hotel! Excellent stay.

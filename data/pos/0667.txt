I stayed here last week and the place was amazing. The room size was ok, but it had a floor-to-ceiling windows with a perfect view of the Pike Place Market, the Puget Sound and the mountains on the Olympic peninsula. I would just walk down to the different places around the market for breakfast and lunch, because it is right outside the hotel front door - it was quite awesome.

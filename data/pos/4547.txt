My Husband and I were down in Seattle for a couple days and we chose to stay at The Westin Seattle because we got a great deal on Hotwire. The front desk staff were extremely personable and friendly. Our room was on the 16th floor in the North Tower (there are two round towers that make up the hotel: the north and south towers) we had a nice view from our floor to ceiling windows of surrounding downtown buildings, the water, the monorail and the space needle. Our room was very spacious with a desk, king size bed, and a comfortable seating area (couch and chair) with lots of space to move around. The bed and bedding were extremely inviting and comfortable. The room has air conditioning which you control yourself which was definitely needed as Seattle was having a heat wave while we were there. There is a pool area which we checked out, the pool itself is indoors with a big outdoor balcony area right beside for sun lovers to lounge on. The hotel is in a great area, right in the downtown core within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants and attractions. If you are arriving by car note that the Westin Seattle has two parking options: valet (entrance located on Westlake Street) when we were there the rates were $39.00 from 5 - 24hrs. The other parking option is a self park garage (entrance located on 6th) and it was $36.00 from 5 - 24hrs. I think both valet and self parked cars are parked in the same garage. An elevator to the parking garage is located just outside the hotel entrance (by the valet parking area). Overall we were very happy with our stay at The Westin and would probably stay there again.

I resentlly stayed at your Hotel , and just wanted to say at first I was not pleased with everything , I thought the room was a little to small for me , and not happy going up and down stairs along with no breakfast , I pointed this out to your front desk agent when I was not in the greatest of moods , she was very friendly and kind with a knowledge of the area ( Gabrielle ) , that I did have a wonderful time at your Hotel and the City of Seattle itself , and yes I will be booking a room at your Hotel next time in town

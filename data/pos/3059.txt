Loved the location, modern (clean) comfort, amenities, staff service and value (got it for $140 through hotwire). We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends. It's located right in the retail core and 6 blocks to Pike Place market (about 5 minutes) - definite must see! All major chain stores, restaurants, and movie theatres are at your doorstep. Wireless internet and flatscreen LCD in every room, computer terminals (free for hotel guests) are locared right in the lobby, and a new fitness centre just opened. Parking is expensive ($38 per day), but the valet jockey did suggest an alternative self-park lot nearby for $10 less. It was raining and we were tired, so we used the hotel valet. If you can, don't drive - there's a shuttle from the airport for $11 each way.

This is a modest, no frills hotel-- but clean, with all essentials provided. Rooms are small but adequate, with comfortable beds, nice linen and plenty of towels. The service was excellent. We received good tips on restaurants, directions to where we wanted to go, etc. The hotel was amazingly quiet. I don't know if there were few people staying there, or perhaps the walls were thicker than usual. I've stayed in much fancier hotels which were also quite noisy.

My husband and I stayed for 1 night. We had never been to downtown Seattle before and chose this one from trip advisor. We were pleased. Tiny bathroom but it is one of the first hotels in Seattle and way back when the bathrooms were small. Our room # 704 was very quite did not hear a peep and I am a very light sleeper. Our mattress was lumpy, they need a new one for that room. I thought they were a bit cheap about the water bottles..... Beware! There is a tag on them saying 4.00 but I was so thristy when I came in I just grabbed it and drank then my husband said "that will be 4.00 dollars honey!" Dinner was very good @ the hotel restaurant and breakfast was fair to good....yucky coffee. I would recommend this hotel as long as your stanards are not 4****. Enjoy!

The Moore SO exceeded our expectations!! People seem to love or hate it. We did reserve one of the suites, which we're guessing might have been in better shape than the standard rooms, b/c otherwise I can't imagine such complaints as I see here. It was clean, stocked with bathroom basics (which i did not expect, given the no-frills descriptions), the room was huge, the location excellent. Given that it includes shared-bath rooms, there were some hostelers (tho the desk clerk noted they get the "good" hostelers b/c they require a credit card deposit), but also other middle aged and older couples. Staff was great and gave great restaurant recs. One item to note: the hotel is over a theatre, and when a band was performing, it was loud, even up on the 5th floor! However, the front desk told us most acts are over by 10, which is what we experienced. We will stay nowhere else in Seattle now (if we can get that suite)!

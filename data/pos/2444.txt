This Renaissance has an outstanding staff in all departments: Front Desk, Concierge, Waiters, Housekeeping, Doorman, everywhere. If there are any problems, then you are probably the problem because the staff is extremely cheerful and go out of their way helpful. The breakfast is worth getting up early for. The location is about 6 steep blocks up from the waterfront, but right off of Rt 5. The rooms vary (we stayed twice in August). This used to be the Madison Hotel before Marriott acquired it, so the rooms are not as big as most Renaissance. But the corner rooms are good size and very nice. The beds are good but not as great as some Renaissance. The exercise room and pool are adequate. The lobby is new and the bar area is nice.

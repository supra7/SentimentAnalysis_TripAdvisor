I booked this "Hostel" online and hadn't looked at the pictures or the review beforehand. Was pleasantly surprised when we got to it. As it was more of a hotel than anything! The prices were very reasonable. Considering the hostels I have stayed in across the US. At $20 roughly a night it was a steal! The location was really good, as Seattle is really easy to walk around! Public transport was really easy to navigate and being in this Hostel your never far from a bus or train station! Pike place market is only a 10 minute walk, with the gum wall and the bay really close by! I would definitely recommend staying here. I had an amazing time!

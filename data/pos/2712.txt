We left the car with the valet parking and quickly checked in with out a problem. The room was immaculate, fresh and up to date. The Christmas throng was in good chjeer and the Gingerbread houses were a main hiliday feature. This is a Great Sheraton property. But the main attraction is the bustle of the Seattle stores that are in the immediate area. Further there are a number of excellenet resturants ready to meet your every need. We were most impressed by the reasonable price for this city get-away. We will return without a doubt.

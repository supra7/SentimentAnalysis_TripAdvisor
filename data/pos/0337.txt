the service was great. when the safe and heat didn't work in the room, they were very prompt in fixing things. all the staff are very friendly and professional. some guests may have pets with them. there was a loud dog barking next to my room for a a few hours. I told management and somehow i didnt hear the dog again. i just hope they clean the rooms pets stayed in extra hard too. The location is great too. can walk to all the great things downtown. it baffles me why people can leave their big dogs at home and baffles me that 4 star hotel lets dogs stay in the rooms. some dogs carry fleas!!:(

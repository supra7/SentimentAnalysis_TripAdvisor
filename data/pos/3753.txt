We spent 2 nights in Seattle in September and picked this hotel because its located right next to the ferry terminal for Victoria, Vancouver Island, which departs all too soon after dawn. As it turned out the hotel and sea view was the real highlight of the whole stay. We had one dinner in the hotel restaurant that's well worth a visit, and although the maitre d' was really quite rude, contact with him was fortunately brief and, the other staff were great and the food faultless. The crab cakes in particular were quite spectacular.

I thought this was a nice hotel. The room my wife and I had was very nice, but this was not the best hotel I have stayed at. I guess from the reviews I was expecting something amazing. The deck was the best part of the hotel. You could sit out there and relax and look at the water or the crowds down at the fish market. The ladies & gentlemen at the front desk were nice and efficient and did their job well. I think the price you pay for staying there is for the location. You are right there by the market and the downtown area, which is quite convenient. I would say if you want to stay at a hotel that is conveniently located and is a nice little hotel, then this is for you.

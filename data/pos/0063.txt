Everything was grand!!! My first time to take my Bandit to the city, she and I LOVED it!! Everyone was so nice, she got a bed and treats in our room. She is a very special 3 year old Papillon. Her and I got to wear our fur coats as it snowed during our stay. She got to meet alot of great other dogs and people :) Thank you! We will be back! Kym St.Clair

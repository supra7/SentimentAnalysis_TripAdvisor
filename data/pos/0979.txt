The location right next to Pike Place Market is the best for sights and eating (even our taxi driver said it was the best hotel in Seattle) We stayed in a deluxe water view room - expensive but a great room with views to chill out in at the end of the day. Or you can take your take away food and eat out on the hotel's sun deck with similar brilliant views of Puget Sound. Staff were very friendly and welcoming and it had a more boutique feel - not impersonal like some large hotels. We had breakfast at Le Panier every day based on previous reviews and it was well worth it for quality of food, drink and people watching being right opposite the market. The view from the hotel was one of the best we have ever enjoyed and the room was very comfortable with fridge, sink and microwave. There are only 2 residents internet stations so it can get busy but the service is free. Overall a great place to stay but maybe not the cheapest. If you can afford it go for it!

we stayed in this westin for a 4 day escape the first week in august. we had a room overlooking the water and it was breath taking. i had room sevice every morning because of that view. you need to see it to believe it. staff was great but forget about getting bellmen service since they never have anyone there. it seems that is not important area to them.we used the conciege a lot when we travel and this was one of the best before the trip and during. all their recomendations were right on. rooms were average but westin hotels have the best beds around. great location to tourist sites and taxi's are always ready out front. great time but i might be biased by that view.

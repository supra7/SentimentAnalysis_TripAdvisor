We had to go to Seattle WA for my sister's wedding. I knew that Seattle was very expensive and I was worried about booking a hotel for me , my husband and 3 teenagers. I looked through Fodors and found University Inn listed with a positive review. It offered free parking and a free shuttle to downtown Seattle. When I called University Inn, the staff was very courteous and reserved a room for my family with a rollaway bed. When we arrived, we were very impressed with the staff. The location was wonderful: right near the University of Washington's beautiful campus. We asked the staff for restaurant recommendations and they gave us a few names of nearby places. All within walking distance and we had a very nice dinner. Five fit very comfortably in the room. The room was very clean, the parking was accessible (right outside the hotel). The staff was very generous with free amenities such as toothpaste, which we forgot., etc. The next day, the continental breakfast was delicious and plentiful. There was free internet access in the lobby, and I had free coffee and afternoon snack. The outdoor pool looked clean and inviting. The next day, we wanted tosightsee downtown Seattle and called the lobby for the shuttle. The shuttle was prompt and like our own private van! It took us to downtown, and can take you to the Space Needle, and we made arrangements to be picked up from downtown at a certain time. When later, we wanted to go back to the hotel an hour earlier, we simply called the hotel and the shuttle driver was able to come by earlier than planned to pick us up. The University Inn had everything we needed and provided excellent service. We had driven cross country 2 times already and stayed in numerous hotels, and we all agreed that the University Inn offered us the nicest stay: generous and courteous staff, free parking, wonderful shuttle, very comfortable beds, a great free continental breakfast, all in a wonderful university campus setting.

I booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. I had stayed at the Four Seasons Seattle last year and loved that, too. When I reserved the room, I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary. When we checked in, they had upgraded us to a townhouse for no extra charge! And gave us this amazing dessert to split with a card signed by the staff. The place is so nice and right near everything. I liked it equally as much as the Four Seasons, and it was a much more affordable price. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know travelling to Seattle.

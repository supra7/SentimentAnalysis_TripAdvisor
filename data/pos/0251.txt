My wife and I and our two best friends recently spent 3 nights in Vancouver, BC and 4 nights at Whistler/Blackcomb ski and mountain resort in British Columbia. We concluded our vacation with 2 nights at the Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton hotel in Seattle, Washington. We had a delightful vacation, with great service and food offerd in our two previous locations. We chose to stay at the Monaco because we have stayed at Kimpton hotels on at least three previous trips, in different cities, and enjoyed the experiences. It was an easy choice for us to stay at the Hotel Monaco. We arrived on time and after a fairly long travel day (6 hours of driving from Whistler with a couple of stops en route) and were greeted warmly by the staff - at the curb at check in and by the counter staff when registering. When we inquired about dining alternatives, it was suggested we consider the on-premises restaurant, Sazerac. We quickly visited the restaurant prior to checking in to our rooms, found the menu to be inviting and the restaurant itself to be warm and comfortable. We enjoyed the wine sampling in the lobby during early evening and dinner at the restaurant was so good we decided to return the next day, after spending the day walking and touring the more popular areas of downtown Seattle on foot. Dinner the second evening was just a good as the first night. Importantly, the concierge of the hotel, the wait staff at the restaurant and all associates with whom we interacted at the hotel were simply superb. I am in the "customer servce business" myself so I have more than a passing interest in observing quality service delivered by other businesses. The hotels of Kimptom we have previosly visited are consistent...clean, very neat, more of a "boutique" sense, generaly reasonably located and fairly priced. We offer our unqualifed recommendation of the Kimptom hotel group. It was a marvelous way to conclude a 9 day trip to the Pacific Northwest.

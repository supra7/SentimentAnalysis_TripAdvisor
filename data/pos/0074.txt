This was our second time staying at this hotel. The lobby is charming as are the rooms. We were able to get an upgrade when we checked in for $20 to a beautiful king suite. The staff couldn't be nicer. We had dinner at Sazerac and the food was very good. We usually don't eat at hotel restaurants, but we arrived late and decided to give it a try. We were definitely pleasantly surprised. Great service and food and plenty of choices. The complimentary hot chocolate with marshmallows and chocolate chips was a nice touch during the holiday season. We would definitely stay here again.

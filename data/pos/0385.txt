We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 nights over MLK weekend. We loved the decor, the plush animal robes (nice to have, but not so soft), the flat screen TV, in-room Strabucks coffee with the coffee maker, and the Aveda bath amenities (the website now says they have L'Occitane amenities). We got a corner room, and the layout of the room isn't your typical rectangular shape, so it was nice. It was nice to have lots of sitting space next to the wide wall-to-wall window. We also loved the plantation shutters along the windows, but there are gaps that let in a lot of light. It was bright in the morning. An extra layer of curtains would help a lot. I called a few days before checking in to request a goldfish for our room. There was no goldfish when we arrived. We asked for a goldfish the second day. Unfortunately, the fish was just about to die the next morning (most likely from lack of oxygen in the bowl). It put a sad note upon leaving this place. This is our first Kimpton Hotel experience. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. It didn't feel like a typical hotel. Will likely stay at another Kimpton hotel again.

We booked this hotel because of its downtown location and proximity to the pier where our cruise to Alaska departed. Arrived in Seattle two days prior to cruise and also on the day the cruise arrived as we had a late night flight. Extremely good value for a large, comfortable room with a good downtown location. This is easily of 4 star hotel with 5 being the highest. Staff was extremely helpful and polite and knew what the word "service" meant. We did sightseeing and taxis were always available at the door. All in all a very satisfying experience. What one would expect from a Marriott.

We had only three days in Seattle......and this was the perfect location. Pike Market is literally out the front door with all of its shops and restaurants. The busy market crowd is high energy and colorful making it a great place to just hangout during the day. At night everything is closed up and cleared out so you can simply enjoy the views and peacefulness of the Sound. There are plenty of great restaurants within a few blocks, many with views of the water or city. From the hotel the waterfront views are amazing and the patio on the fifth floor was a great place to retreat at sunset with a bottle of wine and sandwich. You can watch the boat traffic and ferries shuttling out and back from the the islands. The ferry docks are are less than a 10 minute walk. 10 minutes the opposite direction and you can board the Monorail out to the Seattle Center and Space Needle. Or simply walk 10 blocks to the historic district. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The rooms were exceptionally clean and nicely appointed. I'm not sure what could have made our stay any more enjoyable.Can't recommend it enough.

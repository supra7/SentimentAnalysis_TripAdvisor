I went to the Westin with another co-worker for a conference. When we arrived by airport shuttle (greyline, very convenient!), we were promptly checked in by a nice gentleman (Brian). We asked for a space needle view and we were granted that wish with a smile. There are 2 towers, so make sure you know what tower you are because they have totally opposite elevators. Our room was 4432. We had a direct line view to the space needle. Gorgeous! The room was nice. It had 2 heavenly beds, a nice double head shower (kind of low set), no name toiletries, a desk, TV, internet access from noon-noon for $10, a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, hair dryer, & closet. Not like some of the Westins I have stayed in but overall it was really nice. The view made it great. This hotel is right downtown but it is a 7 block or more walk to The Pike Place market and piers. Though, the hotel is right by the monorail to the space needle ($4 round trip) we walked it and it took like 15 minutes tops. The concierge people were extremely helpful when planning tourist events or making dinner arrangements. They even had coupons for a cruise through the locks. I did slip getting in the tub and I bruised my shin but, that is probably my fault. The conference facilities were nice and the food they served was good as well. I would stay there again. But maybe would consider a place closer to the market and water next time if it was the same cost. This hotel is priced very competitively with other hotels in its class making it a great overall value.

My husband & I just got back from Seattle on Thursday June 28, 2007. We booked our room at the Sheraton through Priceline and I thoroughly read all reviews on this site. I was a little concerned by the mixed reviews. I completely understand them now. Construction did not interfere with the hotel experience at all. The lobby is beautiful. Our first night we were given a room in the Union Tower. The room was wonderful. Super comfortable bed. Everything was bright, clean, & new. Flat screen TV, lovely bathroom. Everything was great. I couldn't understand the poor reviews. The next morning we had a message that they needed to move our room due to "plumbing maintenance." We said, "no problem" (we were hoping to get a king size bed) Well, they switched our room to the other tower and when I asked the girl if the rooms were as nice she replied, "They have a different decor, beauty is in the eye of the beholder." So up we went, to discover why this hotel has poor ratings. The beds were virtually the same, but the carpet was dirty, the walls were mucky, the bathroom was old and dark, and the furniture was so big it took up the whole room. We walked right back down and requested a room in the first tower we were in, they were accomodating. If you stay at this hotel, make sure you have the new tower! The location is great, the staff is friendly, and if you get a nice room it is a wonderful place to stay.

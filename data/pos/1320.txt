This is one of the large mainline downtown Seattle hotels. It is at 5th and Seneca, which is quite a bit of an uphill walk from Pike Place and the Waterfront in Seattle. So if you want to walk downtown Seattle (which is easy and VERY fun to do), you'll need to be prepared for two to three blocks of big uphill climbs. The hotel itself is designed so that the rooms have excellent views and they do. The rooms are large and have all the typical Crowne Plaza amenities, but the beds here were just a bit more firm than most Crowne Plazas, almost too hard for me. While management has clearly added enough updates to bring this hotel up to par with most in its class, the bathrooms could use more updates like newer sinks/tubs. My sink fixture didn't work well and the tub and faucet looked old. Since this is a very tall hotel, having a good elevator is important, but they are undergoing a major elevator repair project right now and that leaves only one or two working at one time which really backs things up. They need to speed ahead with the project to limit inconveniences. This hotel's location is just a bit farther from some of the fun stuff that I'd like. Ideally it would be closer to Pike Place Market and the Waterfront, but you can probably get a better price here than most of the other higher class downtown hotels. Seattle itself is a great tourist destination with lots to do. You can walk almost anywhere in downtown here and when you get tired, the buses are free in the downtown zone before 7 p.m. They also have convenient bus service to SeaTac from the new transit tunnel that will turn into the light rail stations in 2009. This will save lots of money when visitors don't have to pay $20+ for cab/shuttle rides to and from downtown. We did not have a car here and didn't miss it at all. You can very easily save $ by taking the bus to and from the airport and walking up the hill to the hotel.

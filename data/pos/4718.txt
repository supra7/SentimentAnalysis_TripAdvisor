Just got back from Seattle after 7 days stay at the Travelodge. Hotel is clean, room at up-dated, staff was wonderful. Front Desk employees all wonderful. Breakfast was decent, nothing great, but what they have is good. Our room was on the third floor looking at the Space Needle, great view. The only thing that I can say I was not happy with was the TV in our room. It was old and very, very dark. That should be change. For everything else, I give it a 4 star- The location is great, you are walking distance to the Seattle Center, monorail and Space Needle. I only have good things to say about the Travelodge.

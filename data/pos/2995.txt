I recently stayed in this hotel for a recent vacation to Seattle. I originally chose the hotel because of its proximity to the convention center that is across the street, since I was attending a large convention there with friends. Upon arrival service was swift and pleasant, and the staff accommodated my simple request for some extra pillows with great speed. The rooms were well furnished and spotless, and the view was of the typical American big city downtown. Around the hotel there are plenty of restaurants, and you're only 4 blocks easy walk from Pike's Place Market if you'd like some fresh food or just like to sightsee. Its also incredibly convenient for scheduled tours since most of the companies pick up and drop off at this hotel. The only complaint I had, and its one everyone has, is the cost of parking but there is nothing one can do about that.

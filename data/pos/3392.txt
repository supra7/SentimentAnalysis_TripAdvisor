The location is perfect, within walking distance to several area attractions. I was glad that I had upgraded the room to get a little extra space. As other reviewers have noted, the bathrooms are quite minimalist and not what one would normally expect. The lack of vanity area and very poor lighting can be an issue. The staff was lovely, very courteous and helpful especially the doormen. One of the very best things about Hotel Andra is Lola restaurant, but that will be a separate review :-)

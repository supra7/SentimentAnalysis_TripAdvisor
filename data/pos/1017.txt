My work keeps me away from home, so usually the last thing I want to do is travel on MY free time. But the opportunity to come up to Seattle for a romantic getaway was too good to resist. Friends had told me about the Inn at the Market (I had never stayed there on biz), so my wife and I booked a room. What a great decision. Every part of our stay was terrific. The hotel is right in the heart of the Pike Place Market, and our room overlooked the water. Everything was perfect, and we had an enjoyable weekend touring the city and the Market. We enjoyed a bottle of wine on the rooftop deck and watched a spectacular sunset on Saturday. No question about it -- we'll be back.

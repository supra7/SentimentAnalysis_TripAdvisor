My husband and I stayed in the Hotel Monaco Seattle over the Labor Day Weekend. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this hotel. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The front desk always greeted us warmly by name upon arriving back at the hotel each day. We received several great recommendations for restaurants from numerous staff members. The hotel is very clean, decorated nicely and kept up well. The rooms are nice and the beds are SO COMFORTABLE after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel's restaurant is very good, the wine reception in the afternoon is fun, and you get lots of other nice amenities with your stay. Do not hesitate to book a room at this hotel!!!!!!!!!

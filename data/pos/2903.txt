Great location and staff, room was cleaned every day. The only draw backs I found were the room doors closed very loudly and you must be a SPG platinum member to access the club lounge. I'm a gold member and I didn't even rate a free continental breakfast.......I'm going to select the yes for recommendation, but only for platinum members.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night last week before we headed up to Vancouver, BC. If you want something clean with a great location, which are my only two rules when booking a hotel, then this is the place. It's not the fanciest but we arrived around noon, which is hours before check-in, and they had a room available for us. I'm an extremely light sleeper and they were able to fulfill my request for a higher-floor room, so we weren't right above the bar/grill on the first floor. The bed was comfy, the TV was a flat-screen and the shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion in the bathroom were in adorable containers hung against the wall. Also, I love how they had a recycling bin in the room. Gotta love the Northwest for being so environmentally conscious! The hotel is walking distance to the Space Needle. Seriously, you walk out the main entrance and voila -- there it is! I'd say it's a 10-minute walk at the most. It's also walking distance to Downtown Seattle (Pacific Center, tons of shopping and restaurants) and Pike Place Market. I'd say a 10-15 minute walk, but you don't even realize it because you're walking by all the shops and restaurants. The only thing I didn't like was that the Wi-Fi was shotty. It took us forever to log in and the connection was really slow. It made me wonder if they only have one router on the first floor for the entire hotel because we were barely getting a signal. Since we were only there for one night, we gave up on trying to connect and just did everything on our smartphones.

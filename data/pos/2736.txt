The Sheraton Seattle is in a great location, near city center, a short walk from many attractions. It is an older, but renovated, hotel. We paid over $200/day for our room and stayed there three nights. It is pricey. Starting with the positives, the front desk was very good. A person there helped me resolve a credit-card issue. A concierge (Anne) was extremely nice and helpful in her advice and dinner arrangements (elsewhere). The top-floor pool/exercise area was also very nice. The room was OK, although lacking in chairs. The bed was excellent. I liked the coffee-maker with the Starbucks coffee supplied. On the more negative side, not to have free WiFi in the rooms is unconscionable. Sure, I could have used the high-speed connection in the room...for an unknown charge. I went down to the lobby to use the free WiFi there, but I only managed to connect at about 16KB/sec, much slower than old-style modems. Having one computer (in the lobby) to print boarding passes was nice, but there was usually a line there to use it. We had a problem with our Starwood "Starpoints." I guess we need to pay something for those.

I probably would have given this hotel a 4 out of 5 - but the amazing customer service I experienced put this place over the edge. Everyone, the bellman, front desk, servers, room service etc. went out of their way to make sure I was happy and taken care of. The roof top bar is not to be missed. There was a local musician doing a show in the lounge on Friday night - nice touch. This is an older hotel, but they have really made an effort to update the guest rooms with nice dark wood and granite. However, the windows are old and a bit drafty. My room on the 25th floor had a fantasic view of the harbor and other nearby builings. There isn't a lot in the immediate few blocks, but I was easily able to walk to the Seattle Art Museum, Pioneer Park, the Waterfront and other tourist sites.

I lived in Seattle for many years and recently relocated away from this great city. I took a trip back to catch up with friends and see some local theater. I was able to secure a great rate at the Madison and had heard good things about the hotel from friends who had stayed in the past. The hotel is currently undergoing the massive renovation to the rooms. If you stay here be sure to request a renovated room. The hotel sits right on the freeway, so rooms on the East side of the building can be a little noisy especially down lower. I was thrilled to get a room on the 27th floor looking to the south UNTIL the earthquake started - or what I first thought was an earthquake. It turns out that the hotel health club is on the 28th floor and when someone decides to run on a treadmill it literally shakes the rooms below. This wouldn't be so bad, but they open the health club at 5AM and apparently there are some health fanatics out there that think a run at 5AM is a good idea. For those of us who prefer to sleep in on weekends this makes for a very unwelcome wake-up call. I don't know what the hotel management is thinking, putting the health club above guest rooms when the building clearly isn't insulated well enough to prevent this unpleasant intrusion AND opening the health club at 5AM. Granted this only creates an issue for a small percentage of rooms, but it's unpleasant if you end up in one of these rooms. Otherwise I liked the hotel very much. James at the concierge desk was extremely helpful helping even this jaded ex-Seattlite find new restaurants, fun places to explore as a tourist and shopping deals. He truly has his finger on the pulse of Seattle!

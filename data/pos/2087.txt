We stayed in this hotel two years ago and had a good experience then (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered to come back this year). The hotel is clean, friendly and it has a nice authentic touch. We stayed for four days in two adjoining rooms with a bathroom in the middle. The rooms had enough space, the beds were okay and we liked the antique details like the lamps and the doors. Also great was the distance to Pike Place, shops and restaurants (Crocodile Caf is fun, also for breakfast!). The bathroom was a bit small but the shower was hot and the origami towels were really nice. But... don't expect roomservice or fancy shampoos. Accept that (in the weekends) there is some noise from the street below. And don't bring to much luggage, for it might not fit in the elevator in one time.

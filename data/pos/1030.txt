We just returned from a weekend stay at the Inn. We wanted a great room in a great location as we were without a car. This is THE place to stay in Seattle if you are interested in wandering the streets on foot and sightseeing the Pike Place Market neighborhood. You are right across the street from the Market and in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. It is only about a few blocks to West Lake Centre and the monorail to the Space Needle. When you get tired of strolling around this great city just head back to your beautiful room at the Inn. If you are wondering where good customer service has gone, look no further. The Inn has obviously put alot of effort into hiring/training customer focused staff. Don't waste your time or money looking anywhere else.

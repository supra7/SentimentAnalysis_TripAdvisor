I've read a lot of the negative reviews and I don't get it. We were on the city side, with a view of the parking lot and the noise of the trains, but none of that mattered. We barely heard the trains, and we definitely didn't sit around staring out the window. We easily walked to the Space Needle, Pike Place, even Safeco field. The view from the restaurant and the lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are so cozy. And although the parking was a little expensive, the service was exemplary; the valets, doormen, front desk, servers, housekeepers, were all great. We'll definitely come back!

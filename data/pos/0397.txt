The Hotel Monaco is a quant, charming place to stay in Seattle. The lobby is beautiful and serene, with wall murals of Greek dolphins frolicking in the sea. We stayed in a standard king room and it was decorated in a whimsical, unique style. The room was also comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located in a nice central location and within walking distance to a lot of local attractions. The hotel also offers an hour of indulgence, which is a beer and wine tasting. It was nicely done and the day we were there they had a fortune teller. It was a lot of fun. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back and would recommend it.

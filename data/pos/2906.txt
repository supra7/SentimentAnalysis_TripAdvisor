We stayed two nights. We did not rent a car but took the light rail which has an exit real close. That saved a lot of parking fees. We didn't rent a car until the day we checked out (Alamo is one block away). The hotel is right downtown and there are plenty of places to eat and entertainment. Cheesecake Factory across the street as well as Game Crazy and movie theater (If you have kids). Pike street market is straight down the street and plenty of things to see just walking around. The place to catch the monorail is 3 blocks away (takes you to the Seattle Center/Space Needle). I'm writing all of this to let you know you don't need a car when you stay here. Save a few dollars. The rooms were very clean and the beds were perfect. Had a good nights sleep. We had a corner room so we had a view of the harbor and downtown. Lots of windows on two walls. Our kids had a room in the middle of the building and the room had one window. Seemed more closed in. I would ask for a high corner room if you can. Makes the experience of being in downtown Seattle that much better.

I've been meaning to write this review for about 1.5 years now - I love this hotel and everything about it. I'm there on the average of twice a month for business, so I think I know of what I speak! The Edgewater is pure Pacific Northwest. The interior is in keeping with the beauty and style of the area, with high beamed rustic ceilings and big fireplaces. The location is fabulous - it's built on a pier right on Elliott Bay. The view from the water side rooms, restaurant/bar and common area is nothing short of spectacular. You can watch the ferries and sailboats go by, watch the lights come on from across the bay, watch a storm come in, see the Olympics on a clear day - wow, just gorgeous. Every room has a fireplace, which is very cozy and takes the chill off Seattle nights. The bed - it's wonderful - with just the right amount of firmness and cool, crisp sheets. The bathroom is all done in stone - I liked it so much I copied it for a remodel I was doing of our house. The gift shop has the best selection of gifts -- and scarves -- that I always buy something unique there. The staff is superb! I'll do a special call-out to Tanya, the manager and Rick, the bellman. They are so helpful and nice and make me feel very welcome. The bar is a blast - great happy hour with good drinks and small plates. Lunch in the restaurant is amazing, especially the "bento box" lunch where you can taste many of their specialties, including their excellent clam chowder and house made potato chips. I cannot say enough about this hotel. I've traveled a lot, and this is still one of my top 3 places in the world. If you go, spring for the waterside and enjoy!

We spent three days here in September in a Club Level room. The room was well appointed, with great views on the 33rd floor. We especially enjoyed the complementary continental breakfast and evening hors d' ouevres in their club room on the 32nd floor. The breakfast selections were fresh and well presented, and the evening hors d'ouevres (with optional beverage service) were a nice treat after a long day of sightseeing. The club lounge was a sedate aiery where we could relax and reflect above the hustle of the city at street level. The public areas on the ground levels were well kept, and nice looking. Fresh orchids were found throughout the lobby and lounges. The desk staff were especially professional and accommodating, and did a nice job of making us feel welcomed to their property. The rooftop pool, sauna and health center while adequate was busy busy busy, so if you really have to take a dip when you vacation, be prepared to do it with a big audience.

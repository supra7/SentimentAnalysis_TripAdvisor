The Sorrento Hotel is quite away from the touristy waterfront attractions being just to the east of I-5, the interstate that bisects the city. It's an older hotel but has been very well maintained. Service is extremely good in all areas and functions. The remoteness is not a handicap - there is a courtesy car that will gladly take you to downtown or tourist areas of the city. And many excellent restaurants are within easy reach of the hotel, sitting where it does close to the capitol hill district. Almost like enjoying the best of both worlds, so to speak. Raders of my reviews will note that I often gripe about the "nickel-and-diming" attitude of charging for time on computers and printers at a hotel's business center. Not at the the Sorrento... they care about their guests and are not into petty stupidity! Business center facilities are free of charge. The atmosphere, decor and ambiance is classy and of a superior grade. There's valet parking which is advisable anyway due to the fact that the hotel is situated on a busy junction with no campus apart from a very small forecourt. Criticisms? Few: (a) there is only one small elevator serving the entire hotel but this did not inconvenience us often despite the fact that the hotel was almost full during our visit, (b) we signed up for a bed-and-breakfast package and received a voucher for a free daily breakfast. The vouchers apparently have a face value of $32 which doesn't go very far if there's two of you and each has a $3 cup of coffee to start... In general terms, this is a very good hotel for either business or pleasure travelers and should be seriously considered by visitors to Seattle.

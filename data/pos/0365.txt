I have actually stayed at this hotel twice for a total of about two weeks. I enjoyed the downtown location and great room. However, if I had paid for a hotel myself, I wouldn't have splurged on it. I don't recall the exact rate, but it was around $300 per night. OUCH! The staff were friendly, but have their hand out for tips at every juncture. Valet parking is for the birds. Give me a parking lot and I'll get my own car, especially if I have to come and go more than once per day. Bottom line: If you have disposable income, this hotel is a place where you can feel pampered, but I'll stick to other options.

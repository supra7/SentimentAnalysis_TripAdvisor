I booked 2 rooms at the Inn at the Market back in March. 3 weeks ago we needed another room. I got 2 nights but needed one night more. I called each and every day, sometimes twice a day, for 3 weeks trying to get that one night to no avail. Maria who was in reservations took my call 5 out of 7 days a week. She knew me by name. The day before we were to arrive I called one last time and got Maria, same story, no rooms were available. Defeated, I cancelled my reservations. I was bummed because this is where I've always wanted to stay. An hour later, I got a call from Noelle, the reservations manager, who informed me that a room had opened up and the reason she called me back was because Maria had told her of my diligence. I was thrilled! The Inn at the Market has a location that can't be beat! It is steps away from Pikes Market, about 1/2 a mile from the monorail, close to shopping and many restaurants and the rooms are clean with very comfortable beds and the staff, is so very friendly and helpful! There is a balcony on the 5th floor with views of Mt. Ranier as well as surrounding mountains and the beautiful ocean. A wonderful hotel complimented by a wonderful staff!

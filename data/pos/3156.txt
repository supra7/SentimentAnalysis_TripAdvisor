We usually stay @ the Seattle Westin, but since I had a convention from June 30-July 2 @ the Sheraton, we stayed here. They put us in the new upgraded Union Street tower on the 24th floor. Very, very nice room. Plasma tv, nice amenities, bathrobe. I think they upgraded us to that room because we are Starwood Preferred Guests. There was a free bottle of water for me 2 of the 3 mornings. The food in the restaurant, The Grill, was good. It is located approximately 5-6 blocks to Pike Street Market, 2 blocks to Nordstrom and maybe 4 blocks to Macy's. It's 2 blocks to Pacific Place and 4 blocks to Westlake Mall. We walked towards the alley by Pike Street Sunday evening hoping to find somewhere to eat dinner, we stumbled on this wonderful restaurant called the "PINK DOOR". I highly recommend it. It's in the alley and overlooks the Puget Sound. Anyway, the check-in and check-out was great, we had to valet park ($35 per day) because the regular lot was full ($28/day). Still like the Westin for it's waterfront views better.

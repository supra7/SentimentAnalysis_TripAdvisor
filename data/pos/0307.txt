We do an annual overnight trip to Seattle using Priceline roulette - bid on a 4 star and see what you get. This is the first year we got The Monaco, and it turned out quite nice. They put us in a nice room with two beds (my wife and teenage son - 3 of us total). The room was spacious and nicely furnished. They are pet-friendly, and although we left our dog with friends, the hotel "loans" you goldfish to keep you company. Sounds corny, but Robert the Goldfish spent a nice evening with us. The hotel is right across the street from the fabulous Seattle Library and close to many other amenities. The in-hotel restaurant, Sazarec (?) is, however, only average. We ate two meals there which were hit and miss depending on what you ordered. But the free wine tasting every night helps . . . .

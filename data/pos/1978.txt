My husband and I, reeling from the $500 cost of a two-night stay in a popular chain hotel in Portland, made it a point to search for a less expensive option in Seattle. We're both glad we did. The Moore Hotel was comfortable, quiet, and clean. We even had views of the Seattle Harbor from our seventh-floor room! And it cost us only $100 a night, including tax!! It was a fabulous deal. (The only drawback that we saw is that the room wasn't air-conditioned. But we were comfortable and cool regardless.)

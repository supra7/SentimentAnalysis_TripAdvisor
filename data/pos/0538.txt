When we first read reviews about this hotel, we became skeptical. We decided that maybe people expected too much based on the hotel name/advertisements. I believe we were right! We stayed for 2 nights with our 2 teenagers and had a great stay. Our request for a high level room with a view of the Space Needle was fulfilled. The pool, hot tub and sauna were available and well maintained (although the hot tub could have been hotter). The location is within walking distance of Pikes Market, the Space Needle and downtown shopping. The room we stayed in was a bit smaller then other hotels we have stayed at and paid less money for, however it was clean and comfortable (no complaints about the sheets from us). The room had a "well used" look, but keep in mind the hotel was built in 1981, so it is 28 years old. We were dismayed that there is a charge of $11.00 per day if you wish to have internet access from your room, and parking was $27.00 per day for covered and secure parking verses $25.00 for uncovered unsecured parking outside the hotel. The balcony wasn't much of a balcony. More like a ledge with a rail, but it did allow us to step outside to see and hear the city from our room. All in all we had a great stay and enjoyed ourselves. If you are expecting The Ritz or Breakers, you will be disappointed and post a snooty not so good review about this hotel.. If you are expecting a clean, comfy hotel with a pleasant staff and good location to downtown Seattle, then we recommend it.

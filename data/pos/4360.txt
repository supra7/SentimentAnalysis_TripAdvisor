Enjoyed staying there on business. Beautiful room but it would be great if they provided bottled water and had the clock next to the bed instead of behind it. Walls are a little thin. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious. the place is mostly very nice and well run. Like the workout center and lobby bar.

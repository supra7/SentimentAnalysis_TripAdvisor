I was up for a conference during the high season and was able to book this hotel for two nights of my six night stay in Seattle. My flight was late and didn't get to the hotel until around 2am. I wanted one thing -- to be lying in a comfortable bed. I appreciated this hotel for several reasons - its right off I5 - just a couple of turns and you are parked and checking in; the staff was excellent - always helpful and informative; the location is great - walking distance to Pike Place and all of that fun riff-raff; the lounge at the top of the hotel was quiet and comfortable with a great view (I'm a gold member so this probably doesn't apply to everyone); the queen bed was really comfortable; the room was quiet - your mileage may vary I was in Seattle for a conference and booked some of my meetings in the lounge. That worked out perfectly, as it was private enough, there was coffee service and ample seating area.

The staff at this hotel make the difference. The location is perfect. The rooms are comfortable, but the friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff really make the difference. They set up tours for us that were perfect. We had a picnic every day in our room with treats we bought at Beecher Cheese, Le Panier, and Pike Market. These were all an easy walk even for someone like me who has mobility issues. The staff helped with reataurant suggestions. Our room was spotless. There was a beautiful bouquest of flowers waiting for us when we arrived. We would not even consider staying anywhere else when we return to Seattle.

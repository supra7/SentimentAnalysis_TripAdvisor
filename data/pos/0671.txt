I visited Seattle for the first time last month for a cousin's wedding and extended my stay for a few days on my own to get to know the city. The Inn at the Market was perfect: steps from the Public Market and very easy walking distance to other great sites and/or public transportation to get to points further out. Great bed, awesome waterfront view, nice rooftop deck overlooking the Market and Puget Sound, very friendly and accomodating staff. I've run out of superlatives so I'll leave with: If you go, I hope 'the mountain comes out' as the view is spectacular. Not sure how likely that is, as I believe I actually found a place with fewer sunny days than Rochester NY!

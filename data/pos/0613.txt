We visit Seattle at least twice a year, and The Inn at the Market has been our hotel of choice for a very long time. The reasons are many: the rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated/ furnished, and quiet. A trip to the hotel's rooftop deck is a must for a panoramic view of Elliott Bay. The staff is welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate their guests..."welcome back!" is the usual greeting when we arrive. The Inn's prime location is a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum, the Seattle Symphony, shopping and many fine restaurants, including Cafe Campagne and Marche, both located on-site. If you're ready to ditch the corporate hotel experience, the Inn at the Market is for you.

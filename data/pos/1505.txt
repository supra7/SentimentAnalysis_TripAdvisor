Thanks to tripadvisor we found this hotel. It was a Great location...Walking distance to the Seattle Center! (10 minutes) This is where the Space Needle is, I recommend eating dinner here!! Delicious. There are other eateries around every corner. Also Seattle has a great public transportation system. The buses are like clock work. We stayed 2 nights here. The MarQueen at one time was an apartment complex. So your hotel room looks like a small apartment with a kitchen. :) We were only there 2 nights so didn't use it much, but good to have. They also offer a car service which we utilized to take us to the pier 91 and to the airport. Ask about it! It was well worth it. If and when we ever make it back to seattle we will definetely stay at the MarQueen again! Oh, and we faced the busy mexican restaurant we couldnt hear it. So the windows are sound proof. And as far as that bat goes... too crowded!!

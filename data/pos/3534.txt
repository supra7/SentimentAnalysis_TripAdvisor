All of our dealings with hotel staff suggested the hotel's commitment to service. We needed to change a reservation in advance and it was handled courteously, with an offer of a confirmation over the phone and a prompt email follow up. Our flight arrived early in the morning and a phone call inquiring about baggage storage and valet parking before check in time was met with an immediate, "absolutely!" Our room was ready for us at our 10:30AM arrival and the concierge was professional in inquiring about what we wanted to do, and gave us great suggestions that led us to see things in Seattle we would have missed. Upon check out, we were asked about our stay and a "we hope that we sill see you again." We responded that we were returning at the end of a week stay in northern Washington, and were greeted with, "I'll make sure you get a nice room." A week later at check in, we were greeted by name, and a nice room. The location is with in walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do in Seattle, Pike Market, Museums, the library, Seattle Center, and restaurants. Lola down stairs and Dahlia across the street were wonderful. There was some street noise, but not beyond expectations for an urban setting. We found the King Suite comfortable, with luxurious bedding, robes, and toiletries. There was ample storage in a closet, a large screen TV, small sofa, and large desk. The bathroom was small, but quite adequate to our needs. The price for our stay was very comparable to other, lesser properties, and less than other quality hotels we considered. I would definitely stay here again (in fact thinking about a get away weekend in the fall), but will not rent a car, as we didn't need one.

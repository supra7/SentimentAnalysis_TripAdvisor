In a perfect location in the heart of downtown Seattle, the Mayflower Park Hotel epitomizes elegance and old world style: every aspect of our stay was perfectly lovely. It offers all the charm of the earlier era in which it was built, while maintaining all the modern conveniences as well. My husband and I were able to walk to all the sights we wanted to see, and were also advised by our friendly and knowledgable front desk clerk while we checked-in; we enjoyed the hotel so much, we decided to stay a second night to bask in the luxury.

Stayed in a corner suite and was well worth it. This hotel gave us a great AAA discount, otherwise couldn't have afforded it. So be sure to ask. Even with this discount, we were treated with superior service. Arrived before check-in, so they held our bags as we did sight seeing. The desk staff helped us check in for our flights, reserved transportation to airport and even helped "weigh" our bags to make sure they weren't too heavy to check on the airplane. They recommended restaurants and brought us extra terry robes for lounging in our room. Even the clerk who took my reservation weeks earlier was very helpful and explained details of the room and said often the corner suites have a view so I requested a view. We ended up with a super view of the Space Needle. We had 5 people in our group so had one room with 2 double beds, which were very comfortable, and a large sitting room (where we opened a cot at night) with bar and TV and the excellent views. The TV in the bedroom didn't work but one in the sitting room was fine. Best of all we had 2 bathrooms which is great with a group. This is a good location to get to Pike's Place Market (about 4 blocks) and to catch the monorail (right around corner) to the Space Needle. Also close to shopping, the Nordstrom Rack, and a food court in the mall (good for teenagers), and of course coffee shops. Around the corner was a courtyard in front of an office building with a band playing during lunch hour. Wouldn't walk around this area too late at night. Came back from eating at Etta's after dark and was glad we were in a group. We have paid a lot more $$ for a lot less in service and quality so with our great experience at this hotel and we would definately stay here again.

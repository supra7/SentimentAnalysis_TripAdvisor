My family and I have stayed here on 2 occasions and have been impressed each time with the courtesy and laid back quality of the employees. Of course one can't beat the location, either. I flew in from China and it was an easy 2 blocks from the light rail station to the hotel. It's easy to take public transport to anywhere in the Puget Sound area. The hotel specials are the best around and beat out anything else in this category.

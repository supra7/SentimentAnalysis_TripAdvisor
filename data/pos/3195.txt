We were there Memorial Day weekend and had a great stay.. - Large, very clean rooms and bathroom with lots of closet space - FANTASTIC location, especially if you like to be close to good restaurants and shopping! A bit of a walk to Fisherman's Wharf area. - Staff was very helpful and had great restaurant recommendations We would definitely stay here again!

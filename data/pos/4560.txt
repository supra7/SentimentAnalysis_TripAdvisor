We stayed two nights at Westin after 7 day Alaska Cruise. The hotel is centrally located in downtown area with easy walk to Pike Market, malls, restaurants and Monorail station. The room was very nice and the bed was plush. The Grayline runs bus service to and from hotel and airport, so was only $11 each to get to airport from Hotel. I took a chance on Hotwire and booked 4 star room and ended up with the Westin for a great price of $79 a night. Right a cross street from great restaurant called Icon Grill and two malls. Had a nice dinner at restaurant called Mexico in the Pacific Place mall. They have the best fitness center I have ever seen for a hotel. Also womens and mens locker rooms by fitness center and indoor pool plus hot tub.

I managed to erase all of the music from my phone right before my flight except for a Nina Simone album, so I was in a perfectly elegant, classy mood to walk into the elegant, classy Sorrento Hotel last Friday. I love it! It has managed to maintain the look and feel of a gorgeous early 20th century hotel mixing in modern conveniences, and then topping it off with a wonderful friendly staff. Oh, and the rooms are HUGE with lots of light and the beds are *super* comfy. And its just a short walk to the waterfront, to the gaming arcade (guilty pleasure) and to a handful of local fine diners. Two thumbs way up!

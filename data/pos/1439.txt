We searched on line for somewhere to stay in Seattle for a LONG time. It seemed all the choices were either very expensive and fancy or a little less expensive with shared bathrooms/no parking/other issues. We settled on Inn at Virginia Mason and it was a great choice. It's one of the lower cost hotels in downtown Seattle, the parking fee is not horrendous ($18 overnight), it's a clean/safe place, and - best of all - room service until 11 pm with low cost, really good food. And gratuities are not allowed! A very good choice if you need to stay in downtown Seattle.

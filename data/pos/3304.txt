We used priceline and got a price of $65 a night at this hotel. I read some of the reviews and was a little scared but was pleasently surpised when we arrived. The location was AWESOME. We had planned to do a bunch of tourist attractions and attend 3 Mariner games while we were there. About 4 blocks away was the monorail to take you to Seattle center (space needle), and the same location was the transit station where the light rail link took us to safeco field (and went all the way to the airport as well). There was also a Trolley that took us north to the Argosy lakes cruise. We parked our car for $15 a day (which was alot cheaper than anywhere else) and just either walked or took transit. The hotel was a little old, but I didnt care since we only paid $65 a night for it. The room was clean, the A/C worked perfectly and the bed was pretty comfortable. We had a room right above the returant so we actually had free wireless internet in our room which was nice. We were located right next to the gym and laundry room and heard some people run on the treadmill. We really didnt spend too much time in our room, but the time we did spend there I found to be relaxing. I would recomment using priceline or hotwire to book this hotel and not pay full price, but for $65 a night it was Great.

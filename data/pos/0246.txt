I was in Seattle for 3 nights over Labor Day weekend. I booked the Hotel Monaco taking advantage of Kimpton's summer weekend special. The location is excellent - walking distance to Pioneer Square, waterfront, Pike Place, shopping district. It is also 1.5 block to the light rail station. Keep in mind there is a moderate hill if you're walking eastbound to 4th Avenue. Staff friendly and welcoming - always greeting me with "Have a good day" when leaving and "Welcome back" when returning. Room and public areas are nicely decorated. My room had a very comfortable bed, flat screen TV, and a safe big enough to store my 17 inch laptop. I enjoyed the late afternoon wine reception that is a Kimpton hotel feature. Internet is free for Kimpton Intouch members - all you need to do is sign up for the program.

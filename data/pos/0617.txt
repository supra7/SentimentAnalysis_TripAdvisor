We were staying in Seattle for two nights after a several day ski trip in Whistler, B.C. and before flying home to NY. After the long drive back to Seattle through the mountains, the hotel was a welcome comfort. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted in front of the hotel by the friendly valet attendant who also assisted us with our bags into the lobby. At check in, we were happy to hear that we got a complimentary upgrade to our room. The room was clean, plenty of space, and upon entering, we noticed the beautiful view looking out onto the Puget Sound, and it just so happened to be sunset. Our king size bed was lush and enveloped us in goose down comforter and pillows. Our bathroom, also spacious was immaculate and well appointed. We had plenty of room in the hotel fridge to store our small amount of travel snacks and drinks. The concierge was helpful in suggesting a place to eat, and we explored the area surrounding the hotel, which happens to be smack in the middle of the Public Market at Pike Place. Tons to see, tons of places to shop, eat and grab coffee. We even enjoyed an after dinner stroll on the outdoor garden of the hotel which is safely perched up on the 5th floor. If it had been warmer, I would have loved to have pre dinner drinks on this deck. Check out went smoothly and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

I stayed here during a convention, with a discounted price. Every single staff member I encountered at the Renaissance was over-the-top friendly and helpful, and that made the stay memorable. It's a pretty good business-class hotel, not as nice as the Seattle Hyatt or Fairmont, but good enough, with very good food in both restaurants, an adequate health club, a very comfortable bed (but not-so-good sound insulation between rooms), a refrigerator in the room, good lighting in the bathroom and good water pressure in the shower. It is a bit of a hike from the downtown center, and that's a disadvantage for a woman on her own in a city that is not very taxi-oriented.

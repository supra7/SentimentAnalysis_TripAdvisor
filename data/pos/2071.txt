The Moore Hotel is the best deal in Seattle. On a recent winter weekend, they were charging half of what the other downtown hotels wanted. Don't let the somewhat shabby lobby scare you off. However, while the front desk staff is great, service is lacking. A broken light fixture in the closet went unrepaired despite 3 requests. (Aren't energy effiicient light bulbs great.) Also, avoid the rooms with bath down the hall. Finally, ask for a quiet room away from the 2 busy streets. You can't beat the location -- close to Pike Place Market and the restaurants and shops of Bell Town. Take the 194 bus from the airport--just a $1.50 non stop.

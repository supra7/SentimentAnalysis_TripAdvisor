Great room and view. We had early flight into Seattle. Hotel had room ready and welcoming. There are many great hotels in area, Hilton, Red Lion. I would not hesitate to stay at any of them. Crowne Plaza was great for us, though we spent most of our time at market or shopping. Recommend using light rail from airport to University St station. Inexpensive though takes longer than we had anticipated. The people in Seattle were extremely helpful. One flight attendant walked us to light rail platform - it would have been difficult to find without the help. Great places to eat -Pikes Brew Pub, the cheese making place on corner by market. So many good bakeries, coffee shops, chocolate, wine.

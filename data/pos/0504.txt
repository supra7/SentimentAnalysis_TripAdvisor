We stayed for a couple of nights at the end of a long trip and it was just the ticket - yes, the decor's a little dated and the reception area's a little crowded with people in a hurry to check in or out. Yes, the pool is the size of a postage stamp. Can't comment on the breakfast because we're a little cheap so we walked across the road to Ralph's deli. Clean, comfortable air-conditioned rooms in a faded-elegance way, good bathrooms, friendly helpful staff, good location with a bus stop right outside. Good beds and linens. Our 11th floor room had a great view of the needle. What's not to like? We paid via Trailfinders, booked it before the start of the holiday, so not sure what we paid compared to other people, but we thought it was good value for money. Next time we're in Seattle we want an apartment though so we can take full advantage of Pike Place market!

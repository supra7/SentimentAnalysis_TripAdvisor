My husband and I just returned from our trip to Seattle and truly enjoyed staying at the Westin. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We were very pleased with our room. We had a great view of the water and the cityscape. I looked forward to my showers in the morning with the double shower head. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay downtown.

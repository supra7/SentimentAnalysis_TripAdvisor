My husband and I had a combined business/pleasure trip to Seattle last week and stayed one night in the Executive Hotel Pacific. We picked the hotel because it was close to our business appointment, close to the tourist area on the piers along Elliot Bay, and extremely reasonably priced. Throughout our stay the Executive Pacific staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. This hotel is older, with worn carpeting on our floor, but very clean, with newer furnishings in our room. Our bed was very, very comfortable. My husbandd had noticed on their website that they would offer a complimentary upgrade if space was available. So he asked and we received a complimentary upgrade from a queen to a king room with a view of Elliot Bay. This hotel is within walking distance of tourist activity on the bay front, financial district, Pioneer Square, the Amtrak station and if you are a good walker it's not that far to the Space Needle.

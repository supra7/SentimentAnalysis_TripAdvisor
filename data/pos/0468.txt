flew into seattle on thursday morning, and neded a place to stay for 1 night. everywhere was booked, found this hotel and loved it ! pricey but well worth it. turned on internet in room at 8pm and in morning it was OFF. $11.00 / 24 hours... so, i am not sure why it was off. it said for 24 hours, did that mean the 24 hours of the each day? oh well.... we didnt stay to figure it out. had we stayed longer though, we would have inquired.

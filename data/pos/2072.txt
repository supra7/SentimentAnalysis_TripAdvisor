My girlfriend and I were in Seattle for my birthday, staying at the Sheraton. My girlfriend is the type to always seek out the hotel were she can have room service for every meal; she loves to be waited on. Well, we missed out departing flight and were stuck in a city with ZERO rooms available (Neil Diamond was in town). We needed to book a room fast. I got online and found nothing, and then I came across the Moore Hotel. Not only did they have ample rooms, but the rate was CHEAP. My girlfriend complained the entire way to the hotel, because it wasn't the Hilton, Four Seaons, etc. She nicknamed the place the "No-Moore Hotel" befre we even arrived. Once we arrived, the hotel had SO much personality. Everything was exceptional, rate paid considered. We will both be staying here every time we visit Seattle. I can not go on about this place enough!! I truely rate this hotel five stars for its charm and resonable rate!

After reading some of these reviews I was quite surprised by how wonderful this hotel really is. It was very clean and neat-- nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room that we had was what I would consider to be an above average size for a big city hotel. I did not find it too hot or too cold. The bathroom may be a problem for some people who are larger because the toliet sits right next to the bathtub. I also enjoyed having Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on the ground floor for breakfast pastries and coffee every morning. The hotel is within a close walk to Pioneer Square, the Piers, Pike Place Market, and Nordstrom, etc. We even walked back from the Space Needle at night and it was not really that bad-- but definitely pack your best walking shoes.

A bit out of date but we stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel on two separate occassions during August 2008. We stayed here on our first and last nights of our three week holiday and both times this hotel was excellent! Both times we had a room on one of the upper floors with excellent views across Seattle. The rooms were a good size with a double bed, seat, desk and chair, TV cabinet and TV. The beds were very comfortable and we had a great night sleep on both evenings with little or no noise. We had breakfast in the hotel during our first stay and the food was good but we felt it was a little bit expensive so choose to eat out the second stay. If we went back to Seattle we would definately stay at this hotel again as the location was fantastic (five mins walk from Pike Place) and we felt it was good value for money.

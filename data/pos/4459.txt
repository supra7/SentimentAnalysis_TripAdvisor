Pros - Easy to find off I-5 with large parking garage and easy valet. 1 block from monorail at West Lake Centers. Right in shopping area- easy walking distance to Pike Place Market. Friendly staff at check in. Our room was ready and waiting. Elevators were swift and only crowded once when we tried to leave. Staff were friendly at check out - even with a problem with our bill. (mini bar got "bumped") Rooms were nice. Comfy beds and clean feeling. Nice tub/shower and toiletries. Great view of Space Needle & Lake Union. Cons- $39 parking. Ouch! Elevator was pretty full at one point and we had to wait about fifteen minutes for one to open up. Mini bar is sensored and even the slightest bump will rack up your bill. Be careful!

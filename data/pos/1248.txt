I was instantly impressed with the service of the staff- not only were they friendly but they were very accommodating! We were there with another couple and we both had rooms with a great view overlooking Seattle! The only thing that I would have to complain about was lack of free wifi for paying patrons. I think that this day and age it should be a given. $20/day is a little steep. There is a free business center provided for guests- and it even has a free printer. This was great- but wifi would have been even better. We WILL be back - we absolutely loved the whole experience and I was tempted to take home one of the pillows because it was so darn comfortable!

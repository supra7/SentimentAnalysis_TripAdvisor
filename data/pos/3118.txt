Stayed here for some holiday shopping. Got a great deal with a Macy's gift card included. The valet parking was awful. We had a hard time getting off the freeway to the hotel. We then learned it was the valet parking drop off. When we went to get our car the next day at check out it was over a half hour wait. We need to have a member of our party to the eastside in half an hour. We had to take a taxi there & then come back for our car. When we came back we were told 25 minutes & it was actually 45.

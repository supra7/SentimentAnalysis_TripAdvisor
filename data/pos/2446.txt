The Renaissance is a nice, modern hotel. We paid $175 on priceline.com for a double room - same room goes for $240 on the hotel's website. We wouldn't have booked without getting a discounted rate. Biggest disappointment with this hotel was that they didn't offer a breakfast nor do they offer free internet/wi-fi access. Overnight parking costs $30, but you can go in and out with room key. The hotel was located at the North end of Downtown Seattle and not really in walking distance to main sites (unless you want to walk back up steep hills). We took cabs to the market and baseball game, but didn't pay over $10 on a cab ride and the trips didn't take more than 10 minutes. Hotel is right on I-5, but we didn't notice the traffic with the window closed and a/c on at night.

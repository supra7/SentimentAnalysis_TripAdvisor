Room was nice and comfortable. The bar was terrible. Expensive drinks, bartender was awful. Had limes for drinks but did not want to cut them. He was stealing the place blind by charging for drinks but not ringing them up on the register. He added gratuity to the bill on the first night and did not mention it until I saw the receipt and commented. I have never seen an automatic gratuity added to the tab at a US bar. We didn't let our bar experience ruin our stay. The check in staff was outstanding and friendly. We liked Silver expecially. Would stay here again. $85 one night and $130 for NYE. A bargain.

This was our first trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Hotel was the perfect place for us to stay. As noted by other reviewers, the location is a serious plus - walk to Pike Market and the waterfront and next door to all transportation (light rail, buses, and streetcar). The staff is friendly and professional - very hotel employee greeted or spoke with us - and assisted with restaurant recommendations and directions. Be sure to have drinks and appetizers at Olivers (Hotel bar). Our room (10th floor corner) was very clean, quiet, and well appointed. Housekeeping personnel noted when we left the room and serviced it immediately so that when we returned it was cleaned and ready for us. The bellcaps even helped my husband map out a route for his morning runs. This is a great hotel for your Seattle vacation.

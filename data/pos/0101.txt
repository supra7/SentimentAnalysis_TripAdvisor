The rooms were quite spacious and comfortable and the lobby was old fashioned and lovely. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. On the down side the lighting over the sink in the bathroom was very dim as was the lighting in the room in general. I overheard guests making jokes about the very dark elevators and the hotel trying to save a little money. Housekeeping was sloppy. Had to call twice for supplies. The location is really perfect. Can walk to the Library or Pikes Market easily. Do not try to eat dinner in their restaurant before 8:00 P.M. It's a real "happy hour" hangout and extremely noisy. The other Kimpton Hotel a block away has a very nice Italian restaurant with extremely good food. Would recommend that highly.

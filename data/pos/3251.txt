Our tour company changed our hotel in Seattle at the last moment from a rather dodgy looking out of town motel to the far better located and more upmarket Sixth Avenue Inn. It cost us a little more, but in the end we were more than happy to have paid the extra, as our stay was very comfortable, the service was good and the location in the downtown area is great (handy for Westfield, the Space Needle etc). I had emailed in advance to ask for a quiet room (some of the earlier reviews complained about thin walls and noise from traffic) as we would be tired from the long journey from London, and we were very pleased that our request was heeded, giving us a good few nights sleep before joining our cruise ship to Alaska. I have no problems in recommending the Sixth Avenue Inn as a no-nonsense but perfectly acceptable base for a stay in Seattle.

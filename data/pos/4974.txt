I have only good things to say about this hotel. The room was large and had a good view, the bed comfortable, the bathroom quite adequate. Staff friendly and helpful (they even did the webcheckin for me for my return flight). Internet connection was flawless and free. Hotel is very conveniently located in the city. What more can I say? The hotel even welcomes pets and has a special attention for them, which puts me in a very good disposition even if when I travel long distances for business I don't travel with my pets. This hotel is great value for the money and I highly recommend it.

I was in Seattle for a few days and decided to try this hotel. Upon check-in, the staff was wonderful. I arrived early and was given the choice to check into a room that was already ready on a lower floor or wait about an hour for a room on a higher floor. For me, being given that choice was big. When I've arrived early at other hotel and asked for early check-ins, I'm normally given some horrible room looking at a brick wall. I decided to wait and as promised, within an hour a room on a higher floor was available. I really enjoyed the location. It was within walking distance to Pike Place and major shopping. I had an upgraded King room which was wonderful. I had more than enough space. The only two negatives I would say were the price for parking and the slow internet speed. After taxes, it came to like $41 a night. Unfortunately, it seemed to be in line with pricing with other hotels in the area. I did not try the hotel's restaurant. As a member of their rewards program, I got the free internet service. All in all, I had a good stay and will probably stay there again.

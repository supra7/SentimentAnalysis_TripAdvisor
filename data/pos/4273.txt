We were in Seattle for some sightseeing, so this hotel had the perfect location for walking to both the Pike St. Market/waterfront and the Space Needle/Seattle Center. We took the Light Rail from the airport to downtown and the walk from the downtown station to the hotel was very manageable. We were pleased to be able to utilize public transport and to save the money on a rental car/parking. The room itself was nice, although a little outdated. The bathroom also seemed pretty small for a Westin. I did enjoy that the building was curved and that the room was set up with the bed at an angle to look out the window. We were on the 8th floor with a room overlooking the Monorail station so the view was less than desirable. I know now to definitely request a high floor. There was a lot of street noise during the day, but luckily it quieted down at night to a level that didn't disturb my sleep. We were able to pay for our stay with some SPG reward points plus a little cash. So for the price we paid for the hotel we didn't feel we could complain about the floor we were assigned. I would consider staying here again if I come back to Seattle because of the location, but I definitely would want to make sure I got a good deal again.

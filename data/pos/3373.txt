I travel to Seattle on business every two-three months and Hotel Andra is my favorite palce to stay. It's in Belltown within easy wakling distance to Pike's Place Martket, Seattle Art Museum, shopping and great restaurants. I typically stay in a superia room which has a sitting area, desk and kitchen counter. The bathrooms are small but functional with good showers. There is also a separate dressing/make-up area. I've also stayed in a suite a couple times; it is a bit bigger and as comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. Wifi is included if you are a Stash rewords member. Drawbacks include pricey valet/overnight parking (but that may be typical for the neighborhood) and you can hear traffic noise even on the higher floors. All-in-all, a comfortable hotel with fabulous food a stone's throw away.

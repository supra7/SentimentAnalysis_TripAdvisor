We were first given a room on the 32nd floor with an excellent view of Lake Union but we immediately requested a change due to the noisy ice machine right outside our room. We were then assigned to a room on the 25th floor, not as high up as we would have liked, but the hotel room did have a magnificent view of the Space Needle and the city. We slept with curtains open just so we could admire the view nightfall to sunrise. It was amazing! The service was excellent and timely. The bed was comfortable and we did have quite restful experiences! I thought I was going to be disappointed with the furniture given some of the reviews calling it outdated etc., but I thought everything was fine. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in a central location, within walking distance or a short bus ride from all major downtown Seattle locations.

Having booked at last minute to escape the University Tower hotel (see review), this proved an excellent last minute find. Central, clean rooms and good views, albeit the rooms themselves even on the exec levels weren't exactly spacious. Try and book the executive rooms if possible - good choice of breakfast and hors d'oeuvres through the day makes the overall package palatable. Restaurant a little pricey but good food - if only staying one night, skip this and try Benihana just down the road from the hotel, great food and atmosphere.

Great location in downtown Seattle; friendly, competent staff; well-appointed rooms. Spacious room with wet bar, separate dressing area, charming (if tiny) and well-designed bathroom--overall a departure from the chain-hotel template. The location was perfect--about halfway between the famous fresh market (which we visited--you gotta see it to believe it!) and the high-end stores (which we did not visit!). :-) Also had a great breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. Overall good value for the $$. Slept well on comfy beds, too--very important!

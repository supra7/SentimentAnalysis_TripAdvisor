We found the Warwick on Tripadvisor and it was a great choice. I was looking for a reasonable rate and close to all the downtown attractions and this was a good choice - you even get Ralph's late nite grocery across the street. The restaurant is a bit pricey - but not out of range for a downtown, upscale eatery.

A wonderful place to spend your honeymoon! Well greeted by front desk staff and valet. In fact, some of the best customer service Ive experienced period. Foyer and sitting room have the old world elegance of a fine European hotel. Our suite was impeccable with luxurious bedding, marble bath, and fine champagne. Great attention to detail is evident in the choice fabrics, woods, art, and colors used in the room. As expected, the suite was exquisitely maintained. The entire Sorrento staff was attentive to all our needs yet respected our privacy. Such a perfect place for a romantic getaway, were already planning our 1 year anniversary at the Sorrento later this year. Highly recommended for those seeking an elegant room, perfect service, old world charm, and fine dining. What more can you ask for?

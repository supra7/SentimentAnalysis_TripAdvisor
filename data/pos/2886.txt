Hope you don't mind sitting at the dest in the room, because for $11/day that what you get if you want to connect to the internet. My wife and I both use computers for work. We both have WiFi-compatable laptops (as does most travelers). We found that the only way to connect to the internet is to share time with the hotel's ethernet cable. Aside from that, the property is great - including the free pool and fitness center.

This is our second stay at Inn at the Market - the first time, several years ago, we were staying at the Fairmont and stumbled upon "The Inn" on a walk to Pikes Market. We knew at that time, any future visits to Seattle would include a stay at the Inn at the Market. Service is impeccable (and, hotel staff so friendly!), the beds comfy, nice bath products...all that you would expect at a hotel at this price point. Go for a view room, if you can. We had the good fortune to stay in a deluxe water view room and I must say that having a glass of wine on a deck overlooking the Sound was second only to waking up and having coffee on a deck overlooking the Sound! I could get picky and say that it would have been nice to have a double sink in the bathroom - that thought popped into my head for a second - but you will see, the place is so not about that.

I stayed at the University Inn to attend a conference at UW. The room was splendid and was very clean. The waffles available for breakfast were extremely delicious. One complaint was that the boiled eggs were very cold every morning but besides this the breakfast was great. The seating area for breakfast was a bit small but we managed very well. The hotel provided a free shuttle that took you to Pacific Place and this was very useful to us. At the front desk, Jennifer was very helpful and assisted in making our stay even more comfortable. Overall, this hotel provided great value and service for the cost. We would definitely stay there again!

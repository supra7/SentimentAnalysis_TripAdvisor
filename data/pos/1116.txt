We stayed at the Ace Hotel for the last leg of our Pacific Northwest trip, and seriously considered extending our flight just to we could stay another night. If only there were more hotels like this.... okay, maybe hotel isn't the right word for it. Adult Playground Hostel might be more like it. Ace Hotel is in a perfect location, on a quiet strip of 1st avenue but less than a 10 minute walk from the Pike Place Market and downtown. The rooms look like they are out of a CB2 catalog, and despite the tight fit, they are actually decorated quite nicely & with a trendy flair. There is breakfast served every day until NOON (awesome), and the employees are very friendly. Don't be discouraged by the shared bathrooms and showers. Although a 1 second walk outside of your room is required, the bathrooms are still very private and, if anything, cleaner than many of the real hotels I've stayed at. Long story short, stay here. You won't regret it -- and neither will your wallet.

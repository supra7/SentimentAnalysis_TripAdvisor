We just returned from our first trip to Seattle. We had another "favorite ranked" hotel booked by the Market - but changed to Hotel Andra after reading reviews(and a better price). We loved everything about this hotel! They helped arrange a car to pick us up at the airport & greeted us by name when we arrived. Everyone was always courteous, helpful and had a smile. Our two room king suite was wonderful...comfortable bed, huge closets (so we didn't have to live out a suitcase for the week) and good amenities. The location was perfect for us - close enough to walk to Pikes Market, Seattle Center, and fabulous shopping! We had awesome dinners at Dahlias, Lolas, Serious Pie and Assagio...all just steps away. We absolutely loved Seattle - and will definitely stay at Hotel Andra on our return trip!

Excellent hotel. It may only be rated 2 star but it provided us with excellent service from friendly staff in a relaxed atmosphere. Who could ask for more? Any concerns we had about the shared facilities were quickly dispelled and it was actually a positive thing not having the loo, shower etc en suite. Recommend this hotel to travellers looking to engage with Seattle life.

I'm generally a fan of the Kimpton brand and decided to give this hotel a try on my most recent trip to Seattle. Check-in and check-out were efficient and friendly and I had a very nice room on the 11th floor, with an interesting view of the city. I didn't hear much street noise at all with the windows closed, although at one point I had to keep a window open slightly to keep it from getting stuffy. Breakfast at the attached restaurant, Tulio, was very nicely done and the service was attentive. The hotel also puts out free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning. (It would be nice if it were left out a bit longer -- it's sometimes nice to have a cup later in the morning or early afternoon.) I believe there is also an evening wine reception, though unfortunately I missed it each night due to work. The location was great. I was able to walk to and from my downtown meetings and sneak in a quick visit to the Pike Place market area during my spare time. There's a very small fitness center with 3 cardio machines and some weights. It seems like it could get crowded quickly, though I never had to share it with more than one other person. The staff that I interacted with were incredibly helpful. One desk clerk even tracked down a compatible charger for my cellphone when I mentioned that the battery was nearly dead, and had it delivered to the room within about 5 minutes. Very impressive! My only small criticism of the hotel would be that the lobby area feels a bit cramped, especially when a larger group arrives at check-in. But this really didn't affect me at all, and overall it was an excellent stay.

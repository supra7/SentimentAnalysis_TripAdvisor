After reading some of the previous reviews of this hotel, I have to say I was quite scared of what I might find. I was very pleasantly surprised. The bookings went smoothly, check-in and express check-out were both quick and painless. The staff working were all very friendly and were helpful in recommending restaurants and attractions. The room (2 double beds) wasn't anything fancy, but did include a mini-fridge, coffeemaker and was clean with comfortable beds. The bathroom was clean, although the paint on the tub was peeling and the showerhead was like a powerwasher - way too much water pressure. The outdoor pool and hottub were small but perfect for a quick swim to cool off. The area was great, we could see the Space Needle from our window. All attractions were within walking distance. All in all, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel.

We stayed in a suite for 1 night in Sept. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Loved the lobby, velvet chairs, rich dark carpets, very warm and inviting. Great location, up from the market. Will stay again when visiting Seattle. Oh, and really appreciated the old style wood paneled elevator...classic.

I don't understand what all of the other poor reviews are about. The rooms are smaller than some places but you can walk two blocks to the space needle, swim in an indoor pool, it's 5 minutes from the zoo, a huge breakfast is included and the price is great. We were impressed with the helpfulness of the staff and of the extras we received for the price. We purchased the Zoo package and saved about $30 off of our zoo tickets. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, even remembering me from booking over the phone two weeks prior. There's a great indoor pool and hot tub and the rooms have been updated since we stayed last. Though there were some bleach spills on the carpet outside our room, the rest of the place was clean, beautiful and fit our needs perfectly.

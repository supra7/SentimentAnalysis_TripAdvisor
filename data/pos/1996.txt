If you drive a Lexus and your wife has had expensive augmented surgery, you'll likely not like this hotel. But if you live in the real world, it's awesome !!! beds were VERY comfortable, shower was perfect. Toilet was great! View was great. TV worked and rug was clean. Staff were friendly and knowlegable. Eco friendly.

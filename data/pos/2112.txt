I just got back from a five night stay at the Moore Hotel in Seattle. For $65 a night I paid it was an amazing deal! My room was on the 6th floor, and I had views of the bay. The room was large, clean and quiet, if somewhat dark, and the staff was friendly and helpful. the one drawback was the clawfoot tub in the bathroom had no decals or bathmat, so if you are not careful it can be a bit slippery. The front desk does not provide bath mats, so you may have to spend three or four bucks on one while you are there. The location is also really convenient, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market, and within easy walking distance of Pioneer Square and the main shopping area, as well as the location to catch tourist buses and cruises. Also, the Metro bus (which is $1.25 to $2.00 depending on the time of day) to and from the airport is just two blocks away. Would definitely stay there again when I go back to Seattle, and at those prices I can certainly afford to!

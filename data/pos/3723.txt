Stayed at the Edgewater just one night for a business meeting, but would love to go back and stay longer. Although some people think the rooms are small, the two of us found it to be very comfortable and spacious. Love the fireplace sitting area. The ocean view is awesome and worth spending a little more to have it. I would love to have the updated bathroom in my own house, including the french doors. Although a bit pricy, the food was excellent. All staff members were friendly, polite and helpful. Enjoyed the photographs of all the musicians who have stayed there, including the Beatles. Never heard the train once. Would go back in a heartbeat!

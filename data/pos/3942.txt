Having read some of the reviews was a little hesitant, but we had a great long weekend stay. Rooms are on the smaller side, but tastefully decorated and fireplace and bathrooms are nice touches. Staff very friendly and helpful and location very convenient, less than 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market and right on the water. They provide hourly shuttle van service to most of downtown, but it is limited to first 7 people, so make sure to show up 10-15 minutes early to guarantee a seat. Only real complaint would be the internet service. I don't mind paying $10/day but it really was tempermental in room, worked consistantly well in lobby, for the daily fee you would hope they could get their network to work a little better.

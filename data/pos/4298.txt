I stayed at the Westin for 5 weeks for an extended business trip. While this hotel would not be my first choice for an extended stay, I had a very nice room with a gorgeous view and a great central location. It was not ideal for an extended stay because there were no coin-op laundry facilites on site and there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. However the property was very nice, the location was great for shopping, dining, and all the downtown tourist attractions, and the room was spacious, modern, and well kept. I had no problems with the staff who were very accomodating. Ask for a room on the highest floor available. The views are fantastic!

My wife and I just pent 4 nights at this beautiful hotel. The service was very friendly and accommodating. We had a junior suite that was perfect in size, comfort and decorating. I highly recommend this hotel. The food at the Hunt Club was very good and we ate at the bar as the restaurant was empty.

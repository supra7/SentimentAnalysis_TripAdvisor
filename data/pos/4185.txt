The hotel was everything we expected from a Westin. The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. Our room was well appointed. We were not happy the Wifi was not free, but its not the end of the world. The pool and hot tub was great. We really liked the conveince of the changing rooms with lockers and showers. Parking is expensive like every big city hotel. We found a lot 3 blocks away that was only $10 for 12 hours. The Westin delivered the level of experince you would expect.

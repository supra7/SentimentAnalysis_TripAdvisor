The Renaissance Seattle Hotel provided for a nice, spontaneous & romantic getaway to Seattle. It was my first reservation made on Priceline. I was able to get a room at the Renaissance for $129/night + taxes. The hotel is in a good location, and it's the typical old but not quaint downtown hotel. We were able to request a king, non-smoking room with a view of the Sound and downtown at time of check-in. The bed was comfortable with nice linens and comforter. The only down side to the hotel room was the very small bathroom; however, this might by typical for an older hotel. I would stay there again.

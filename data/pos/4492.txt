The Westin was centrally located within the downtown core and just perfect for our family weekend in Seattle. We had a one bedroom with suite attached for a family of four and found it spacious and comfortable. The staff was helpful and courteous. We had no complaints whatsoever. We enjoyed the meals we did eat there and checkout was easy.Taxi service was readily available.We had a fabulous dinner at the Il Bizzarro Italiian restaurant our last evening. It was a 10 minute drive away and great fun.

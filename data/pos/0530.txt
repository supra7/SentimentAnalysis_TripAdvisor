We stayed for four nights last April 2009. My husband cancelled our previous hotel because he found a good rate at this one. I was a little suspicious but was very well satisfied with this hotel. It was situated very well between many key attractions (Pikes Market, all upscale shopping and Space needle were both within walking distance). We had a great view of Space Needle from our room and although there was no breakfast at the hotel there was an awesome doughnut place that was fun, unique, reasonable and right by the hotel. There is also a grocery directly across the street. The most unexpected bonus was the Cinerama across the street. It is the only one left in the U.S. and it was such a nice treat for our family. It played first run movies, but we saw Little Shop of Horrors. It is not to be missed and I would recommend it to anyone going to Seattle. We don't see movies on vacation but the experience of this one is not to be missed. The only consideration is the Ladies shelter located a couple blocks away. We were never approached or anything but we did see a few aimless women hanging around the grocery store directly across the street..again, not a problem but should be mentioned. I would stay in this hotel again. If you are unsure what area of seattle you want to stay in this hotel is perfect...close to everything but not committed to any one area. We did not need our car for this trip (and we had it).

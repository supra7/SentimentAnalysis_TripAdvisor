I dont understand all the negative reviews I read here and on other web sites about this hotel. Dont expect something for nothing and you wont be disappointed. Stayed here with my sister for a visit to Seattle. Reserved through Expedia at 150.00 a night. Upgraded to water view for 50.00 more a night and it was worth it. Beautiful view and nice little balcony to sit on. Bed was comfy and fie place was nice too. Room was small but adequate. Bathroom was very nice and modern. Lots of options for spending extra money, such as snacks and liquor but we simply brought our own bottle of wine and used the complementary wine glasses. Ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was very good and reasonable. Vale parking was expensive but worth it to us. We walked almost everywhere except for one night when we went to dinner. we were in room 238 and it was great. Would stay again.

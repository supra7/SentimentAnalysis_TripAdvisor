You know Sheraton and their worldwide makeover - the new rooms are relatively generic but functional and the beds are comfortable. This hotel has a great central location, open lobby space and friendly employees. The bi-level gym has an expansive view and very good equipment. The associated pool is small but looked fun for the family using it. The club lounge is fine and offers the usual snacks and breakfast. The only downside is that the latter facilities are in the Pike Tower and I was staying in the Union Tower. This is a large convention property and can seem a little impersonal or empty when business is slow and the snow is falling outside. I was very happy with the corner room that offered a sweeping view south and west to the water. This wouldn't be my top choice for downtown but at the right price this hotel will provide more than adequate lodging.

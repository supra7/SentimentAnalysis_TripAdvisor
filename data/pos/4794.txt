Incident: The previous room occupant left some kind of gunk stuck on the bottom of the iron in our room. In the morning, I began to press my shirt collar and it immediately bonded the stuff to my material, ruining the shirt. The management replaced the cost of my shirt immediately, with no questions, in the most respectful way. They never interviewed me about any aspect of my problem, just wanting to make amends. They made a customer of me for life.

I stayed for 4 nights in late August. One cannot over rate how centrally located and convenient to every thing downtown this hotel is. We were in Seattle to visit a friend (who lives on Capitol Hill) and to watch the MLS soccer game. Very convenient to both. Concierges were exceptionally helpful. I never noticed the service staff.

Years ago, my husband and I took a romantic weekend from Vancouver, BC down to Seattle for the weekend. We were lucky enough to get a room at the Edgewater Hotel right on the water. We probably got the room because we stayed there in January, but what a fabulous weekend it was. If you're there to see Seattle, the location of the hotel couldn't be more perfect. The room we had was kind of small, but it was so quaint and cozy, and the service far surpassed all the other hotels we've been to in the city. In the evenings, we'd sit and watch the boats coming into the harbor and just enjoy. We were so close to all the best restaurants in the city, and all of the typical Seattle attractions. The hotel made our romantic weekend very special and we'll definitely go back there, if we can get a room! You'd better book FAR in advance if you want to stay there. You can really enjoy Seattle in a different way when you stay at the Edgewater.

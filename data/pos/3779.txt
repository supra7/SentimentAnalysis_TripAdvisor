Our room was on the water with a large window. We were supposed to have a balcony but the window was great. I would not stay here without the water view. The rooms have been refurbished & are very nice-rustic style. The bathrooms are lovely but the shower fixtures are too high. I could not reach the controls-the wand or to switch to the rain head. Stupid & very unsatisfactory. The restaurant is not worth your time. There are many wonderful places to eat in Seattle but the hotel restaurant is not one of them.

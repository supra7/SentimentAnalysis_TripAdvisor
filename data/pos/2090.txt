This hotel may appear old and run down from the outside but I found it quant, clean, and roomy on the inside. I rented a room that had a bathroom. The room had room and even though the building was older it was clean. The was location was great, (2 blocks from Pikes Place). I stayed for 3 nights. My only complaints were thin walls, (you could hear chatter next door even when others were using speaking voices), and one night were the neighbors liked to party late.

Stayed here for a 3 night stay. On a transfer from Minneapolis to a different airline, Northwest screwed up and kept my bag in their system. I arrived late in the evening and checked in without a problem. The next morning at 8:00 (still no luggage) I went to the concierge desk and asked about local dept stores. The concierge noted they all opened at 9:30 or 10 but she knew someone at the Nordstrom down the street and would see what she could do. Someone at Nordstrom literally met on the sidewalk and took me up to the mens department. I was able to buy some clothes for the day and was on time for my conference. This is what service is supposed to be. Hotel was very clean, nice flat screens in the room and even some local HD channels. The clothes iron was new, clean and actually worked properly (a big gripe of mine in most hotels). Staff was very friendly and they have those cool "Surface" tables in the lobby. My only complaint is the $21 cost for the breakfast buffet and $10/day for the internet (although it was free in the lobby). Overall, a great experience.

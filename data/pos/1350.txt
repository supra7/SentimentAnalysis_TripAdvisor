This is a rather late review since we stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle in May 2006. However, since I have just joined Tripadvisor, I thought It would be useful to leave a review. My husband & I were in Seattle for a 6 night city break. Having always wanted to visit Seattle, we chose this hotel as we are priority club members & we got a good deal booking online. We had a room on the top floor (club level) with the complimentary breakfast / evening snacks & we had no gripes whatsoever. The view was incredible - the space needle & city lights at night just beautiful & the morning sun over the water amazing. The hotel is well located & easily accessible to the main department stores / downtown shopping. Yes, its a little walk to Pike Place & the Space Needle but certainly not miles & its a rather pleasant walk. We hired a car for 2 days & visited some out of town malls as well as the Boeing factory (awesome) & the Microsoft campus. We did go up the space needle & ate in the restaurant one evening - whilst the view was great, the food was only OK & you really are paying for the view (which incidentally, is not half as good as the view from the CN tower in Toronto), so I'd think twice about eating at the top of the Space Needle. All in all, we loved Seattle. The people are so friendly & go out of their way to help. The hotel was perfect for our needs. Clean, efficient & a spacious room. We would definately stay there again.

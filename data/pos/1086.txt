Inn at the Market offers a superb location near Seattle's Pike Place Market, as well as tranquil, well-appointed guest rooms. The hotel is steps from the excellent Campagne restaurant (pricey but worthwhile), the superb 94 Stewart Street (marvelous modern American fare with exceptional wine and cheese choices) and numerous other notable restaurant choices. There is excellent shopping nearby. I recommend Inn at the Market unreservedly for those on vacation in Seattle. The staff is friendly, the room is comfortable and restful, and the location cannot be improved upon. One small quibble: no lobby shop for sundries, and unfortunately the hotel is some distance from a drugstore. If you are a business traveler (as I was), I might send you elsewhere (perhaps to the Vintage Park, the Monaco, or the Olympic Four Seasons) for the following reasons: (1)No desk with task lighting. Although there was a windowed table in my room, it did not have task lighting nearby. I had to order a flashlight to read paperwork while working on my computer at night. (2)Staff will not put Fed Ex charges on your room account. Yes, they will (after some idiscussion) charge your credit card for Fed Ex, but it would be easier to just have the charge added to your room, as most business-oriented hotels will do. Bottom line: lovely place for leisure travelers, but needs a few changes to be top-notch for those in Seattle for business purposes.

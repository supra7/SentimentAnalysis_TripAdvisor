I was in Seattle on a business trip and stayed in a lovely room complete with kitchenette (that I didn't use). Loved the location and the neighborhood. Amazing variety and quality of nearby restaurants. Front desk staff was helpful. This hotel isn't for you if you want the latest plumbing and shower fixtures, but if you value solid character and charm, along with a reasonable price, it's perfect. Windows open which is good. It's a converted convent so has lots of history.

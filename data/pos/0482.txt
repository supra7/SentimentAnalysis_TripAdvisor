For group travel, this hotel was incredible. We travelled with a group of 35 college students for a choir tour. It was difficult choosing amongst several possible Seattle hotels for a one-night stay. We were very glad we chose the Warwick. The person in charge of group reservations was great and had eveything completely ready for us when we arrived, including individual key envelopes with each person's name on it. The check-in took less than 5 minutes. Rooms were clean and spacious, a meeting room was provided and a Starbucks is located just across the street for a quick breakfast.

I have stayed at the Edgewater several times now. It is my favorite hotel for decor and location. The bar and restaurant are excellent, not to mention the view. Its a short walk to Pike's Market and convenient to highways. All the rooms are super cozy with a fireplace and fuzzy bear footrest. The Main Lobby is gorgeous with amazing views and very comfortable places to just sit and read. I love coming to Seattle, just so I can stay here, and there are usually great deals for this hotel online.

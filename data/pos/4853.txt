My husband and I are here at the University Inn right now. It's definitely the place to stay in Seattle. The room we are in has one queen bed and a nice sitting area, with a microwave and mini-fridge. The lobby stocks Tazo teas and the breakfast buffet is tasty! The parking is easy--right next to the hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic--right in the heart of the University District, walking distance to UW campus, and all the surrounding bars and restaurants. It's also very close to I-5 and just a few minutes drive into the heart of downtown. We both HIGHLY recommend staying here. As one reviewer said, it really does feel like a little home away from home. Please feel free to contact me if you have any question about this hotel...

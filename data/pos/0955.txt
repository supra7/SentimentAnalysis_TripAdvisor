Stayed there for 3 nights. A fairly expensive room but worth every penny. Staff was unbelievably helpful when asked about restaurants and things to do in the area. The room was sparkling clean and the room service and maid service was outstanding. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Seattle if I had enough money.

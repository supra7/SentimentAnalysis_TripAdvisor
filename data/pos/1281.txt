The location of the hotel is great. It is within 6 blocks of most of the main downtown attractions, convention center, restaurants, and public transportation access. The facility was very nice. While there are some reviews critical of room size, I felt the room to be perfectly acceptable. The room was well furnished, including a safe and refrigerator. As a Platinum Priority Club member, I had free internet access. There were complaints in other reviews about the normal charges for internet but they are in line with comparable hotels. There were also complaints about the $37 parking charges but I found them to be comparable to similar hotels downtown. Parking at downtown hotels in major cities is expensive, just a fact of life. Finally, all the staff I encountered were very pleasant and helpful,

The Edgewater was a great deal and the staff was excellent. Even though they are located away from downtown, the proximity to the bay area more than makes up for it. Their free shuttle to the downtown area is also an advantage, you are able to actually have a vacation away from the hustle and bustle, but when you want to be downtown you don't have to walk uphill to get there. I stayed there for the first half of a trip with my husband and some friends, then I had a conference at the conference center for the second half and moved to the Sheraton. I was really wishing I could have stayed at the Edgewater. The staff was much friendlier, the view of the bay was relaxing and the rooms were very cozy, especially with a fireplace! The only downside was that they room we stayed in was a little noisy. It wasn't terrible, but I was surprised to hear conversations from outside the room so clearly!

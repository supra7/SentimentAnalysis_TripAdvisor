Centrally located for shopping and other hotels.I was attending a seminar at the Grand Hyatt on Pine St and enjoyed the 10 minute walk each way at the beginning and end of the day. The staff were helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean and I like the Save the Planet program they have in place. I only ate a light breakfast in the lounge/dining room but the staff were pleasant, the ambience agreeable and prices appeared average.

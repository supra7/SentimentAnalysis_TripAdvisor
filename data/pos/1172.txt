Inexpensive and close to downtown without the parking problems For the money this is a great pick. You can drive downtown in just minutes and the rooms are clean, pools is fine, and the views are wonderful. The setting is on the side of a hill overlooking Lake Union just 5 min. north of downtown. Not much within walking distance, and trying to find places to eat without going downtown was not too easy, but after a day it got easier to find things.

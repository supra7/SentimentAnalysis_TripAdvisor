I was worried when I got there...it was an hour or two before check in, but the desk staff made it seem like they didn't have my registration. This was after e-mail contact and a phone call with my credit card. They wanted me to come back for a 3:00 check in. They stored my luggage and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING downtown, so it wasn't a big deal. When I got back at 3 though, I don't think my original room was ready yet, but they gave me a room on the 6th floor on the side street (above the theatre, perhaps?) No view, but the side street allowed me to have the window open all night (no air conditioning- it's alright!) That being said, this is an awesome hotel with friendly staff and people staying there, and it's right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, so the location can't be beat. A car is not needed. Walking and busing got me everywhere I needed to go! I travelled solo (29-year-old male) and felt completely safe everywhere I went, but it you are a nervous traveller, this might not be the place for you. Rooms were simple, the age of the building gave it some character. Appreciated the fan in the room- wouldn't have slept as well without it. I would stay again next time in Seattle!

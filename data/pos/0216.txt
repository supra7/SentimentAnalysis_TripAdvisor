Great attention to customer needs -- I ordered room service tonight, and the attendant named "Fisher" was concerned my ice cream would melt -- so he said he would run it back up to me when I was ready for desert. Great bath products, well designed rooms that are very comfortable, and excellent location in Seattle. I'm writing while staying here Jan. 14-16, 2011. Free internet if you register with their website. Pillow selection and very comfortable beds. I will be back!

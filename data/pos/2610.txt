The room was extremely small, we stayed in much cheaper rooms that were twice as big. But, it was very clean and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. We just didn't feel the value for the price was up to par. It is located near the space needle. Quite a walk to Pike Market, but an enjoyable one. We would recommend this hotel and we would probably stay there again.

We have been going to The Sorrento Hotel for many years over the American Thanksgiving holiday. We love their Christmas decorations, old world charm and live jazz music in the evenings. Their rooms have lovely bedding and are very comfortable and well appointed. Drinks before dinner in the bar is also fun, appitizers are very good. They have a town car which was always available. My only complaint is that the breakfast is only ok for the price - very average. The staff have been there for many years and seem to all get along and even remembered us. A fantastic weekend was had by all.

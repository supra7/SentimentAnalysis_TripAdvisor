We stayed at the Sheraton during a convention at the nearby convention center. The hotel staff were very friendly, and the concierge provided some excellent suggestions for dining and entertainment options in the area. My room was clean and everything worked. I truly wished they had wireless internet so you didn't have to be chained to the desk area. I also noticed two stations in the business center were not working when I visited the area. The 500 bonus points and $5 food/beverage coupon was a nice touch in lieu of housekeeping services during our visit. Overall, a good stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I make it back to Seattle.

The room we had may have been a little small, but I was warned so I expected it, not a problem as we only stayed the one night. The room was very comfortable. Stan at the front door greeted us very freindly and very professional. For a room in downtown Seattle, we found this hotel to be very affordable and within walking distance to many attractions.

I surprised my wife with a weekend getaway for her birthday. I booked a room at The Sorrento Hotel and the exceptional service started as soon as we pulled in the driveway. The amazing service carried on right until we left. We felt like we were the only two people staying at the hotel. We have recommended The Sorrento Hotel to all who will listen and we will definitely be back soon. RP, Sidney, BC

A three night stay (Monday thru Thursday morning). My wife and I had a room on 26th floor. Fine view to the north. Room clean, well maintained, temperature easily adjusted. Plenty of electrical outlets, towels and amenities. A bit of noise from the folks in the next room at three a.m. one morning so the walls are either a touch thin or the connecting doors act to amplify the sound. Not a major problem in any case. Staff invariably friendly and motivated. Restaurant had prompt service and wide choice of menu at all meals. (Recommend the chowder.) Location convenient to several downtown attractions and a taxi stand close by the main entrance was a welcome sight. Did NOT notice the elevators as being particularly slow. Would like to see free Wi-fi in the rooms (who wouldn't?). Otherwise two thumbs up and we'd stay there again in future.

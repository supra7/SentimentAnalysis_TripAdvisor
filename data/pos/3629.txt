Hi, We stayed here as the Second part of our honeymoon, prevously at the Hotel Omni in San fransico. Unlike the Omni we had no room upgrades or discounts as a gesture towards our honeymoon. We arrived fairly late and as a result got room service which came from the resturant attached to the hotel. The food was excellent although very expensive and they added a massive service charge to bring the food to our room. My wife was impressed with the designer shower gels and shampoos. The room was beautiful with a massive bed and all the amenities in the room which you would expect. The location was splendid with only a five minute walk to the stores downtown and simarlaly to the EMP and the Space Needle. The staff were professional, but not particulary warm. I would recommend the hotel if you want a couple of nights in a unique and luxerious room. However, there is no pool or hot tub but is not like a rolled out chain hotel.

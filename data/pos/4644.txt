I stayed at the Westin for a Girl's Weekend Away the last weekend in July. The hotel met all of my expectations and I would highly recommend the Westin for anyone who is looking for a high-end, brand-name hotel in a central Seattle location. The Westin is mere blocks away from all of Seattle's finest restaurants, shops and tourist destinations such as Pike Place Market. You will not need your car because you can walk just about anywhere. My group requested a single room for 4 ladies to share and we were extremely comfortable in a basic King Size Room. The room comes with a King Bed, Sofa-Bed and a Rollaway (when requested). The front desk and concierge were always willing to accommodate and answer questions. Overall it was an amazing weekend and staying at the Westin was a positive experience. ** Fun Tip: If you stay at the Westin Seattle be sure to visit the Dahlia Bakery which is adjacent to Dahlia Lounge. This bakery has the most unbelievable truffle cookies & coconut cream pie. You will find the bakery up the street from the Westin on 4th & Virginia.

You can't beat staying at a hotel where it sits right at the edge of Elliott's Bay. If you're lucky enough, you may even have a room overlooking the bay. The hotel's cabin-like atmosphere with a twist of modernism was very welcoming. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous. Would not hesitate to come here or recommend this place to anyone.

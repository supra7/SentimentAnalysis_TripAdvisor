The hotel is in an amazing location with great restaurants, gourmet grocery, and cinerama within 1 block radius. It has Macy's, Nordstroms, other shopping within a few blocks after that. The mattress was very comfy. AMAZING SWEEPING VIEW of space needle, lake union, downtown, and Elliott Bay. Great pool and gym facility too! Room service is nothing to write home about. Don't get the pizza. Parking was $21. YIKES! Old building, but nicely remodeled.

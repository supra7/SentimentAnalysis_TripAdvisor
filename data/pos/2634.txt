We stayed here for a week while touring Seattle. This was a nice hotel with everything we needed. I was given a choice of room and wanted a quieter room so we stayed on the side opposite the highway. The rooms were good and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was great and included scrambled eggs and sausage. The surface parking lot was full at times but there is also a gated lot that connects to the elevator and is accessed with the room key. We always found a spot. It was convenient to the Seattle Center and a long walk to the Farmers Market water area. I felt that the area was safe. There were restaurants in the area and the hotel staff were very helpful and suggest places to eat. There is a patio on the second floor and the rooms there open onto this area which would have been good with kids. The computer in the lobby could be used for a charge but airline tickets were printed free. There is also a fitness room and laundry. The only drawback was that the hot tub was lukewarm most of our 9 nights stay which would not be a problem if you don't like a hot tub. We would definitely stay there again.

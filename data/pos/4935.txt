We had a wedding to attend and made arrangements for our parents to travel with us. The hotel was very good about helping us with arrangements to get from the airport to the hotel. They even provide umbrellas in the rooms just in case the rain showers start. Enjoyed our stay here. There was wine tasting in the lobby from the Washington vineyards. The lobby is too small for this activity, but it was still pleasant. I also enjoyed the cold drinks provided when we first arrived.

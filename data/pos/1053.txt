I stayed in the Inn at the Market for four nights at the end of September 2007. The first thing to notice is the absolutely perfect location of the hotel. I cannot imagine a better location to stay in Seattle. The room was large (then again, as a European it seems to me that all rooms are big in America!), very clean and just pleasant to be in. The free wifi was important to me and it worked great. The hotel is a little bit expensive, but you do get what you pay for. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is no breakfast, but there are diners, coffeeshops and of course the market close to the hotel, so that was not really a problem. I would definately stay here again.

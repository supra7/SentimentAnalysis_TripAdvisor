Everything great at this downtown hotel. Parking a problem. Read other reviews where hotel parking was $35 overnite. Parked one block away at Convention Center for $18. Short 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. Don't miss it! Excellent dinner at the hotel's Daily Grill! Would definitely stay here again.

Having reviewed comments at tripadvisor, my girlfriend and I chose to stay at the Edgewater Hotel while in Seattle from December 16-18. The pros of our stay include: (1) personal shuttle service to any number of downtown/waterfront Seattle sites, (2) location - walking distance to Pike's Place Market, (3) friendly staff, (4) nice rooms, (5) comfy bed and fireplace (we had a City Deluxe room), and (6) delicious breakfast (included in our weekend package) along with free valet parking). My list of cons is relatively short, but significant to me: (1) there is no pork alternative on the breakfast menu - most thoughtful establishments have some type of turkey or beef protein and (2) there was a $9.95 daily charge for internet. Given the cost of the room, this should have been free. Every high-end establishment we stayed at for the remainder of our trip provided this service. Overall, the Edgewater was a great hotel to stay at, but I would think twice about staying again if I have to pay for internet service.

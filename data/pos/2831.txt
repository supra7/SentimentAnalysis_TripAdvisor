We lived in Seattle for many years and had been curious about the new Sheraton tower and we recently had a need to stay. We love the location, it is so convenient to most everything. The entry, lobby, lounge, bar - it's all very very nice. It looks great, trendy, welcoming. The rooms don't disappoint, especially if you like nice rooms that could be anywhere in the world. However, housecleaning was pretty poor. When we first checked in there was a few items obviously left by the previous occupant left on the nightstands and a glass had fallen behind a table but obviously in plain sight. On a daily basis the room was not adaquately cleaned or trash was not routinely taken out, the soap/shampoo not replenished in 3 days. Despite that, I rate it a very good 4.

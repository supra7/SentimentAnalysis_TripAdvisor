My husband and I traveled to Seattle for four days to celebrate our second wedding anniversary. Neither one of us had been there before, so we were looking for a fun place to play tourist and explore a new city. The hotel was in a great location, literally half a block from the famous "Public Market" sign at Pike Place Market. The location makes it so easy to walk over to the Market for breakfast in the morning and is really a great home base for all your touring. Our room was fantastic. We paid for a city view and had a room on the sixth floor, facing Stewart Street. However, because the window bumps out a bit like a bay window, we were easily able to see out onto Elliot Bay. One of the highlights of our trip was sitting in the little bump out window, sipping local wine, watching an amazing sunset. Our room was quite large - we both were surprised at the ample seating area (sofa, coffee table and chair) and the large bathroom. The free wifi was great also. The hotel has a nice "roof top" deck, which unfortunately it was too cold for us to really use when we were there. I could definitely see having breakfast up there during nicer weather though. The lobby is also nice, and we spent some time reading the paper by a nice fireplace while we were waiting to go to the airport. If you don't have a car, the towncar service to go to and from the airport was a good deal and made the trip a little extra special. My only complaint, and it's so minor, was that the front desk staff was not very helpful in suggesting "off the beaten path" things to do. We had covered the whole downtown area pretty well by our last day and wanted to venture into one of the surrounding neighborhoods (Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, etc.) The man at the front desk had no suggestions on where to go and gave us wrong directions to Capitol Hill, which was a bummer way to end our trip. Overall, a great experience though. We will definitely stay again!

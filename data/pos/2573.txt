Stayed for 3 nights for the Thanksgiving weekend. We made the reservation on the hotel website and got $104/night with AAA discount. Since were HH gold member, we got free breakfast in the executive lounge on the top floor. The hotel is not as grand as the other Hilton because the hotel lobby is on the 10th floor. When we pull up the hotel address, we didnt know it was the hotel since there is no obvious hotel entrance. There are 2 small doors on the 1st floor and a bellman is there most of the time. There is also a Alamo/National rental car counter on the 1st floor. You can only park on the street for 10 minutes for loading/unloading. We had to take the elevator to the 10th floor lobby for check in. Our room is on the 20th floor with partial water view. We can see the Red Lion, Sheraton hotels from our room. The room is small but adequate. Its been renovated so the bathroom has nice granite countertop. Everything looks new and clean. The heater is noisy so we turn it off at night. The bed is comfortable, the sheets and towels are luxurious. Breakfast on the top floor was good, with a view of the city skyline. We can see the Space Needle from the breakfast room. Staffs are very friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel is at a great location, with luxurious stores on the 1st floor on the same block. Its only a short walk to the downtown transit tunnel where you can take the bus or light rail to/from airport. Its also a 10 minutes walk one direction to Pike Place or the other direction to the shopping meca with Macys, Nordstrom, Westlake mall, etc. This is also where you can take the monorail to the Space Needle. But we walked from the hotel to the Space Needle via the Olympia Sculpture Park. We also walked to the ferry terminal to take the ferry to Bredenton ($7 round trip), a cheap way to cruise the Puget Sound. This hotel is definitely worth it.

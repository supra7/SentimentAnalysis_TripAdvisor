The service at this hotel is simply outstanding. The entire staff makes the extra effort for the guests comfort. If you need something, simply ask, and they will do everything they can to help. When I requested a plastic bag and ice for a sore ankle, within minutes housekeeping delivered it to my room. When I wanted dinner outside the hotel they printed out menus for me, and since I was on crutches and concerned about navigating my way across the street, even offered to pick it up for me! The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The location is fantastic, just half a block up the hill from Pike Place Market. If you can't navigate the hill they will call a cab for you. There were no problems with noise. The hotel itself is accessible. Handicapped accessible rooms have walk in/roll in showers, shower seats, and grab bars the length of the wall. There are ramps onto the deck and elevators to all areas of the hotel. But the doors are not automated. And the deck on the 5th floor overlooking the water and Pike Place Market is a great place to relax and take in the view!

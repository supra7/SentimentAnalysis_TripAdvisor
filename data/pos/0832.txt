We have stayed at the Inn every year since 2004 and decided to return twice last year - once in the summer and once in the winter. Incredible views; extremely comfortable; friendly, thoughtful, and accommodating staff from management to housekeeping; and a location that cannot be beat. Every year we look forward to the Inn as our trip to Seattle would not be the same without it.

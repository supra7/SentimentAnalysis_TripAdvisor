Love this hotel. Stayed for business and felt spoiled the whole time. My room, #711, was spacious and well-appointed--far more than what I would normally need or require while away on business. Very clean and well-lit bedroom, closet and bathroom. Bathroom had ample space for my toiletries and the shower was a dream. Gym was being renovated, but had free passes to an excellent gym a block away. Great location for business but also close enough to some attractions during downtime. Lola restaurant was fantastic as were Dahlia and Etta (of the same ownership nearby). The staff are friendly and helpful. Kudos to Elizabeth, Chad, Erin, Susan and Sean from the front desk and to Dan, the valet. You made me feel very comfortable and cared for. Guillermo in restaurant Lola is a great guy.

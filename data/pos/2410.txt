After reading mixed reviews on this hotel I was committed to addressing the major questions. 1. The hill. Problem -yes there is a steep hill. Solution - use 5th or 6th street and u will avoid the huge hills. My 2 and 6 yr old did it with no problem 2. The pool. Problem. Yes they keep it at room temperature. Indoor pool. The Windows are quite dirty. Solution - best to go when it's warm in seattle. Recommendation for hotel. Your going to have happier guests if you increased the pools temp by ten degrees and washed the windows 3. Problem- the noise level since the hotel is facing a major highway. Solution- ask for a room not facing the highway as its much quieter 4. Problem - the 4 star on priceline solution - triple aaa missed the mark this is not a 4 star but u can get a great deal on priceline . People have paid as low as 79 a night and we paid 129 5 problem - the parking is 30 day. Solution off street parking free Saturday even and sunday 6 problem the wireless is 12.95 per day. Solution. Wireless free in public areas. Recommend for hotel. Throw in wireless as customers dont want to be nickel and dimed 7 location. 5 blocks from the market 8 kids. Not a kids hotel. Hotel. Consider have a kids bag when Checking in

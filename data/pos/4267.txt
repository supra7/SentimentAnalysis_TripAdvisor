Stayed here with SPG points or a mini vacation in Seattle. I didn't expect a great room because we were using points and it was the Sea fair parade weekend. We were pleasantly surprised to get a beautiful view of the space needle and floor to ceiling windows on an upper floor. The room was large and nicely furnished with a beautiful bathroom with a dual shower head and travertine tile tub. Seattle was great but wish I could have spent more time in this beautiful room.

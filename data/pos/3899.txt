After looking online at the website and reviews we were expecting this to be a nice hotel but upon checking in we were really impressed. The location is absolutely stunning; floor to ceiling windows in all the public areas and the twinkling lights from across the water it's really beautiful. Our room was nice, really comfy bed, fancy bathroom and a nice touch with the fireplace. The only slight turnoff was the hotels constant opportunity to "upsell". Everyone these days expects to be charged if they take the bathrobe or clear out the minibar but it seemed as if everything was for sale, I wouldn't have been surprised to see a price tag on the bed or TV! We ate in the restaurant a couple of times (dinner and Sunday brunch) and were really impressed by the food. The dinner menu is fairly pricey but the standard of food is outstanding and there are lots of options if you want a lighter meal or a bar snack. If your staying in the hotel on a Saturday night we'd really recommend the Sunday brunch, that was $35 each very well spent. The only negative about this hotel is because it's built right on a pier there isn't much in the way of sound proofing. You certainly won't need to set your alarm for the morning as you'll be awake from the noise of bathrooms, footsteps and doors slamming as well as quite possibly the noise of your neighbours having .... ahem, a good time with each other (!!!) We'd love to visit Seattle again and would definitely stay at the Edgewater Hotel.

I'm relocating to Seattle and am currently looking for apartments. While I was looking for a place to live, I chanced across Hotel Monaco and took up residence there for eight days. From the moment I was met at the valet on the first day to the day they handed the keys back to me, I enjoyed every aspect of the stay. Every member of the staff made me feel not only like a valued customer but that they genuinely cared about my comfort. I have stayed in many fine hotels in the past and have experienced great customer service but not really at this level. Upon check-in, I was informed on how best to take advantage of my stay and ways to save money. After having enrolled in their rewards program, they upgraded me to a suite. The room was more than tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The turn down service left two chocolates on the pillow and if I timed it right, they would cut me in a couple more ;-) The restaurant, Sazerac is not a name you will remember but you certainly will remember the experience. The only complaint is that it was so well liked, the place was packed by 5:30pm. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and reasonably priced (as far as breakfasts go for four star hotels). And the relationship was tested as well: Upon check out, I had learned that I had been charged for a bottle of wine I had not consumed. I figured that it was due to a bottle I had brought in and left out on the table. Simple mistake and simply explained. But I did wonder how this would be dealt with. No problem. I explained that I did not drink the bottle of wine and that they were welcome to run inventory and if it was missing they could put it on my tab. No need. They took my word for it and took it off the tab on the spot. Simple thing. Big relief. I've had simpler things ruin a stay. I will be staying there again and highly recommend that if you are in Seattle, you try the Monaco as well.

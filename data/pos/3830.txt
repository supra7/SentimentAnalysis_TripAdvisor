My daughter and I were in town for strictly a girls fun trip and picked the Edgewater because of it's location. We had a waterfront room and enjoyed the spectacular view that you get being right on the water. We used the shuttle one day that leaves the hotel on the hour. The bar was a little noisy but food was good and waitress very nice. Overall we were very pleased with our stay.

Uber, hip boutique hotel. Great lobby and even better restaurant. There are four words to describe Seattle. The first two is Pikes Place, the other two is Tom Douglas. If you stayed here, you would be able to access some of the best, if not all the best dining establishments--on foot. Everything from Mac and cheese at Beechers to sea food at Ettas, peanut butter cookies at Dahlias, pizza at Serious Pie and drinks at Lolas. All within a 10 minute walk from The Andra. Like they say in Seattle, NIRVANA.

The price for one night was top end of the market for us. However well worth it in terms of location , amenities & staff. We could walk easily to the Pike Place market & Space Needle. We also had the type of room & floor requested with the added bonus of a partial bay view. The roof top patio area is just brilliant & we took a glass of wine up there & lay on a comfy sunbed enjoying the wonderful views

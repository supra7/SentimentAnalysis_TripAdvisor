I would not recommend this hotel for someone looking for a 4 star hotel and over the top amenities. You are not going to get that at The Moore, but what you are going to get is a great location at an amazing price. I've read some of the reviews and yes, the hotel does have an older look to it, but I wouldn't hold it against this historic hotel. They offered a wonderful collection of shampoos and soaps and the cleaning staff did a tremendous job. You can see where some of the floors are getting updated and some that haven't been touched yet. We had one of the cold rooms with an attached bathroom, while a friend had one of the hot rooms. Luckily Seattle favored us with warm, sunny days during our trip. I have no complaints against traffic noise (we were on the 7th floor).

Just returned from a girlfriend reunion/get-away weekend. The Hotel Andra was a great spot for our reunion. Loved the decor in both the lobby and rooms. We shared two rooms, both with two queen beds. The rooms were clean and, while not huge, were a good size. The beds were extremely comfortable. Our view was pretty poor (the roof top of the neighboring building) but the price was right and we were on the go, anyway. The location is outstanding. We were able to walk everywhere but still feel like we were not in the heart of the "skyscrapers." The staff also were friendly and helpful. I would return to the Hotel Andra anytime!

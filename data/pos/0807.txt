My husband and I just had a wonderful 5 nights stay at the inn at the market when we were in Seattle. We will not stay anywhere else ever in Seattle. For the location, the atmosphere and the service I can frankly say it can't be beat. I wake up each morning and open the curtains and see the mountains and the market vendors loading their stores and smile. The service is also very good. We went to pioneer square, bainbridge island with a wonderful ferry ride, Fremont, Ballard and university village. It's so welcoming that I cancelled the Alexis to stay here 2 wks later when we take our flight back home. That tells a lot.

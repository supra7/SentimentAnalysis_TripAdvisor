This hotel was pretty nice with a fairly good view of downtown from the top story executive lounge. The service staff was polite and helpful and responded to requests and needs quickly and easily. It was well equipped for business travel with a print center, workout room, and irons/ironing boards in all of the rooms. The rooms themselves were simple and reasonably sized, with a desk, fridge, full bath tub Although the hotel was very clean and well designed, I was fairly surprised by the lack of decorations, design features, or classical touches a person would likely associate with a Hilton. This had little impact for someone like myself, however, due to the fact that I really couldnt give a damn about that sort of stuff. It is always nice when you stay at a hotel that has clearly gone to the effort of designing its space for aesthetic appeal, but I am much more concerned with the quality of staff and the cleanliness of the rooms and facilities than I am about anything else. This is not to say that this hotel was a cold war era bunker or a whitewashed psych ward. It was, in fact, very nice and verynormal, and was only surprising in that it did not really lend itself to the vibrancy of Seattle or even the natural vigor or the Pacific Northwest.

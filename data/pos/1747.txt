When we are visiting Seattle, our hotel of choice is the Mayflower Park. Not only is the downtown location ideal, the friendly and attentive staff is remarkable. While the ambiance is elegant, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Be sure to visit Andaluca, the hotel restaurant. Fresh & unique cuisine is served in a lovely space and the extensive wine list is a plus. Oliver's lounge is popular with hotel guests and locals alike. All in all the Mayflower Hotel experience is incredible!

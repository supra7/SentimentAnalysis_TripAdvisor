What a wonderful stay we had at the Westin shortly after the New Year. Our room had a gorgeous view of Puget Sound and we ere lucky to have some sunny weather with which to enjoy it. The hotel was well located for the shopping and dining amenities of downtown Seattle. Our room was lovely, the bed was piece de resistance with its Heavenly Bed, I haven't slept so well in ages. The bathroom was in need of updating as it was small and not well-lit, the only let down in the room. The lobby was beautifully appointed and the staff were very helpful. My husband went the gym while we there at the hotel and was duly impressed with the quality of the facility. We would not hesitate to stay here again.

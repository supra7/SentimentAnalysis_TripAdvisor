We stayed at the Travelodge Seattle by the Space Needle this past July. We had stayed there previously and returned because the hotel is ideal for anyone wanting to go see a major league baseball game. The hotel itself is clean, affordable, the staff were wonderful. They have a complimentary breakfast that was really nice, hot and cold items, very nice. The pool is great and well maintained. The hotel offers a shuttle service to and from the stadium, for a $5 fee one way. You don't have to worry about parking and walking miles, and we especially appreciated this service. Great hotel, great service, we'll be staying there again!!!

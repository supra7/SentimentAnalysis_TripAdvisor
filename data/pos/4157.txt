I was very impressed with the Sorrento Hotel. The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby. Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am). My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped, especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still, I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money, and I would definitely stay there again.

We had a wonderful, romantic stay at the Inn at the Market! It's all about the little things here: a free gift-wrapping station during the Christmas season that my wife took full advantage of, personal service (even the bellman remembered my name), and turn-down chocolates in the evening. And of course, that location!! Right smack in the middle of one of the great urban shopping and eating areas in the nation, with Pike Place Market at your feet and all the great stores of Seattle just a few blocks away. We'll be back for sure!

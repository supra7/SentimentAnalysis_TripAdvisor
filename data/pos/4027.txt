We stayed only one night but wished for more!. We had a small suite with a marble bathroom. The room was clean and smelled nice. We had 2 tv's, a desk, couch and chair in the seating area. There was a stocked fridge and some other items on the tv stand. We loved our bed and linens as well as the robes provided in the room. Best night of sleep that trip for sure. The room also had an iron and ironing board. The staff was professional, friendly and helpful. The concierge staff was wonderful too! Drove us to Pikes Market for a hair appt and picked us up without delay. They also delivered us to dinner at the Metropolitan Grill too. We would have had a pick up as well, but wanted to walk off the dinner. We enoyed the wine at check in and the coffee in the lobby in the morning. We had an early departure and would have loved to take some time for breakfast as with all we had experienced, we could imagine the food to be amazing. Can't wait for a return stay!

Stayed here for one night, check-in was quick, front desk was friendly & helpful. Placed in the South Tower, nice view of the downtown area. Room was clean, nice soaps, starbucks for the single use coffee maker. Very comfortable bed with feather pillow. Wi-Fi was not free here, $10.00 per night. Nice size LCD TV in the room, we were Starwood members so the USA today was delivered to our door. Parking under the hotel is $41.00 per night, or you can use the adjacent parking garage linked by a skybridge for $22.00 per night. This hotel is centrally located, shopping & dining is everywhere around the hotel, Pike Place Market is a 3-4 block walk away.

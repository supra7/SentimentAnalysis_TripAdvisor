We stayed here for one night after a company Christmas party, so we did not use a lot of the facilities. Our room was clean and was a nice size. The bed was comfortable. Toiletries were of good quality. They have really cool leaf-shaped soap in the bathroom (I asked for an extra and took it home to my kids). My main complaint about this hotel was breakfast. The hotel has two restaurants, a Bar and Grill and a second that is more like a coffee shop. The Bar and Grill is not open for breakfast, so the coffee shop is the only breakfast option. Although it wasn't bad, it seemed to be geared more towards takeout. The menu was fairly limited, but the worst part was that it was loud and had a hectic atmosphere. Not the way to get your day off to a relaxing start. Might be okay if you're looking for a quick bite before heading out for a business meeting, but not the ambience you want if you're on a relaxing vacation or weekend trip. The other thing I noticed was that the hotel (at least our room) creaked when it was windy. This was actually disconcerting ... we were in the room the night before and it was quiet, but the next morning the room started to creak. I really thought we were having an earthquake! I realized we weren't when it lasted more than a couple of minutes. And no, it wasn't coming from the room upstairs or beside us! :) I also thought the minibar could use some improvement. There were a bunch of sodas and beer, but the only liquor available was bourbon, scotch or vodka. There was vodka but no tonic. Also no wine. The location is great. The valets were very helpful. They were able to give me good directions to locate a gas station (hard to find in downtown). The lobby bar was a nice spot to have an after dinner drink.

We stayed at The Hotel Monaco after our cruise. The rooms were very generous and decorated uniquely. The hotel, a remodeled Pacific Bell building, had charm and a sturdiness about it. Everytime we walked by the bell men, we felt like we were coming home. Very secure. Great for single travelers! The location is fabulous. Walk to most things, Pike market, even the space needle. Little grocery/drug store a block away. Was on Today show about being Green! Bravo. We had 1 double bed room and one room with bed and couch separated by a curtain. My( snoring) mom slept there,behind the curtain. Great food there and nearby.

I stayed hear for 11 nights during a recent business trip. The room I had wasn't great , but the bed was confortable and the rest of the hotel was good. The best thing is the bar in the lobby, especially the bar tenders who were friendly and lively! This would be great if you were traveling alone (I wasn't). I would stay here again, although if traveling for pleasure I might have to stay somewhere cheaper.

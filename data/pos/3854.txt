The hotel's greatest asset--its location, with spectacular views of Puget Sound, is also its biggest drawback, because it's rather inconvenient to everything but the waterfront and Pike Place Market. The hourly shuttle to downtown is better than nothing, but it only runs once an hour. For walkers, each room is provided with an umbrella. On the down side, the rooms lack private safes, which I have come to take for granted in good hotels, and if you want a wifi connection in your room you have to pay extra for it. This on top of the fairly high prices you'll already be paying for your room. (There are two free computers with internet in the business center.) The room was very comfortable and well furnished; the bed was lovely. The faux-rustic decor doesn't quite work for me. The bar is lively and the dining room serves superb food. Both are popular with locals, but pricey! Despite the noise in the bar, my room was very quiet. Staff was friendly and helpful

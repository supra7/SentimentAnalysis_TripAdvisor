We had a suite (is it all suite?) but the suite - or at least the one we stayed in - was basically a really large room - like an open plan / studio flat (apartment) with a kitchenette (sink but can't remember if you could cook) but not a true suite with different rooms. Room has coach (sofa) large bed, desk etc. Nicely furnished - good quality. Bar down stairs is really nice plus some of the better restaurants (recommended in the guidebook) are next door / across the road. Also a supermarket quite near by. All the main touristy bits are all within 10-15 minutes walk. No free wifi, except in the lobby, and the gym was tiny - looked like they'd just taken one room and put a few machines in it. Two people and it seem pretty full. But Seattle is easy enough to go running in.

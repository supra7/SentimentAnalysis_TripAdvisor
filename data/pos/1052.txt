Having read the previous reviews, I was expecting to have a great stay. I was not disappointed. Service was very good and the friendly staff gave some good tips on what to see and do around the Seattle area. The views from the room and the 5th floor deck were fantastic especially in the morning and at sunset. 2 minutes from the Public Market made it a great choice for browsing the many stalls.

The rooms are pretty average rooms for a hotel of this quality. Where this hotel excells is convenience and service. From checking in until checkout I had a great experience with the staff here. There is a nice lounge and restaurant on the 2nd floor. Pikes place market is less than a 10 minute walk away and there are numerous restaraunts in the area.

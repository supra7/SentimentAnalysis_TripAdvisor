Stayed one night after booking on Priceline (2 adults, 2 kids). Boutique hotel is in a spectacular waterfront setting right on the pier. Staff were great. Views are breathtaking. Great lobby area takes in the water view and is very comfortable. The "hunting lodge" decor which some reviews take offense too seemed rather tasteful and appropriate to me (if you want bland, stay at a chain). Water side rooms get the views plus added amenities such as nicer bathrooms and flat panel tvs. City side rooms are almost as good but look backwards onto downtown. Major caveat on the city side rooms is the noise from the train tracks which are very close. Trains run all night. The hotel should invest in better soundproofing for the city side windows. Restaurant ("67") also has the amazing view and has excellent food. $26 valet parking charge is a little steep but not out of line for downtown Seattle. A regular lot across the street from the hotel is cheaper. It is about a 15 minute walk to the main part of downtown.

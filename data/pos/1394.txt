The Queen Anne-area in Seattle is central and still very local with its own cosy diners and cafes, well assorted supermarket and the big Key Arena suitable for big events. If you prefer doing a lot of sightseeing by foot this is the perfect starting point wether you want to go to the water side, downtown or Lake Union. Inn at Queen Anne made our stay in Seattle very comfortable. Nice and clean accomodation, nothing fancy but ordinary in a good way. Easy check-in and -outs. Felt like you had your own little appartment with a small kitchenette, walk-in closet and tub. If possible ask for a corner room.

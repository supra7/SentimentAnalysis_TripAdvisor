Lets get one thing straight  Miauw Suites is not a hotel  there is no concierge or room service and if you need a full service hotel, then dont stay here. However, if youre looking for a very central, stylish apartment as a base for a city break, then Id thoroughly recommend it. The rooms are a little noisy as they overlook a canal street, but the views of the Amsterdam canals are stunning and the interiors very chic and minimalist. I especially liked the wet room bathrooms  small but practical. Would definitely stay again!

My husband and I stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne for 6 nights in July. While the room was a bit small, the closet was huge, so we found there was plenty of room for us. We even had a view of the space needle from our corner room on the 3rd floor. As the website clearly states, there are no elevators, so be sure to request the 1st floor if this will be difficult for you. We found the building to be very quiet and pleasant. The courtyard is beautiful and the breakfast is decent. Our room was air-conditioned, which was necessary after the 80+ degree days in Seattle's streets. Be sure to request this if visiting in the summer, not every room has air. The location and price of this Inn can not be beat if you are willing to forgive a few vintage features and don't need a lot of creature comforts. We came to Seattle on a budget and wanted to spend our money on great food and sights. We were so happy we made the choice we did. We could walk from the Inn to so many attractions or take a short bus ride to awesome little neighborhoods.

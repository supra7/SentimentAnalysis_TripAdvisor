It was tough choosing a boutique hotel in Seattle but the Andra was a good choice. Great decor, everything from the light fixtures to the retro clock radio on the night stand. Room was quite large and comfy, the beds were fantastic. Only complaint would be that the bathroom was a bit old and dingy. It appears to be an older hotel that was renovated - the rooms are great but the bathrooms have old tiles and flooring that looked like they could use replacing or a good scrubbing! Bathroom is also tiny but not terribly so, still quite usable. Service was great and location is also a bonus, would stay there again.

We stayed three nights at the Marqueen in August. As we drove up our daughter said, "that is the ugliest hotel ever" as its boxy brick appearance is not very impressive from the outside. The inside is well cared for and the building has a subtle charm. The urban location is great, next to restaurants and an upscale food market (similar to Whole Foods) , the room kitchen very useful. We were able to easily walk to elegant residential neighborhoods, parks as well as to downtown. Hotel was clean and staff helpful and friendly. A good value and we'd absolutely stay there again.

The main attractions are in downtown, so if you're planing to star there the Westin is the best choice. It was literally the best location within the hotels. The staff was great, very helpful and kind. The room was amazing! The view is priceless (because of the big windows) and the bed was so comfortable! I fully recomend this hotel, because even knowing it isn't cheap at all, it is worth it, because you'll save a lot walking (everyhting is a few blocks away) instead of taking a taxi. If you have any doubt of where to go, or what to visit, just ask the staff at the concierge and they will tell you where and how to go!!! I LOVED IT! And by the way, Seattle is a very secure city, though there are lots of homeless in every corner, they are harmless ;D Antoher advice: It is cheaper if you go and have breakfast outside the hotel! A good place to go is cheescake factory, it is about 3 blocks away :)

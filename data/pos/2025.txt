We stayed here one night in June and loved it! The location cannot be beat for the price. Our room (#730) was recently renovated and was terrrific. There is a computer in the lobby and a great bar next to the hotel. The desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Definately consider this hotel if you want a downtown hotel with a great location and not a lot of frills.

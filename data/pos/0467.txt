this was my last hotel of my 2 week trip. I wanted to stay in someplace nice....after staying in a college dorm on a hard bed for 1 week. Nice service at front desk. Room had an awesome view of the space needle and downtown. The sunset was beautiful. I wished I could have stayed 2 nights and enjoyed the amenities of the hotel and pampered myself with room service. Great walking thru the city and down to the market. All sorts of food, bars, stores all within steps of the hotel. Gee you don't want to bring a car in town...27 bucks a night for parking! ouch. I saw some places were 36 bucks a night! My room was $179 which I don't normally spend for a room....but splurged. They have a happy hour in the bar restaurant on street level and also a indoor pool with jacuzzi which i would have loved to use. very convenient location. little room off lobby with 2 computers to check internet and print out boarding passes.

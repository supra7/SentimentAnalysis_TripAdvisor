We only stayed the one night as we were just popping down from Vancouver but loved the hotel and would defiantly stay again. Rooms: Huge and comfy rooms. We got an upgrade on arrival which is also brilliant. Very good value. Location: Very central and only a few blocks away from the shopping or the sea front with all their yummy restaurants. Service: From the moment we arrived they were extremely helpful. We were very disorganised and hadnt booked dinner in a seafood restaurant we were hoping to go to or drinks in the space needle. I mentioned that I forgot to at the front desk to my boyfriend and the receptionist asked if she could help. We only made it up the room before we had a call from the concierge saying everything had been taken care of.

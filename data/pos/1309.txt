We picked the Crowne Plaza because it was on the airport bus route and offered a suite that would accommodate the family at a reasonable price. First impressions aren't much - the lobby isn't very grand but staff were friendly enough and soon had us packed off to our room on the 30-something floor with a view of the Space Needle. There was a sofabed in the living area and a huge super king in the bedroom. No pool at the hotel but easily located just a short walk from the centre of downtown and also within the free bus area that is provided in the middle of Seattle. We were on a breakfast inclusive rate but also got upgraded to the club floor. Restaurant breakfast was good, as was the club lounge but the latter was small so not alway easy to find four seats together. Crowne Plazas are very good at supplying free toiletries if you leave anything behind. I was very surprised to see that when asking for a razor, rather than getting a cheap disposable, I was supplied with a 5-blade Wilkinson Sword! Departure back to the airport was OK but as we had been the second stop for the bus on the way in, we had to go right round all the other hotels too. That was a bit of a pain, but nothing the hotel can do anything about. Note it is up something of a steep hill from 3rd avenue which is the main North-South route in the city.

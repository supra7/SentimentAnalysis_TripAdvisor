My husband & I stayed at this hotel 2 days before Christmas in a Superior Queen Room. The room's size was perfect -- chair by the window, large armoir w/TV that had 3 drawers for your stuff, queen bed and nightstand on each side. Bathroom was very small, but adequate. Everything was clean and the bed had great pillows and a wonderful down comforter -- very comfortable! We booked online and, luckily, printed out our confirmation w/room rate. Had to show this to the manager in order to get that room rate. Other than that, we had no complaints. Old hotel -- quite charming -- location is GREAT -- close to everything! Parking is available in garage next door for $19/day.

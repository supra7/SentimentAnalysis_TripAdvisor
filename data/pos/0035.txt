great location, large , clean room and very comfortable beds. we got a great deal as we were there right at the end of the "off season". renovations are going on but the biggest inconvenience was our inability to go into the lobby from the main door for an hour or two. . . no big deal.. staff was very nice and attentive. good value for the money. would definitely stay here again!!

I really don't see how you would ever find a better hotel in Seattle at that price. My husband and I go to Seattle about once or twice a year and never think of staying anywhere else. The hotel is starting to show its age, but our room is always clean, the staff is always courteous, and it's got the most convenient location a tourist could ask for. (Easy walk to lots of great restaurants, shopping, Pike Place, etc.) Highly recommend it. Plus, at that great price, you have extra money for some of the great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. (Marco's Supper Club is our favorite.)

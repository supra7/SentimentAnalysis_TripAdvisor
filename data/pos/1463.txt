Loving the Marqueen!!!! The rooms where spacious and we had a view of the Space Needle. No lift but the door man was sooo helpful. The restaurants in the area are amazing and it is so close to the monorail that takes you into the centre of town. If I came to Seattle again (and I will) would definitely stay here again. My daughter thought it was 'cool' which is major praise indeed!!

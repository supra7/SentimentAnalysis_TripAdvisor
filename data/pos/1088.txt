I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market. I absolutely loved it!! I had never stayed in a hotel in Seattle so I did a ton of research. I knew I wanted to stay within walking distance of Pike's Place Market. This place was in the best location. The room was beautiful (we got the Deluxe Water View), the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was beautifully decorated and lots of attention was paid to detail. The staff was great. We will return!!

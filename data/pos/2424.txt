This hotel was very elegantly designed. It is definitely more upscale than many in its price range. The 28th floor restaurant/bar was lovely and surprisingly quiet, meaning that it was easy to have a conversation. There is a small but sufficient pool and hot tub also on the 28th floor, as well as a decent sized fitness room. The room was actually more of a suite- small living room with desk/couch, then tiny "hallway" with bathroom (good counter space) and lovely bedroom with large corner windows. Although the rooms were tiny, they were more than sufficient for a single business traveler. Everything was BEAUTIFULLY decorated and finished, and very clean and well-kept. The only downside to the bedroom was the HORRIBLE and CONSTANT freeway noise (even from the 9th floor!). The breakfast buffet (for a charge) in the restaurant was decent. The French toast was WONDERFUL! The one downside was the horrible parking garage! It was very difficult to find a spot, and even more difficult to find a working elevator from the garage to the lobby. We ended up walking up 4 flights of stairs just to get to the lobby.

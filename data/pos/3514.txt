What an incredible hotel! Having had a late-night business dinner in Seattle, I decided to treat myself to a night downtown at the Hotel Andra - a little mid-week respite, if you will. Not only was it convenient to have a place to stay downtown on a Tuesday evening, but once I checked in (they had the room ready at 1pm!) I nearly snuck off for the afternoon and soaked in the tub right then! The property was even better than Id anticipated  I love seeing how the Andra's renovation (from the previous Claremont Hotel ownership) still allowed a few touches of the Claremont to shine through with such wonderful character and in perfect contrast to the upscale Scandia-contemporary look. My worries about bedding? (I"m a bit of a stickler for comfy beds and lovely linens): I was surprised at how very comfortable each of those 315 Egyptian threads felt! Couple that with the FACE amenities (which I'm still enjoying at home) and a more-perfect night would be hard to find. Now I see why John & Yoko loved their hotel sit-ins! Andra ... take me away!

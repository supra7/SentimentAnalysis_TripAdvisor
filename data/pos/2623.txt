After spending 3 hours traveling the 15 miles from Seatac airport to the center of Seattle in a subfreezing winter storm, my husband and I abandoned our plan to drive home to Bellingham 90 miles north of the city. Leaving I-5, we negotiated our way to a parking lot and began calling hotels in the area. We were able to book a room at Quality Inn and Suites Seattle Center. We didn't have a map and were unfamiliar with the area, and several streets were blocked by snow and ice. John, the Commercial Manager, stayed on the phone with us for 15 minutes, giving us precise directions to the hotel. He greeted us at the door, gave us hugs, and led us to a free, covered parking spot adjacent to the hotel. There was a fire burning in the lobby fireplace, where I warmed myself while my husband registered. We not only got a room with a king-size bed at a more than reasonable price, we were upgraded to one with a jacuzzi. The staff was wonderful, the room clean and comfortable, and after a hearty complimentary breakfast the next morning we were on our way home.

Our first trip to Seattle was a good one. We got lucky with the weather (it never rained) and this heritage hotel helped it be a positive experience. On check in we were initially a little disappointed that at 2 pm our room wasn't ready, the hotel didn't seem overly busy and as check out is 11 I had hoped that we would be able to get straight into our room after a lengthy flight. However as check in isn't listed as guaranteed until 4 pm we can't complain. The hotel took our number to call us when the room was ready and we headed off for the short walk to Pike Place Market. After a couple of hours the hotel never called us and this was typical of the staff there. Generally they were disinterested and for almost everything looked like too much trouble. The one exception to this was the concierge who was lovely, very friendly and helpful. Once in our room it was very large and although slightly dated, clean and everything worked. As well as a large comfortable bed there was room for a sofa, chair and plenty of room to move around. In modern hotels the space would have been partitioned and called a suite. Given such a large room the bathroom was tiny and although the fixtures were in good order, the tiny size, at odds to the room itself, was somewhat uncomfortable. The door could barely squeeze closed past the toilet howeverI guess this is typical of older properties. The hotel is well located next to the monorail stop and a short walk to the excellent light transit rail link which serves the airport as well as Union Square and the stadium area. I'd return for the location and the value.

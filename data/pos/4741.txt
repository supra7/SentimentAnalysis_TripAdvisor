Stayed here with my girlfriend for one night. It has great location for the Space Needle, it's about a five minute walk although not sure about how far from dowtown. The hotel itself was nice and clean and the room and bathroom were a good size. There was also a small pool and an excellent complimentary breakfast along with free wifi. Our main complaint was the rude service we received from the front desk upon arrival and when checking out. The man/teenager that checked us in was quite ignorant and rude. Overall we would of been happy to stay in this hotel longer if we had been in Seattle longer.

Stayed here for four nights recently on business. Front desk staff were excellent in providing a room that met my needs on the Club Floor. Had a nice view of the city and water. The room was spacious and well equipped for the business traveller. Nice bathroom and Aveda amenities. The room alsonhad a refrigerator stocked with complimentarynwater The service and food offerings in the Club Lounge on the 26th floor were also excellent although it is on the small side and did get very crowded in the evenings. I noticed that folks with club access were giving access to the lounge to those who didn't have access. The bell staff and concierge went out of their way to assist. Overall, the staff is well trained and consistently demonstrate a high level of customer service ethic and the property is well maintained. It is well within walking distance to the Market and shopping but a little bit of a hike back due to the incline. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

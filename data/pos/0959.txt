Actually finding the hotel is hard, but when you're finally there, it 's beautiful. I contacted the manager before the trip and said I was surprising my husband with a trip for his 40th birthday. He quickly moved us to a waterview room at no extra charge. It was breathtaking! He had mini cupcakes waiting in the room with a note saying "happy birthday and enjoy your stay" to us! We only stayed for one night, but everything was great. It's literally right over the Pike Place Market toward to ocean, then the other direction is all of the shopping and eating you could dream of! A great area!

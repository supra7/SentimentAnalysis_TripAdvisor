Both my wife and I can remember that as children in the Seattle area, we thought the Sorrentol was magical, and never dreamed of actually staying there. The attractive rate offered by the hotel made that possible. It's like a fine European luxury hotel. Last weekend was our second stay, and we're looking forward to coming again and again. The clerks and the valets were both friendly and helpful. We happened to be there for the big and thankfully rare Seattle snowstorm, and the valets gave us a safe and comfortable route back to the freeway. Great dinner and breakfast, and the most comfortable bed ever.

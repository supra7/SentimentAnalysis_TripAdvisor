a very comfortable stay. great views. yes parking across the street was 26 / day but we factored that into our costs. We got a fair deal on priceline. Pros - comfortable beds, pillows, rooms, and great lobby, 4 star hotel, top location. Cons - pool and hot tub look a little dated for such a great hotel. It is odd they haven't done a reno there. The pool at our 89 dollar best western in federal way was nicer and had a clean feel to it. Sheraton needs to clean this area up.Only other negative was we couldn't really get the room quite as cool as we would have like at night but that seems to be a problem in some high rises with central air. Hotel bar charged me 3.50 for a ginger ale to take out to the room for my ill wife (I had told them). Thanks for that. All in all a top hotel. We stayed on the not reno'd tower but it seemed very acceptable.

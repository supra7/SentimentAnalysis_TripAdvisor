My family and I recently stayed at Hotel Monaco for a trip after Christmas and the location of the hotel can't be beat. We walked to the Public Market, shopping each day and to dinners. The staff was extremely helpful on giving directions and suggestions on places to eat near by. Not only were they helpful, but so friendly and remembered us each time we arrived back to the hotel. The restaurant in the lobby had great food too...highly recommend it.

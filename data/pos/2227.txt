We were in Seattle for a wedding and wanted to stay close to the wedding site and close to Pike Place Market, but we didn't want to break the bank. This was one of the only budget options in the area and we were initially nervous that it might be kind of worn down after reading some of the reviews on TA. And while there were signs of wear and tear here and there, we were more than happy with our stay. The staff was extremely nice and very helpful even providing us with complementary umbrellas when it rained one day. Our room was not small, it wasn't huge but hardly small. No idea what other reviewers are complaining about there. They only negative was that the walls are a bit thin, so you will hear noise from the halls and elevator from time to time, but we only heard noise during the day - at night it was quiet. We used the hotel's small business center and were able to check our email, check in for our flight and print our boarding pass all for free. The hotel was modern, had free wifi and is in a great location. We were extremely happy with our stay. For the money, it absolutely cannot be beat.

Stayed here 4 nights for a business conference. The hotel is an older property but very nicely furnished. The room, while small (common for older properties), was very comfortable & adequate for one person. The only complaint was that the lamps were a little dim for reading. The bathroom was on the small side (again, common for older properties) but fine for me. Instead of small bottles of shampoo, etc, there were larger pump bottles of shampoo, conditioner, & lotion in the bathroom (a good brand) which makes more sense to me. There were plenty of towels as well as robes in the room. The bed was very comfortable. I had requested a refrigerator when I made my reservation, and one was already in my room when I checked in. The staff was very courteous and helpful throughout my stay, even getting me a taxi within 10 minutes at 5am. Internet access is free. There are 2 small computers available for free use in the lobby (15 minute limit per session) & you can print your boarding passes. The concierge was always helpful. There is a restaurant & lounge on the premises. I did not try the restaurant but Seattle locals I talked to in my meetings said that it is very good. The lounge is good; the appetizers are big enough for a meal. The hotel is very centrally located. It is within 1 block of the Light Rail to the airport and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is only 3 blocks from the Pike Street market & within easy walking distance of lots of shopping & restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here & would stay again.

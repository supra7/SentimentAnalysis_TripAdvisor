I stay at the Monaco whenever in Seattle. Pleasant staff especially the doorman. Love mingling at wine hour and most importantly feeling welcome when traveling with my dog. Great location, comfy beds and guitar hero at wine hour. What more could you ask for! I love the Monaco and will continue to stay there when ever I'm in Seattle!

I asked for a room away from the elevators and ice machine as I am a very light sleeper and they provided me with a corner room that was perfect. Other hotels are not willing to accomodate my requests without bringing in a manager to negotiate, and make an ordeal out of it. (I always make note of this in my reservation but it is never honored). I was extremely pleased to see that the Sheraton allows their front line to make those type of quick changes without having to envolve everyone in your business.

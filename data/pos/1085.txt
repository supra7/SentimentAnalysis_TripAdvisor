My Daughter and I stayed at the Inn At The Market on April 24 after a four day trip to Vancouver BC. We arrived at midnight from Vancouver. (Hint-- the USA/Canadian boarder is a nightmare...we waited over three hours to get across, and were told a four to six hour wait on the weekend is not unusual.....make sure you leave either very early in the morning or late at night.) Greg the night front desk person, gave us an absolutely wonderful welcome.He upgraded us from a cityview room to a breath taking end-room on the 6th floor!!.We woke to the sounds and smells from the famous Pike Street Market....The location was incomparable! Good restaurants,great boutique shopping, and if you need mainstream...Macy's is three blocks away. I have stayed at the Monaco, and the Grand Hyatt in Seattle....I will never go back.....this is my new Hotel of choice.

Everything was great! We arrived before check-in, but we were pleasantly greeted and they offered to hold our luggage since our room was not yet ready. The front desk offered me a walking map of the area and suggestions on places to see nearby, and later phoned to let us know as soon as our room was available. We ordered room service one morning and had some really great food. Highly recommended!

I was able to book a last minute stay here over 4th of July weekend. The first thing I noticed about the place was how nicely decorated and clean the hallways were. The room I stayed in, on the other hand, was a lot plainer--though clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful, friendly, and accommodating. You have free internet and wifi use in the lobby, too. CONS: 1) Having to wait to use the shower. You pay a low price for the hotel because bathrooms are not en suite. I think one morning, I waited about 2 hours to be able to shower, even walking downstairs to check other floors. The bathrooms could have been a tiny bit cleaner, too, but it wasn't bad considering how many people use them. 2) No free parking. You get a discount, though, in a lot near them. It can add up, at $12 a day. Or, you can park at the meters after 6 for free ($4/2 hours before 6pm) and move the car at 8 am. Overall a really nice hotel in a great location.

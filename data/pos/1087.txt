Just got back from a week in this nice City. Stayed at another, high end hotel the first three nights which was exceptional, but priced a bit high. The last two nights we stayed at the Inn. Excellent location, helpful employees, and very nice rooms. It is a very fair price for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The roof top patio was really very beautiful and worth it (if the weather is nice) all by itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel in fact if we go back in the future, this would be my first pick!

Best hotel I've ever stayed at: Staff was over-the-top helpful from reservation to car service to check out. The bed was the best bed I've ever slept in. The ambiance from the courtyard to the lobby to my room, made a boring business trip something to smile about. (Really - I literally did smile!) I'll never stay at another hotel in Seattle.

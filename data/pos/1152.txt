I've stayed at the Ace probably 6 times over the past six years. It's in one of my favorite (and incredibly convenient) neighborhoods. There's tons of stuff to do, places to eat, and great shopping all in close walking distance. The staff this time was definitely better than before. The first couple times I stayed there (in 2001 and early 2002), the staff was really aloof and way too into the fact that they were working in a nicely designed, young, trendy hotel. But now every single staff person I encountered was super friendly, helpful, and cheery. That makes it an even better place to stay! Yes, the rooms are spare, a little chilly, and they don't have huge flatscreens in them. But if you just want an inexpensive, clean, centrally located place to crash, this is a great place. If you're looking for a plush bed, romantic surroundings, and room service, this isn't your place.

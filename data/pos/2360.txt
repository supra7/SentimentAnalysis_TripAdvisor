The staff at this hotel was very helpful. They were accommodating to our request for a room on a higher floor. The lounge downstairs was very nice for a cocktail after a long day of sight seeing. it is a bit of a walk to the wharf area but no more than 5-10 minutes. It sits at the top of a hill so it is so easy going down there but harder coming back. The rooms were very nice and had everything we needed for our stay. Room service was also nice.

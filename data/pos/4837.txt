We didn't have reservations and were given a room with 2 queen beds, we called and requested a room with a king bed and couch. The staff was very friendly and polite about our request. We were given another room which was perfect for us. The rooms were spotless and comfortable. There are a LOT of pillows on the very comfortable bed, white ones being feather and beige ones being foam, really nice to have so many. If you put your order in before midnight, you get breakfast brought to your room between 8 and 10 AM. We forgot to put our room # on the menu choices and when I called to see when breakfast was coming, a polite clerk named Terrell immediately got our breakfast delivered just as ordered- yummy blueberry waffles, scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurt, coffee, all for free with the room. We would definately stay there again. By the way, the hotel on the block before this wanted $60 more for their rooms and we had a great view of Mount Ranier, which the other place didn't.

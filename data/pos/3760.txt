My family stayed at the Edgewater when we were in Seattle for a business trip. We chose it because the hotel was close to where the convention was at Bell Harbor. It's an interesting hotel as it sits right on a dock over the water. As you open the window there's water right there underneath you, very intriguing...my kids loved it. (They were feeding seagulls right out of the window.) The room was small though for the price but it was clean, modern, and very upscale. The parking was very expensive and with the room rate and taxes, we paid close to $400 a night. The restaurant was very good though a little slow, perfect for someone who's not in a hurry. All and all it was an excellent experience though we probably wouldn't stay there again for that kind of price. Next time we'd opt for something closer to downtown.

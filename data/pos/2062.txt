I stayed here for one week at the beginning of May 2008. This is seriously a really great hotel in Seattle. The price is right, the location is brilliant, and the staff are friendly and helpful (Bob who works afternoon/evenings is a goldmine of information on where to eat, where to go and what to see). I stayed in the room without a bathroom (it just had a sink) on the 5th floor with a view of the sound (with a foreground view of a rooftop carpark!) I found the room big and clean, the bed comfortable and the tv had a zillion channels! It was a tiny bit annoying that the wifi doesn't really work in the rooms, but it can be accessed in the lobby. The shared bathrooms were cleaned everyday and didn't smell bad. The floor I stayed on was not a renovated floor - so be sure to ask for a renovated room. The hotel is old, so the hallways are a bit dark and overall the hotel doesn't look like a new modern/contemporary hotel. The decor is kind of old too, but the location (2 blocks from Pike Place Market) and the price definitely makes up for this. I would definitely recommend this place! (If you stay here, grab a pastry and coffee from Pike Place market for breakfast!)

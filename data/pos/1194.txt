I would like to start off by recognizing Dante at the front desk. We booked our room last minute through Hotwire. From my experience, hotels treat Hotwire guests like bottom feeders since the rate is so low. In this case, Dante treated us like we were VIPs. From the moment he greeted us, he was very accommodating, courteous, and professional. He gave us a complimentary upgrade to one of the Parlor Suites on the 30th floor. The room was gorgeous, well appointed, and very clean and spacious. The bed was to die for! The restaurant was very comfortable, very lounge like and a great place to grab a bite and drink after a long day. Our server was great, and very personable. We took advantage of the breakfast buffet the restaurant offered the next morning. The arrangement of food was of good quality and very good! I would recommend Crown Plaza to anyone who cares about getting 5 star treatment at a more affordable price. It is clear that this property values its guests and loves to make a memorable impression.

Stayed at this property with Starwood points. Was given a room on the 22nd floor on the Union Square tower. The room is very nice and clean and is quiet for a downtown hotel. The bathroom is clean and spacious. The lobby is nice. The concierge is helpful and the front desk service is prompt and efficient. The best thing about this property is the location....it is right in the good part of downtown Seattle and you can walk to all the good restaurants and nice shops. The only annoyance is the parking fee (over $30). I would rank this at par or better than the Seattle Westin.

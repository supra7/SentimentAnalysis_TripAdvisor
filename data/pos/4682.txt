The Westin Seattle was a wonderful place to stay over the New Year holiday. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The view was excellent and afforded a beautiful view of the fireworks from the Space Needle as the New Year began. Our 7 year old son loved the pool, as well as the fireworks. Did first get a two double bed room, but requested and received a King with a fold out bed. The fold out bed was perfect for our son. This was a very nice stay.

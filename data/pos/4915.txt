I'm afraid I never got to try the wine (the lobby had a flooding incident).... But the hotel it's was very comfortable and luxuriously pleasant. A lovely palette of warm hues complemented the excellent service throughout. The Italian restaurant attached was buzzy and enjoyable -but do insist on a downstairs table. The hotel itself is also in a nice quiet area of the old town and within easy walking distances of the main old town sites and restaurants.

My daughter and I just spent a few days at the Mayflower and brought along my three month-old granddaughter. I wish to compliment your hotel staff for the fine service, luxurious accommodations and kind consideration we experienced during our visit. We have decided to make this an annual trip for the three of us. When we arrived at the desk we were informed that our guestroom had been upgraded to a suite on the top floor. We had a wonderful, restful visit to Seattle, including time to shop, enjoy some local restaurants and relax in our comfortable, spacious room. The various staff members who made our reservations, parked our car, checked us in, served us wine and snacks at the Andaluca, brought us room service, and prepared such a lovely room are to be commended for their good work. We will certainly return.

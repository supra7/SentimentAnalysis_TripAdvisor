Nice hotel very convenient to UW. Good free breakfast and if you're in a hurry they'll put together a small breakfast bag to go. Small swimming pool. Quiet and clean rooms. Short walk to University Ave with plenty of student oriented restuarants. Not close to many toursit attractions. Somehwat overpriced for style of accomodations.

The Sorrento remains my "go to" hotel in Seattle. I love the old world charm, great location, friendly staff, quirky crowd and generous rooms. In fact, I've never stayed in two similar rooms or suites -- I like that. Nothing cookie cutter about this place. This time I was upgraded to a suite (thanks to AmEx platinum) overlooking the porte cochere. It was chilly, rainy and windy in Seattle and I couldn't get the heat in the room to cooperate, but the top notch comforter and bed linens were so inviting they almost compensated. The lobby and adjacent bar can be lively if there's live piano, but the Hunt Club restaurant is, regrettably, just serviceable. The signature palm trees out front are looking a bit forlorn (I don't think this variety grows well this far north -- just sayin').

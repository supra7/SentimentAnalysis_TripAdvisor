The location of this hotel is perfect, right at the heart of the city, but parking is expensive! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were very accommodating with our request to have a room with a better view.. I always enjoy staying at Sheraton hotels because of the famous sleeper beds and this one didn't disappoint, it's like sleeping on a cloud. The only (very minor) gripe was that there wasn't any shower gel supplied and I had to ask for extra toiletries, which I feel should have been supplied automatically when room service is done. Other than that, the Sheraton is a great base for a city break in Seattle!

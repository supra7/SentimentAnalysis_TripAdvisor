We traveled to Seatlle from Michigan to attend a wedding. We had many friends and kids strewn about the hotel. From the very first moment that we were helped from the taxi the stay was fantastic. Our luggage would not arrive until the next day, we were a tad stressed and missed the complimentary wine hour. The front desk folks gave us toothbrushes and cards to get some much needed and appreciated wine! That got a rotten trip off to fun and laughs in the lobby! What a lovely gesture. Our room was very cool and so was our gold fish, Hayden. After shopping Pikes Market my friends and I returned with bouquets of flowers for our rooms, the staff had vases delivered to our rooms in the blink of an eye...we were astonished. We all commented to each other about how the staff couldn't do enough for us! It was a remarkable stay at a really cool hotel.

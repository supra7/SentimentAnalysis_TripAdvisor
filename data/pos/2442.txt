We booked one night at this hotel prior to leaving Seattle for San Francisco. We just needed a place to crash for our last evening and opted for this one since it looked pretty reasonable at 50 euros each. I wasn't expecting anything particularly exciting due to all the lukewarm reviews I had previously read, but I must admit I was quite pleasantly surprised with this one. We got a room on the 12th floor with gorgeous views of downtown Seattle, including Rem Koolhass' public library, and the room was neat, tidy, spacious and welcoming, with probably the best shower of my trip. Given my low expectations, I should say this came out as a very positive surprise.

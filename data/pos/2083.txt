We had our concerns when we booked at the Moore for Sept 6 & 7, because you get what you pay for, right? And any accommodations anywhere else would have been more than triple. We were very pleasantly surprised! We got more than we paid for. The rooms were clean and spacious with character. Even though Megadeth was playing at the theater, we slept soundly. We will absolutely stay there again. The location is excellent. We used the city bus service, so parking was not a problem. Although there was no air conditioning, open windows and fans kept us comfortable. Splurge on the John Malkovich suite if it is available (private joke, you'd have to see it.)

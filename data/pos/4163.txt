My girlfriend and I stayed there for a special occasion. I LOVED having a drink in the amazing fireside room off the lobby - it's one of the best places to have a drink in Seattle. The suite was nice, but felt like it should be updated. We rode in the new British Taxi car (part of their complimentary downtown towncar service), and that was a really great way to eat dinner downtown and not worry about driving, etc (we tipped the driver $10 each way). My biggest complaint (and it's a big one), is that they don't tell you there's a pet fee until you're there. We checked the website, and while making the reservation on the phone I told them I was bringing our black lab, and they never said "there's a $50 fee" - I hate hidden charges, especially when I'm already springing for a suite. Notice here: www.hotelsorrento.com/reservations-petfriendly.php - It says they're "pet friendly" but there's no mention of the hidden fee which is tacky. Besides that, we really enjoyed our stay. They should update the rooms (TVs looked like they're from 1985), but the town car service and fireside room are amazing.

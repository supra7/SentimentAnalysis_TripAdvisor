It took us a while to book accommodation in Seattle, but we ended up deciding upon the Sheraton. It was definitely worthwhile staying here. There were four of us, and we all shared a room, as accommodation in Seattle is expensive. We decided on somewhere nicer to stay, but to share a room. The hotel room was spacious enough for 4 adults. It had two double beds, but also had enough space to put out luggage. The hotel was centrally located in Seattle, close to shopping (Macys & Nordstrom), pike place market. Seattle has a free inner city bus service, which we were able to get to from the Amtrak Station (we travelled from Vancouver via Amtrak bus). The hotel had free internet service, which enabled us to keep in contact with friends. Had a spa while here which was great. Had a huge gym by the pool, which was huge. All in all, the room was nice, clean and would definitely stay here again. We paid $149US a night for four of us, so all in all an excellent price.

Excellent staff and sunny, comfy lobby. The rooms are quite small but clean and charming. Good breakfast; I loved sitting at the counter facing Roosevelt Ave, watching early morning commuters. Afternoon snacks of veggies, salami and cheese was a nice touch. Great location nearby the freeway and minutes from downtown. My trip was business but it would be fine for a family stay as well. Fantastic without being fancy. Great price.

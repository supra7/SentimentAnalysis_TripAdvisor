My boyfriend and I have just got back from a wonderfully rainy weekend in Seattle. We were traveling from Victoria, BC, through the Amtrak train service so we were pretty tired by the time we got their. We booked a great deal with them through Hotwire,com earlier that day, and was hassle free at check in. They put us in a room facing the water with a very comfortable King size bed. The modernity of the hotel lobby continued throughout all the rooms and floors, especially the top floor with the "R-View" restaurant, fitness centre, and pool, the salt water touch was very nice as well. The location was exactly where we wanted to be..about a $5 cab ride to the nightlife, but out of the busy streets when going to sleep. The hotel also offered a refreshing & inviting lobby where you wanted to sit, relax, and have a few drinks. Their was also a restaurant on the 2nd floor called Maxwell's that we discovered on the last morning of our stay where we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast for $16.75/each that included eggs,bacon,sausages,hashbrowns,fresh fruits,waffles, yogurt and all your morning beverages you could desire. We did however experience a slight downfall on the first night where a used bandaid was on the floor beside the bed, the chambermaids removed it immediately the next morning for us thankfully. Besides that we trusted the many other reviews that we read before we left and are very happy with the results! I highly recommend the Renaissance, the staff will go out of the way to help you with anything you need!!

Came for 2-day conference and stayed for 2 days of play. I enjoyed the proximity of Sheraton to Pikes Place (fast four block walk) and other attractions. Comfortable, clean rooms. However, when Reservations could not change my room from a "double" to a king, I was told that the doubles were actual as big as queen beds. Not true, there's nothing oversized about these double beds. I don't know what they're thinking b/c these are standard double beds. Super comfy though, and the room size was average. Great view from 30th floor. TV didn't work upon arrival, but when I called for service, they sent a tech up pretty quickly to fix it. My only gripe about the room (besides being misled about the bed size) was that the iron is cheap, can't even stand up on end and therefore dangerous. I hate ironing as is, but had to deal with this 2-bit iron. Friendly staff and overall good value. The fitness center is excellent with several cycles, ellipticals, treadmills to choose from, and some free weights. Small-ish indoor pool next to the fitness room.

Staff was very friendly and professional at check in. Hotel is in a nice downtown location close to light rail stop from airport. Lobby was nice,but not that big. Each night they had a wine happy hour plus each morning there was coffee and papers to start the day. Room was nice ,but decor was dated with different colors that needed change. Bathroom was nice size and very clean. The hotel takes pets which I didn't know and found strange. Overall good place to stay.

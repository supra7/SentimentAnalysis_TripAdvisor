Hard to find fault with this one. But one caution - valet parking is terribly expensive and if you want to self park you need to do so a block away. That being said, the place is roomy, quiet, elegant, spotless and the staff is friendly and helpful. Loved the room, great view and the Daily Grill restaurant is reasonably priced and delicious. Loved the location, but beware - downtown Seattle can get pretty seedy and even dangerous. But I'd stay there again, for sure.

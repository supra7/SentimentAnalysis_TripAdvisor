My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend getaway after three months apart. We spent very little time in the room since we wanted to do all the touristy things in Seattle, but it was always so nice to come back to our nice, comfortable room. The rooms are recently remodeled but still retain some of their "charm." This isn't really a "luxury" hotel, but it is definitely comfortable, clean, and quiet (considering it's right downtown). The location could not be better, an easy walk to Pike's, the aquarium, shopping, tons of restaurants etc. The space needle is about a 30 minute walk, but we opted for a cab which was under $10. The service from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out was phenomenal. You can't beat the price for the quality of room, location, and awesome service. Will definitely be staying here again.

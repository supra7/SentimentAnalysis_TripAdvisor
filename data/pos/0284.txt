we checked into the Monaco for a memorial day weekend "staycation" here in seattle. we booked on their website the night before and got a great AAA rate for a standard queen room. we chose the Monaco for the location downtown (short walk to market) and for their very open pet policy. in general, we also like the boutique feeling of their rooms - every one feels different. i am giving this an "excellent" because their service is wonderful. we were greeted so warmly (as was our dog) upon arrival and were given an immediate and free upgrade to a Mediterranean suite, which included a huge jetted tub for two and a king bed. it was awesome. the hotel was clearly dead for the weekend - bad weather and most people leave Seattle at this time of year - so i was glad to see that they were putting empty rooms to use to make current customers happier. thank you!

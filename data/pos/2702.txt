The condition of the room was excellent, the beds were terrific however there were many over sights when the room was cleaned before we checked in. We found a dirty sock on the top shelf of the closet and some tags from newly-purchased clothing were still laying on the floor of the bathroom behind the trash can when we entered. It must have either been a very busy weekend in Seattle or the front desk was understaffed since the lines were always long. I have to congratulate them however on having the MOST professional Concierge staff I have ever encountered, the 3 ladies who helped us out on various occasions were absolutely worth their weight in gold. One of the more experienced ones, perhaps named Mary, particularily went out of her way to secure a rental car for us as well as directing us to excellent tour operators and attractions. Fabulous seating areas to wait for tours as well.

We recently stayed downtown at the Sheraton in their new tower. It was just one night, but it was a nice place to stay after a friend's wedding. We've enjoyed other local hotels more, but for the price we got, it was worth it. Amenities were good, but they didn't provide robes in the room, which is always something I enjoy to lounge around in. Service was great though and the room was spacious. No view of the water this time around, but we got a nice floor relatively high up.

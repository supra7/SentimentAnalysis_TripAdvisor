Our kids and I were looking for a fun hotel in Seattle to celebrate a surprise 70th birthday for my husband, and the Monaco Seattle, a Kimpton Hotel, was recommended to us by a friend. We had heard about Kimpton Hotels ( smaller european style first class boutique hotels, each with it's own signature restaurant), but never stayed at one. Our entire 3 day experience at the hotel was perfect and made for a very memorable celebration. From check-in, to check-out, the entire staff made us feel special and welcome during our stay, and we loved the happy hour in the restaurant. The rooms were so much more homey than most other hotel chain rooms, and the beds were great. If you're looking for a more home-away-from home hotel experience when you're on the road, check out this hotel company.

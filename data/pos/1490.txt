We stayed here one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. The hotel has a lot of character and has a beautifully furnished lobby. Our room was quiet and spacious and even had a kitchenette. There is no elevator, but the porter was eager to carry our heavy bags upstairs and did so promptly. Everyone on the staff, actually, was eager to please. In the afternoon, wine tasting was offered in the lobby and we met another couple, newly married, who were going on the same cruise we were joining. The location of the MarQueen is ideal; the Queen Anne area of Seattle is quiet, there are many restaurants, a bus stop is across the street from the hotel, the Space Needle and convention center are within easy walking distance, and even downtown Seattle is a doable walk. If you go, do NOT miss the Metropolitan Market, a few blocks away. It is one of the best urban markets we have ever been to.

Is it spartan and dated: charmingly yes! So for the traveler who appreciates a clean, classic hotel in a prime, downtown Seattle location, this is for you. We've twice chosen the Moore for a pre-cruise stay with our kids in a suite of two conjoined rooms seperated by the bathroom. It's right downtown, so there is typical noise from trucks/sirens; but the beds were comfortable and showed no sign of bugs as others claimed. My only caution is to use the same ordinary caution outside as you would in any urban area after dark. The staff is incredibly cool, accomodating and provide free internet access in the lobby to check email, etc. I have recommended this hotel to like minded frugal friends and look forward to the next time we visit Seattle for another stay at the Moore.

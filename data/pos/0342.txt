We got a good deal to stay at this hotel for our anniversary. We arrived late in the evening, and we took the advice of previous reviews and did the valet parking. Check in was very quick and easy. We were a little disappointed by the (non-existent) view from the room, but the room itself was clean and a nice size. The bed was comfortable, but I woke up with a stiff neck from the high pillows. It was not as soundproof as we like...we heard music from the next room at night, and in the morning there were loud bangs from doors opening and closing, and we could hear people talking in the hallway. Maybe we just had noisy neighbors. The aveda bath products were nice. We did not get a goldfish for our stay, though that is a nice touch and we would've taken advantage of it if we were staying longer. Location is great, within walking distance of shopping. Overall a nice experience, except for having to pay $40 for parking one night!

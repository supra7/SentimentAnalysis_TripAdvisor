I have had the priveledge of staying at the Hotel Andra in Seattle twice this year. Both times... absolutely amazing!! Hotel is beautiful, clean, has great restaurant, bar and lobby lounging areas. The staff is beyond compare when it comes to customer service and friendliness. They always go out of their way to accommodate even the oddest requests. If you want a great location and a stay you can rave about afterwards...don't miss out on staying. I will be back anytime I travel to Seattle.

We loved the old world charm of the lobby foyer with fireplace.Our room was roomy and had a great view of the space needle and the city. The resteraunt and pub like bar had a good atmosphere and attentive staff and incredible food. That the hotel was a bit small and quiet was a definite plus. Also in a good location, within walking distance to Pikes Market and the Space Needle. Would certainly stay again.

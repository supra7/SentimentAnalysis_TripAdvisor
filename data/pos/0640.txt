Hotel is well located in central business area; staff was good and responsive, nearby restaurants are fine; problem is heating/ventilation system, very noisy and intermittently runs regardless of how it is seemingly set, call to maintenance unable to resolve so I assume inherent to the system. Possible that it is room specific but I doubt this.

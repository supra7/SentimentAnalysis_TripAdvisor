I loved my recent stay at the Renaissance. It seemed like the majority of the guests were there for conferences (many held at the hotel), but I really enjoyed it for my vacation base. The location is great with easy walking distance to the waterfront, Pike Place, great shopping and restaurants. The rooms were a little small but very nice, with large flat screen tvs, extremely comfortable beds, and furnishings that seemed new. Service at the hotel was outstanding and is what I think really sets this hotel at a higher level than some of the other chains at similar to slightly lower prices. The breakfast buffet was really good, and we enjoyed both hotel bars (one on the first floor and one on the top floor). Drinks were a bit expensive but tasty, and the views from the top floor were nice. My room was on the freeway side but the noise didn't bother me at all. It was just like a steady buzz. I booked this with a good deal that included free breakfast for two (buffet) each day plus a 25$ Visa gift card for each night I stayed. I think that with these perks the value was excellent.

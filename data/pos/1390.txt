Was worried when I told my friends about the rate I got here, but when we arrived, we were greeted by a very helpful and friendly staff who knew the area quite well. Our location was fabulous...maybe two blocks away from the Space Needle, Seattle Center, the Music Museum and a mile and a half away from Pike's Place Market. Clean room with nice amenities..a/c, room fridge, microwave and small kitchenette stocked with nice plates, glasses and brand new cooking pans. We got a room on the third floor, which was very quite, but no elevator which might be a problem for those with heavy luggage. Free tea and coffee on the first floor and a quaint patio with furnishings for a dinner under the stars...just great. Will definitely stay there again if we ever make it back to Seattle. Great hotel for a single night or someone staying longer on a budget...There is a grocery store about two blocks away. Again, so very convenient. The TV was a little old, but I didn't come to Seattle to watch TV ;-)

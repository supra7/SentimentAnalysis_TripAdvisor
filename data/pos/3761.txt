We visited the Edgewater Inn, and had a room overlooking the water.... Pricey hotel, pretty nice lodging, nice view. Overall grade: B Stay there once in your life and take in the view. In 1969, Led Zeppelin checked into Seattle's Edgewater Inn. The place was a favorite with musicians because guests could fish from their room. The Beatles fishing from a window in suite 272 at the Edgewater Hotel, Aug. 21, 1964. Note: Fishing is no longer allowed?

I was at the Monaco hotel for an overnight stay while on a business trip. After a long day flying to Seattle then going to several meetings, I was delighted by the service I received at the hotel. Welcoming staff, elegant surrounding, upgrade to a suite, complimentary breakfast, convenient location, and more. Will definitely return there, whether on business or leisure travel.

This hotel is located in the business area of Seattle, next to the Library, and surrounded with skyscrapers. We enjoyed our stay, probably because we were on the "right" side, that is to say, facing the river, not the freeway. Our room was large and very pleasant, the view stunning, but I found the bed a little hard for my taste. Employees were friendly and very helpful. There is a pool and a good exercise room upstairs, as well as a restaurant with great views. Downstairs, a cafe offers basic breakfast and lunch, nothing imaginative, but the choice of cafes in the area is very limited. Ask for a room away from the freeway, and you will be happy with your stay here.

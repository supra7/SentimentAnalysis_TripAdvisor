We had friends coming into Seattle for the weekend and we ended up paying full price for our one night stay. The location is wonderful!!! The views are wonderful!!! The staff seemed courteous enough. The bed was comfortable, a little soft for our taste. The elevators were scary, not a smooth ride at all and once an alarm/ buzzer went off that worried us all in it at the time. We all had a chuckle at the economy style toilet paper, we use toilet paper as a scaling tool, sometimes it is the little things. The bathrooms are on the small side due to the shape of the rooms. We had a hard time using the clothing drawers because of where they were next to the bed, so they hit the side of the bed, a little inconvenient. We left the laptops at home also seeing as you had to pay for the WiFi. Self parking was $36/for hotel guests, I was a bit shocked that there was no free parking. Would we stay there again, yes, but we would book the room on a discount site like our friends did.

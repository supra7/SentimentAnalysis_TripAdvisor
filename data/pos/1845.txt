Stayed with three friends in one of the quadruple rooms. Beautiful hotel, super friendly staffs, and excellent location! 8 min walk to the public market and 10 min walk to the convention center made it very easy to enjoy Seattle while spending bulk of daytime in the convention center. Recommend Public Market, restaurants and coffee shops on first avenue, Washington state ferry from Pier 52, and monorail to Seattle center to Experience Music Project (Jimi Hendrix!). Also easy walk to Capitol hill to enjoy excellent pasta (Cafe Marchavelli) and honey lavendar ice cream. Our safe didn't function well and wifi internet was slow, but otherwise it was a superb stay. Will definitely stay again!

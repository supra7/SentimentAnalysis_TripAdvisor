We stayed here the night before boarding ship for an Alaska cruise. The location is right next door to the cruise terminal @ pier 66 (for NCL cruises). Arriving at night, the view of the harbour and city is fabulous, and waking up and pulling the drapes to see your cruise ship is wonderful. The water facing balcony room is more expensive, but if you can afford it...it's worth it. The room is huge with a big flat screen TV. Since we got in late, we ordered from the room service menu and the fish and chips was plentiful, fresh and delicious. The service in the dining room for breakfast was a little slow, but we had a rookie waitress. The people in the hotel are all very friendly and guest services were very helpful with giving me directions to walk to Pike Place Market which is a about a 10 minute walk. Check out the market, it is really cool with cheap bouquets of flowers ($5 - $15!!), seafood, restaurants and the usual t-shirt, knick knacks, artwork and jewellry. There is a shuttle from the hotel to downtown as well. The day of the cruise, the bell hop took our luggage to the terminal, so we simply walked to the ship...and saved the cost of a cab! The novelty and convenience of staying at The Edgewater is well worth the cost IMO.

Stayed here Sept.3rd thru 6th 2011. I loved this hotel. The lobby was beautiful. The staff was great. Friendly & helpful.Allowed us to check in about 10:00 am.The room was large. Stayed on the 26th floor. A fantastic view ,especially at night.Beds were comfortable, medium firmness. Tv had good selection of stations. Internet was fast enough for watching videos online. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the 2nd floor for 2 days. Outstanding. But I do have 2 complaints. The first is minor. I didn't really care for the bathroom doors. They are made of white glass that you can partially see through (silhouettes). For most people this might not be a problem, but for families or friends sharing a room , it might. Also when someone goes to the bathroom at night ,it lights up the whole room. Plus they are sliding doors. The second complaint is the cost of parking. $30. a day plus $6 & change tax on the parking. This reminds me of the luggage fees that airlines charge. I prefer just to have the full price upfront, please. This hotel is in a good location for walking around the city. But I do recommend going down 6th to Pike to get where you want to go, as it is a lot less steep. Also recommend the Mod Pizza place on 6th for an inexpensive meal. Even with my 2 complaints , I do recommend this hotel. I really enjoyed my time there.

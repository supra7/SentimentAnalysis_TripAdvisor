Very nice hotel in a great location. Although I would rather not pay as much, it was a great hotel and you get what you pay for. City view room's view was not quite as good as expected, but rooms with ocean views were very nice. Very clean, up to date. Luxurious. Sink is in the bathroom. While not a plus for me, it was not really a problem for this short trip anyway.

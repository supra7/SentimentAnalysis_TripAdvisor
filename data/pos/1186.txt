Needed a place to stay downtown near my office when we had a snow storm hit the city, and this place served its purpose perfectly! I was able to check in well before check-in time and got a nice room on the 21st floor. The room was nice and clean and very well appointed. The location is great too. You can easily walk to anywhere you need to get to in downtown in minutes. I'll definitely stay here again!

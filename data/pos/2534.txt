As others have noted it is well located and well priced for its location. Web research prior to this trip suggested that the top floor had a restaurant that would be a good choice for dinner but it is no longer open for dinner (which is only served in a lobby bar) but becomes the executive lounge after 3pm. It's not a bad place for a drink before dinner.

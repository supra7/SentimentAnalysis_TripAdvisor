I attended a conference in Seattle and stayed at the Sheraton. Everyone there was helpful and friendly from the curbside service to the special little request. Everyone was accomodating. You have an option of having your room serviced. If you choose not to you recieve a $5 coupon which you can use anywhere in the hotel. As for me, well it paid for my breakfast. The staff made marvelous recommendations and I enjoyed every day. The only negative was that the internet service was not free.

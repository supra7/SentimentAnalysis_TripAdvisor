Very, very pleasant rooms. Stay on higher floors for less street noise. The hotel has free wifi in the hotel lobby, but there's a fee for it in the rooms. Parking is pricey -- $36 to $39 per night -- but unfortunately this is the standard going rate at many downtown Seattle hotels. The concierge staff here is surprisingly clueless when it comes to deep knowledge of and familiarity with Seattle's great dining scene, but otherwise the staff at this hotel is friendly, professional and very helpful. This hotel is not really superspecial (particularly in this day and age of special hotels with character) but it is thoroughly pleasant and delivers reliably nice quality in an ideal location for shopping and dining in the heart of downtown Seattle. Easy to walk everywhere, or even grab transit. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

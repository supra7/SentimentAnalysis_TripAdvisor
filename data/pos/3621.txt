first off, the staff at this hotel are JUST wonderful- they all were pleasant, very helpful , and went out of their way to treat their guests well. If you worked Sept. 11-12, 2005, we thank all of you - special thanks to Anthony, who let us weary cruise travelers check in early. The hotel is pretty cool design wise........ they have turned a residential property into a nice place. The downtown location was convient, able to walk to shopping. I dont know if I would walk around at night, one block was nice, the next alittle shady- thou not the fault of the hotel !!! Our room was smaller than imagined. We travelled with our 2 children, and when the rollaway bed was put down, it was tight. The street facing windows (that opened, which was a nice treat) were fun to look out of and gave us wonderful fresh air. The bed was comfortable by hotel standards (thou the Grand Hyatt bed was just incredible ), and had cool blue reading lights. The closet for luggage storage was huge- and had lots of hanger space too. The bathroom too small with new fixtures styled in the 1920-1930 design. The sitting couch was the only seating, and wasn't too comfortable. It was a nice place visually, but dont know if we would stay there again- just wasnt worth the $$. Lola, the ajoining eatery though was superb- wow, what great food !! Ben, our server was friendly and prompt (and cute too!) Maxwell's, Central Ca.

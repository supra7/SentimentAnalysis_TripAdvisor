I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. When my daughter and I checked in we were given an upgrade. The room was very spacious and the view of the Space Needle was nice. We took advantage of the complimentary shuttle service. The only negative thing was the noise of the trains if you are in a room on the city side. Otherwise it was a wonderful place to stay.

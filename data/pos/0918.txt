We stayed at the Inn at the Market one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. We arrived early in the morning. Our room was not ready yet but the hotel staff took our cell phone number and called us when it was ready. The desk staff was very helpful and gave us directions to the Space Needle. I somehow pushed the wrong button on my camera and got it into the wrong mode. I had forgotten to bring the manual with me. When we got back to the hotel I asked at the desk if there was a camera store near by. The girl at the desk asked what the problem was. When I told her she offered to try to find the manual on the internet for me. She downloaded the instruction manual for me and showed me what I had done to get my camera in the wrong mode. The room we had was very nice. It had a partial waterview and we could look out on Pike's Market from our room. We were able to walk through the market in the morning when it was still fairly quiet before we left on our cruise. The room was quite large and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here if we ever come back to Seattle

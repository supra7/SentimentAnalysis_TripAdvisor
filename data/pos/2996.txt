Stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton Seattle, good location, right downtown, near shopping, cafs/restaurants and 5 min from Pike Market. Room is ok but need a refresh soon. Service was very fast, had a problem with safe, 4 min later, security/maintenance arrived, same thing with housekeeping for towels, very fast and good service. Nice lobby and great swimming pool/jacuzzi on the top floor with a beautiful view on Seattle. I recommend this hotel for a downtown location.

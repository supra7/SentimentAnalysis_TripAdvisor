Sometimes fate just smiles on you, and that is just how we felt about this jewel of hotel. We got our room through Priceline, so we got a deal, but the staff was very friendly and helpful! They couldn't have been nicer! The room was very clean, although a little smallish, and the bed was very comfortable. The room had a little refrigerator, which we used to store some snacks and drinks. The hotel has a great location just 4 or 5 blocks from the main shopping district with lots of name brand stores. Pike's Market is 8 or 9 blocks away--an easy 15 minute walk. There are some excellent restaurants in the area. We ate dinner at Brooklyn's and we had a couple breakfasts at Bacco's. The hotel is also only a couple blocks from an IGA grocery store and Walgreen's drug store on 3rd AV. The excellent public transportation system is also right there. You can now ride the train all the way to the airport from just a short distance away from the hotel. Some very nice extras I want to mention: Coffee in the morning (FREE) in the beautiful lobby was excellent and gets the day started right. Later in the afternoon, they serve hot chocolate (FREE), which really tastes fantastic after coming in from the cool outdoors. Early in the evening, they did a nice wine tasting hour in that same beautiful lobby. That is an outstanding way to start the evening and really was a nice surprise! I was very impressed with the attention to detail the staff exhibited! This is a really well-run hotel, and we would gladly stay there again!

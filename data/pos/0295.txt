GREAT HOTEL!!! GREAT LOCATION but..Awful Front desk! The ladies who worked at the front desk of this hotel act like they hate being there. They are not pleasant or easy to work with. They act as if you are bothering them when you making a request. They also never seemed to have anything nice to say when you entered the lobby. There were no smiles, no cordial exchanges. I do know that there was a great disparity with the evening front desk staffIt was like night and day No pun intendedbut seriously the night staff was perfect. They had recommendations and there were plenty pleasant exchanges. Cami was very nice. I really am surprised being that this is a Kimpton Hotel. Why would such unpleasant staff be used on the front line? These young ladies who work in the day really need to take a class on being in the service industry I do ask that the hotel do something about this and to let me know because honestly these ladies are bringing the Kimpton name down. With that being said, I LOVED everything elseThe restaurant is FABULOS: the happy hour is great, excellent location, walking distance to lots of things. Great complimentary hot coco, coffee and wine. The doorman and cleaning staff were extremely nice and attentive...Overall its a great hotel as long as you dont go to the front desk between 8am-8pm.

Edgewater is built out onto a pier, so it really is over the water. The rooms are lodge decor, with a cozy fireplace. If you upgrade to the nicest rooms, be aware that the higher room numbers are out farther, are completely unobstructed. And you should upgrade because the views are amazing. Plus the soaking tub was lovely, as was the newly decorated bathroom. The room decor could use some upgrading--the bedspreads are in need of a change. Absolutely do eat at the restaurant--great food, beautiful decor, right on the water. And we enjoyed the nightclub afterward, which had good live entertainment. Breakfast was great too. The one negative? No free internet which drives my husband nuts.

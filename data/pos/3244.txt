We stayed at the Sixth Ave. Inn before a recent cruise to Alaska. Yes, it's an older facility but everything was clean and working properly. The front desk staff were helpful in suggesting a late night spot to eat when our flight was delayed. They also arranged transportation to Pier 91 for us the morning of our cruise. It's location couldn't be better, a few blocks to Westlake Shopping Center, a few more to the Public Market and Space Needle. I did have issues with the wireless internet, it would drop you offline frequently and require another login. I just used my modem enabled cell phone,,,woprked fine. Great place,,,great value!!

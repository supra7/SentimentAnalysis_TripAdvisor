We went to Washington on a spur of the moment trip.Just for fun we are from Medford Oregon. First going to OMSI in Portland then Seattle to see the space needle. This place was so nice!( The Hotel) I have no idea the cost my husband paid. I doubt it was cheap=-( I have a broken foot so he checked us in........ but please keep reading! The pool is great, the view is so pretty( city lights that sparkle) the rooms clean a major number 1 thing for me!!! And every staff member made you feel so welcomed ( not like it was there job, but more they wanted too) Getting a room at last minute it only had one bed so they brought up a portable bed for my son. It was more like a down comforter bed hahaha he was in heaven! The guy set up the bed and did not act as though he even wanted to take our tip. Now valet I felt there that if you did not tip they would not be to happy about it. It's like 35$ to park your car so we did not tip. That attitude does need changing!!! We can pick up on resentment. They are getting paid by the hour. And who in their right mind wants to find a parking spot in a big city in the rain with a broken foot and a child. ( my thoughts exactly)The hotel was perfect otherwise.I would say stay there if you get the chance.Shops,workout center, computers every where for guest to use and big screen T.V's for the guys sneaking away to watch the foot ball games.lol I even have a few photos I can add. I like to write on here as we travel a lot. Keep an eye out for me I'm as real as they get. April M Wright Medford Oregon.

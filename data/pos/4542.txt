After researching many downtown Seattle hotels, we chose the Westin for a business/leisure stay. The location was convenient to walking to Pike Market, shopping, and great restaurants. The concierge service was impeccable. Ted, our man to go to, even lent my husband the belt off his pants, when my dear husband discovered he had left his own belt at home. Although our view wasn't of the Space Needle, we enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to revisit the Seattle Westin.

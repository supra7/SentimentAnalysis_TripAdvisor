A really lovely hotel. Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of October. Arrived soaking wet following an autumn downpour, but the concierge didn't bat an eyelid and made us sit straight down. Very friendly and helpful staff, and the room was beautiful, with a terrace, and huge shower. Was a bit nervous about getting a good room, after reading some of the reviews on this site, but we had no problem at all. It was a wonderfully quiet and leafy part of the city, with very quick links by Metro into the centre. The breakfast was just fine - plenty of fresh fruit, meats & cheese, pastries - a typical continental breakfast. Would definitely recommend this hotel, and intend to stay there next time we visit Rome.

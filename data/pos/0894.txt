This was a perfect location for a 2 night stay in Seattle. We were in the heart of the activity. Getting to Seattle Center, Pioneer Square and the Waterfront was easy, all were in walking distance. The Pike Place Market was right outside the door. We found great dining locations all around the hotel. We spent our eveings, at sunset, on their beautiful deck overlooking the Puget Sound. Our room was spacious and a quite oasis in the midst of all the activity below. The valet service was friendly, attentive and helpful, which after a long drive was just what we needed. The front desk staff accomadated our late departure plans by letting us keep the car parked and bags checked until the eveing, giving us the whole day to spend in the city. Perfect!

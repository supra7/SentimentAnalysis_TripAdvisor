Stayed one night at Sheraton while on vacation in Washington. Booked on Hotwire and got a great deal! The staff was very friendly. We arrived around noon and our room was not ready, but they checked us in and asked that we return in about an hour. We left our bags with the bellhop and walked a few blocks to Pike Place Market. When we returned our room was ready and very nice. The location is awesome with restaurants and shopping within blocks and the waterfront is nearby. Had the brunch buffet the next morning which was way overpriced, but tasty. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

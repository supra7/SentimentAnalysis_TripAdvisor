Located in the heart of Queen Anne. Lots to do in this area. Easy acess to down town Seattle. Cab fare is only about 7 dollars to Pioneer Square from here. The rooms are cozy and as expected for a historical hotel. The service was friendly and very helpful. Price was good. Would definitely stay here again.

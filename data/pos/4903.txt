The Vintage Park Hotel is a small hotel run by the Kimpton Group. It is conveniently located in downtown Seattle within walking distance of Pike Street Market, shopping, library, concert hall, metro, and numerous fine restaurants, including Tulio's, which is located in the hotel. Our room was comfy and clean although the bathroom was a little small. The afternoon wine tasting, featuring Washington vintners, was a bonus and very popular with the hotel guests. The concierge, Louis, was very helpful in arranging airport transportation. Oh, by the way, this hotel is pet friendly.

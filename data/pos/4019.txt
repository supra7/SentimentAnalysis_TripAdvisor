This is an excellent older hotel with great architecture, comfy beds and friendly staff. My wife and I stayed here the other day and were very impressed. The staff (particularly John) were extremely professional and courteous. We stayed in a junior suite which was nice and spacious for two people. We also dined in the Hunt Club downstairs, which featured a fantastic selection of wines. Would highly recommend this hotel.

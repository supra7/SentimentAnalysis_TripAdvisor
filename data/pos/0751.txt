In November, I went with my husband on a short trip to Seattle. We didn't want to rent a car so we booked Inn at the Market. This was a GREAT location and the service was good. The room we were given was a nice size with a comfortable bed. This place was right across the street from Pike's Market. We were able to go everywhere easily on foot. I generally don't go to the same place twice and I haven't to date. This however is on my list of places to visit again and soon.

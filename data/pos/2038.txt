walking distance to all of downtown buses, easy to walk to shops and Pikes Market area. But turn right out of hotel to experience Belltown shops, cafes and bars. But bring your own shampoos - not supplied in room. Its an upgrade from the hostel down the street and now if you are like me and plan to be out on the town and dont need to spend a lot of time in the room, you will be fine here. My room with a view I could see the space needle. somewhat noisey at night if your window faces the alley with trash trucks and the City is repaving the street in front so that could also be the source of city noise. good value, and well, "moore" than I expected.

While on a holiday with my mother we stayed at the Vintage Park for three days and we were repeatedly impressed by the service and the quality of the hotel and its staff: The Valet responded to several requests quickly, the front desk staff answered all my questions, the restaurant staff were knowledgeable about the wine, the menu and their recommendations fulfilled my expectations, and the chef even answered questions about my meal, but the highest regard is to the Concierge, Ally, who went repeatedly above and beyond. She made both my mother and I feel like we mattered.

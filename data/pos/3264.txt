We planned a day trip to Seattle from Vancouver BC but since the weather and road was getting icy getting back we decided to stay overnight.Decided on this hotel since I have stayed at sixth avenue inn years back. We inquired at the front desk for availability and price. The professional and friendly staff really provided us more than what I would expect in terms of how we were given a good drop in rate for two rooms.The room was very comfortable , well maintained and quite. Overall I am impressed with the hotel with a very competitive price/comfort than staying in an exorbitant priced hotel in downtown area.

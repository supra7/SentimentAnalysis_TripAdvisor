First I must say the location is great. You can walk to Pikes Place, the Crab Pot, the library, museum and the monorail to the Space Needle/Experience Music Project. Then I must say everyone that works there is amazing. Talk to anyone behind the counter and you get an amazing story, inside local info and more than one good story to tell your friends. I would be amiss if I did not give Wyoming (aka Bob) five stars! He made the trip. Not to mention the attached bar and the wonderful bartender who makes sure you start your vacation right. I love the Moore and hope to be back soon.

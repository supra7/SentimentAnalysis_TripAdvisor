We booked this hotel using Priceline and for $70, we got wayy more than what we paid for. The staff was super-nice and patient - thoroughly explained how the parking worked, if I needed a city map and what sort of checkout options I have if i wanted to check out but keep my car in the parking lot. We got a king suite, with a beautiful view of downtown Seattle. There was a livingroom-type room when you got in, a huge bathroom and a bedroom at the end of the hallway with surrounding windows. The pool was under renovations unfortunately and the fitness centre had new equipment, but was very tiny (about 6 people could fit in there). The only issue would be the $30/night parking (but that's like every hotel in Seattle). Overall, great hotel and i would definitely stay here again. Had the best sleep of my life in a long time thanks to those wonderful beds!

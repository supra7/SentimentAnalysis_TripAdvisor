We celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary with a romantic weekend in Seattle, based at the Hotel Monaco. We had a King Room. The bed was sooooooo comfortable both the perfect firmness mattress and the supersoft bedding. The room was sunny by day (well, the weather helped) and the window treatments kept unwanted light out at night. The flat screen TV was a nice treat, as were pay-per-view movies and a well stocked honor bar. The concierge was able to direct us to an excellent boat tour of the harbor and locks as well as to make dinner reservations. We ate the first night in the hotel restaurant which had excellent food and excellent service up until the last moment when the server lost his cool over a small error in calculating the check. I highly recommend the crab cakes appetizer, which together with an appetizer and Washington State wine made a wonderful meal. Another local restaurant, The Brooklyn, recommended by the concierge also had excellent seafood. The Monaco is an excellent hotel for a romantic or sightseeing trip to Seattle.

We stayed at the downtown Hilton recently for four nights for a conference. I was apprehensive about the stay given negative reviews from other travellers. We had a very positive experience during our stay - although we did not use either the exercise facility or the business features. As per another's suggestion we requested an upper floor room with a view of Puget Sound. This was quite pleasant. The room was clean and quiet, although a little on the small side. The bathroom amenities were quite nice. We ordered room service during the stay, and the food was excellent and arrived as ordered. Additonally, the lobby bar was pleasant and understated. I'm not sure this hotel would be a good value at full rate, but discounted for the conference it served quite nicely.

We had a great stay at the Westin over the labour day long weekend. We booked a great deal through Priceline. Location cannot be beat - so convenient. Close to shopping, Pike Place Fish Market and Belltown restaurants. We parked our car and walked everywhere. The service was fantastic; the staff was very accommodating and courteous. We will be back.

Yes, we payed $300 a night but we knew that going in and the hotel exceeded our expectations. We arrived early, around 11 am, and went into the Inn to store our luggage. We were told our room was ready so we were able to check in right then, wonderful news! The room and bathroom were large and the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was tastefully appointed. Service was always immediate and professional. This was our first trip to Seattle and the location was outstanding! Pike Place Market was fabulous; a perfect blend of tourists and locals. We used the fifth floor deck every day. We really, really enjoyed our stay at Inn at the Market and would stay again.

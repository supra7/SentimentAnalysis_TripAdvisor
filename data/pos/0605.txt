We got the Special Art Museum Package at Inn at the Market for our 3 day trip to Seattle. The customer service was first class and the location of this classy hotel was perfect! We took the light rail from the airport and got off at the Westlake station & walked 4 blocks to the hotel. We were early and they held our bags until the room was ready. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view and it was beautiful. There's a deck viewing area to soak in the views. The location next to Pikes Market is perfect because we could shop, eat, and rest anytime! The customer service was excellent! Beds were comfortable and we could see the ocean when we got up! I would definitely book this hotel again. The location, service and quality make Inn at the Market an excellent value!

We booked this hotel online and paid extra... a lot extra, for the waterfront room. This was for a special occaison, and I have to say it was worth it, though I don't feel as good about it knowing some people were able to get that for free. The Edge really does nickle and dime you at every opportunity... 25$ if you tried to steal one of the bath products? 30$ for the teddy bear that your kids will start asking for when you walk in the room? Wifi another extra daily charge. Valet parking another charge. Try not to drive there. There is a shuttle leaving the hotel on the hour, that will take patrons downtown or to the Amtrak station. No charge other than a gratuity for the driver. In the room, you will also find the usual high end hotel items like bottled water, snacks and the minibar. Loved the cute bear ottoman, noticed you can get one in the gift shop for 425$. OK this is a hotel for rich people, we may never do this again. The coffee at least was free, but I called the front desk just to make sure. Now that I've gotten done complaining, on to the good......rooms are comfortable, bathrooms are obviously remodeled and quite nice....the entire hotel is lovely, the staff are outstanding, and the onsite restaraunt, 67, is NOT to be missed. In fact it is a destination on its own. Waterfront views, impeccable service, tasteful, relaxing ambience, and the food was excellent - everything was presented wonderfully and tasted great. We may not be able to afford this hotel again if visiting Seattle in the future, but we will make it a point to visit 67 regardless.

Place itself has great rooms, with a fridge and microwave for those nights you dont want to go out. The staff are so friendly, helpful and have a sense of humour!!! You can easily go to the bar/grill downstairs to grab food and a drink. But you have not gone on holiday for that ..... this place is two blocks from downtown, a 10 minute walk from the Market and all of its delights and you can walk out the front and see the space needle. Get the monorail to the Seattle centre by walking 2 minutes and on the way back there is a drug store with all your needs. Obviously as this is Seattle coffee is everywhere around you in the morning. Simply for an easy stay in Seattle - walkable to all the sights you can not get better and at the price that this place is - you really can not get better in central Seattle. On an evening there are a couple of bars within walking distance (or staggering) and if you want to go on any of the organised tours (Mt Ranier, Lakes etc) then the staff on the front desk are happy to organise. You can leave your baggage on the day you arrive or leave. Had a fantastic time here and would recommend the place to anybody and everybody

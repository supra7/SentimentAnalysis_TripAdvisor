Our group was going on a cruise so we came into Seattle early to see the sights. I'd read about the Moore on Trip Advisor and decided to book 4 rooms for us. Everyone was delighted with the price of rooms and charm of this once grand dame. The staff was very helpful and friendly, Ed was a dear! Our rooms had all recently been renovated and were lovely. The beds were great. The location is great for being able to walk and see the sights of Seattle. No car needed. I can't remember the name of the coffee house we went to but it was accross the street to the right and about a half block down. By far the best Latte I've ever had! I will definately stay here again!

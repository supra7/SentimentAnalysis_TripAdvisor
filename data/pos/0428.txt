The Warwick is in an older building but the rooms and public areas are up to snuff. Flat screen TV, good internet (albeit at a charge), a dorm fridge, small bathroom but nicely appointed with good soaps and big towels, nice lounge. Public areas are small, but that is what you get with older structures. Easy to walk to a lot of places. Valet parking is $30/day, but I didn't need a car. This is no more than other downtown hotels where the rooms are much more expensive. Staff was courteous and friendly. I would definitely stay there again.

We went to Seattle for the weekend for a Seahawks game. We got a package that included parking which was a great deal for us because even though we checked out on the Sunday which was game day we were allowed to leave our car at the hotel and took transit down to the game. I was very pleased with my whole experience with this hotel starting with the reservations agent who was very friendly and knowledgable.The conceirge at the hotel was absolutely amazing and was able to answer all our questions about restaurants, directions and shopping. The rooms were very nicely appointed and our room service breakfast that we ordered the night before came right on time and beautifully presented. The location of this hotel is perfect! Right near all kinds of restaurants and shopping and public transit. I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel.

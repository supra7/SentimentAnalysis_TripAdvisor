This was the third year I have spent my new year's eve birthday at the Mayflower. What can I say, it just feels like home. From the moment I arrive at valet park I feel like the hotel is my home. The service and attention to detail is impecable. The rooms are old world spacious, clean, and up to date classic all rolled into one. Oliver's is the place to ring in the new year with classic cocktails remeniscent of a black and white movie with service to match. Yes, I've been to France, Australia, Mexico, Thailand...gimme the Mayflower for opulence and old world classic style any day!!! After a weekend there I feel like I've left the real world behind and traveled to grown up Disney Land!

Excellent location and so much more personal than the majority of hotels we have stayed at in Seattle. Everything was as described on the website, if not better. The staff were universally friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant. In addition, the hotel is surrounded by several fabulous Tom Douglas Restaurants, including our new favorite, Lola, which is part of the hotel. Overall, a great experience and it will be our top choice when we make our annual visit to Seattle.

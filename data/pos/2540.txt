We stayed here for the U2 concert. The rooms were great. View was nice. Price was reasonable. Would definitely stay here again. The location was the best part if you want to enjoy downtown Seattle. Easy to get to from the I5 coming in from Canada. The only small wierd thing was how the lobby was on an upper floor because it was separated from the ground level by parking. Also sucked abit they didnt have valey parking but then again nice not to have to pay for it like you do at the Sheraton next door.

What a fabulous hotel!! Excellent accommodations..Fantastic city view with windows that open [3inches then safety limitor]; 5 bed pillows that make a dreamy mountain range..a sink fixture that makes a mini waterfall--resembling the many water fountains around the city...umbrella and robes in the closet..all night menu for room service! Kind, Caring, and Amusing hotel staff...doggie bowl at drive and little bone biscuits near desk..:)

Unlike other reviewers we found this hotel very functional. It is quite plain when you enter the lobby but the staff were really friendly. When we got our room keys we were very pleasantly surprised at the size of it, and the size of the bed! It would have slept 3 people comfortably. There was lots of space to relax and there was a chair with a foot rest. It is downhill from the hotel to the shoreline which means of course, that it is uphill back, but if you walk across another couple of streets and then return, it isn't nearly so steep, and we are in our late 60s, so if we can manage it I don't know what others are whingeing about! The freeway is close by and we could hear it slightly from our room but it didn't disturb us at all. We were also able to buy breakfast in the cafe/restaurant on the second floor and it was very good. The concierge staff were also very helpful especially when we needed to print our boarding passes. So all-in-all, we think this a good hotel for a couple of nights.

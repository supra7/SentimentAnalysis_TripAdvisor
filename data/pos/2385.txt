Stayed at Renaissance for one night on Labor day. The location is very good in downtown Seattle. However, it's on uphill and near the high way. A bit noisy and could be quite a walk to Pike's market etc.. The lobby was very pretty- nice modern style decor. Room is spacious. This is an old hotel but they renovated it. The furniture in room is very modern style, as well as the bathroom. The lady at the check in counter was extremely kind. Enjoyed the style

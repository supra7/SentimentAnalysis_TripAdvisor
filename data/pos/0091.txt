We were visiting our daughter in Seattle. We stayed for four days. What a totally wonderful experience at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. Everyone was more than friendly and accommodating. The wine hour was very nice, and we enjoy nice wines, and theirs had the taste and appeal of fine wine. The entire hotel had the appeal of a nice, fine, hotel. It was a super experience, and one that I hope to repeat, the next time that I visit my daughter in Seattle.

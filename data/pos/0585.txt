I travel for business and prefer relatively small hotels instead of the huge, name-brand dormatories. In Seattle, I found the Warwick. Two hundred rooms, not 2000. A very personable staff. Free shutle rides to your appointments around downtown. Tiny excertise room, pool, adequate restaurant, 24 hour room service. All at rates lower than the more famous people barns down the street. A very pleasant experience. PS. The hotel is in the upgrade process and the refurbished rooms come at at a $20 premium. Worth it.

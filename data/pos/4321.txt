Good 4 Star hotel with central location with great views from upper floors. Chosen on Trip Advisor advice rating  and my experience there were pretty much in line with all the other reviews. Upside: Motivated, friendly and efficient staff. Downside: During my stay I experienced absolutely hopeless Wifi (drop out and lots of contention) which Westin expected to charge exorbitant rates for the joy of using it. So bad in fact I went to Starbucks and McDonalds(just behind the Westin) to use their free WiFi. That said there was quite a large number of less fortunate folks in and around McDonalds and it felt rather inflammatory rocking up with a flash lap top and phone ..so no evening calls!

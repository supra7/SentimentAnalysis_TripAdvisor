I just stayed at the Edgewater, I loved the rustic decor and the staff was absolutely wonderful! I did have to pay 33 dollars to park but the valet staff was great. It is close to many waterfront restaurants with a wide variety of things to do. Downside with teenagers were no vending machines- take your own snacks or pay dearly for them. The view was great I loved it. I would stay again and recommend to anyone. If you cannot appreciate this hotel then you either have too much money or too much time on your hands. The rain shower, shower head was the best !! you were wet all over and the shower was nice and steamy in no time. I loved it and so did my kids.

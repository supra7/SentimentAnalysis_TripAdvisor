I stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle for two nights in September. I always enjoy the Kimpton hotels because of their exceptional service. This hotel is no exception. The hotel is clean, in a great location and yes... the service is great. Everyone from the front desk staff to the cleaning personnel are very friendly. The restaurant is also very good. I have stayed at Kimpton properties in many cities (San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Denver, Chicago and Seattle) and I am never disappointed.

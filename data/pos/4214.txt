I have been to Seattle many times in the past but this was my first time at the Westin and had a great time there. Excellent location with plenty to do within walking distance.I even returned my rental car after 1 day because I never needed it. Very clean room and beautiful views made this hotel even better. Rooms were immaculate and the conference center was well staffed and ran like clockwork. Free Wifi also was fast and safe.

Not only did we get a great deal through Priceline, the hotel also exceeded our expectations as well. The location is excellent, truly a great "central location" for everything in downtown Seattle. Shopping, Pike Place Market, etc. are all within walking distance which is nice. We attended a show at Jazz Alley, which was only a block away from the hotel. A couple other "not to miss" things nearby is the Icon Grill restaurant across the street (wonderful atmosphere & food) and Lola on the corner of 4th & Virginia. All 6 people in our group tried their "made to order" doughnuts and agreed they were the best doughnuts we had ever had. The hotel itself was clean, rooms were pleasantly large & comfortable. The views were great since their aren't many other very tall building immediately next to the hotel (except the other hotel tower since there's 2). The Sheraton Hotel is the other 4 star hotel you commonly get with Priceline bids in downtown Seattle, and we've stayed their 3 times in the past. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Westin more than we've enjoyed previous stays at the Sheraton hotel, although the Sheraton is nice too. Highly recommended hotel!

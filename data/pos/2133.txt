We stayed at the MOORE for two non continuous nights and we were glad we did...the rates were the best in town and the hotel was as clean as a whistle....the help at the desk was great....Bob was especially wonderful and the best! Thanks Bob for alll your help while we were there. The manager, was also terriffic. I had a problem and he allowed me the privilege of sending a fax free of charge from his office. He couldn't have been nicer. The location of this hotel is great. Just a few blocks to Pike Street Market.. (BIG ATTRACTION IN SEATTLE) The rooms are big and the closet is emence. The hotel is not fancy but it is clean, quiet and safe and there is a computer available in the lobby which can be used free of charge and an elevator to take you to the upper floors. Rooms with or without a bath can be obtained. I would definitely stay here again. The city is great. The buses in town do not charge anything. Great restaurants and a fun place to visit and a great place to start off your vacation. We used the Clipper Boat/ferry Service and visited lots of close by places; San Juan Island; Victoria and Vancouver... you will not go wrong if you stay at the Moore. Read the history of the place...which is very interesting....I only wish I had time to visit the Theater next door...which I understand from the Manager/owner it is one of the oldest in the US. Smart ecconomical travelers will stay here who do not require the Marriot ambiance and/or do not want to pay the top prices.

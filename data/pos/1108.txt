If you haven't yet stayed at one the Ace hotel's (Seattle, Portland, New York), you should. Simple rooms with special touches like the decor or the sweet little radio/IPod dock. Seattle's version is located right in Belltown and within walking distance of everything worth seeing. They also seem to have cornered the market on hip front desk people with an ear to the ground on what's happening in Seattle.

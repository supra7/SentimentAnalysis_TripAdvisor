This hotel was is in a great location to see the sights of Seattle Close to the market, downtown and the various types of public transport - The rooms were basic (I had one with a shared bathroom) - but theye were clean, as were the shared facilities. The staff were great on the fron desk, the most helpful I came across in my 3 weeks in the USA. (And yes, they really do wrap thier towels in the shape of an animal on arival!)

After checking many travel sites I went online directly to this hotel. They had a special deal that was very hard to believe. I kept waiting for them to add hidden charges. It never happened! Every staff member we met was very friendly. The location was very good for walking around downtown. The room was small, but clean and well appointed. I could not think of anything that is lacking. We'll definitely return.

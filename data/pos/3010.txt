We paid $99 per night through a Priceline deal over Memorial Day Weekend and this hotel more than met our expectations. We were on the 11th floor, and our room even gave us a bit of a view of the water through a few skyscrapers. Very comfortable bed, very clean (with bliss spa products, my favorite), and very quiet. We avoided the valet parking because it was pretty expensive, but there were several parking garages on the surrounding streets that while not cheap were a little less per night. This hotel is within walking distance to Pike Place Market and many other restaurants and shops in the area. Very close to the baseball stadium also. We couldn't have been happier and for the price - it was unbeatable. Would absolutely stay here again, even if the rate wasn't as good.

You will always get mixed reviews on dining and lodging experiences, and the Mayflower is no exception. I had read some less favorable comments before arriving for my stay and I think these folks must have stayed at another hotel because our stay was perfect. The staff is super friendly. The hotel has all the charm and ambiance that you could possibly want. The location is perfect for access to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. The Light Rail takes you right to the hotel with a hop and a skip through Westlake mall, you never have to go outside to reach the hotel lobby. Stay here - you will not be disappointed!

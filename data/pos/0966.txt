This hotel is amazing and you won't be sorry if you stay here. Right in the heart of downtown and 1/2 block north of Pike's Market. You don't even really need a car if you stay here. There is a restaurant across the street called Steelhead Diner that has the BEST CRAB CAKES ever. The hotel is in a small quaint building that doesn't look like the other high rise hotels in Downtown Seattle. It has Tempur Pedics beds and the real kicker is the 5th floor rooftop terrace that overlooks the market and the Puget Sound. The desk staff was nice enough to give me a great room with a partial water view (even though I paid for the inexpensive city view). Each night I would take a bottle of wine and cheese and sit on the terrace and watch the ferries roll in on the Puget Sound. This hotel is what MADE my stay in Seattle so great - that and the Lady Gaga concert at the Showbox! The desk staff at the hotel were so friendly and I really felt at home while staying there. I had never been to Seattle and was alone for a week long trip- the staff did everything possible to ensure I had a wonderful trip. They pointed me to all the great shopping places nearby, local restaurants or coffee shops I might like to try and even gave me some pointers on diff neighborhoods in the city. The bellman and valet were also super helpful and friendly. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and the staff who work there- I felt so welcomed! 5 stars for this place! Inn at the Market should know they have free advertising in Tucson, AZ from me! I'm going back in April and will be staying there again. Cannot wait!

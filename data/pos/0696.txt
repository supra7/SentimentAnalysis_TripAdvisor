Inn at the Market is hands down the best hotel out there. The staff is neat, friendly and courteous. They go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and welcome. They even included cupcakes and a card for me, for my 50th Birthday. The location is great, right in the Marketplace. Its a short walk to light rail and buses. The rooms are spectacular, especially the rooms with water views. I will stay there every single time I am in Seattle.

Our two night stay was arranged by Clipper Vacations travelling from Victoria. The hotel was easy to get to and close to everything. Room was very nicely appointed and the bed was the most comfortable we'd ever slept in while away from home. We didn't get a chance to eat at Andaluca but we enjoyed a couple of nice drinks in Oliver's. This bar has got to be the best anywhere. Kicking out the old school cocktails with a nice friendly accomodating manner. Really no negatives to speak of at all. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The entire building is well kept and you can tell it's managed with pride. We will defintiely be back to enjoy the hospitality at the Maryflower many more times in the future.

The Hotel- Location- Awesome location, we walked everywhere, from Pike Market to the Football Stadium. Lots of restaurants, and bars close by. Amenities- The gym/pool area is on the top floor and has views that overlooks the city, which was incredible Rooms- Rooms are pretty basic, but has all the Sheraton nice things, like comfy beds :) Our room was a really awkward layout, long and narrow, with a couch next to the bed, but the view of the city made up for it

we stayed with family the week of July 14th - very clean and comfortable. We didn't have a car so the parking fees didn't apply. ( we took the link from the airport - 40 mins to Westlake and 3 block walk but only $2.00/person) the beds were super comfortable and the hotel was clean. we stayed in union tower and swam in the pool. ( small pool but clean with a view). Within walking distance of Pike's place, waterfront, shopping and restaurants. Very safe part of town.

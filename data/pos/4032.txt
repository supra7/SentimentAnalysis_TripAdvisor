Seattle is a wonderful and gorgeous city so you should match the experience with the superb Sorrento Hotel. This hotel has character; there are Thanksgiving menus dated in the early 1920's that greet you by the single elevator (a bit of a nuisance at first, but you'll get over it quickly). The lobby is immaculately studded with old wood and a cool ambiance that can only be captured in times past. About the staff, I can only that even your expectations will be exceeded. They were courteous and attentive, amidst a very large group, and did their best to accomodate almost every request (or annoyance) we might required. I highly recommend this hotel and hope your stay will trigger an equally stellar review.

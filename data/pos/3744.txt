We stayed at this hotel pre-cruise (trian to Vancouver, BC). What a great hotel. Perfectly located, within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in downtown Seattle and a wonderful park just down the street. Plenty of places to eat and drink right outside the door. We found nothing to complain about and loved our stay. We would certainly stay at this hotel agin. Our room was very pretty, modern bath, and clean.

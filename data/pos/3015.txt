We booked this hotel through Hotwire (for 99USD per night). Stayed there for 3 days and definitely love it. Previously read a few reviews about being treated poorly if the hotel staffs realized that we booked the room through 3rd parties including Hotwire. That wasn't the case for us. We arrived at the hotel an hour before check-in time and got through the line within 5 min (considered that there was a big group of people in the lobby due to some convention). We were asked if we want upper/lower floor and opted for the upper floor option. We ended up getting 26th floor (top). The room was clean and beds were super comfortable. The location of the hotel was fantastic with 10 min walk to Pike Market, and shopping right across the street! The pool was rather small, but if you go early in the morning before 8am, it's rather quiet (I was there alone at the pool from 730-8 for a quick swim). Oh, and I love their hot tub! :D Free 45-min internet in the lobby as well.

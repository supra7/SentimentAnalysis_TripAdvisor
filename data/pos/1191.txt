Easy to find and handy to downtown, Pike Place, Hard Rock Cafe etc. Found it easy to walk around and parked our car in the nearby public carpark and saved on the hotel parking fee which was quite expensive. This hotel had interconnecting rooms and we were on the 22nd floor we overlooked the motorway which was a little noisy but for us Kiwi's we quite enjoyed watching the traffic below us. Good views out towards the mountains also. The beds were very comfy and the hotel bathrooms were well equipped, clean and spacious. Staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. Would stay here again. Free wifi another bonus for the teenagers.

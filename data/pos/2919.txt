I have stayed at a few other Sheraton properties and this is my favorite so far. The property was very easy to get to, only a few blocks away from the Westlake light rail stop. The hotel is very close to the flagship Nordstrom and 5-10 minute walk to Pike Place market. The Concierge was very helpful at finding a place for lunch (the Brookyln Seafood). This property is part of Starwood's Green effort. Guests are given a choice to decline housekeeping each day in exchange for a $5 food voucher or 500 Starwood Points. It is fairly easy to participate as you hang a sign on the doorhandle each night. I elected to take the Starwood points, but they have not yet posted to my account. I checked-in a few hours ahead of the standard check-in time and was able to get settled into a room right away. My room was right across from the elevator bank, which gave me initial concerns. Fortunately I did not experience any noise issues. The room was very spacious. There was a complementary bottle of water in my room when I arrived (I am not sure if this is standard for all rooms as I was on a Starwood Preferred Guest Floor). One of the highlights of the stay was the breakfast in the Club Lounge. There was a large selection of breakfast items to choose from and a large amount of seating as well. At checkout, the front desk was very helpful at shipping a box back to my house. Club Lounge - very good breakfast

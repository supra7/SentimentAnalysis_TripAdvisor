Our second visit. Great location, fantastic restaurant. Cool and funky industrial/modern/Northwest decor. Water view recommended. Staff was very pleasant and handled our room-change requests with professionalism. Close to the Space Needle and waterfront attractions. Amazing sunset views. Will be back for sure!

Our family stayed in the hotel. The second I arrived I knew it was going to be a great stay. We had no trouble getting into the room and a very nice guy parked the car in their specialized garage. The swimming pool was humungous and led to almost an hour of swimming. They recommended an italian restaurant called Buca de Bepo. Moi delesioso! It was a 3 minute walk to the needle and 1 LRT ride away from the market with the original starbucks. In general this is an amazing hotel. Not mentioning the amazing breakfast. The regular continental breakfast with hot food as well. The T.v's were kind of small but way better than some of the others we saw on our trip. I would stay there again and a small stuffed animal was left behind. no matter, they saw to it asap and when we got home there was the animal, all packed up.

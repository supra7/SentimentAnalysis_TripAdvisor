This is a nice "little" hotel. They have complimentary wine tasting most nights. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Having to subscribe to get free internet is a slight pain, but not a big deal (nbd). The little work out room is kind of a joke, but it is a clean and well appointed joke...the TV (w/headphones) on the exercise machines is nice. The hotel is kind of at one end of the part of town if you're walking around, but, again, nbd. The bartender of the restaurant was great.

We stayed at the hotel Sept.24,25, 2005. Arrived late and was given a fine room, asked for a room with a good view and was given a room on the 32nd floor. No priceline attitude by the f desk. Room was great with no complaints. Would we stay here again. Yes. Very convenient to shopping and fish market.

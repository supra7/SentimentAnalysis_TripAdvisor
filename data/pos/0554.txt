We stayed at the Warwick for an overnight getway and to enjoy some Christmas shopping. The Warwick exceeded out expectations. The staff was wonderful and extrememly friendly, the room was clean and the service at the lounge was wonderful! Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel was very friendly! The women's bathroom on the lever above the lounge was...well.. I think is haunted... totally creepy vibe and the lights... anywho. Even with that, we really enjoyed our stay and are going back in a couple of days!

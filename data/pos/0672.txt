I always travel with my own down pillow as I usually hate hotel pillows. The pillows here were exceptional.. the best ever hotel pillows.. I won't bring my own next time. The bed was firm with a soft topping.. great for a good night's sleep and perfect for a back that has walked all day. The location is so good that you really can walk most places from here. Staff were all way above average, professional and pleasant. I had a room with a "partial view" of the ocean. Actually I had a spectacular view as I had 3 windows and the city was just as interesting. Lots of natural light was a real plus for me. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and stay here on my next Seattle visit.

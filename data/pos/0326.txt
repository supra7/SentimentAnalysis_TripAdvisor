I have never been in a hotel where a goldfish is in the room. A goldfish with a name. This place is quite quirky. Here for a huge conference - 7000 lawyers: insert punchline here - so inevitably some of them were also staying here, but it was a world away from the hotels downtown, but thankfully not literally. Staff are friendly. The concierge knew his stuff. Would probably consider staying here again. Popped into the W over the road and preferred the Monaco.

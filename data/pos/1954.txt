The very good: Robert on the front desk; nothing was too much trouble, a wealth of knowledge on all things Seattle. Location The good: The room size. Plenty of hanging space and draws. The not so good: The toilet bowl was butted up against a protruding coloum, forcing one to sit with a leg pointing at 10 oclock and trying to complete the paper work was more difficult than normal. The shower cubical was a tad small. No wifi for our 3 nights Our room faced onto the street and was aware of early morning traffic noise. None of the above was show stoppers, and it would not stop me staying there again, should I return to Seattle

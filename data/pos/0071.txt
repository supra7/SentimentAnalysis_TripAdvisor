Supposedly built in a former bank- welcoming cheerful staff- room 607 is large with Queen bed, no view- good small bath with lighted shave mirror and hairdryer; good bath amenities- T V and purchase films, the latter expensive- Avoid breakfast as it's too pricey; cross the street to the Seattle Brew or turn left to Starbucks- the hotel serves coffee in the Libby until 9 AM and has a 5 PM wine tasting with snacks which is free- only blocks from Pikes Place-

This was my first time visiting Seattle and I couldn't have been happier with our choice. The location is unbeatable. Steps away from the Market, with some of the best food options located around the hotel. The rooms were excellent, roomy, and the tempurpedic beds had me sleeping like a rock. I thought that the only improvement would be to add their own kitchen so they don't have to rely on the neighboring restaurants for room service. But that was so minor. I also loved the terrace, that was accessible to all guest so they could relax morning or night and watch the harbor and the ships coming in to the market.

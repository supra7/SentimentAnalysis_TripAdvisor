I stayed the nite following a cruise. My friends were to fly later that day, but we went to the hotel to hopefully drop off our luggage & do some sightseeing. It was 10 a.m. when we arrived at the hotel, with check-in being after 3 p.m. First, the valet's took all our luggage, which was substantial & sent mine to the room. I recieved my luggage within 20 minutes of checking in. They kept my friends luggage on the main enterance until they left later that day. I was impressed that they would do this for someone not staying overnite. I went to the front desk & they were able to check me in at 10 a.m.! I was so happy, but nervous that I would get a horrible room for this exception. But no, I had a wonderful room on the 10th floor that looked out to the Space Needle (see my pictures). My friends were happy to be able to nap before their flight. I used the Concierge desk 2ce & always friendly & helpful. They did look very busy later in the afternoon, but had 3 or 4 employees to answer questions. When my friends left that afternoon & when I left the next morning, our luggage was delivered withing minutes. They also carried all the bags to the curb where we got on the Gray Line Airport Shuttle. The hotel has internet service at a cost, but it does offer free access to download & print your Airline E-ticket. I almost forgot, I did order room service & was very happy with the quality & amount of food. I recieved my food around 20 minutes after ordering, which again surprised me, as I often wait at least an hour at most hotels. Of course, room service is at pricey hotel standards, but worth it for me, as I was exhausted. And Starwood Properties have the most comfy beds, pillows, & bedding

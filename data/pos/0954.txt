Found this hotel on a whim to get away overnight for an anniversary celebration. Rate was a last-minute rate, and seemed very reasonable for a boutique hotel. So we went for it and were so pleased! Staff upgraded our room to celebrate our anniversary, provided a chocolate treat and a happy anniversary note which made us feel very special. I forgot my Blackberry charger at home and the staff even had a spare charger which helped make my life much easier. The rooms were clean and well-appointed, and felt very spacious. Woke to a lovely view of the water and market. The BEST location in Seattle in my opinion, if you are playing tourist during your stay. Campagne for brunch was HEAVENLY and literally steps from the front door. $25 fee for in-and-out privileges/valet parking might seem a bit pricey, but parking is hard to come by in that area! Can't find anything to complain about with this hotel, and will definitely be back again!

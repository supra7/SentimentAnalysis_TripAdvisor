The hotel is located in a prime downtown location. The staff from the bellman to concierge, to front desk and even housekeeping are gracious and pleasant. I don't believe they know what the word "no" means because everything we requested was delivered as promised and then some. While the beds and pillows could use some work because they were not the most comfortable, the staff made this hotel stand out as one of the best that I've been to. I'm used to my five star hotels but Inn at the Market by far exceeeded my expectations. I would return in a heartbeat!

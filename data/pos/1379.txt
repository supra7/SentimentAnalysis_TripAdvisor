Inn at Queen Anne is an older boutique hotel with age-appropriate decorations in the halls and lobby. My room was basic but clean and freshly painted. A view of the Space Needle loomed large out the window; it is only 4 blocks away. There was a small full kitchen, complete with gas stove and oven, bar refrigerator, microwave, and pots, dishes, and utensils. There are 2 supermarkets within 2 blocks, so it is easy to get whatever you want to eat in. But there are a very large number of restaurants of all kinds within a few blocks. Downtown Seattle is a 10 minute bus ride away; the buses run frequently and to after midnight. On the down side, there is no elevator in the 3 story building. And the free wi-fi was up and down most of the time. Also there was major construction across the street that started at 7am on weekdays. It was hard to sleep in with the nails being pounding incessantly. That should be a temporary thing since they were building quickly. I had a weekly rate for my 11 day stay and the price was the best.

Just got back from a fantastic stay at the Hotel Monaco. Thought this was excellent location for a downtown Seattle trip- only a 10-min. walk or so to the Market, or to the Monorail to Seattle Ctr., and generally positioned right in the middle of things. Further, thought the staff was very friendly & customer-service focused. Concierge gave great advice; cleaning staff was very good; front desk very friendly. Enjoyed the "wine" happy hours they host for free in the lobby every night. Room was very pleasant, however, our room didn't have any view (it looked into a wall), so if that's important, may want to look into that ahead of time.

We love kimptons and we enjoyed our stay here , but we wish Our dog was with us and that there was a pool or rooftop hot tub.. Wine hour is always great. The rooms were clean and modern but the beds were not so comfy. You are a few blocks away from the fish market and some great restaurants (Go to "list" for happy hour- half off great food and beverages inc. Wine bottles). Make sure you join kimpton rewards!

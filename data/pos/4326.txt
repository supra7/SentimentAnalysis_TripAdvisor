This is a classy hotel, with unique architecture, both towers are round. It's walking distance to most of downtown Seattle, has some good food in the restaurants and the rooms are well appointed with "Westin Heavenly" beds, that are hard to beat for extreme comfort. I used the gym and pool and found them to be nice, though small. Pike Place Market is just down the road, most of the higher end shopping is nearby and the tram you can take to the Seattle center is nearby as well, though it is also within walking distance. My only complaint is that they charge a ton for parking and aren't exactly fast getting you your vehicle when you want it if they are at all busy at the time. I paid more to park the car for the 2 or 3 nights we were there than I did to rent the thing from the airport. All in all, a really nice hotel in a good location in downtown Seattle.

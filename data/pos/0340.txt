We were visiting family in Seattle and My husband and I decided to have a night out in the city and stay here. It was so nice. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean. Sweet flat screen with video games. There is a mini bar with overpriced drinks but it didn't stop us. There was no pool which we would of liked. The view from our room was sweet. The location of the hotel was perfect. Its a nice walk to shopping and down to pikes market. We will stay in a Kimpton again!

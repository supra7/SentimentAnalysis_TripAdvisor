Twice I have stayed here as a cheap alternative to the Westin, where I was at a conference. For $100 less per night, you get a perfectly adequate room. They may have done some work in the two years since I was last there. I found the room fine, though it and the bath were a bit small. Iron, coffee maker, hair dryer, lights and TV fine. The food is OK but the restaurant a bit on the dark side. I really liked my little room, except the windows are single pane and daytime traffic noise is a bit loud (get a room on the upper floor, or at the back). This is a budget hotel, but it is not a dive. Definitely a step up from Motel 6 style places. Lots of food in the places - just blocks from Westlake Center. Bed and linens were just fine. I have always found the staff to be pleasant. I'll stay there again.

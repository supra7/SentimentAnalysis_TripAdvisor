The Moore Hotel itself is an excellent place to stay for the money but not so much if you are driving a vehicle. Parking is a bear around the hotel. We had to wake up at 7:00am every morning when our overnight parking expired to pay additional fare, we spent almost $100 in parking fees. I would definately stay there again if I flew to Seattle but not if I drove.

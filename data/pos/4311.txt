We actually stayed here in May 2010 before going on a cruise. The staff were great. The room was very nice and had a good view. Everything in the room was clean and in good order. We did not hear any noise from neighboring rooms. We walked to a couple of restaurants and walked to the space needle. I would recommend the hotel to others. Tip: we got a great rate from a popular name-your-own-price site. If flying in, downtown is a bit of a drive from the airport. When we got off the plane, we skipped the pushy cab drivers and got a limo (not 20 feet from the cab stand) for only $10 more!

Stayed at this hotel for a week for a conference. My first impression of the hotel was that it was modern, clean and newly refurnished and the bedroom was the same way. Close to everything, restaurants, light rail, convention center ... etc. Even after staying a week I had no major gripes. The only minor gripe I had was that the walls were a bit thin as I heard my neighbors a couple times. Also street noise was heard a bit. But I had ear plugs so no biggee! Also, I never complained about it, but the pillows weren't as plush as I'd hope for.

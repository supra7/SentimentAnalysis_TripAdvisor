I stayed at the Warwick while on a business trip to Seattle. It's located in the downtown area and is very close to shopping, restaurants, Seattle Center etc. I took the Gray Line Airporter shuttle to the hotel from the airport. The Airporter runs every 30 minutes between 5am and 11pm for only $10.25 or $17 round trip. It was quick and the drivers were very friendly, I'd definately recommend this service. When I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very welcoming. I received a room with a King bed on the 16th floor with a beautiful view. The room had a standard mini bar & fridge, a small coffee machine and a comfy robe. I was relieved that they had room service and enjoyed a grilled sandwich and a glass of wine in my room after a long flight. This hotel is one of the few in Seattle to have a pool. The gym is nicely equipped and the business center is open 24 hours a day. Other amenities include turn down service and a daily newspaper. The restaurant served a delicous breakfast, and the bar was a nice quiet place for drink in the evening.

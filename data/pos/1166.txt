This hotel couldn't be more convenient. It is a perfect hotel for a tourist who wants to be in the hip part of town. The hotel is located right at one edge of the "free zone" bus area near the Space Needle. There are plenty of restaurants and bars/clubs within a 3 block radius. The Pike Market is a 5 minute walk and Pioneer Square is only a 10 minute walk. But you can take the 1st Avenue bus and get to either even quicker. My boyfriend and I stayed in Room 111, which is a standard room right by the front desk with shared bath for only $95 per night. The room was definitely "cozy" (meaning small) but if you are a good tourist, you don't spend too much time in the hotel room, anyway. The hotel also offers rooms with a private bath, if necessary. Don't be "put off" by the shared bathroom situation though. The bathrooms are not dorm-like bathrooms where you are showering with strangers. Each shower and toilet is designed for individual use. They were super clean and offered all amenities (shampoo, conditioner, towels, hair dryer, etc...). It got a bit loud at night because of the club right downstairs but... I woke up once and went right back to sleep. The front desk staff is extremely helpful. They are all young locals so they can offer suggestions for any type of tourist activity. They lock the front door at midnight but the key to your room can open the front door. A continental breakfast is included in your room night fee and you should DEFINITELY take advantage. It begins at 8am. It includes cofee (of course), OJ, yogurt, granola, fruit and toast. It's a perfect start to the day. In the same area, you can take advantage of more amenities offered: washer & dryer, vending machines, microwave, etc...

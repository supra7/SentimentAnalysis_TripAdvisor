Hotel itself was great, I stayed there back in May. Friendly staff, great location, and the rooms were really nice and large. My only downside was the t-mobile hotspot, I was drastically overcharged, and they acted like they were doing me a favor by rebating 1/2 of what I was overcharged (so I still had to pay double). My advice, use the wired internet in the hotel, as that is run by the hotel, not t-mobile

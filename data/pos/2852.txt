We stayed here when we came to see the musical "Mary Poppins" at the Paramount Theatre. The location was very convenient - only a couple blocks away and several restaurants to choose from located between the hotel and theatre. We spent such little time in our hotel room or the hotel - I can't even comment on the tv or other amenities of the hotel. Hotel and hotel room was clean. The beds were comfortable. The price for parking was steep - but I understand that is the going rate for Seattle downtown hotels. When we returned to our hotel room at 11:30 to go to bed - one of the rooms was quite loud and keeping us up. I phoned the front desk and they promptly took care of it. As I could here the staff talking to the guests I must add they handled it in a most professional manner. Check-in for us was smooth and quick. BUt I did notice a line had formed behind me when I was done checkin in and there was only 1 staff member doing "regular" check-ins - so those guest may have had to wait. No wait at check-out as I had no reason to visit the front desk at check out.

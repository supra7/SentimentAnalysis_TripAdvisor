Our favorite in downtown Seattle. We stayed overnight the Friday before President's Day. Great package with tickets to the Seattle Art Museum's Gaugin exhibit and valet parking. Location is the best. We could walk to SAM, Pike Place Market, the 5th Avenue Theater to see Oklahoma. Oliver's is a beautiful historic bar. Never had the same type of room twice, but have always felt pampered. Staff is friendly and very helpful.

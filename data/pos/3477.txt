My wife and I have traveled all over the world, but never have we been so pleasantly surprised by what was waiting for us when we checked into the Hotel Andra! Completely RETRO furnished rooms with warm and inviting colors. Very comfortable bed. No road/city noise. Handwritten note from management. Best italian Reataurant we have been to in years right next door. Had a perfectly prepared breakfast in the Hotel's restaurant called Lola's. There right, whatever Lola wants - Lola gets and that was a big tip for a well trained and friendly staff to go with the fresh high quality meal. Did I say the the room cost was very modest?

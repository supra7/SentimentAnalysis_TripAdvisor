I stay at Hotel Andra whenever I get down to Seattle. I love this hotel because it is a small boutique hotel and the location is amazingly close to everything. The staff are friendly and I even got a personal note from the manager welcoming me back to the hotel which I thought was a very nice touch. I've eaten at all the Tom Douglas restaurants and all of them are exceptional. The only complaint is that on my most recent trip we stayed in a suite and it was extremely noisy and I could not sleep due to hearing the crosswalk chirp all night. I didn't complain as we only stayed one night this time but next time will make sure I don't get a room close to the road. I would not recommend a corner room close to the crosswalk unless noise does not bother you.

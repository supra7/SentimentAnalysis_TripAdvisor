Great hotel. The rooms are really fun - not huge but certainly different and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom but we never had to queue for one of them, even in the mornings - in fact, we could take our pick and they are palatious and clean. Don't worry about the noise either - our room was literally right over the Cyclops bar and if you have the window open it's noisy but as soon as you shut the window it's pretty quiet. Great location too - right in Belltown so loads of bars and restaurants nearby, 10 mins walk from the Space Needle and in the other direction, 10 minutes walk from downtown. Great value place to stay in Seattle, maybe not a place for the over 40s though.

We are locals who wanted to stay downtown after the Elton John concert (which was cancelled). We kept our hotel plans and we were very glad we did. The hotel is stylish and in a great location. It is central to great Belltown restaurants and boutiques and close to downtown shopping. The lobby was friendly and cozy with a fire place. You can go to Lola's bar and bring your drinks into the Andra lobby and sit by the fire. Our room was comfortable with nice amenities. The staff were very friendly too.

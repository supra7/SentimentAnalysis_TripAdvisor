My Fiancee and I started to plan our wedding and wanted to have it at a hotel, the only problem was we did not want to use standard Hilton, but wanted to find a place that had some charm and style, and on top of that a location that would handle all our wedding needs (planning, scheduling, etc..) we stopped by 3 different hotels in downtown seattle that were recommened by The Knot, two the hotels had the right charm but no customer service, plus they would not handle all our needs. That's when we met Andrew at The Mayflower Park hotel, the moment we met he was so open and friendly. He never said no to any of our question or request and the Hotel had the perfect 1920's style (done right). We decided this was the place to have our wedding, during the whole process Andrew was star, he always responded back to our question / issue ASAP, treated us as if we were his only clients, even though he had 3 other major events scheduled in July. Food was perfect, service was perfect we couldn't of asked for a better location or Hotel. If you are planning a wedding, please check out the Mayflower Park in Downtown Seattle, ask for Andrew and you will not be disappointed. Thanks again Andrew you made our wedding perfect, Becky told me she could not have dreamed of better wedding.

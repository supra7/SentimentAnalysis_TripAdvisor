Having read excellent reviews about this hotel, as well as heard it recommended by local friends, it was a no-brainer. Only slight more than other hotels nearby, it was still a steal at $175/night. When I told them that it was my husband's birthday weekend, they generously gave us a complimentary upgrade to a Townhouse (City View). The room was very nice (though I am not a fan of the two story townhouse layout), with something that we're already used to from home; a Tempurpedic bed (my husband was in heaven!) and soft, beautiful bedding and sheets. The bathroom left a little to be desired (I like nice bathrooms with large bathtubs and this was very cramped and small) but for a weekend, it was fine. I had requested a bottle of wine to wait for us as we arrived for his birthday, and they delivered and also left some delicious cupcakes and a birthday card. Very nice extra touch. The location could not be more perfect, right next to the Pike Market. Even though we had a City View (ask for the Ocean View if you can; it can't be beat!), we still had a partial view of the water and the market from the bay windows. Highly recommend this hotel, and will definitely stay here again!

Location is everything in the Westin Seattle. I've stayed at several Westin hotels and this might be the best one, although it could improve a little on some issues: concierge was always crowded so you got information very quickly (and not so kindly) and felt you had to move so the other guests in line could be attended. Internet access is OVERPRICED. When are hotels going to realize they have to stop charging for internet access? I'd definitely go to another hotel which offers this at no charge. Elevators are so old they look vintage (I liked this) but the sound they make is horrifying. Great bathroom but water pressure was not up to the Westin standards. I booked a deluxe city view and it was worth it. We had a problem with room asignment but staff was quick and helpful (although not very kind) and changed us to another room. So close to great restaurants, shopping and the best spots in town. I'd stay again for sure.

We stayed here one night at the end of a cruise from Alaska to Vancouver. It was so much cheaper to fly from Seattle to NY than from Vancouver, we saved money by taking the bus down to Seattle. I was thrilled to get two double rooms on the 14th floor for $75 each. A short walk to the monorail and a short ride later, we were at the Space Needle. And we even got a blue sky (not sure William Shatner had anything to do with that). In our brief stay, everything about this Sheraton was top flight. If you have kids, monitor them carefully so that they don't dive into the typically overpriced basket of junk foods in each room. The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is the ridiculously priced Internet access at $15/night.

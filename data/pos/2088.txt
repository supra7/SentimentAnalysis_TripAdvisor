I love this hotel -- WILL DEFINITELY STAY AGAIN on my next trip to Seattle. Quite unpretentious, room is large, clean bathroom, clean everything. the friendliest staff on the planet, quiet, well-insulated rooms, loved the "clawfoot" bathtubs - very ornate and quite unique. Very reasonably priced. Only few minutes walk to Pikes Market and heart of Downtown, Ross Dress for Less and Macy's, greatest location for the price. I will definitely come back.

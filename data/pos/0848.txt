We recently spent three days in Seattle and chose The Inn at The Market because of it's location and because it was offering a Picasso ticket and room package for the traveling exhibition. We were a short walk from the Settle Art Museum, lots of shopping, and just steps away from Pike's Market. We reserved a room with a "partial view" and very much enjoyed being able to see the water and all the ferry and freight activity. The room was enormous with a desk and chair, (free Internet access), and an additional table with two comfortable reading chairs. There were three sets of windows providing plenty of light and both water and city views. Service at the hotel was top notch with employees at the desk, bellmen, and room service personnel being both friendly and helpful. We ate twice at Cafe Campagne, one of two restaurants associated with the hotel, and the food and service were both outstanding. I would recommend this hotel to travelers who want to enjoy leisure time in a lovely room as well as walk around and explore a busy and lively area of Seattle. i The only slight drawback is a bit of traffic noise at night, but it wasn't enough to keep us from enjoying a good night's rest.

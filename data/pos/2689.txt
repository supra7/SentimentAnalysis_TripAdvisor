Bang in the center of Seattle Downtown. Great location, walking distance to the Duck tours, Pike Market and other attractions. Access to shopping - Pacific Place, restaurants including a great steak house within the Sheraton (name has slipped out of my mind). The bell captains are polite, the conceirge extremely helpful, and everything was smooth and systematically handled. Wonderful hospitality. Will recommend this place for stay, and definitely will be back myself!!

We were attending Teatro ZinZanni in Seattle, to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary, and looking for a nice hotel downtown to make the most of our visit. The Monaco offered a really great price to theater guests, so we gave it a try. Starting right at curbside, with the charming and helpful valets, we knew we made the right choice. The lobby was magical, with its holiday decor, and the desk clerks were professional yet casual at the same time (really?) We felt special when we used the room key-card to reach our "secure" floor in the elevator, and imagine our surprise to find his and hers jungle print bathrobes (which we immediately donned, snapped photos, and texted them to our grandchildren) and a goldfish we named BART to keep us company. The bed was comfortable, room clean and nicely decorated, everything we had hoped for, but it was "the little things" that made it a perfect fit for us.

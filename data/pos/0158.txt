Our 25th anniversary fell on the date of a meeting I couldn't miss - so my husband came with me. I'd just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Salt Lake and loved it, so I changed my reservation to try out the Seattle location. We had a wonderful time. The staff was amazingly helpful from the minute we drove up. The bellman helped us with all of my workshop materials - and then filled our ice bucket. The window seat was actually a comfortable place to sit and relax while enjoying the champagne and fruit tray they'd left for us. The location is close to everything - we parked the car and walked everywhere. Breakfast in the restaurant was quick, healthy, and good. The wine reception each evening is yummy. Join the rewards club and internet is free, and you get a coupon for the mini bar. The overall ambiance of the hotel is warm and comfortable. It's a place to linger and relax. Between the ambiance and the location, I'll be back.

You will feel welcome and at home from the moment you arrive. Centrally located--4 blocks from Pike Street Market, and most of Seattle's best restaurants within a five minute walk. Helpful and friendly staff are attentive to your needs and wants(including a Sunday New York Times). This little gem is one of my favorite hotels on Planet Earth, with experience in more than 100 countries.

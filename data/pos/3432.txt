We decided to book this hotel for the 3 nights prior to a cruise leaving from Seattle. I made the reservation based primarily on other Trip Advisor recommendations, and we were not disappointed! The hotel was easy to find and walking distance from the train we took from the airport. The staff was professional, and our room was much more spacious than we expected with a large comfortable bed and sofa. The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring Pike Place Market and the waterfront. We especially liked the restaurant and several good spots for drinks and appetizers nearby. There is also shopping nearby, including a conveniently located Bed Bath & Beyond in case one has forgotten any vacation toiletries. The hotel was a very short taxi ride to the port/cruise terminal. All in all, we were not disappointed, but rather very pleased with the value and comfort this hotel provided.

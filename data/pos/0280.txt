It had been several years since we stayed in Seattle. I knew we wanted to be in the downtown area- so I looked up DT hotels on line. Hotel Monaco was a four star hotel that came up along with several others-a bit out of our price range, but in looking at their web-site- they offered a better rate for two days. It was perfect for us. The hotel was beautiful- the staff were very courteous and most helpful. They had great suggestions for resturants and places to visit. The rooms were spacious and super clean. Great showers. We will definitely be back!

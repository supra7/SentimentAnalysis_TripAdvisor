My family and I stayed here on the first night of our vacation. The hotel is fantastic! The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable, the room had a fantastic view and good sized. Would stay here again for sure! The only down side seems to be that the walls are rather thin, you can here regular conversations going on in the other rooms. Overall, its a fabulous property in a perfect location. Plenty of places to eat in the neighborhood to ease the burden of hotel food prices, close-by public transportation, easy walking distance to most Seattle attractions.

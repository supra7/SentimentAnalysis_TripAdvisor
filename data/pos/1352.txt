There were three of us traveling so we tried to book suites at in every city. We were having trouble finding a decently priced suite until we found the Crowne Plaza. The suite itself was a decent size with great views of the city. The king size bed and all the sleeping amenities made for a great sleep. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The hotel is a very short walk from the city centre and a few seconds from strips of great shops. The location is great for walking downtown and getting out of the city and back to the airport. The best part of this stay was that we were charged $40 US less a night than we had booked online! I would recommend this hotel.

We stayed here for two nights while in town for a Seattle Sounders game. We were traveling with our two boys, ages 7 and 4. They LOVED our "pet" goldfish, Pink. The evening wine/soft drinks/appetizer reception was a nice touch. We booked the AAA "50% off Parking Package" which made this a decent value. I signed up for the Kimpton program as advised by other Tripadvisor members and received free in-room WiFi and a $10 mini bar voucher. The kids are already asking when we can schedule a return visit to see "Pink"!

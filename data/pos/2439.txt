I loved this hotel. It was convenient to Seattle attractions like Pike Place Market, the library, wine bars, and the Seattle Art Museum. The rooms are very clean (albeit somewhat small), but the updated furnishings and warm, inviting undertone of the decor made for a very pleasant stay. The hotel staff was very courteous in accommodating all of my requests. We had dinner at sunset at the hotel restaurant on the top floor.. it was gorgeous and I highly recommend it if you stay there. The rooms are very well insulated, so I slept like a baby.

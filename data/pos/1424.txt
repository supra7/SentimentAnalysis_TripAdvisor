I stayed at this hotel for nine nights while visiting Seattle on holiday. I will admit that it is an old building, but that adds to its charm. All the staff were friendly and helpful and they do a complimentary shuttle service within 3 miles of the hotel - this was a great help as i don't drive and it was not a problem for the drriver to take me to the zoo or pioneer square. The shuttle will not go to the airport, but ask when making reservations and the hotel will organise a town car to collect you from seatac. It was no problem either for them to organise the car to take me back to airport either. My room had a kitchen area, bathroom and a walk in closet (which was bigger than the kitchen - i wanted to take it home!). There are no kettles in the room, but they do provide free coffee and juice in the lobby. Iron and hairdryer you need to request from reception. Beware of the water pressure when showering - it can go from very fast to very slow in seconds - so be quick! The hotel does not have an elevator, which was okay for me as i was on the ground floor. There is a lovely courtyard outside where it is lovely to have breakfast or enjoy complimentary wine. Overall the hotel isn't perfect, but it is comfortable and very close to Space needle and the monorail. There is a 24 hr supermrket and pharmacy accross the street and a great Irish bar round the corner - Chicken sandwich to die for!

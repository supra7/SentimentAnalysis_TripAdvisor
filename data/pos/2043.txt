The Moore Hotel isn't for everybody- if you want anything fancy, stay somewhere else, but if you want a unique, historic hotel, it's great. I've stayed here on several different occasions, and have been pleased. Don't be put off by the sometimes cluttered lobby. The rooms are all different (and in varying stages of remodeling), but all are clean and spacious. The price is right. Request a room with a view of the bay. On the downside, the walls are thin and there is no air conditioning, but even on a hot day, the rooms cool off by evening with the windows open.

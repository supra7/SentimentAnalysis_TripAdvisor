Stayed here on a business trip to Seattle where I had to keep nightly rates at or below $200. A colleague whose taste in hotels is a little richer than mine recommended the place, and I was surprised it was within my allowed budget. The hotel is very nice. Solid, masculine, yet very plush feeling. Sort of Pacific Northwestern-meets-Scandi-chic. My room was incredibly spacious, with a desk, wet bar, couch, and large bathroom. Staff was friendly, fast, courteous. Helped me find directions to where I needed to go. Offered an umbrella for the night when it started to rain. No negatives here. I would give it five stars, but I think I'd have to reserve that for a truly world-class bank-breaking hotel.

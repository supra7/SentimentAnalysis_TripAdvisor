Memorial day was our first time bringing the kids with us to the Westin. My husband and I've stayed here at least once a year for the past few years but usually stay at the Sheraton when we travel with our kids. Our stay at the Westin with the kids was GREAT! We were upgraded to a wonderful room on the 38th floor, lots of space and the kids thought it was amazing to be so high up and great views! They REALLY Loved the pool and the sun even came out the day we were there so mom & dad got to sit outside while the kids swam. Valet & Front Desk were all very friendly and helpful which is always nice when traveling with small kids. We also enjoyed dinner at the Coldwater Bar & Grill, food is pricey but we had the Entertainment book so we enjoyed both specials of the night, Halibut for myself and Rib-eye for my husband. My favorite part of this hotel has been the ability to rely on the comfort of the beds and bedding, WONDERFULLY soft and always get a great night sleep. Thanks for another great stay! Hope to return soon. (only dislike is the cost of parking @ $39 before tips)

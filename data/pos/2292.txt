We stayed overnight to see the last seahawks game of the year.So was not sure what to expect. I must say i was presently surprised. The location was great..right close to both Pikes Market and Qwest and Safeco Fields. All three within walking distance. Sure the room was a bit on the small size,but i am not spending all my time in the room so the size was not an issue. The cost is reasonable and i guess it is you get what you pay for. The Bathroom was clean and the shower had good pressure and the water got hot right away. We had a king size bed in our room and it was very comfortable with a nice thick duvet. The TV is a nice size and flat screen which was nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were craving Chinese food so called down to the front desk and asked if there was any in delivery distance. The clerk not only let us know which ones but helped out by giving us menus as well. If you are looking for good location and good value and a comfy stay i would recommend this place. I am going to stay again the next time i am in Seattle.

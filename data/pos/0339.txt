My wife and I booked a last minute get away to Seattle. We got a great price on Priceline most likely due to the time of year and the flooding they have been experiencing west of the Cascades. But what a great weekend and great hotel. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and all of the staff were extremely helpful. They also offered wine tasting Saturday night and had Starbuck's coffee available Sunday morning in the hotel lobby. The location was perfect - within walking distance to all that we had planned for our short stay. Our only complaints were the overpriced valet parking - $40/day, and no pool or jacuzzi. But overall, we had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed the hotel.

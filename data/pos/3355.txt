The perfect boutique hotel for a romantic get-away! We had a great room with a peek-a-boo view of the Sound to sit and enjoy the sites of downtown Seattle at Christmastime. Loved the accommodations - very upscale yet comfortable as well. The Hotel Andra has a very friendly staff - from reservations to check-in to valet.

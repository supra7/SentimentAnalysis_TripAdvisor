Was here for a Conference which was also held at this property. Check in was quick, staff friendly. The hotel was going through some construction, so they were at a temporary front desk, not very astatically pleasing, but clean. Elevators were a bit slow, i was on a high floor, took some time to get an elevator from the floor back down to the lobby. Room size was HUGE... i was very surprised, very comfy bed, clean room, some stains on the carpet but nothing major. Great view of the city, bathroom was small but nothing out of the ordinary for hotels. Pool was on the very top floor, which you could smell as soon as you got off of the elevator. You could tell it was an older pool, looked like it needed some cleaning, but it was still nice. The hot tub was warm but the bubbles only worked once during my 4 night stay. Great views from the pool deck! Hotel was in a great location. Walking distance to pretty much anything. I walked to a Mariner's game, only took about 20-25 mins. Tons of shops and restaurants all around the hotel. I would def stay here again if i were to return to Seattle.

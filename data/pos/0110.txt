The many, many extra touches and great staff made our stay in Seattle really memorable. We loved the goldfish and leopard bathrobes! The decor was charming and the room extremely comfortable and clean. We left our baggage with the bellman before check-in and after check-out and were pleased that the staff knew this both times without being asked. Very personal. it was my husband's 50th birthday while we were there and he received champagne and chocolates. The location is perfect for walking around downtown. The food in the restaurant was delicious, and again service was excellent. I completed the survey after our stay and they actually responded! They care . . . and it shows in every detail.

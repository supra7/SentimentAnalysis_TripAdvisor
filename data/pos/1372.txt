This is our 2nd or 3rd time staying at the Inn and is still one of the best values if you are going to an event at the Arena. It is a quick 2+ block walk to the Arena, and very close to a number of varied restaurants/bars. What made it less than we remembered is that now they no longer offer the complementary wine on Friday/Saturday nights which was always a great event. It is also a walk-up building which makes it a work out if you are on the 3rd floor. Parking is $15 additional, which is still way cheaper than the garage and most lots in the area when there is an event. However, there are only about 11-12 spaces available so you have to check in early enough to claim one. It will still be our choice of place when we are going to the Arena but probably has less amenities than other larger hotels on the other side of the Center.

We stayed here for one night during the week of Labor Day this year. We arrived pretty late as we drove up the coast from Lincoln City, OR that day. Upon arriving, I was impressed with the staff. The front doormen held the door open and greeted us with friendly smiles. The front desk clerk was also very friendly and greeted us with a smile. After getting checked in, we headed to the elevators. I noticed right off the bat that the elevators were very old, but although they were a tad bit rickety, they still functioned. The hallways could use new carpet and decorations, but they didn't smell bad. The room was very nice with a plush king sized bed that made for a good night's sleep. The room also had nightstands, a desk, and television. The bathroom was very nice as well. My only complaint with the room was that it was very small with very little room around the bed, and the bathroom was cramped. Nice room with very little space. As for the location, this hotel is located in the heart of downtown right next to the interestingly structured library. It is situated in the free transportation district of town and is minutes away from Pioneer Square and Pikes Market. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, and I will definitely look it up the next time I am in town.

I would certainly go back to this hotel. All things considered, the hotel is adequate too nice. We only stayed one night, and spent most of our time out and about. We did not eat at the hotel at all. You have an entire city at your doorstep. Pros: - Downtown, walking distance from almost everything worth seeing downtown. - Affordable, I didn't think the price was unreasonable. - $140 for one night including parking for almost 2 days - Nice little bar on top floor for late night cocktails. - Staff are human, meaning honestly friendly without being fake. - Excellent king size bed. - Perfectly clean, everywhere. - Nice TV, with enough free channels to just chill out for a while. - We called for toothpaste, and they were there in less than a minute. - Check-in/out in less than 5 minutes, even with airline pilots arriving and going all the time. - Don't expect a new 5 star hotel. This is more like a slightly older, but very well decorated and managed 4 star. Cons: - The room air-con kept me awake until I finally decided to just turn it off. - Flushing next door can be heard clearly at night, since the walls are not concrete. - If you want to be fussy, you could complain about being close to the highway, with some rooms not having much of a view, and some noise. For us, it wasn't all that big of an issue. The air-con was noisier anyway.

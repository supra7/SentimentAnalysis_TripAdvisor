My first reaction, to the hallway, was apprehensive. However all my concerns were dispelled upon entering the room. It was lovely, well appointed, and clean as a whistle. The staff is very helpful and the interaction is like old buddies rather than staff. Use of a computer in a quiet room off the lobby was a further bonus, and the restaurant was outstanding. All considered, that will be the place for me any time I'm in Seattle.

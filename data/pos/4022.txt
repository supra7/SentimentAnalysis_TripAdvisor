My husband and I chose to spend our anniversary at The Sorrento Hotel in December. His company had arranged for dinner in the Hunt Club restaurant at the hotel so he thought it would be lovely to spend the night at the hotel. We had stayed there two years prior and remembered it as having a warm and lovely ambiance. Our room was comfortable and well-designed. We were greeted with a small bottle of wine, salted chocolate caramels (yummy) and a lovely note congratulating us on our anniversary. The coffee was delicious - prepared with a coffee press with detailed instructions provided. Only two "flies in the ointment": the room was too warm and I could not find a way to turn down the heat (in the middle of the night and not thinking clearly to phone the front desk). Also my husband had booked the room one month ahead and we found out later that other members of our party who stayed the night as well, paid less for their package and were upgraded upon arrival. The hotel's response to this was to say that we got what we paid for and that it is their discretion to chose to upgrade upon arrival. My husband had also requested a corner room (we didn't get one), but another member of our party received one and they arrived after us and had not requested one. Hard to understand how hotels work. However, I would return for another visit.

We stayed here for one night preceding our 15-day cruise from Seattle the next day. We arrived from the UK after a 10-hour flight so we were jetlagged and unable to sleep, but the reception staff checked us in very quickly and efficiently and our room, on the 15th floor, had great downtown views of the Seattle city and harbour. The room was very quiet and pleasant and we appreciated the cafetiere which allowed us to make fresh, filtered coffee the next morning. The bathroom was immaculately clean and there was a good selection of toiletries (including conditioner; hardly any places give you conditioner!) The lounge bar had a nice ambience and was quiet and relaxing, with very comfortable settees and chairs. We enjoyed a chilled wine or two whilst trying to staying awake as long as possible! We did not have to check out until midday which meant we had a chance to look around the city before leaving for the pier. A nice place to stay and I would definitely come again if I get the chance.

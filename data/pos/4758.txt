About two weeks ago I wrote a review titled SOME GOOD, SOME BAD. When I was checking out, I had a long conversation with the manager about the concerns I mentioned in the review. The manager was very receptive to my concerns and I feel that she took them seriously. I believe that she will be acting on some/all of the things we talked about. As I was checking out, I was pleased to find out that there was no charge for printing my boarding pass. Also, I wanted to highlight the fact that -- throughout our stay -- the manager and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly!

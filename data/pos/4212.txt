Rarely have I stayed at a Westin that disappointed. The Westin Seattle is no exception. The rooms are clean and well appointed. Things work. The bathrooms are nice. But, like some of the dates you've had that are nice but don't rev your engine, so too is this hotel. Everything is tourist/business class expensive. That is no surprise as I think that is probably Westin's bread and butter clientele. Parking is very difficult in Seattle and very expensive. This is the left coast and they hate cars. Parking at the Westin is easy and, alas, very expensive, so be sure to get a quote on that additional cost when you price the rooms. The restaurants can have very, very slow service but no matter, there are a plethora of restaurants immediately nearby ranging from truly gourmet dining to twenty-something night clubs to you name it. No reason to have to eat at the Westin if you don't want to. Your just a few blocks from Pike Place Market (it's Pike folks, not Pike's :) ), the downtown Monorail station (takes you to the Space Needle), and ditto for the heart of the city's financial and municipal buildings. And, lest I forget, it's less than a block to shopping including Nordstrom's and Macy's. So, for a great location and no disappointments, the Westin Seattle is a good bet.

My husband and I were wowed from the moment we stepped into the lobby. The check-in was seamless and fast. Our room was average in size, fun colors and decor, Aveda products in the bath, cozy robes, Starbucks coffee and even a large umbrella for those rainy Seattle days. The street noise was a bit much for us because we like to sleep in, but the staff delivered a free fan which took care of the problem. Dining, drinking and Pike's were all within walking distance (in good weather) or a $5 cab ride in not so great weather. There is a bloody mary bar on Saturday and Sunday morning. The barstaff in Sazarac made excellent and creative cocktails and were friendly beyond what would normally be expected. The same can be said for the entire staff of the hotel throughout our stay. Hotel Monaco will be our choice anytime we are lucky enough to be back in Seattle.

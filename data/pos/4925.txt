I have stayed at several other Kimptons, but this was the first time in Seattle. Lovely hotel and great, friendly service. They do have a few quirks, though. On the positive side, beautiful decor and comfy room and I raved about the Tulio restaurant, where I enjoyed one dinner and two breakfasts, with excellent food and attentive service, especially from the manager, Doug. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the peculiarity of only having morning coffee available in the lobby. It is good coffee, but these days, even the average motel provides good coffee in the room. The bathrroom is rather small. Since I use a breathing machine ( CPAP ) the first thing I check out is electrical outlets near the bed. This was one of those cases where the outlet was behind the mattress, and it involved some rearraging of plugs. Otherwise, even with the extension cord that I carry, it would not have reached other outlets in the room.

From the outside this hotel doesn't look like much, but everything inside was almost perfect. My GF and I were travelling with our two Chihuahuas and were reluctant to leave them in the room alone for a few hours. As it turned out, they were pretty well behaved, and didn't cause any problems. All the staff were very polite, considerate and understanding. The room we were in faced Wall St, so it was a little noisy at times. This didn't bother us much, but it may bother others as there is no A/C so you pretty well have to leave the windows open on a warm day. They do have a small fan to help with that as well. Rooms and (shared) bathrooms were very clean. As far as the location goes, it was very central. About a 6 min walk to the Space needle, and about 10 min walk to Pike Marketplace. Also, a lot of great restaurants and shops in the area too. The breakfast Ace provides was awesome! You can make your own waffles, or if you prefer, there is yogurt and granola, milk and OJ, and coffee. Overall, I'd rate this hotel a 5/5.

This hotel has it all. Great location and amenities. In Seattle over Thanksgiving and enjoyed warm hospitality in their spacious lobby, complimentary mulled drinks and comfortable ambiance. Rooms were very clean, modern, and quiet. Easy access to light rail transportation 1 block from hotel and walking distance to shopping and Pike St. Market., We would definitely stay again.

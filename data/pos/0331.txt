From the valet parking guy to the lady who checked us out when we departed, all were friendly, personable and professional. Our room on the ninth floor was large, comfortable, nice and quiet, but a bit dark. Internet service was provided . The bathroom was large, clean and comfortable to use. The hotel is about a five minute walk to SAM and maybe a ten minute walk to Pikes Market. There are lots of great restaurants just a short walk from the hotel as well. I would absolutely consider staying here again.

We have stayed in this Hotel twice now. It is in a fantastic location within walking distance to Pike Market, city shopping, Space Needle and more. The room is well appointed, quiet and clean. The bathroom is generous and good water pressure which is always a good point. The only part that let us down was the staff at the front desk. They just didn't have the service that other Hotels had. It was all business - no warm welcome or conversation. There was no warmth in their welcome or help. The bar and restuarant staff were completely different. They would stay and chat and ask questions about where we were from, and give advice on what to see and seemed genuinely interested in our holiday adventures. Even the Manager came and spoke with us and made us feel like old friends. We would stay here again - just hope that the check in staff and doorman get some personality and warmth.

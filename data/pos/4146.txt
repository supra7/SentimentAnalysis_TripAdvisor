My fiance and I stayed at the Sorrento during a weekend away - and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Upon arriving and checking in, we were immediately ushered into the elevator (which is small) and shown to our room. The room, although a little small, was absolutely beautiful and had heavenly scent of jasmine. The bellhop asked if we would like to make reservations anywhere in town for dinner that night, and since we didn't know where to go, gave us a few recommendations and let us alone to decide. We called the concierge who gave us great tips and recommendations. Our entire trip we found the hotel staff and concierge beyond helpful as far as making recommendations for dinner, bars, and clubs. Even though we had a car, we used the towncar service frequently everyday - and never had to wait more than about 15 minutes for it to arrive (although I recommend reserving it in advance if you know you will be leaving at a certain time). The beds were absolutely heaven and our entire stay was very enjoyable. We found the restaurant attached to the hotel to be a little pricey for what was provided, but immensely enjoyed sitting in the lounge of the hotel sipping some drinks and listening to the beautiful jazz singer they had for the night. I would not hesitate to return to the Sorrento! It was wonderful!

We had booked two nights in this hotel through Venere. When we arrived, the reception staff couldn't find our name, Venere hadn't booked us a room. Fortunately we had printed the confirmation and no money had been taken. The staff has been extremely helpful, they gave us a room (which I thought wouldn't be possible as it was the w-e of July 4th and that they had told other people that they were full!!) for the same price as offered on the internet. Looking at the pictures and the previous reviews, it seems we had a pretty big room (two double beds). Everything was really clean, of course it was a bit noisy as we overlooked the freeway but it was not the noisiest hotel we stayed at during our stay in the US. The swimming pool was clean and the water was a nice temperature. The breakfast was excellent with waffle makers, bagels, muffins... It is a walking distance to the Space Needle (a must see attraction) and a 15 min walk to downtown. The only negative point was that the internet connection on the computer of the lobby was really really expensive!! We stayed in cheaper hotels with free internet in the lobby!! But we would definitely stay in this hotel again as the staff was so nice and helpfull!!

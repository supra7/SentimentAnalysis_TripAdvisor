I was here for a conference in July, the best month to be in Seattle. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's in the downtown area surrounded by a lot of upscale stores (J. Crew, Anthropologie, Nordstrom's and Macy's amonth others) and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops (there's a Starbucks every other block). I am not a Sheraton fan but the hotel had a few major positives: 1) THE CONCIERGE: the 3 women who work the concierge desk deserve a raise. They are friendly, competent and available at all times. They booked dinner for us, a cruise of the Puget Sound and a lunch and all worked out perfectly. 2) The beds and linens were very comfortable. 3) You can enter the business center with your room key to use the internet. Most hotels charge for this but their service is free. A few negatives: 1) Housekeeping could do a better job. The room was cleaned, but not well. And a coworker staying with me had to call twice to have someone even come do her room. 2) The food at the Daily Grill was average and overpriced (but hey--you have a thousand restaurants to choose from nearby and we just grabbed a scone at Starbucks after not enjoying the first breakfast!). 3) Most of the employees seem to be going through the motions. Aside from the fabulous concierge, I sensed an apathy among the staff there............as if "this is just a job" was the thing going through their minds as they helped us. I got this feeling with the bellhops, the front desk people, the waiters at the Daily Grill. It is not that they seem unhappy, but their smiles came across as false. But overall it's a comfortable, convenient place to stay and I would come back.

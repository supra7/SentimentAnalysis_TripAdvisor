We stayed for some days, and came back on the last day despite plans to go to an airport hotel. I had been there before on a business trip, but somehow this time, it was even better. The breakfast was incredible. The comfort of our room was great for the price. The view of the needle was great. The staff was helpful. We could use the internet facility without problems. If we had a problem, the staff came up with a solution - a nearby jazz club, a good shop to buy x or y... Helpful and knowledgable concierge and reception staff. We enjoyed the gym and the pool. We were particularly impressed with the way in which our larger group - a party of family and friends - were accommodated, even when there were changes of plan. Transport with a bus or the tram to the airport was simple. Nice shops close by. If I could suggest one improvement, I would say the shower is a bit tricky to figure out... but that was all.

We booked our stay directly with the Inn at the Market, and mentioned that we were looking forward to celebrating my birthday weekend with them. Not only did they provide cupcakes in the room--they had upgraded us as well. The bed was quite possibly the most comfortable matress we have ever experienced. We ordered room service, which was both reasonably priced and of high quality. The decor was stylish and it was impeccably clean. The staff was attentive to every possible need--even accomodating our request for a late check-out, and then allowed us to stow our bags for several hours while we walked around the city in the afternoon. So, even after they had our money--they still treated us as honored guests. In short, it was beautiful, the staff was kind, and we would recommend this place to everyone.

The Moore Hotel exceeded our expectations . It is located in 2nd Avenue, great location close to Pike Place Market and also close to a lot of good restaurants and bars. The room was huge and very clean, and the price was really good for a downtown hotel. The staff was really nice and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay there.

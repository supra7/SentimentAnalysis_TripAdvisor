Don't get me wrong, the Renaissance (a Marriott Hotel) is classy, amply staffed and rich in amenities. The location is excellent if you plan on visiting the court house or the former Bank of America Tower. If not, you might be better off few blocks North of here. It's worth paying the minimal fee to upgrade to club level, the free breakfast you get in return is stellar. Having a pool on the top level is pretty cool (there are even adjacent restrooms with showers, which is nice). The pool, however ,literally had algae growing in the southwest corner during my stay and the pool deck was always dangerously slick. The club level offers excellent resources for tourists and a concierge is present to assist with planning outings, scoring event tickets, etc. In room decor is pretty typical, elegant but not particularly innovative or worthy of mention.

Hotel Andra was fantastic and one of the best hotels I have stayed at for a very long time. The staff was great, having Lola in the lobby was terrific and I enjoyed all the small details, like quiet ice machines in the hallways! I will make Hotel Andra my home away from home when in Seattle from now on.

The two bedroom suite was very comfortable with a large living room, dinning room table, bar (with sink) and extra bathroom. The walls were decorated with nice art and the furnishings seemed modern and new. Our large party was very comfortable and the hotel was able to reserve all the regular rooms adjoining the suite for us. Great views and we appreciated the relatively affordable price. Perfect for a family traveling together. The hotel does not have an executive lounge but elite members are welcomed to a buffet style breakfast and h'orderves served in the penthouse restaurant area. The space is a bit awkward because it is a bar with adjoining conference room. The set up can be compared to a conference buffet in a hotel banquet space. But you are graced with awesome views of Seattle. While none of us used the gym it had very good equipment. Same as the Beverly Hilton.

We were only spending the night in Seattle before boarding our ship for an Alaskan cruise. The Inn at the Market was the perfect place to spend that time. A  block from the famous Pike Place Market, this hotel gave us the opportunity to explore the Market, Starbucks first coffee house and numerous other quaint shops and restaurants at our leisure. The view from the deck was picturesque from the Washington Ferries, beautiful sunset, Mt. Rainier and the morning view of our awaiting cruise ship.

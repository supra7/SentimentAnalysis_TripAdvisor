This hotel is well worth the extra cost. Great location and great staff. This hotel really lives up to the Westin name. The only down side - the cost of parking (which is pretty standard in Seattle) - however, there is a garage next door that connects to the hotel and is about 1/2 the cost. Worth the extra 2 mins of driving/walking. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!

We have stayed at this hotel many times and have never been disappointed. Indeed it is our default hotel for Seattle. The location is convenient for many things. For shopping it is right across the road from Macy's, adjacent to the Westlake Centre, and just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. Many good restaurants are nearby: our favourite splurge restaurants are the Dahlia Lounge and the Waterfront Seafood Grill (which is right on the water). It is also close to art galleries and the football and baseball stadiums. Less than 50 yards away there is a rail station serving the airport, and the Westlake Centre is the terminus for the Monorail, which runs to the Seattle Centre with its Rock and Roll Museum, Opera House, Space Needle and fairground. The hotel itself is an elegant old-timer which has been very tastefully restored, the lobby with with a more modern Japanese-style decor. The rooms have all been modernised with great beds and efficient plumbing. The high-ceilinged bar is one of our favourite features (be sure to try the Citronella cocktail, one of the best ever). The restaurant features high-end food that puts it near the top of the Seattle list of favourites. The breakfast are all great - try their excellent eggs benedict.The stafff has always been very friendly and accommodating. Overall, the hotel is a classy bargain, especially if you can get AAA or CAA rates.

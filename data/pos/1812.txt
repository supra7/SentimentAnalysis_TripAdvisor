I took my wife to Seattle for her bday and booked 2 nites in the Mayflower. Taking the Light Rail from SeaTac was a breeze, even if the train took 40 minutes; it drops you off on the same block as the hotel. The hotel is definitely well situated in the middle of all the action. The front desk personnel were very courteous and professional. We got a room on the 12th floor, right next to the elevator, which gave me pause -- I was concerned about noise, but decided not to object. To my chagrin, noise was a problem on the 2nd night, but not from the elevators, but from next-door guests. The hotel staff was thoughtful enough to send my wife a card and small box of chocolates for her bday which definitely brought a smile to her face. The room was clean and relatively small, as previously reported, and well appointed. We'd definitely stay here again.

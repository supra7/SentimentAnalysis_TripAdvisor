Booked through Priceline, paid less than half the best posted rate at the moment. We ended up with a room on the 44th floor, looking out over the city - fantastic and nice and quiet. The bed was amazing, something they call the "Westin Heavenly Bed." I would stay in the hotel again just because of the bed. The place is a bit older, had a tiny uncomfortable old iron bathtub, but no big deal. A 2 minute walk to Nordstrom's, 5 minutes to Macy's. 10-15 minutes to Pike Place Market. Service was excellent. My only complaint would be the usual complaints of 4*s - they gouge you on parking ($36 per day for valet) or $33 for self park. But if you are a bit organized, there is cheaper parking within a block nearby - research it a bit before you go. They also gouge on room service, and charge ridiculous fees for phone and internet. But if you pay so little via Priceline, it is no big deal.

Stayed at the Sheraton Seattle 2 nights pre-cruise to Alaska...most enjoyable. Great service from the front desk and concierge and wonderful pool / hottub facilities on the top floor. Great central location, easy walking distance to Pike Market and short cab ride to Seattle Centre. Non-smoking facility a definite plus. Although construction going on to add an additional tower to the complex, we were located on the far side and heard absolutely no noise on the 19th floor. Really comfortable beds.

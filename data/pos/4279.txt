The Westin was our hotel of chose for our first visit to Seattle. We only stayed two nights due to the fact we had a cruise scheduled out of the Port of Seattle, but I can tell you we really enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again. Overall it was clean, busy, stylish and about what you'd expect from a Westin. Everyone was friendly and we didn't have any problems with service. But what was really great was the location. We stayed on a high floor and had an amazing view of the city. We could also see both ports and were able to see our ship, The Oosterdam. The location also lent itself to touring the city, as we were able to walk from the hotel to Pike Place Market as well as The Pacific Science Center area. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby, a drugstore across the street, a movie theater around the corner and a coffee shop in the lobby.

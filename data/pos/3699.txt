With all the modern/chic boutique hotels popping up, I loved staying here where I truly felt like I was in a cabin or somewhere elegant but cozy and warm. I loved the decor, the bar and restaurant are fabulous (we had a very intimate booth). Business center is easily accessible near the guest floors, and service was great. Location is a pro but also a con - I personally LOVED having an ocean view and being right on the water, however it was a bit tougher to walk into the city center. Having said that, they do offer a free shuttle service to any part of the center you desire. They also schedule pick-ups. Tip: Grab a cocktail and sit near the large fireplace with a loved one and just.. relax.

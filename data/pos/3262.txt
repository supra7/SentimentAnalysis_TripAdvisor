One of the best places Ive stayed at. The staff was very very friendly. James Mann was very good to me. James the brother at the front desk was another friendly staff member that made me laugh alot. Kuddos for both of them. My home in Seattle away from home. Thank You once again James Mann. Greetings from Miami Beach..

My husband and I just returned from 5 days at the Inn at the Market. From the first moments of checking in when I was asked if I'd prefer a Seattle Times or a New York Times in the morning until the last moments of the bellman carefully packing my rental car, I enjoyed the supreme customer service of this lovely hotel. Our room was beautiful with a great view of the ferries crossing the Sound. Because we were literally only steps from the Pike Street Market, I visited daily, bought fresh flowers and fruit and did some great people watching.The Cafe Campagne associated with the hotel served the best French bistro food we have had anywhere. Steelhead Cafe across the street was also fine, as was Place Pigalle. And all these great restaurants were less than a 2 minute walk! The little patio at the entrance to the hotel contained two lovely shops where I did all my Mother's Day shopping in spite of great other shopping also walking distance away. And the bed? Divine. Room service? Fast and delicious. Overall ambiance? About the best US hotel we have found in many years..

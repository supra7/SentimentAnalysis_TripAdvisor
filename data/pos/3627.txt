for $240 (tax incl). Nice room, good shower with no tub, good Turkish towels, that can be a little rough. Pleasant staff that doesn't know too much, like no one knew how long it took to get to the opera house. We were there for the Wagner Ring cycle. Cabs almost impossible to get during rush hour, but very helpful doormen. Biggest asset: Lola's restaurant (through lobby), great bk, dinner, and late night snacks. Would probably return.....

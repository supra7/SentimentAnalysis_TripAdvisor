We spent 4 nights here in an upgraded partial water view room on the 40th floor. Positives first - location is great- easy walk to everywhere, nicely decorated rooms, wonderful service especially the concierge(++), clean safe rooms and very fast elevators. Down side - poor sound proofing to hall - can hear people talking and the "ding" of the elevator, maybe the heavenly bed does not suit us as none of us slept particularly well because the beds were quite soft (also as there were 3 of us we needed 2 beds and they do not have 2 queens only doubles or 1 king and a cot), long & slow line to check in at front desk and competent but not friendly staff, add on extra costs for everything including internet. This was our third stay and like all of the others it was good. Nothing memorable. The gym looked good - too bad we were too tired from all of our adventures to try it out.

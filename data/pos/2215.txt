This isn't the place to stay if you are looking for a luxury hotel. But, given the location and the price, this place rises to the top. We stayed here twice in a little over a week--the night we arrived in Seattle, and the night before we flew out. Both nights, we had rooms that were clean, comfortable, and quiet. I agree that the rooms and the bathrooms are small. However, they were spotless, which to me is more important. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We had read some of the negative reviews and decided that, if our first visit wasn't satisfactory, we would go somewhere else for our second night. Needless to say, we didn't find that to be necessary. Location is wonderful, and we will definitely consider this hotel again if we head back to Seattle.

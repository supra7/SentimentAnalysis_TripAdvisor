We stayed at the Sixth Avenue Inn on a recent family vacation. The hotel was a great value and walking distance to most of the attractions in downtown Seattle. We arrived at the hotel way before check in time, and the staff offered to keep our luggage for us since we had already returned our rental car. We had a huge room, with a kitchen area, a couch, queen bed and rollaway beds for the kids. We were very pleased with the room, considering most of the other hotels downtown were $100 more a night. We weren't looking for luxury, just an affordable, clean and convenient place to spend the night. The Sixth Avenue Inn was just the place for us.

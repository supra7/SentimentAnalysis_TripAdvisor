Our room was upgraded to the 31 floor so great views over the city and convenient location and you get the benefit of being able to use the lounge for snacks in the evening and a light breakfast. Rooms are standard hotel type but clean and comfortable , beds very comfortable, heater/aircon can be a bit noisy, large flat screen TV. Happy hour in the bar early evening is good value. The big problem is you are in downtown Seattle and car parking is very expensive hotel valet parking gets close to $40 per night. On a Saturday / Sunday night you can park for free on the street if you can find a space and some local car parks are cheaper if you are prepared to walk. Hotel is very convenient for downtown, and lot of choice locally to eat and drink. Just the normal mid range hotel problems of $10/ day Internet and expensive hotel phone if you use.

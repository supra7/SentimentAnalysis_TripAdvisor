I've stayed at this hotel a half dozen times, and am always satisfied. The hotel staff is prompt and friendly, and the hotel is in a central location in downtown Seattle - maybe six blocks away from Pike's market and a couple blocks from the main shopping area. Nice touches at the hotel include the new Going Green service that allows you to swap your daily maid service for either a $5 food credit or 500 Starwood points. The free umbrella check out service is also a bonus (and is a must for Seattle).

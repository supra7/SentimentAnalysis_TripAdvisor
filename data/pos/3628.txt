Stayed there for a week whilst attending the Seattle Opera's Ring cycle this year. Overall an excellent hotel though there were some minor irks that should not be in a relatively high priced "luxury" establishment. Front desk and door people were unfailingly welcoming. cheerful and helpful. I had checked out the parking rates before, so didn't bring my car to Seattle - thus no comments on the valet service. Daily paper - offerred choice of NY or Seattle Times - chose Seattle Times for local content and news. Received NY Times - every day! Six complaints (I was there 7 nights) but never did receive the right paper... Room was in good condition though housekeeping erratic. Bathroom small but adequate, but would look much better if the stained and worn tile floor was replaced. Food Smells - every now and then, usually late afternoon, but the A/C (noisy but very efficient) seemed to take care of it easily. Traffic noise - yes (I was on 3rd floor) but not particularly loud. Didn't bother me. Restaurant - did not try Lola's (but friends who did liked it). Assiago's next door very good. Bakery across the street (Dahlia) a great place for breakfast goodies. This hotel is certainly on my list for a great place to stay in Seattle.

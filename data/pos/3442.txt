I am a heavy traveler who takes 20+ trips per year, all for pleasure, none for business. I must say this was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the small touches like free newspapers, the under-cabinet nite-lite in the bathroom, comfy bathrobes, and the Tivoli alarm/radio were fantastic. Most luxury hotels provide upscale toiletries and a superb minibar, but the Andra seemed to go beyond this with extra comfy goosedown pillows and a really wonderful mattress! I slept like a baby! And the common areas like the lounge downstairs and the fireplace are really comfortable and make you want to come back to the hotel to hang out! Lola Restaurant is attached and Dahlia Lounge and Serious Pie (BEST brick oven pizza) are across the streeet, plus the reasonable parking next door make this place perfect! The price was also VERY reasonable, about 30% cheaper than comparable hotels nearby in the same district. Staff was extra friendly and helpful and gave us free wifi access. I am definitely recommending this hotel and my mother (who stayed with me) has already decided to come back on her next trip to Seattle.

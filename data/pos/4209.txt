We booked through Priceline at a very good rate, when we arrived we couldont find the parking the area so we just parked in the pick/up drop off lane. The people at the desk said no problem and had the valet run around to the front to get our car, the valet noticed I was running low on tire pressure and offered to fill it up, as he drove away he stopped and ran back to me and gave me my phone which I had left in the car which I thought was very nice. We were offered an upgrade to a higher room floor at no cost, and what a beatuiful view we had. The bed was very comfy and the room was nice. When we went out that evening, we asked the concierge for some tips on what to do and where to eat and they were very polite and knowledgable, they even offered my girlfriend an umbrella due to the rain. The hotel is very close to the shopping areas and a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The only negatives I had was the fact the gym didnt have a treadmill, I found this odd and also the parking seemed a little high (43/night). Overall we would gladly stay here again.

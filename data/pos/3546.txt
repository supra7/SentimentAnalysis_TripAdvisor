My Husband and I recently got married in Seattle. We are locals, so we know the Seattle scene pretty well. When we shopped around for a hotel for our out of town family and honeymoon night, Hotel Andra was our number one choice. Andra's atmosphere is very chic but exudes a very homey vibe. The beds were surprisingly very comfortable, which as everyone knows is a rare find! We had quite a few young children in our party and the hotel provided as many cribs as needed...which were also good wood quality, not the typical white pbc pipe looking ones you usually get at other hotels. Andra has a great restaurant attached to it called "Lola". We had Brunch there and it's one of the best restaurants in town, ask anyone! The night before the wedding my bachlorette party kicked off @ Lola, it's a wonderful cozy, low lit vibe, their cocktails are great! All the rooms have magnificent views of the city, especially the Monarch Suite! My Husband and I stayed in the Monarch our wedding night, and it was truly the icing on the cake for our wedding! From the jacuzzi, king bed, bathrooms, flat screen plasma tv, which are in most of the rooms in the hotel, to the long dinning room table where we held our brunch for the gift opening. The staff truly went above and behond to make our wedding go as smoothly as possible, we cannot thank them enough! We look forward to staying there again soon!

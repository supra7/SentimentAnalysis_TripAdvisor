Charming hotel. The standard rooms are very small, but pleasantly decorated and squeaky clean. Large lobby with comfortable seating. Go to Olivers for great drinks and the Andaluca Restaurant for a great meal. Best of all, located in a good neighborhood, easy walk to Pike Market, the waterfront, and across the street from the monorail that takes you to the Needle. The light-rail from the airport to Westlake Center is $2.75 pr person, the Mayflower is right next door.

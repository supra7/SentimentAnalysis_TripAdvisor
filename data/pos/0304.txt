Just prior to Christmas we spent two nights at the Hotel Monaco. The desk staff were friendly, the lobby always had something going on. Starbucks coffee in the morning; wine at happy hour and even Santa made an appearance late on the Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was excellent. We ate dinner on the Friday night and went back for dessert after theatre on the Saturday night. Our first time. We'll return. swas

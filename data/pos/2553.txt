We received excellent service at this location, and it is in a prime location. However, our tub did not hold water (a problem for a daughter who still takes bathes), the cordless phone was not charged or plugged in (plug hidden behind heavy headboard), and the chest of drawers were all off of the track with one being completely broken. These issues were called down to the front desk and they promptly (within 5 minutes) had maintenance in our room fixing the tub (it worked after the change) and the phone. Excellent service and attentiveness, but the building is definitely showing its age, and some of the extraneous trim work was shoddily done (crown moulding being mismeasured and miscut). I would recommend this Hilton to anyone visiting Seattle as it has a great staff and excellent location, even if some of the problems border on hilarious.

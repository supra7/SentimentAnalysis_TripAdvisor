The Hilton Seattle is located a block away from the Sheraton where all the action downtown begins - by action, I mean, shops and restaurants and everything else. This location puts its guests close enough to everything yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of a busy pedestrian area. Granted it is an older property, much older from the outside when compared to other hotels, such as the Sheraton but the rooms and the service provided is sufficient enough to make up for the age. Rooms have been renovated and while it is nothing too out of the ordinary, it is comfortable (albeit, the rooms, and especially the bathrooms are pretty small). Being another Hilton, one can come to expect reliability! The Downtown Airporter bus stops at this hotel (they only stop at a few select hotels) so that's another added bonus - there is no need to transfer to another bus to get to your hotel! All in all, a solid choice in Seattle.

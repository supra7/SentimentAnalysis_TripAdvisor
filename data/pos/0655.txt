Quiet, understated elegance, convenient location... Have been to Seattle several times, stayed in several places, but if you have limited time, and really want to treat yourself, this is your best choice... Location, location, location... The Pike Market is at your doorstep, the central district is a two block walk, the waterfront is at your doorstep, and a gorgeous deck provides a private outlook over the sound (feels like your own personal back yard-sadly, the clerk forgot to mention it to me when I checked in, but after a couple days, I asked "where is the rooftop looking place you featured in your ad' and was directed to it) ...A basket of apples awaits you at the front desk, spacious rooms, vey comfy beds, usual ipod docking alarm clock, extremely helpful concierge and staff, willing valets for parking... only drawbacks are a function of the small size and intimacy - no spa, no workout room, the business center is a small room with only two computers (may mean a short wait)... I had a city view room (ok), would ask for waterview, (so much more relaxing)...

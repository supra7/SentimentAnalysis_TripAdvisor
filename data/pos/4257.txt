This is a very nice hotel in a great location, right in downtown Seattle. Close to the monorail which you can take to the space needle, close to light transit and street cars. Walking distance to both Pike's Place market and pioneer square, many shopping and dining options close by. My wife and I had a spacious clean room with a perfect view of the space needle and the ocean. The staff is very helpfull and friendly. Used the concierge service for dinner recomendations and reservations and also for local info. Judy the concierge is great. We would stay at the Westin again on our next visit to Seattle.

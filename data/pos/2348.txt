My family and I booked this hotel through hotwire and received a great rate. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle and is walking distance to Pike's market, the aquarium and many other local tourist attractions. The room itself was nice and included a king size bed, flat screen tv and mini fridge. We were on the 19th floor on the highway side and the noise from the highway was present, but ignorable. Parking was $30/night and since our vehicle didn't fit in the self park, we received one night of valet parking at the self park rate. The desk staff and door men/valet were all very friendly and helpful. The costs of staying at a hotel like this add up: $30 for parking, $15 for internet + tips etc. If budgeting a stay, make sure to include these costs.

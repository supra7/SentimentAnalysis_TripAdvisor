My wife and I stayed at the Edgewater for two nights at the end of May and had a blissful experience there. To justify the cost and the location you do have to stay in a waterfront room - a room on the city side (as you can see from the photo, taken from the top of the Space Needle) really would not do a stay at the Edgewater justice. Being English and used to small hotel rooms we found our room just perfect with an amazing bathroom, beautifully comfortable bed, great terrace overlooking the ocean and cosy fireplace. The staff were all uniformly friendly and helpful and the hotel was also well placed for all of Seattle's best attractions. Complaints? Well just two really. The first was that I didn't realize the Beatles Suite existed until after we had left so missed the opportunity of having a look inside (had I known about it beforehand I might have been tempted to book it which I suspect might have proved an expensive option). The second complaint concerns the wretched bear, Mr E Edgewater. What a mean and dirty trick it was to leave the cute and cuddly Mr E propped up against our pillow. Needless to say we were not allowed to leave without him and at $35 he proved to be an expensive little chap! Still he seemed to quite enjoy the rest of our holiday and the flight back to the UK, and once he has finished his period in quarentine he will be able to join all his other furry English pals in our bedroom at home. If you want to avoid similar entrapment just avoid eye contact with him when you first enter your room at the Edgewater.

My husband and I have "getaways" in our own city. We stayed at the Monaco to celebrate our anniversary and spend some holiday time downtown.The staff was amazing. It was the perfect level of service. They were attentive without being overbearing, in a word, the service was excellent. Our room was very nice and they even left us a bottle of champaigne and some chocolates to help us celebrate! Very unexpected and a nice touch. We will definitely stay again at this hotel. We also had breakfast at the restaraunt and it was also very good.

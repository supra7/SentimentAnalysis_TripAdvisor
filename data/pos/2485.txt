I stayed here in March for one night and several more in April. The front desk and housekeeping were very responsive and friendly both times. The hotel is being renovated right now, however, which is a bit of a drag, so for my July Seattle trip, I'm staying elsewhere. The room was clean and comfortable; everything worked in the gym and it was clean. Pool/jacuzzi with FANTASTIC views of the city. My room had a lovely city view (ask for a cityside room as opposed to a freewayside room). In March, I'd had a severe allergic reaction to something at the Hotel Monaco and fled to the Renaissance in the middle of the night. They let me check in a 3 a.m. with no extra charge. (Hotel Monaco, by the way, did nothing to help me in my frenzied state, like, for example, get me a ride. I had to trudge up the hill with all my stuff in the dark.)

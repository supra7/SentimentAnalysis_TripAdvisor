We stayed at the Ace Hotel three nights (a Thursday through Sunday). For the price, the location is impossible to beat. We stayed in room 107, a corner room on the front with two windows. I only have two complaints about the room: it was noisy at night (the room was directly over a bar) and my husband's and my feet hung off the end of the bed. However, the room was otherwise quite comfortable, the atmosphere was modern and fun, breakfast was good (granola, yogurt, toast, coffee and juice), and as I said before, the location was fantastic. The shared bathrooms were clean and convenient. At this price, I would definitely stay at the Ace Hotel again.

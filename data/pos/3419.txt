This is a rather nice hotel with an excellent location. This is not an overwhelmingly large property but not small either. This hotel was easy to find, but parking in the front to wait for the valet is limited and you may have to circle around until someone pulls out. Overall the room was a nice size, but the bathroom was tiny. The shower was interesting in that it had no door or shower curtain on it but rather a long glass wall with an opening. The sleep quality was among the best for the pillows and mattress at a hotel. Being in a city, you'll here the occasional ambulance go by at night and a noisy vehicle every now and then, but for the most part things were quiet. The bar/restaurant downstairs in nice but you are only a short walk to other places to eat as well as a small grocery store and a movie theater. This hotel is in a great location being between the Space Needle and the Public Market which are both an easy 15-25 minute walk (the market being closer). I did walk with a friend to Pioneer Square but it is a good 45 minute walk at the least. This is OK to do once, but if you are really desiring that area you may want to look for a place closer to there. The staff here was pretty good and friendly. For value, this is a bit based on the area. For downtown Seattle I gave it a 4 for value based on what I recall similar hotels going for in the area. However, being from Las Vegas, I would say this was a hotel on par with the Mirage or Treasure Island for room quality but charged room rates like the Wynn. So I can't give it a five on value, since while it is nice, this isn't a five star resort!

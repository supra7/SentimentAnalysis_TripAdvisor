This place is well run and well maintained. The staff is excedingly friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine, nothing special, though the coffee was better than your average hotel coffee. Location is excellent, and close to two great restaurants -- Local360, and Nora or Zola or something like that. Also a very fine coffee shop/bakery right across the street. Rooms are small, clean and efficient. The shared baths are kept very clean, and the hotel provides nice fluffy robes for guests. Clientele is not all hip and beautiful -- we're in our 60s! Even if their website shows no vacancies, it's worth a phone call because they don't put all their rooms up online.

We were in Seattle after a wedding in Canada and did not know where to stay. Chose the Westin for its central location and we generally like the Westin style. Rooms were modern, ours must have recently been refurbished., and the view was amazing. We could watch the sun reflect off the Space Needle. The concierges were very knowledgable and exceedingly helpful. They made suggestions and happily made reservations. They helped make the vacation more enjoyable.

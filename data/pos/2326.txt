Save on rental car! The Radisson is a short walk from the baggage claim: just walk to the first light and cross the street! The sleep number beds were a nice option here. My husband and I were thinking of buying one, so it was nice to try it out. It is right next to 13 Coins Restaurant: 24 hours of great Italian dining, and very quiet. We felt that it was a great way to save on a rental car: we just walked to the hotel, and then rented the next day. Very fast check in and nice rooms.

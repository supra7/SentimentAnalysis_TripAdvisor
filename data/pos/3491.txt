Recently when attending a concert at Key Arena, my girlfriends and I stayed at Hotel Andra and we were very impressed! The staff at the hotel was great and the room was awesome. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very nicely decorated. We had drinks and dinner in Lola, a restaurant right at the hotel, which was great and the concert was a quick ride arranged by the hotel staff. It was a perfect weekend with friends and we will be back for sure!

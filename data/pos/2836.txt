I stayed 3 nights in this hotel, based on good reviews. It took about 40 minutes by Link LIght Rail from Seattle/Tacoma Airport to the nearest station (University Street Station). From there it took about 5-7 minutes to the hotel on foot. (It is just 3-4 blocks away, but be prepare for uphill) The lobby of the hotel is spacious and clean, there was a hotel staff in the lobby but he did not seem like helping any customers at all. Checking-in was smooth and I did not have any problem but the front desk staff was unfriendly. There wasn't any welcome atmosphere. The room was spacious, clean and I had a nice city view from the window. I liked the bed, it was very comfortable and I had nice sleeps at night. The bathroom though, I found lots of hairs on the floor and around bathtub, it was a little disgusting. Also there was only one electric socket I could use for my cell, and the socket was nearby TV cabinet (a few steps away from the bed), so I could only put my cell on the floor while charging. There should be some more sockets near working desk or side table. I went to ball games at Safeco Field, and it was about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. It was a nice walk to the stadium through historical Pioneer Square. Also it is possible to walk to Seattle Center where Space Needle locates (about 35-40 minutes), though you can also take mono rail from West Lake Station which is 5-7 minutes walk from the hotel. You can also easily walk to Pike Place Market and there are many stores and restaurants around the hotel though there are no convenience stores around the hotel. This is a very nice hotel with decent price and very good location, but there are some places for improvement, especially the front desk staff and other hotel staff in the lobby. I would stay again if there is more friendly and welcoming atmosphere in this hotel, but otherwise I would look for better service hotel with similar price when I visit Seattle again.

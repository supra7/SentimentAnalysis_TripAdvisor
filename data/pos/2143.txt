The Moore must be the best kept secret in Seattle. I researched downtown hotels extensively online and booked a room here for a weekend trip. I got a nice little room with a claw foot bath tub for $70 a night. The staff was very nice and accomodating. I used the internet in the lobby to check my flight times. The bar seemed a little daunting to a solo female traveler but there were many other options close by. Got an early check in which was awesome. Can't wait to come back.

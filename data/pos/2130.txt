We stayed for two nights (Sept 17 +18) while in town to see Dead Can Dance at the Paramount. Coming from Victoria on the Clipper it was $7 by cab (including tip) to the Moore. Check in was quick and front staff were very helpful! Our 7th floor room was charming and very clean. Water pressure was perfect but watch out for the shower - hot was cold and cold was hot - at least in our room. The hotel was quiet - we only bumped into a couple of groups in the hall and yes the noise on the street from the bar scene was noticable but close your window and you won't be bothered. The area is safe and really would you walk anywhere alone at 3 am? We found a coupon on the web for 10% off the already great price. Close to the Market, Monorail, major shopping, a 10 min walk to the Paramount - location cannot be beat. Belltown has many great placed to eat - Belltown Pizza, 2 huge slices and a soda for $7.91. For a late nite snack and a game of Connect Four or an early morning coffee try Nexxus - just 1/2 block to the north on 2nd ave. We are already planning our next trip to Seattle and can't wait to stay at the Moore again!

Hotel rooms were clean, neat, and big enough. Only disadvantage is if you aren't staying in the tower where the pool is, it is a bit inconvenient to get to. Though this did not stop my son from wanting to go swimming every night. THe view from the pool is awesome especially on a clear day. Staff from the bell hops, the front desk, concierge, to the housekeeping staff were all friendly and helpful. Location is great. Close to the market, the monorail that goes to the space needle, the bus system, and shopping. The mall where the monorail is has a very nice food court with the best selection of "mall food" I've ever seen (and it was pretty decent food). I felt very safe walking at any hour with my 8 year old son. I would stay here again.

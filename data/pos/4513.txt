We loved the Westin! Location was wonderful and the rooms and beds very comfortable. We were given a room on the 39th floor with a fantastic view of the Space Needle for no addtional charge. The Concierge Service was phenomenal. They recommended wonderful restaurants, gave us free appetizers at each one, and arranged free transportation to some. The room was clean, but only one thing could use improvement, which was the housekeeping forgot to leave us some supplies such as glasses and coffee. However, they brought things to us immediately when we called them. I would definitely stay there again!

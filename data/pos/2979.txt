I stayed here for three nights in October after finding a great price on Hotwire, and was really impressed with the Sheraton. I will defininitely make this a first choice hotel when I go back to Seattle. The hotel is good, but the big draw is the great location. It's easy to get to off the Interstate, and right in the action downtown with Pike Place only a few blocks away. Also within short walking distance are the shopping malls, theaters, loads of restaurants, coffee shops and attractions, monorail to the space needle, and the transit tunnel. The hotel itself was good. The room was comfortable, the bed/pillows/linens were great, everything was what I expect for a hotel like this. Not fancy but functional and in good repair. The room had a large flat-screen TV, safe, minibar etc. Staff were all pleasant to deal with. The fitness centre is surprisingly large and spacious unlike the broom closet workout rooms squeezed into many other hotels. The pool was nice and clean too, though there isn't really a locker/changing area, just a restroom area. Cons: No free internet, and no wireless in the rooms either - wired high speed internet is available for extra cost so you're confined to the desk in your room. Yet they still give you a free paper. Hotel managers please pay attention: lose the free papers and start giving free internet instead. Parking: Onsite parking is valet only and pricey ($40+/night I believe). Self-park is only available at the unsecured public parking at the convention centre a block away and is still expensive at $28/night, but that's just the price you pay to be in the city I guess. On the other hand, if we stayed outside the city we would have just ended up driving downtown and paying for parking anyway, so it probably balances out.

This hotel is centrally located and service is exceptional. Great for business travellers. You can walk to a number of really nice restaurants as well as Pike Market. The rooms are a combination of rustic and European appointed so very cozy and chic. But bear in mind these few things: get a room on the water side as the train runs through the night on the city side; there is no pool in the hotel; you can turn off the fan if it gets too loud.

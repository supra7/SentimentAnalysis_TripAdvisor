We stayed for one night at this hotel, which is clean, quiet and has a great, central location. Not to mention having reasonable rates! I would say, however, that the hotel is still undergoing redecoration and we were given a very drab room that had us thinking of the song "Hotel California". On the other hand, we DID arrive prior to check-in, but the staff were very friendly and could see we were eager to get settled. Had we been patient I am certain we would have been put in one of the newer rooms. The Pike Place Market is two blocks away (downhill), and Belltown is right there so there are plenty of options for dining. Seattle is also a very walkable city (aside from some of those hills). I am not the type who really takes decor into consideration, though. All I really want is a room for a reasonable rate that is clean, quiet, comfortable and located in a good area. And the Moore Hotel certainly met all of those qualifications. They also have cable television and free internet access if you bring your laptop. If you're expecting doorman service, bellhops, extra linens, etc., this is not the place for you. That kind of hotel you would spend over $200 a night for.

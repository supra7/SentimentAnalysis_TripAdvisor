My husband and I went to Seattle for a long weekend to semi-celebrate our Anniversary but also to experience Seattle which we have been wanting to do for awhile now. Some friends who live in the area recommended we stay at the Edgewater Hotel. The hotel is very cozy and was perfect for the time of year we were in Seattle. It is totally worth it to upgrade to a waterside room, we originally were in a streetside room but it just wasn't as nice. I think it was an extra $50 for the upgrade and totally worth it. The lounge and restaurant are great if you don't feel like dealing with the rain. Great location - we could basically walk to everything, never needed to take a cab except to the aiport. We would definitely stay here again.

I just stayed here last weekend and have already planned to stay here again the night before New Years. There is a very warm atmosphere about this inn and I personally think its more like a hotel than an inn. They actually have room service from 5-10 which are the same hours as their restaurant. This is something I couldn't find elsewhere in the area. If anyone reading this knows better...please feel free to educate me :o) Outside of room service hours there is a pantry with both wine and beer available too. I took advantage of this given I was in the area visiting my girl friend. The chef..I think Patty is her name is really nice, very entertaining and very obviously a hit with the locals. Both mornings I had breakfast..more non residents came in for breakfast than residents and the breakfast was delicious. Eggs/pancakes etc made to order and plenty of selection. The beds are one touch beds which allow adjustment for firmness..I slept like a log..no need for more to be said. The stay comes with complimentary access to Bally Fitness/La Fitness (large well equipped gym) within a 2 minute walk from the hotel. This hotel will be my hotel of choice for stays in Baltimore for the foreseeable future.

Wow. Friendliest staff I've ever encountered. Treated my fianc and I like we were old friends, recommended excellent bars and restaurants, always helpful if we needed directions. I read the shared bathroom thing and was very nervous but the rates were so good I booked anyway. There were at least ten bathrooms and I literally never saw less than four available. This area is walking distance from anywhere you'd want to be. As for the rooms, just look at their site, very trendy and cozy. Highly recommend renting a bike and riding along the coast. Breakfast in the morning was such a nice touch. Yummy waffles and they always had soy milk available for the health conscious! Cyclops, the restaurant downstairs is absolutely delicious you must try anything on their menu but if you like burgers, get one! They've changed my opinion on what a burger should taste like.

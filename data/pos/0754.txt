We have stayed here several times. You cannot beat the location: steps away from The Market and stunning views of Elliott Bay. We arrived late morning after a 6-hour flight from Philly and were able to check in right away to our beautiful room overlooking the bay. All the staff we encountered were cheerful and helpful. (Come to think of it, everyone we encountered in Seattle we cheerful. Do they put something in the water?) The only disappointment was the temporary closure to Campagne, the hotel's restaurant. It's been closed for renovations for some time.

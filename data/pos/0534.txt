I spent 5 nights here, would recommend it for: 1. Location...walking distance to Space Needle neighborhood, and it's right downtown 2. Cleanliness 3. Smoking rooms available if you need that...confined to the 9th floor I believe 4. Restaurant...on site; excellent food at reasonable cost 5. Nice internet rate 6. Nice views Cheaper parking right next door on 5th if you don't need secure, covered parking.

I booked a 3 night stay on Priceline ($80/night Sat - Mon) and once I got the name of the hotel I did my research...I was scared after reading some of these reviews. But there was no need - this is a great place for that price. The staff was amazingly friendly and accomodating (brought a bottle opener to the room and changed my room as requested). The room was comfortable and nicely appointed. This room had everything that I would expect for this class of hotel. The renovations are up to date and stylish. Make sure to go to the 28th floor for a nightcap - the view is worth it! Parking is a little pricey but there is a surface lot about 2 blocks away on 8th that is $15 for the day - if you don't mind getting up early to buy the ticket. Street parking in the area after 6 PM is free so take advantage of that. If you plan on walking, you can avoid some of the hills by walking down 6th to Pike Street and then left to the market - it is a fairly flat walk unlike going down Madison.

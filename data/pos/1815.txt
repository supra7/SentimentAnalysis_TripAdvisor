We decided to stay at this hotel because we had stayed there previously many years ago and because of the great location. The location is very good for seeing the main tourist sites of Seattle. It is within walking distance to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square, the waterfront ferries and shopping. You could either walk to the Space Needle or take the Monorail from the shopping center that is next to the hotel. The hotel is also located across the street from Nordstrom and Macys for those who like to shop. The rooms were very clean but showed some age. The bathroom fixtures and bedspread had seen better days and should be replaced. The service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of the staff were very nice while others were not. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would have rated it higher had the service been more consistent and room been updated.

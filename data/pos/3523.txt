This is hotel is on 4th Aven, good locations, good restaurants and short walking to shops. We hade a suite but in mine mind it was closer to big hotel room. We traveled with two teenagers. The mattras are great, they come from Hastens in Sweden. Room was clean, bathroom way to small (our older daugher got locked inside of it for nearly 2 hours when I, my wife and out younger daugher went to the gym and computer room). The door knop felt off and she was scared there inside but took this with as a grown up and stared to think about positves things and wait for us to come back. But hotel in this class should not have loose door knop. The bar is small and crowded with people and you dont go there inside to relax and have one or two drinks. The staff is eager to help around Seattle and tell you about things to do and where to go, f exp restaurants, shops, carrentals and so on.

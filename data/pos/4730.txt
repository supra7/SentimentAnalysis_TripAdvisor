Me and a friend just stayed at the travelodge over Easter weekend to attend the Mars Hill Church Easter service at Qwest Field (which was also excllent by the way). The staff was incredibly helpful and nice. The room was very clean, the beds were really comfortable, the comp breakfast was the best I've ever seen. So much choice - you can make your own waffles, yogurt, cereal, fruit, toast, bagels, muffins, pastries, juice, coffee. It was awesome. It was an excellent location in the downtown area - easy to find your way around. We walked down to Pike Place market and the pier - it was a decent walk. I know where I'll be staying next time I'm in town ! We had absolutly no complaints at all. Did I mention how comfortable the beds were! Thanks Travelodge!

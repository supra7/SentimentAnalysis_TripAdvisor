The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Boutique hotels are not normally the best option if you are traveling with kids but we took our 2yo and were pleasantly surprised. The size of the rooms and in-room counter and made our stay that much pleasant. You can't beat the hotel's downtown location. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle and Pike Place. You can basically walk everywhere if you want to. It is also across the street from great restaurants. We definitely recommend it.

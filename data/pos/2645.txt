Booked this hotel from the Internet and it was a great choice. Arrived after midnight and reception was very friendly and helpful. Nice room, complimentary breakfast and a spa and pool. Lobby was welcoming with a warm fire and free real coffee or chocolate milk. Desk very helpful with tourist information and booked a fantastic 1/2 day Seattle tour for us. Hotel very close to Space Needle, Science Museum and Monorail. Monorail convenient for getting into the City. There were six in our party and we all loved Seattle and this Hotel.

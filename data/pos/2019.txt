WOW! We ended up here after our hotel double booked us and were thrilled! Pay the extra for a suite (it's still super cheap); it's huge with a kitchenette, high top table, large bedroom, a very comfy bed, and an antique clawfoot tub. Our room was super clean and quiet which we really appreciated. This hotel is well situated with easy access to all public transit and just a few blocks up from Pike Place Market. There are a few cons. Beware of the water temperature going from warm to literally scalding without notice. The staff seemed mostly apathetic but for one very friendly and helpful young man at the front, so don't expect a lot of assistance. One gal literally told me she had no idea what to recommend to do because "there isn't a lot to do in Seattle." There is a homeless shelter two doors down, so especially after dark there are some character hanging around on the sidewalk. They didn't approach us, so no harm there. All that said, I HIGHLY recommend this spot (at least the suites). It is the best value in downtown.

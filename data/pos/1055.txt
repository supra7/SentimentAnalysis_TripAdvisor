My husband & I just got back yesterday from Seattle. Our stay at The Inn at The Market was wonderful. I agree that the layout of the room is awkward for watching the television. The view from the 5th floor deck was breathtaking &the setting was very relaxing. You are literally next door to the maket & there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I loved the bath robes, turn down service & chocolates. The staff was friendly & eager to help in any way they could. Would stay again.

I stayed here 2 nights before the business part of my trip would start. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had booked a regular room but at check-in I was informed that I had been upgraded to a king suite which was great. The location of the hotel was great, across the street from Macy's, and perfect for exploring Seattle on foot. The room itself was big, with a separate sitting room. The bathroom was a little small in comparison. Shower was great. The decor of the room was supposed to be European style but the flowery motive was a little bit overdone. I had a good time staying here.

It's a really nice hotel, especially for the business traveler hoping to unwind. They know who they are catering to and they don't miss a step. They're not going for a hip, spare atmosphere, but catering to what urban travelers want. I also like it because there's an indoor pool, it's downtown, the views are amazing, so when I can score a sweet deal to make it somewhat affordable, I'll take the Westin. The rooms are wonderful. There all the nice smelling shampoos, shower gels, etc, that you'll want to take with you. And the linens are so soft and cozy you might splurge for room service breakfast and even beg for a late checkout. The large hotel lobby with the big soft chairs is great for meeting friends for a cocktail before dinner. There are plenty of very nice hotels in downtown Seattle, and while I like to mix things up when I visit, the Westin is a consistent favorite.

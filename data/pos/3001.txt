Location of the hotel was excellent, quick drive from I-5 and proximity to Pike Market was excellent. Hotel is located in the shopping district across from American Eagle and quick walk to Nordstrom, Macys etc., Hotel is huge so valet, check-in was extremely busy during our stay not very friendly. Room was good not much of a view. Room was clean, beds were comfortable. Couple of issues during our stay nothing major.

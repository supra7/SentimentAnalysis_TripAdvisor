We had two rooms with a great water view. Everything was very clean. The reservation process was one of the best I've experienced. The only problem we encountered was that our rooms were not ready at check in. We went to the bar but were told we were not allowed to be in there with a 15 year old. No problem, if we would have been told that food and beverages could be served to us in the lobby. We eventually figured it out and enjoyed delicious snacks in the lobby. I would strongly recommend this hotel.

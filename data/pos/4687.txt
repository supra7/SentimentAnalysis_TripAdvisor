The Westin is known for having great beds and this hotel was no exception. The rooms were relatively quiet, clean, and well appointed. That said, the hotel is definitely older and the design is just plain silly. The hotel consists of two round towers. Because each tower is round, all of the rooms are oddly shaped and a bit narrow from front to rear (as opposed to narrow from side to side as with most hotels). As a result, the bed is quite near the windows and you can hear some (very little) street noise. Again because of the round shape of the building, the elevator area is not separated from the rooms. Thus, several of the rooms are right next to the elevators and if you get one of them, as we did, you can hear the elevator bell ding whenever an elevator arrives and you can hear people talking while the waiting for the elevator. I have trouble sleeping and this noise didn't help. The bathrooms are also relatively small and have a shower curtain instead of a door, as most modern hotel rooms do. If your room faces the other tower, beware that people can (and do) look out their windows and will see into your room at night. The two guys in their underwear in the room opposite my kid's room apparently didn't know (or didn't care). Also, I was a little disappointed at how our bags were handled. When we arrived, there was no bell staff available so the doorman simply left our bags unattended at the other end of a long sidewalk next to a major street, instead of taking the bags into a more secure location while awaiting someone to transport them. I admit that these are minor gripes, and this is a perfectly good hotel. That's why I've given it four stars. But given the price, I expect a larger bathroom and a quieter place to sleep.

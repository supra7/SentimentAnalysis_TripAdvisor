I've always been a lover of the Kimpton brand and my recent stay at Seattle's Vintage Park proved I have good taste! The rooms are clean and well maintained, the restuarant is top notch (best roast chicken I have ever had in a restaurant...no lie), and the staff are great! Sherry in the bar is a particular fave (she knows what a sheleighly is for Pete's sake!)!!! I'll be in Seattle regularly over the next few months and the Vintage Park will be my home base!

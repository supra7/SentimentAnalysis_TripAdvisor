This is our second visit to the Hotel Monaco and it did not disappoint. We love the central location and proximity to all that Seattle has to offer. The hotel is well appointed, it has extremely comfortable beds and superb sound insulation considering the location. We were once again treated like royalty, the staff were extremely accommodating. There is a genuine effort being made to make your stay as pleasant and seamless as possible. Outstanding personal service. We like the relaxed feeling of the place, it feels less corporate than other hotels yet maintaining a professional attitude. There is little doubt that this will become our preferred hotel when visiting Seattle.

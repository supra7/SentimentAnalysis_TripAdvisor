Wow! What a wonderful hotel - such a shame we could only stay one night. Location - Convenient to just about everything Seattle has to offer. Rooms - Beautiful! Clean! Just like the photos. Staff - Wonderful! Helpful! Funny! The Concierge was a riot who was also very, very helpful in booking things. Room Service - for tired travellers it was quick and delicious. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle, it was a pleasure and when we can return again this is where we'll stay.

Very nice Hotel stay. Nice rooms, good service, wonderful lobby. The location is in walking distance of everything that matters in Seattle. A few blocks from Pikes Market, Macy's and Nordstrom, the monorail to seattle center and walkable to Pioneer Square. Right next door to the convention center makes it super conveinant for folks with activities scheduled at the center. Friendly staff. Room service is a bit pricy - higher costs for same items downstairs plus delivery fee and gratuity added. I would definately stay there again.

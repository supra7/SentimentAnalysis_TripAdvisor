Stayed here for 2 nights. fantastic location for WestLake Centre, just a stone throw from the hotel, and the hop on hop off bus is just 2 blocks away. The Seattle Needle is just 10-15 minutes away depending on your speed of walking. You can got to Westlake centre on the 3rd floor for a meal as it has a food court there, and Mc Donalds next door (but the staff there is so rude and unfriendly. The room was large and comfortable the only negative thing is that on our floor the smell was not so pleasant on the corridor as you get out of the lift. We were pleasantly surprised that we had a microwave, fridge, coffe maker to which we had coffee replenished daily. There was also a drink dispenser on our floor and the cost was.40cents cheaper that outside. fantastic place with great value for money. do not be put off by me saying about the smell on the corridor. Everything was in order. Had a good time. There is not much to do here if you have travelled before as the activies lik e the aquarium, etc is the same as every where else so I say 2 days is enough for a short visit. For a 2 star hotel we had shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, shower gel. Not at all bad for the money we paid. Clean towels were given almost every day. Hope it is helpful.

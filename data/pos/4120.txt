A personable staff, first class linens on the bed and great location make this one of my favorite local hotels. I live in Seattle and used this hotel for a weekend out (my company party was on one of the nights). This cozy little gem of a hotel is renowned in the city and is close to everything that matters. The hotel has a comfortable old-school feel.

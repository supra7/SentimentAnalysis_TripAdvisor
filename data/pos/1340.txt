I stayed here because I was in town for a conference at the convention center and it was a little less expensive than the other downtown hotels. I was able to book a club room for less than the rate of a regular room at some of the other hotels. It included a continental breakfast in the club lounge with pastries, cereal and fruit, as well as early-evening appetizers (charge for alcoholic beverages, though), and I got a room on a high floor with a great view of the city. They also gave a coupon for a free appetizer at the bar. The hotel is very convenient if you have business at the convention center -- it's about a three minute walk through the park across the street directly to the convention center's side door. Everything else was fine -- decent gym and OK bar. I'd stay here and try and book a club room if I visit Seattle again.

The Mayflower Park had attentive service and a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and attached to the Westlake Mall where you can access the monorail. We opted for the deluxe room to gain a little more area and were glad we did. We had a corner room with 3 windows on 2 walls and we had lots of light. As high as we were, it was surprising to still be able to hear the traffic so well. I guess we were tired enough at night that it did not really turn into an issue. The bathroom is very small with a pedestal sink. A small glass shelf above the sink is where I removed my contacs and I really prefer a vanity area. I estimated about 20 inches at the most between the sink and tub. The bathroom was definitely my least favorite thing about the room. The elevators were unbelievably slow and we spent a lot of time during our several day stay waiting on them. I think this might be a better one night stay place with a good rate from a Priceline type internet booking.

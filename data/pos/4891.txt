Was recently on business in Seattle, stayed 4 nights Sunday-Thursday. The hotel itself is in an older building that has been redone. Warm, rich woods and colors. Makes you feel at home. Yes, the lobby is small, but seriously, how much time will you spend there? I was warmly greeted when I arrived at 7pm Sunday night. The desk staff were quick and efficient. Noted that I was staying a while, gave me some tips on where to go and what to see. Also informed of the hours the restaurant and fitness room are open. I was upgraded to room 1108 on the top floor - a King Premier Suite. I would strongly suggest you somehow get this room! It was amazing, overlooking the city library, the skyline, and the courthouse. I could have spent all night just looking out the wall of windows! The suite had a sitting area with chair and sleeper sofa, nice sized flat-screen tv, fridge/dresser, and coffee table. The king bed was ridiculously comfortable, the bathroom updates with granite. It was a wonderful room. The week flew by, all the while the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Checkout was a breeze, and they even held my bag for me so I didn't have to lug it to a business meeting. Oh, and they found my cell charger that I'd left in my room! Above and beyond. The hotel, as others have noted, is close to I-5, and while you can hear some traffic during the day, at night this is a non issue. I even had my window open one night. For the money, you can't find a better property than this. Breakfast downstairs at Tulio was tasty and reasonable, and be sure to join In Touch to get free wifi and perks. To sum it all up - STAY HERE. You definitely won't have any regrets doing so. No surprise that it is #11 of all hotels in the Seattle area.

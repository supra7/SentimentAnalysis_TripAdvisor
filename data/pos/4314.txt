The Westin Seattle was the best hotel we have ever visited. We only had one night there before boarding the cruise ship going to Alaska the following morning. The Westin had the most comfortable beds in the world! Service was excellent. Amenities were superb. The room was exceptional. The hotel was close to everything in the downtown area. Our time was limited but we definitely will schedule another trip to Seattle when we have a few days to explore the city.

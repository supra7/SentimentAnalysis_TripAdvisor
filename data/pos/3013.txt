We spent the weekend here for my daughter's birthday. The staff were top notch - giving her a gift box with chocolates and a little souvenir book when they learned it was her birthday. The view was fabulous from the room, over the city and the sound. Walking distance to Pike's, right by the cinema, etc. All in all, very comfortable, with great service.

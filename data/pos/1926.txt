Seattle is a friendly city anyway but the Mayflower Park made it even more so. The staff were always ready with a friendly word, even if they didn't have to bother - and it really made our trip. We had a superb room, quite high up with a view (of the Space Needle) as requested. The room was beautifully clean and very well maintained, comfortable and relaxing. Situated Downtown, the hotel is in an excellent position for all the main attractions and an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of shopping and business. Expensive yes, but a great start to our two weeks holiday. A very classy and stylish hotel.

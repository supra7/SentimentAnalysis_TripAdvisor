Stayed one night prior to returning home after a business trip. Centrally located near Pike's Place with an easy walk to restaurants (94 Stewart), shops, etc. Check in was easy and staff was friendly and helpful. I had a "courtyard" view instead of a water view. I had not requested a specific view, so I'm not complaining. (I learned that if you want a water view you need to book in advance and call to confirm.) Room and bathroom were large, well lit, with good amenities. Bed was devine and I slept soundly for seven hours without waking up -- usual for me when I'm on the road. No extraneous noise -- a suprise because I later discovered there was a family with a small child next door, but I never heard them. I did not use the business center. Wi-Fi in the room was quick, even with downloading files. Although I did not use room service, I did get juice from Baccos. Baccos made a fabulous apple, carrot, grapefruit juice...squeezed while I waited. I plan to return with my spouse for a special weekend.

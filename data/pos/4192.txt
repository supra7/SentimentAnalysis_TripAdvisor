For five days I was in Seattle on business. I asked for and received a room away from the elevator and the ice machine. I am a light sleeper. My requests were granted. The only glitch is that I choose the Green Option which meant that I would not get housekeeping during my stay. That is perfect for me because I don't like my sheets changed and don't need new towels daily. I did ask for two things: my bed made daily and coffee for the machine. The first three days that happened. Then out of the blue I was told that since I chose the Green Option housekeeping would not enter the room. I was not going to pay for coffee but I was okay with making my own bed. Bottom line: for me I would have liked those two services and those two only. Unfortunately it was an all or nothing deal. Had breakfast and lunch daily at the little cafe in the hotel. It was excellent!! Internet was good, view out the window wonderful and proximity to the downtown places perfect. Getting to and from the airport was a breeze. I used the Shuttle Express for $15.00 each way. I will return to Seattle and will most definitely stay here. However I will bring my own coffee.

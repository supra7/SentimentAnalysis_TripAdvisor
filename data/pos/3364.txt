Hotel Andra is a hidden treasure in Seattle. Located in an older but classy building, once you walk in the door, it's modern yet warm charm envelopes you. The staff is friendly and very helpful yet not obtrusive. Our room this trip, a suite, was large, very nicely furnished and comfortable. For the value, this place is a hidden treasure. Excellent restaurants nearby, valet parking and close to Pike Place and downtown, Hotel Andra hits a home run.

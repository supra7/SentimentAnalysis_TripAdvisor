Stayed at the Mayflower with my wife while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Centre. Great location. Close enough to walk to the Centre but far enough to avoid running into attendees 24/7! Also close to a wide range of shopping tastes: Macy's, Nordstron, Banana Republic Payless and Ross Dress for Less for example. Some of the surroundings were a bit dingy (that park with the waterfall for example) but we never really felt threatened even though some unsavoury looking characters were always hanging around. Didn't spend much time in the hotel (out in the morning, back at night) but we did eat at Oliver's which was delightful and enjoyed watching a very amusing bartender give lessons to a visiting group. We were left alone, and that was fine. The room was always well made up and that was our main concern. Free wireless internet was great, so I could check my email at nights. No assistance provided on checkout (it was 4am and the staff did seem sleepy) but that was fine too. Saved a tip there. We would stay there again if we went back to Seattle.

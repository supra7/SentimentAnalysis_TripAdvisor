The hotel was nice and well maintained. However, it was the hotel's staff that transformed this nice but normal hotel into a 5 star standout. Every single staff person, from the front desk folks to the cleaning person, was pleasant and went out of his or her way to 1) greet you; 2) ask if they could assist you; and 3) actually help you with your request (instead of recommending you see this person or that person).

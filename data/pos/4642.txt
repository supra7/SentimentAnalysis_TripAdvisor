Exceeded my expectations for weekend with two nieces aged 2 and 10. Spacious room with two doubles, desk, and two easy chairs with room to spare for Heavenly Crib which was very cute! Great kids pack at check-in. Slightly small bathroom with large tub/shower. Excellent service with every request for extra towels/robes and light fixture problem was handled within 15 minutes. Location is fantastic for access to monorail to Seattle Center and Westlake food court across the street. Can walk to water/Pikes place market and then taxi back if kids are tired. Cafe in lobby with hot and cold breakfast which we took out to room and had breakfast in bed. Kids loved this hotel and enjoyed the pool even though it is small and more for exercise. I previously lived in Seattle and would highly recommend this hotel primarily for its location and now also for the excellent service we received.

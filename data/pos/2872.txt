Very convenient location and access to shopping centres and Pike Place Market. Best for first time tourists. The hotel was also very easy to find as it was right off the I-5 highway. It offered an awesome 24-hour gym on the 35th floor. The hotel is very busy and overnight parking is quite expensive, but I gather that the rest of downtown Seattle is the same (22% parking tax!) We had a difficult time sleeping on the bed as the sheets were quite starchy and the room temperature couldn't cool down enough. Overall, the hotwire discount price along with the location offered great value.

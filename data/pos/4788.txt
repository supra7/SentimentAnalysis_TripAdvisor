Our recent stay at the University Inn was fantastic! We loved the "feel" of the cozy small hotel and the people at the front desk. They always were so helpful and answered all of our questions. The mattresses on the beds looked brand new, along with the entire room. It was a very clean room. The towels are brand new and SOOOO soft! The free shuttle was fantastic picking us up right on time and whisking us away to the Space Needle to catch the Duck tour. (We took the 3:00 shuttle for the 5:00 duck, but only needed the 4:00 we got there so fast!) I had made reservations for the shuttle 2 days before arriving since there was 6 of us. I would still reserve early if you are on a tight schedule like we were. We stayed only one night in Seattle. Right next door we ate lunch at the Portage Cafe which had a delicious banana foster french toast..... The toppings bar was LOTS of fresh fruit. I was in heaven. It was very quaint allowing us to eat lunch outside. It was very convenient too being able to walk there from the hotel. Overall, this was a much more affordable option than staying downtown. The free breakfast the next morning was good with yogurt, cereal, muffins, waffles,etc. We were going to leave before it started, but the nice young man at the front desk had it ready a few minutes early, which made us happy. When in Seattle, we will be back!

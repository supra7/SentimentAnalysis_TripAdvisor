This hotel is charming, right in the heart of downtown. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our four-legged family member was welcomed with open arms. The rooms reminded me of Manhattan hotels with excellent space economy. We had a pleasant stay, would recommend this hotel to friends and definitely will return again when next in Seattle. We were really excited that the soaps and lotion are vegan and of excellent quality. The bed was super-comfy and I did not miss my pillows from home. We do not usually use room service, so I cannot speak for that amenity or lack there-of but there are hundreds of options all within walking distance from this location. The SAM and Pike Market as well as numerous other sites are within walking distance. Our room's view was not great (alleyway) but this afforded noise protection from street sounds. We happened to be there during the Torchlight Parade for a local festival. The parade went right in front of the hotel. A fun surprise. http://heldveganbelts.com

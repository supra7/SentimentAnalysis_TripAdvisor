This is a great hotel and especially at the low, low price of $139.00 from Priceline in the summer on a weekend. I was a bit reluctant because when you book on Priceline you don't know the hotel until you have basically paid a non-refundable night(s). Also since I think it rated at only 3.5 stars I was wondering if it would be up to my neat freak standards. YES, it was! The staff was very attentive and handed me water bottles the minute I walked in after my morning runs. They also had small pocket laminated running route maps at the concierge desk. The concierge knew everything! Pool is a little on the stuffy, chlorinated side since it is inside but still nice. Our room had the most wonderful view of the city, harbor and space needle. I think it was the best view at the hotel, room 4632. Our room was immaculate and we loved the in-room Starbucks coffee and tea. I really can't think of any negatives about our stay at the Westin. It is also perfectly located. We walked to Whole Foods and bought food to go since we have young kids and the hotel even brought up a mini-frig at our request at no charge.

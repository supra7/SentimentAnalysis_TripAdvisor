Thoroughly enjoyed our two night getaway at the Edgewater! It was everything and more than we expected. This hotel has its very own style and feel. It will not be like anywhere else you have ever stayed. The rooms are cozy! Love the intimate fireplaces and renovated bathrooms. Our waterfront view was amazing with the ferry coming and going. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful. We will definitely stay again. Couple of recommendations... WiFi should be complimentary in keeping with the times. A 24 hr room service menu would be awesome. And as I see mentioned throughout the reviews, more affordable parking. I did appreciate the heads up I received on booking about the cost of parking. This allowed me to make alternate arrangements that saved me 80+ dollars. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Edgewater!

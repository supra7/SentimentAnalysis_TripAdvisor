Good little hotel for those wishing to be downtown but who also prefer to budget. Our room was clean, but small - with no view, staff was friendly, and location was within easy walking distance down to the market and pier if mobility isn't an issue. I recommend a taxi back from the waterfront area unless you're in good physical shape... the climb is steep. I would book this hotel again. Very good value for the location.

We had 4 families staying at the Moore hotel prior to leaving for our Alaskan cruise. The Moore is located an easy 2 block walk from the train which runs from the airport. A mere $2.75 per person gets you there! Each room was decorated differently - we had a walk in shower & my daughter's room had a clawfoot tub. They have really kept the "feel" of the hotel as it was nearly 100 years ago but recently updated. The room rates were very reasonable. It's located 2 blocks from Pike Place Market & very close to several restaurants. You won't find a better value for your $$. If you want the "cookie cutter" hotels w/the free breakfast, this isn't the place for you. We have no regrets & saved $100's of dollars.

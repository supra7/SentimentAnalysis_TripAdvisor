Stayed here, with a friend, for a 5 night business trip. We were both very pleased with the room and the service. The front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff was very responsive and helpful. I had a free refrigerator (you have to request it). They are trying to be "green" so they give you a $5 coupon for the cafe if you decline housekeeping. We decided that we did not want to waste water having them wash sheets and towels everyday, we don't do that at home, so this was a good deal. The pool and jacuzzi are nice. Excellent location in the downtown area. 19th floor was quiet, no street noise. Felt very safe. The room was nice, not huge, but certainly good enough for the amount of time that we spent there. I would definitely return to the Westin. Free wifi in the lobby, although you can pay for the internet access in the room. Business center has free boarding pass access, otherwise you pay for the internet. Bring a laptop and sit in the lobby. You can people-watch and surf at the same time.

I enjoyed my stay at the Moore Hotel. It is a very reasonably priced hotel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean, the individuals at the hotel lobby desk were friendly and helpful, and there was a computer available in the lobby to check e-mail and view the Internet. I was able to walk or take the numerous public transit options to view many of the attractions of interest to me in Seattle. Also, the hotel is only a 3-minute walk to the Central Link light rail, which for $2.75 can take you to the SeaTac airport. The negatives are that there is no breakfast, no fitness center, no writing desk in the room (so I ate my snacks/meals by the nightstand), and no air conditioning. The air conditioning was not an issue for me even for the week I stayed in August, as the Seattle weather was pleasant and cool and there was no need for air conditioning. It would have been helpful if the window had a screen as I minimized opening it due to my concerns that bugs would fly inside. I highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay there again.

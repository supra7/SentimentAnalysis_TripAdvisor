We stayed at the Inn at the Market for 5 days in August and had a wonderful experience. Every member of the staff who we encountered throughout our stay was very friendly and helpful. We had a city view room (or whatever the lowest category of room is called) and it was great. We didn't need a water view from the room since we could just go to the rooftop deck anytime for a water view anyways. The city view room allowed us to do some people watching as well. The room was very clean and up to date. There is a small fridge in the room with some beverages you can purchase, but there was also enough room for us to use it to store our own drinks or leftovers from the restaurants. The rooftop deck was so great and I can't imagine staying in a hotel in Seattle without it now that I've experienced it. It really was a great place to enjoy breakfast, lunch, dinner, a sunset, or any other time of day. The housekeeping service was great, and the front desk and bell staff were also super. We even saw orca whales in the bay one morning from the rooftop deck. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle. Great location, great staff & great overall hotel experience!!!

I stayed at Westin Seattle from July 29th to July 31st. I checked in late. The airport is about 25 mins from Seattle airport. Check in was smooth. I requested a room with a view and they were accomodating. I got to stay in south tower on 27th floor. Room had a good view I called in room service. Room service took about 25 mins to get the dinner. Bed was comfortable. Room had a desk facing the window which was nice. I saw many folks from cruise staying there Hotel is nearby to Westlake shopping center and other attractions. You can walk to Pike Public market. Very nice place

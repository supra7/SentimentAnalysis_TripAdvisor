Our room was in the tower of the Union street. We had a room next to the elevator and was worry that it'd be noisy, but it wasn't. Great location to the Pike Place Mkt. One thing I'd like to add is that they have 4 computers @ the lounge with 45 minutes free of charge access. They have free unlimited wireless access @ the lounge If you have your own laptop.

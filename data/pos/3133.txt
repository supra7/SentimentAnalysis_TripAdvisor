I spent four nights there and really enjoyed my stay -- except for the dreadful woman in the next room who stayed up late every night to call colleagues in a differnet time zone (Europe?) and slammed her door repeatedly. Food was great (if you like burgers try their Angus Burger - OMG it was amazing), very professional staff, clean and comfortable rooms. I stayed on Club Level (which is in the old tower and it was really nice) and got free breakfast and hors d'oeuvres; both were VERY tasty. The breakfast included larges bowls of fresh in-season fruit and had the best raspberries I've ever eaten. Great high-end pastries, too. The housekeeping staff was gracious and very helpful. Had a room on the top floor with views of the mountains and water. Located in the middle of everything and I had a chance to walk all over the place, including just a few blocks to the Pike Place Market. Shopped at Macy's and had great service there. Would definitely return. Also, the bed was amazing! Took the tour to Boeing and it left from the hotel. So convenient.

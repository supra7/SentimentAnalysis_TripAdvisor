We had to stay at the Marqueen due to the "crazy snow storm" this week. We live on the top of Queen Anne, and this is the second year we've taken the precaution and stayed here. They have excellent service, and the rooms are always spacious. This year they welcomed us back and offered a free paper that was waiting for us at 6am when we left our room. The valet driver was fast and had our car ready for us by the time we were checked out. All around a great experience and I highly recommend while out on the town, or visiting the space needle/ Seattle center. We will be back, and send family here when they visit.

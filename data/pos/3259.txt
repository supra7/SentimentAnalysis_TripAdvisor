We stay in downtown Seattle 5 or 6 times a year. When we're on a budget, this is THE place. It's just a 950 foot walk to Westlake Center, and minutes to Pike Place Market, or anywhere else downtown. A walk back from Pioneer Square took about 18 minutes. This time we got rates of: $76.46 for Friday and $71.58 on Saturday night (I believe I asked for either a AAA or Government rate), before fees. The $15 parking is also a great deal for downtown Seattle. The Lounge/Restaurant is adequate, and room service was quick. I'll let the pictures speak for the room itsel...well, ok, I will add that it was clean, nice size, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This place can not be beat for value and location. PS. My wife asked to mention that the in room toiletries come out of a dispenser, which some folks may not like. The dispenser says that it may save 1000 soap and shampoo bottles each year. Oh, and the blow dryer didn't blow hot air.

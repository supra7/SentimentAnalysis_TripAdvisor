We stayed in Seattle last November ( 2011) and it was a fantastic and unexpected experience. We stayed in the Sheraton Seattle and the experience was excellent. The hotel is located next to the Convention Center. If attending a conference, it is the place to stay. The Lobby is grand, the entrance floor is nicely decorated, there is a nice bar, restaurant and other conveniences. The room is very good, comfortable, has everything the guest needs. The Chinese cleaning ladies were wonderful trying to please the guests. The view, in particular from the gym in the 35th floor is breathtaking. Staying in the Sheraton was marvelous experience. The city has everything a tourist wants: the downtown area is very well preserved, clean and in particular at this time of the year, the fall, presented astonishing colors varying from green, yellow and all ranges of red. taking the monorail towards the space needle and several museums is breathtaking trip over the streets. Walking down to the water front we get to the fish market, where the first ever Starbucks cafe is located. In this market besides the fish that looks out of this world, one can walk and buy fish, fruits, vegetables, flowers and also clothes, enjoy good restaurants with nice view. it is possible to take the ferry to several destinations, including Canada. the nearest destination (only 35 five minutes away) takes you to Bainbrige as we leave Seattle by ferry the view is something we cant describe. The city skyline facing the water is astonishing. Take a bus tour and get a good idea of the city has to offer, including the floating bridges, with well projected landscapes in both sides. There is much more to see, come to seattle to see it for yourself. We highly recommend sheraton seatle for your stay.

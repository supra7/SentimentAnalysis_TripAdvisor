I arrived late from a flight and was pleased to find a very beautiful crowne plaza hotel. $129 a night - Excellent value and an Excellent stay. There is Valet parking for $28 a night and I took that so I don't know if there is a parking ramp close to it or not. Check in was fast and very professional. The room was clean, soft King size bed, quiet, good food (room service), and updated or just very well taken care of. Check out had a few problems. I was double charged for Valet - Corrected. And I didn't like the front desk managers (Morning) attitude. He seemed busy doing nothing and let me stand there for awhile as he poked at the key board. I was going to complain, but that seems to never get a response any longer. Easy to get on the freeway.

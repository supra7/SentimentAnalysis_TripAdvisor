This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Inn at the Market. The property is better than most: the lobby is handsome, the rooms comfortable (though a little tired and ready for renovation, especially in the case of the bathrooms), the sun deck overlooking the harbor is a treat, and the staff is welcoming. The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells. It is also a little inconvenient for business; and the business services in the hotel are not comparable to those in a Hyatt or a Marriott. But the tradeoff is a real sense of place, something you can't get in other cities or in Seattle's uptown hotels.

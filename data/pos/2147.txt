Historic Hotel just blocks from Pikes Market. The hotel offers very clean rooms, each with a sink, as well as a telephone, cable TV, Comfortable Queen size bed, several lamps, night stand, desk and several chairs. The room I had was very large and clean. The room's outside wall was all large windows with a great view of the Sound. I chose a room with a shared bath. I found the bathrooms down the hall were always kept clean, and I never had to wait to use one. The maids fold the towels and wash cloths into animal designs, such as a swan, which offers a nice welcoming touch to the room. Overall, I found the staff to be very friendly, and the location was tops. Only drawback if you are visiting in the middle of the summer is that they do not have air-conditioning. For the price you can't go wrong. They do not have parking, which you really don't need, as the downtown busses are free from 6:00am to 7:00pm (provided that you stay within the free bus zone). If you do need parking, there is a parking lot just across the street. Right next door to the Hotel is "The Moore Theater". It is the oldest theater in Seattle, and is still in operation.

Stayed here oct 17-19. Great experience!! Location, price and view! Sliding door opens to mini balcony but good enough. Can walk everywhere tho waterfront can be challenging coming back-- hill. Tho I am not a high maintenance person--I can read signs and figure things out. If I can't I will ask for help nicely!! If you have problems with the help anywhere touristy you are not asking correctly. Really--try it!!

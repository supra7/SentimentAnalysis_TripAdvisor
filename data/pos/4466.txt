I travel to Seattle often and know the downtown area hotels well. Got a great deal thru Hotwire; half of there lowest published rate. The good stuff first: Everyone I encountered was friendly and profeshional. Starwood Perferred checkin was super fast and my room was ready early. Hotel room was of an asian theme with dark woods; everyting worked, funiture in good condition and clean. Westin heavenly bed is excellent. Hotel location is perfect for the buisness or vacation traveler. Indoor swimming pool and not tub are beautiful and modern. A well appointed gym at no additional charge was appreciated. Area's that need help: The property hast to be at least 30 years old and it shows it. Public areas are dark and dated. Carpeting, furniture and elevators are all over due for replacment. Room service was some of the most expensive I ever had. Even compared to New York and London, not a good value no matter how taisty. The lobby cafe next to the elevators is'nt open late enouph for buiness travelers. Security is poor. More than once I saw street people entering the elevators "up to no good". I would recommend the Westin Seattle when booked through a discounted travel site. However it's not upto par with other Westins/Starwood properties in the same class.

I stayed one night at the Westin Seattle August 6, 2005 prior to boarding a cruise ship to Alaska. The hotel room was oddly shaped, and on the small side, but the bed was what it claimed to be; Heavenly! And we all know how horrid some hotel beds can be. I did have one problem; I had booked a sound view room; the first room they gave me was not a sound view. So keep the print out or record of your confirmed type of room (which I had), so I could show the front desk. They then gave me the sound view room. The Westin itself was fine, but looked a little worn and could definitely use a facelift. The front desk was helpful and patient upon check-in when I could not for the life of me find my drivers license or credit card (finally located it). Room service was great, and getting a taxi was a snap with the good help out front. I'd stay there again, but hope they do a little refurbishing in the near future.

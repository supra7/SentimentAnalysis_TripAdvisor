We stayed several days for a conference, with a few extra days added on just to be tourists. Due to flight problems, we had a late check-in and we were not happy with our room for our first night. We moved to the new Union Tower for the remainder of our trip and were very satisfied. We ultimately had a corner room on a lower floor, no real view but the room was great otherwise. Very quiet room, comfy bed, perfect for a restful night. The hotel lobby has free wireless for guests, there were also a number of computer stations and a printer. There is a charge for internet access in the guest rooms. Concierge was helpful for tourist information. The hotel is very close to the Convention Center, although they do not actually connect. The location in general was perfect for my needs, close to a variety of restaurants, music venues (like The Triple Door), shopping, the Monorail, and public transportation. It was also an easy walk to Pike Place Market, just be aware that this route is a bit hilly in parts. We actually walked to the Seattle Aquarium and the Victoria Clipper (Pier 69) from the hotel; that may not be possible for everyone given the distance and the hills. Cabs are always waiting in front of the hotel. We did not have a rental car during our downtown stay and managed just fine. We would definitely stay here again.

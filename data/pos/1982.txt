The location is great, 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. It's an older hotel and is not fancy, but you can get 2 rooms that share a bathroom for the price of a single room anywhere else. One of the rooms had its own sink, and there was a sink, toilet and shower in the shared bathroom. The shower was pretty small, and missing a soap dish, but the water was hot and the water pressure was good. The bed was very comfortable, although the pillows were a little firmer than I like. There is a theater next door, so if a performance is going on, I'm not sure how noisy it would be; there were no shows during our stay. There was a band playing across the street one evening, fortunately they didn't go on too late, because even with the window closed it was pretty loud. The hotel has a deal with the nearby Macy's garage, you can park for $12 a day. I'm not sure if they have air conditioning, I suspect they don't, although it wasn't an issue when we were there.

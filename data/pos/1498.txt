Ten of us traveled to Seattle (where my niece lives) for a family get-together. She chose the hotel due to its proximity to her apt. We had four rooms and each was nice. Upon check-in, one of the rooms needed to be changed to include a pull-out bed (this was done expeditiously!) The staff quickly learned who we were and greeted us each time we passed the front desk. The rooms were perfect for a family gathering as each had a small kitchen and sitting area. We were able to meet for "happy hour" before dinner each evening. The decor is Queen Anne style (I think) with wingback chairs and wonderful chandeliers, wood floors and nice area rugs. The hotel is small - only three floors and does not have an elevator. The stairs are in the style of a grand staircase and my 3-year old granddaughter loved making an entrance to the lobby. The free breakfast was minimal - yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, oatmeal packets, oatmeal bars, coffee, and tea - but worked well for us as we were eating big lunches and dinners. There are many good restaurants VERY near the hotel.

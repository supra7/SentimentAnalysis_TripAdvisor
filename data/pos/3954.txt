My husband and I came to Seattle for an inspiring Christmas experience. The Edgewater met our expectations and exceeded them in every way. from the attentive and knowledgeable valet staff to the sweet front desk staff, they charmed us the minute we disembarked from our car. Our waterfront room was beautifully appointed, from the large arm chairs to the fireplace to the comfortable king bed with the crisp linens. It was fun to watch Elliott Bay or the big screen tv from the comfort of the claw foot tub. My only regret is that we didn't bring our Miniature Pinscher, Faulkner to enjoy this stay with us. The hotel welcomes pets and we met a couple of adorable furry pals while here. A note for the foodies: The room service is great, but if you're dining in the restaurant please DO NOT miss the shrimp mousse crab cakes or the divers scallops.

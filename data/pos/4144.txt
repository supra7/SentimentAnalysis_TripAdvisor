We arrived in Seattle and had two nights booked into the Sorrento to begin our two week holiday in Washington. We were made to feel very welcome and were provided with some very useful information from front desk staff..Our room was very comfortable and quiet,we had a great nights sleep and were able to explore downtown Seattle the following morning, only 15 mins walk (downhill).. We enjoyed taking a ride down to Pionner Square in the complimentary hotel car, following drinks in the elegant yet relaxed hotel bar and Fireside room.. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend the Sorrento.. Having stayed in other, more expensive hotels in Seattle it is worth the extra few blocks walk up the hill... I also had the best breakfast at this hotelof our whole trip, and a decent cup of tea too!

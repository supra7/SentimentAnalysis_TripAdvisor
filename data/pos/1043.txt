I've stayed at this and many other Seattle hotels over the years, and Inn at the Market always comes through. The location is wonderful, rooms clean and comfortable. If you want to be downtown, Inn at the Market is a great place. Rooms in Seattle are getting pricey, and Inn at the Market is still a pretty good value.

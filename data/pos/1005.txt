I love this hotel! My husband and I stayed here pre-cruise a couple of years ago and are planning another cruise this summer in celebration of our 25th anniversary. Inn @ the Market is definitely our #1 choice for Seattle lodging. The bed was wonderful - like sinking into a cloud, the room plush without being pretentious, and our room had excellent views of the market and the sound. The Inn's close proximity to the waterfront (sightseeing, food, shopping) and the Pike Place Market can't be beat. Even though I am a farm-wife in real life, I feel a bit like a princess while staying in this hotel. : ) It is a little on the spendy side, but the location is highly desirable!

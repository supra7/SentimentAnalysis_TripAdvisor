We stayed at this hotel the weekend of April 17th. From the moment we drove our car up to their valet parking and went to check in we were greated with wonderful staff and very helpful too. The lobby of the hotel is great with a view of the water and our room was on the smaller side but nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable. We had a city view on the 4th floor, overlooking the hill up to the Space Needle and also train tracks. We didn't find the trains too disturbing and it was rather interesting watching them go by. We used the hotel's shuttle bus to get to shopping areas and the Paramount Theatre. We also had drinks in their bar and the service was great. Valet parking was rather expensive at close to $40.00 with taxes included but we found a good deal on priceline for the room $75.00 for the night plus taxes so at this rate were okay with paying for the valet parking. We will definately be back.

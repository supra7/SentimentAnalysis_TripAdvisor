This is one of the best places I've stayed. It was near everything we wanted to do. It was really close to the Market, I'm guessing that is where it gets its name. It was close to the water. It was close to a lot of toursist attractions. It was darn near next to the tattoo place I chose to go to for my permanent reminder of a temporary feeling. The people there were very knowlegeable about places to go, where to eat, and just about anything you asked. I will stay there again when we do visit again. We had a room that had two window seats, one towards the front of the hotel and one on the side. From the side you could see the water and the ferry boats always going back and forth, plus you could see all the people shuffleing ( sp ) by which for me is an extra bonus as I am a people watcher. I like to sit in one place and watch things go on. The whole town is a very dog frinedly town, everyone we crossed paths with were very nice. I am apparently a person that attracts coversation because I had several local people come up to be and we just talked. So much to say just can't remember all of it at this point. I haven't been this exciteed about a place since I was in San Francisco at the Fairmont.

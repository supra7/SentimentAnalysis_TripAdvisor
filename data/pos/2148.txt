If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the action and will have some money left over for fun, this is the place. Service was great, from booking to checking in etc. Very friendly staff. The room, which was a suite on the 7th floor, was fantastic! Okay sure the towels were a bit wimpy, but the arrangements they were put in daily was terrific. The view was great, fun to watch the ferries and cargo ships go by. We ended up just leaving our car on the street overnight. It was intact every morning. A great bargain, don't make the mistake of staying somewhere else to save a few dollars. Granted it is not new, but it does have old charm and they have done a lot to spice it up. Thumbs up Moore hotel.

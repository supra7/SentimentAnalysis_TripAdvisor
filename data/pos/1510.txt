My wife and I come down to Seattle, from Edmonton Alberta, two or three times a year. On our last trip we walked in to check out the Marqueen's ammenities for possible future stays. Are we ever glad we did! The room was spacious, well decorated, clean, quiet, and had the best bed We've ever slept in. Every little detail was looked after, our room was extra clean every day, the bathrobes were luxurious, the bellman incredible and the front desk staff bent over backward to help us, from directions, recomendations and advise, to making sure everthing in our room was perfect, or made that way, in an instant, not later. The best in every way!!!!!

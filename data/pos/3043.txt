Ended up with this hotel through Priceline (we selected 4* in the Pike Place area). Given the price that we paid, it was good value, but I don't think that it would have been worth the "Best available rate" they quoted us ($179+tax) when we inquired about staying another night. (We didn't.) The hotel itself is clearly older - the beds are decent, but the bathroom was a bit dated. The room was a good size and was quiet. Our room was missing a corkscrew and neither the concierge nor the front desk could locate one for us. We finally took the bottle to the bar where the friendly bartender gladly opened it for us. Other than that, we didn't notice the service problems others have mentioned, but then we didn't really request service either. For parking, around the hotel it is outrageous and they all gouge. Some are also not open on Sundays...not great for a weekend getaway. We parked at a garage we have used before about 10 blocks away (1st and Cherry Street - Central Parking System) because it is only $6/day on the weekends. Longish walk, but worth the cost savings for us.

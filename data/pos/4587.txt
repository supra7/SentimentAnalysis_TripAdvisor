We stayed here after getting a great rate on hotwire. The view is incredible! We had a corner room that overlooked downtown and the space needle. The room was oversized and the bed was very comfortable. The rooftop pool was great... since the weather was sunny. We also used the free wireless service available in the lobby. Overall, very clean and a great place to stay and walk to various sites in the Seattle area.

We booked a beautiful view room for early March 2008 for 4 days for our anniversary. Took a taxi from SEATAC. Nice and easy. Upon arrival to the hotel we found they upgraded us and provided us with chocolates and strawberries for our anniversary. Had a perfect view of the huge red Pike Market sign, the ferries and the water way along with all the landscape and surrounds. If you want to experience the market, water, ferry and shopping surroundings, this is the place for you. The outside roof top porch is a great place to take a couple drinks and watch the views. We got lucky as there was no rain during the 4 days. The room provided free umbrellas. I was sort of bummed being from Arizona and not a lot of rain, I personally was hoping for some. Bought fresh flowers at the market and the hotel provided a vase at no charge. Nice amentities, comfy bed and large tv in living room and a separate one in the bedroom. Completed the underground tour of the old city, pretty cool so don't miss it. Never took the ferry, but maybe next time. Just too much to do in 4 days around the general area. Lots of excellent places to eat and drink.

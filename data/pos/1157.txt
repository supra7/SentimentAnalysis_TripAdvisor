I had read bad reviews and good reviews so wasn't sure what to expect. It was a great hotel....there are a few steps up to the front desk but it's not that bad and when i left the guy on the desk offered to carry my suitcase. The staff were really friendly and helpful, happy to give directions. They even helped me unpick my suitcase lock when it broke and they printed up some stuff for me. I stayed in two different rooms while I was there as I had a few days at the hotel then went to university of washington then came back again. Both rooms were decorated differently. The beds were comfy in both rooms and there were lots of TV channels which is always good when u first arrive somewhere and just need an hour or so to relax! The wireless internet connection was good and fast. The showers and toilets were really clean and they provide shower gel and shampoo. Also get your own bathrobes, which was handy. If you wanted your room cleaned you had to put a thing on your door...I saw people complaining about this but you don't need clean towels every day! Breakfast is basic. Toast, jam, cereal, apples, yoghurt and then there's coffee, tea, orange juice and milk. I think the hotel is also pet friendly as I saw someone with a dog. There is a mini supermarket across the road and you are near everything like pike place market, capitol hill and downtown etc. This hotel really is in a great location. I'd heard some people complaining about noise from the cyclops club which is below it. I didn't get kept awake at night at all although my second room was not on 1st avenue and so was quieter than the first one. In any case i am sure you could request a room not on 1st avenue when you book. I would definitely come back here it's funky, clean and the staff are lovely!

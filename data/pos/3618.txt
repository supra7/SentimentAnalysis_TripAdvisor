Overall, we loved the Andra and found it very charming and chic. The location was great as well, and the staff, especially the guys in valet parking (who you will deal with the most if you have a car) are amazingly helpful. They printed out maps for us and just were very nice and quick and always on the job. The beds were so comfy too. The walls were, as previously said, very thin however. Luckily, I'm a heavy sleeper, but I did wake up and hear the people in the next room a few times, and there are some ambulance sirens to deal with, but then again this was in the middle of downtown and not out in the country somewhere. There is also a nice fireplace in the lobby and also free internet which we used every day as well as the little gym (mostly for cardio) and the restaurant, Lola, was pretty hip too. Very recommended.

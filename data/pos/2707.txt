We stayed there for one night during the holiday season. We stayed in a 2- double bed room on the 32nd floor. The view was Ok and they brought a crib for my toddler as well. The breakfast in the Club Lounge was ok. Nothing fancy but fresh and clean. The roof top pool was not to the 4-star standards. Only 1 change room for the entire pool and no shower in the pool area. The valet parking was very expensive ($43). I wouldn't use the valet and instead park in one of the numerous public parkings in the area. The location is excellent. Close to shopping, dining and a few minutes walk to the pike place. Overall, a good hotel in a good location.

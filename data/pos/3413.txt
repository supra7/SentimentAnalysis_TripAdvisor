A very upscale feel, without the upscale price! Very nice, large, clean rooms. Great location 3-4 blocks from Pike Place Market....coming back is up a big hill, so beware if not able to walk hills...lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Doorman addressed us by our names each day we were there...awesome! This was our first trip to Seattle and it was a memorable one, and a hotel I would definitely go back to! Thank you Hotel Andra!!

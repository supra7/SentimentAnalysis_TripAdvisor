Stayed three nights for business trip. Great rate ($154/nt). Very nice hotel. Staff very professional and very helpful. Beds very comfy. Plenty of hangers, shampoo/conditioner, etc. Eco concious hotel also. Comfortable and tastefully decorated room. Wish I would have asked for higher floor so I would have had a view of the water. Was on 18th. Food on premises, but never tried because so many restaurants, shops, and sight seeing to do - all in walking distance or by public transportation. Fitness room and pool being renovated. Substitute fitness room is very small. Had to get up extra early to get on the bike. Supposed to be finished in late 2008, but looked to be a ways off.

Stayed for one night finishing up a week in the PNW. This hotel is fine and I have no complaints. However, I lived around the corner for two years while in grad school so I know the area inside and out. I love the U-District and UW but a casual tourist might be disappointed by the area. There are some good little restaurants but they cater to students so there's not going to be any fine dining close at hand. The nightlife is student oriented as well. That said, the hotel is clean, staff is helpful and friendly and it's not that far from downtown. Our room was big, although it faced the street so it was too loud to open windows. I didn't use their shuttle and it seems a bit limited in hours and destinations. If you're willing to ride a bus, you can get a lot of places pretty easily either from Roosevelt or "The Ave", which what University Way is always referred to. Call it by its real name and locals might be confused. The price was higher than the Mayflower downtown, but we'd booked pretty far in advance. I'm sure things had changed given the recession of the winter but my wife didn't want to try rebooking. Portage Bay cafe is next door and has a great breakfast. Schultzy's Sausage and Big Time Brewery on the Ave are my picks for local spots. So again nice hotel, but it is out of the way for the average tourist, and you might pay less downtown or in Belltown.

We stayed here before and after our cruise to Alaska. It was a great location. The hotel offers a free shuttle (you just pay the driver a tip) to take you around if it is available. We had them take us to Pike's Market and then to the Pier. They will also pick you up and drop you off at the airport for $10 per person. Taking you and picking you up from the cruise ship is $6 per person. What a bargain! The hotel room had a comfy king size bed and a huge handicapped bathroom. Supposedly Elvis stayed there and filmed some location shots at the pool. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the Space Needle and there are several restaurants by the Space Needle area. If you want to ride the Ducks around Seattle, that is even closer to the hotel. The hot tub was broken when we were there so I didn't bother to use the pool. The breakfast was lots of carbs - but pretty decent and a bit better than a lot of the free breakfasts offered. And if you are driving or have a rental car - FREE parking! That's huge in Seattle where most hotels, you have to pay to park. The staff was pretty nice and the drivers were great. We got there early and so we checked our luggage and went sightseeing. There is a computer with internet in the lobby also if you need to check in with your airlines, etc. They also have restaurant menus at the desk which was helpful when we were looking for someplace to dine. I would definitely stay there again.

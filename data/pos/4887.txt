I like this hotel. It's small, cozy, and comfortable. The staff at the front desk is exceedingly friendly and very competent. There is an evening wine reception from 5:00 to 6:00 in the lobby, accompanied this time of year by a nice fire in the fireplace. I was upgraded to a King Premier room, which had a full size sofa and armchair, a small desk, and a flat screen TV in addition to the king size bed. Check out the closet for animal print bathrobes! A nice perk for members of the Kimpton InTouch program is a "Raid the Mini Bar" card for up to $10 worth of your choice. Unfortunately that doesn't buy much at the mini bar prices. One downside to this and most really nice hotels is no in-room coffee. However, morning coffee service is available in the lobby... along with a big fire in the fireplace. Tulio is a pleasant Italian restaurant providing service to the hotel. The food was delicious and service was very good (Efren). Especially notable were the orecchiette with spicy Italian sausage and a scrumptious pork shank that falls off the bone. I felt bad because there was no way I could eat it all. Definitely a highlight of my stay. One minor downside - I was a bit surprised that I could still hear traffic on the 10th floor. Not enough to affect my sleep, though... I'll be back.

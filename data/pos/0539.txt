We chose the hotel due to the excellent location in Seattle. I booked by contacting the property directly and had a wonderful first impression of the service. I also called back to verify that I advised of a late check-in and was once gain spoke with a courteous property representative. The hotel recommended a terrific sedan service direct to the hotel (complete with mini tour of the city). Check-in was effortless and the room request was honored as booked. We requested an upper floor (needle facing) and frankly am glad we had the booking. At 0600hrs there were a couple of folks in a theatre entranceway across the street from the hotel whose voices were amplified in the entrance, we could hear them on the 15th floor. Gilcrest and Soames toilettries were a nice touch and other room features are frankly forgettable (for a property considered to be 'luxury".) The view was nice, breakfast was great, fast and friendly in the dining room and the complimentary business center was a G*dsend (since I forgot my Seattle maps). One may come across websurfers monopolizing the computers, so get there early. For those familiar with "Ralphs" grocery in California, sadly the one across from the property is not the same. We reserved our walkabout for the next day in daylight, as the area has some sketchy elements if one is not familiar with Seattle. We'd stay there again.

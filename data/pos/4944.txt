I had intended to go with my boyfriend but he got stuck on the other side of the country so I took a friend - and I'm glad I did. The room was neat, clean and well taken care of. The bathroom was spotless and quite large - I am suspicious we had the accessible suite. If so, it was quite accessible - I was glad actually to see the details they had considered in this regard. The TV was in a bit of an awkward spot, but we we're there to watch TV. The hotel is close walking distance to Pike Place and shopping.

$200+ hotel if booked separately, but I got a wonderful deal through Expedia and a round trip airfare JFK-SEA plus 1 night stay at this hotel was only $387!! Good location, very comfortable bed, clean bathroom and friendly and helpful front desk and bell stand staff. I'd stay here again and highly recommend to others.

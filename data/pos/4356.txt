We really couldn't have hoped for a nicer stay on our first trip to the US. We got a good deal through Priceline and were a bit nervous as it was the first time we had used this site, but we needn't have worried at all- we got treated every bit as well as far as I was concerned. Location: as others have said, pretty perfect. You're a block away from about 4 fantastic Tom Douglas restaurants, including the delightful Dahlia Lounge, and not much further from the trendy bars and cafes of Belltown. Space Needle, Pike Place Market, shopping etc etc all there practically on your doorstep. We walked everywhere. Hotel lobby: buzzy at most times of day and night, and grander than we had expected. Rooms: we were given a king room on the 43rd floor with awe-inspiring views of the SN and Puget Sound. Just beautiful. Room was very comfy, especially the amazing bed, and scrupulously clean too. It had a slightly retro/ Mad Men feel which we enjoyed- could well imagine Don Draper chilling out in the room we had... All in all, we loved it!

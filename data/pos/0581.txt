We made online reservations for two nights on the hotel's website and took advantage of the Warwick Escapes package. The package included best available room upon arrival, parking and breakfast for two for $150 including all fees and taxes - what a bargain! On arrival we were greeted by pleasant and attentive parking attendants, bellmen and front desk staff. Our room was exactly what we requested - clean, no smoking, high floor, king bed, quiet room, away from elevator, view of the Space Needle. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of many major attractions, shops and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Warwick and will, with no hesitation, recommend this hotel to friends and family.

This was our first visit to Seattle. We wanted a decent hotel in a great location downtown. We found it in The Sixth Avenue Inn! The building is older, but we enjoyed our small room with newly remodeled bathroom. The bathroom fan didn't work when we arrived, but we voiced our request to have it fixed and it was within the day while we were out sightseeing. Housekeeping was wonderful--very helpful, quiet, and willing to go the extra mile. The front desk staff was also great to chat with and help direct us toward what we wanted to see/do. The streets are busy with trucks and buses, which did highlight the single paned windows, but it's just that....a busy downtown area! We loved the location to the many shops and places to eat. There is such a variety of both within blocks so we were very pleased. The restaurant within was charming. Most of the wait staff were pleasant and prompt. The value and quantity of food for the cost is within reason--breakfasts were huge! We would stay here again---we booked this hotel on Hotwire and received a rate much lower than usual. And we would recommend this hotel to other budget-wise travelers! Thanks for a great stay Sixth Avenue!

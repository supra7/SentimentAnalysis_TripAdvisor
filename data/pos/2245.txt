If you're looking for a romantic weekend getaway...not the place. If you are looking for somewhere central and simple while visiting Seattle - it's perfect! I stayed here with friends for the New Years and found it clean, friendly, and a good value. There aren't a lot of amenities, but honestly of you're in Seattle you want to explore - not spend your days in the hotel room. This place reminded me the hotels you find in many European cities.I would recommended this place for friends looking to explore Seattle an young couples looking to get away without spending a lot. Best thing about this place...location, location, location. Plus, near a Link station so it ha easy access to the Airport.

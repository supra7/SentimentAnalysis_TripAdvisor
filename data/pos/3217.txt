You can't beat the location, you can't beat the price and the location is within walking distance to so many things. We went to a concert at The Moore Theatre and it was just a couple of blocks from this hotel. The bar and food was also good. We had a little trouble with a party that broke out in the room next to us, but the Front Desk was quick to send security to break it up. I would recommend it to all.

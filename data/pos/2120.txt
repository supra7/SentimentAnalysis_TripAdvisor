This old hotel is in a 7 story building built in 1907 that includes the Moore Theatre, a busy concert hall. Not sure how much of the fixtures, including granite shower enclosures, glavanized pipe and cast iron radiators are original, but they take you back, in a good way. Clean and functional. We paid $79 for a high ceiling-ed suite, two rooms, each with a queen bed and cable TV, and a bathroom between. On the 6th floor, we had a view of Elliot Bay. $15 for 24 hours at the parking garage directly across the street. Cheapest overnight parking in Seattle. All no smoking, great location, friendly staff, good value.

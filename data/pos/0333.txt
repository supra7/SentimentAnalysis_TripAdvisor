We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for Valentine's weekend, and it was great!! We booked on priceline for $110/nt We originally were supposed to arrive at around noon on Friday the 13th, however it was Friday the 13th, and we had quite the delays with our flights. So by the time we got to the hotel (8 hours later) we were exhausted and we appreciated the staff greeting us with genuine friendliness and warmth from the doorman to the front desk!! The check-in was so quick they had us on route to our room within 5min!! The room was HUGE!!! Bed was comfortable, everything was very clean and animal print robes were hanging in the closet for guest use. Aveda bath products were great quality. We had a small bite at Sazerac which is the restaurant in the hotel. It was very convenient and had good quality food. Restaurant also provided room service. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and efficient!! Happy Hour had great deals!! I loved the idea of the wine hour in the evenings, we unfortunately didn't take advantage of it, but it was very popular. The complimentary Starbuck coffee and tea in the lobby helped us get a jump on our day! I was nervous about the location as it was my first visit to Seattle, but it seemed like anywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance or a $5 cab ride. If you book this hotel you will not be disappointed :)

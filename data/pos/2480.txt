I stayed here one night for work and really enjoyed my stay. The room was very nice and the view was great. I found the bed to be very comfortable and loved the size of my room. The only draw back was the parking garage which seems to fill up very quickly and you drive down to the bowels of the building for parking, which is fairly pricey but probably in line with Seattle hotel rates.

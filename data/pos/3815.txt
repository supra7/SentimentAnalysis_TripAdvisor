The Edgewater was a great stop on our way to Vancouver, BC. We booked through an online discount website and got a great price form the room. Upon arrival we upgraded to a waterfront room-well worth an extra $50.00. The staff were very polite and attentive which you would expect from a four star hotel. The style of the hotel is that of a rustic lodge which comes off as outdated especially on the exterior of the hotel. The beds were okay-not too comfy, but we didn't wake up with our backs hurting. The bathrooms have been remodelled recently. It included a claw foot tub with a view of the water and glass and slate shower with the same view. The view. AMAZING. This hotel is literally in the water. The room also included a fireplace which is probably really nice if you are travelling during the winter months. As far as location, there are restaurants and bars within two or three blocks. The pike place market and the space needle are also within walking distance.

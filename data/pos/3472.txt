All too often people are quick to write a review about some horrible experience they had at a hotel or restaurant and quite often forget to write about the exceptional experiences they have had. I will admit that I am guilty of this myself. I don't often write reviews However After staying at the Hotel Andra and I felt it necessary to tell people how truly wonderful it is there. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the location was wonderful. What made the hotel standout even more though was how wonderful the staff was. The staff were always friendly and attentive and always went above and beyond to assist you in any way possible. Staying at the Hotel Andra is just one more thing to look forward to on my next trip to Seattle

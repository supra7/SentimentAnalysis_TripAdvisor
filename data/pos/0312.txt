The staff was courteous, helpful, and cheerful; the decor was elegantly funky (and comfortable); and the amenities were nice (and the kids' welcome gift was delightful and just right for our adventures in the city). The location, right across the street from the main library, was convenient to many of our travel spots. Bring comfortable walking shoes because most places are within a decent walking radius, but some of those hills made us pretty tired after we hiked them several times a day! There are several free bus options within the business district to help you get to spots a bit further away, such as the Space Needle, or if you don't want to tackle those hills. We enjoyed the wine hour each evening before dinner, the kids enjoyed the popsicles each afternoon (esp, because Seattle was experiencing one of it's hottest heat waves) and we all loved our room goldfish. Beds were comfortable, room was not terribly spacious, but it was fine as we were there mainly to sleep. We received a very good rate by contacting the hotel directly. We are going back next summer and will be staying here again.

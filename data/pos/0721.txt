This hotel sits right on top of Pike's Place Public Market. Our room (partial ocean view) had a great view of the market and ferries coming in and out of the harbor. In walking distance to countless shops and restaurants. Breakfast room service was great the first day, but got my order wrong the second day (and didnt have the time to send back for the correct order). There is a beautiful view from the roof top deck, where we sat and drank a bottle of champagne. Staff was all friendly and helpful. Valet parking (extra). Can't beat the location though! All in all, worth the price.

We stayed at the Hilton Seattle from August 18-20, 2007. What a beautiful, friendly, comfortable and well-located hotel. We were only a few short blocks from the Pike Street Market, harbor front restaurants and shops and even closer to the high-end shopping district (5th and 6th Avenues) with Nordstroms, Macys, Abercrombie and Fitch, Gap, etc. Our room was a King Non-Smoking. The room was larger than expected, well-furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The parking garage and elevator system were convenient and fast. I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgable of hotel ammenties and the city (what not to miss in 2 days!). We were directed toward the Brooklyn restaurant for our first dinner in the city -- good choice. The Top of the Hilton was wonderful for nightcaps and breakfast - great view. As HHonors members, we also had the Executive Lounge appetizers and drinks in the early evening. All was excellent, especially the EL concierge staff. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on my next trip.

I normally choose Westin's over Sheraton's, and I would have never stayed at this location if it weren't for the other guest's that were in Seattle for the same occasion. My experience began with the hotel in an excellent location. Close to the Convention Center and also close to the tunnel for the bus system(which taking the bus from the airport was a breeze, under two dollars a person and only a few stops to this hotel). The rooms were larger than I had expected, the pool area was well maintained with excellent views of the city, and the fitness center met our needs. The hotel overall was very clean, housekeepers were friendly, and every phoned request was met timely. I have to add that the lobby of the hotel has the neatest tables with touch screen maps and information that my partner and I have never seen anywhere else. The only thing I disliked was the "suite sleeper" bed. It was very hard and I had a hard time sleeping on it and it would be the only reason I will never stay at a Sheraton again. If you don't mind not having a pillowtop bed, then this hotel is perfect in every other way.

Great location, historic hotel with very good staff. Unfortunately the air conditioning was broken the evening I stayed at the hotel. I was immediately given a fan which worked very well and I was very comfortable. I was very satisfied with my stay and loved the location in the middle of shopping. Would definately stay at the Mayflower again.

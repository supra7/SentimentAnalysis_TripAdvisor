Prior to booking a two night stay at the Executive Hotel Pacific, I read reviews from other guests saying it was "very old". Since I am from New York City, I thought it was actually very cute! It is not stuffy like other hotels that seem to overdo the decor with tacky art and nursing home colors. It is near Pike Place Market, Pioneer Place, the International District and great stores and restaurants. I say "near" because I walk everywhere in NYC and the major areas seemed pretty walkable to me. The only thing I wish for is a vending machine of refreshments because weather can be unpredictable and I do not feel like battling the elements.

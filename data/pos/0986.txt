I stayed for four nights - wow! The location of this place is unbeatable, just steps down the hill to Pike Place Market and some of Seattle's best restaurants, i.e. Matt's at the market, 94 Stewart and the Steelhead Diner - all were superb. The Inn at the Market has some of the friendliest staff I have ever met, my room on the eight floor was spacious, huge bathroom and came with a commanding view of Puget Sound. There is a deck on the fifth floor - very nice - spent time there as all four days I was there were sunny. This is more of a larger boutique style hotel with a great atmosphere. I don't think you could pick a nicer hotel in all of Seattle.

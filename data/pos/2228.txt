Though we live only an hour away, we travel to Seattle often for cultural events, shopping and for the fabulous central branch of the Seattle Public Library. Every now and then we stay overnight, and when we do, this is our hotel of choice. The location can't be beat - close to Benaroya Hall where we see the symphony and right across the street from the library. Shopping is within a few short blocks. We especially like this hotel because it reminds us of the smaller boutique hotels we like to stay in when traveling. The rooms are cosy but not cramped, the amenities are good, and the customer service has been fine. On top of that, the price can't be beat. During the times we've stayed at this hotel, we've neither experienced nor observed any of the negatives mentioned in other reviews.

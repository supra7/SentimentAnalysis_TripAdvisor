I stayed here on a recent business trip and had a great overall experience. The front desk staff was very friendly and I had a corner king room with a great view of the space needle and the waterfront (although obstructed by other buildings). The location is within a short walk of Pike Place Market and all of the downtown shopping. There are also many restaurants nearby. There was a mini fridge in the room with two bottles of complimentary water that was restocked daily and Aveda amenities. My one complaint is that the elevator took a long time, every time. There appeared to be a large convention in-house, so that was probably the cause of the slowness, but it was still frustrating.

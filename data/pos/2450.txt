My husband and I took a quick trip to Seattle and stayed at this hotel for one night. We flew in and took the lite rail downtown from the airport. We got off at University Street and it was about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. When people write about a hill to get to this hotel they are right! It is a huge hill to walk up! Luckily we just had backpacks so it wasn't a problem with luggage but if you have luggage I would not recommend taking this route. There is a bus that will drop you off at the door but by the time our plane landed that bus had stopped running. The room was a nice size with a King size bed, chair, desk and desk chair and a nice flat screen TV. Everything was extremely clean! The bathroom was a nice size and towels were so plush and soft and thick. The toiletries were Aveda shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The hair dryer was a nice high powered one, not a typical sunbeam wall mounted dryer. We were on the side of the hotel with the highway but neither one of us felt that it was too noisy. Our first night we took a cab to the Space Needle. The front desk told us it was a 20 minute walk but I would definitely not want to do that walk at night and even during the day it would be pretty long...seemed like more than 20 minutes to me. The hotel staff hailed a cab for us very quickly. The next morning we walked to Pike Place Market. It was about a 10-15 minute walk. From there we did walk to the Space Needle and then took a cab to the Underground walking tour. We only stayed at this hotel for one night, but it was a very nice stay and I would definitely return to this hotel.

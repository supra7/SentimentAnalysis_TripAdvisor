I was thrilled when I called Seattle Pacific Hotel and was given a fantastic weekly rate. During my stay all personnel were always responsive to my needs. I had a very late flight out of Seattle the day I left, and I was allowed to stay longer in my room with no extra charge. All the people at the hotel were very accommodating. I will definitely stay there again. Lucy Wright

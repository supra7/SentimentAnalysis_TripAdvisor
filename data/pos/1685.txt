The Mayflower Park Hotel really knows how to treat their guests well. The customer service is excellent; everyone was friendly, helpful, and made you feel special. The hotel has been remodeled from 1927 but still has kept the old charm, especially with the grand piano that plays in the upper lobby. The concierge was extremely helpful multiple times, and gave a great restaurant suggestion that was delicious. It is centrally located to many attractions, so just vallet your car and go enjoy Seattle. It was great having the hotel directly connected inside to the monorail that goes to the Space Needle and a mini mall with shops and eateries. It is also by the light rail which goes to and from the airport, so you don't even need a car if you're staying only in Seattle. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have the most comfortable beds I ever slept in. We stayed in two different sized suites at two different stays on our vacation which both had ample room for five of us. The rooms are very clean. The hotel website is great. There are also computers in the lobby where you may print out any needed documents, in my case our boarding passes for our return flight. I would definitely stay there again.

I stayed in this hotel for 3 days whilst on business. It was excellent all round. Very clean and well appointed and the staff were exceptionaly friendly and helpful. I particularly liked the small touches; the free coffee in the lobby, free business centre and free shuttle to the nearby mall. All in all a great experience and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.

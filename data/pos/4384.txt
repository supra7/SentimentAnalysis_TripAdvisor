My gf and I booked this hotel through hotwire for a quick weekend getaway to Seattle. Overall we were quite happy with the hotel. The staff was friendly, especially Don, a server in the Coldwater Restaurant. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy, though being an older hotel, the sound proofing isn't great. We really enjoyed the soap and shampoos that were provided. The location is great though parking is ridiculously expensive. The hotel lot charges $36 per night and the 'discount' lot next door (on 5th, the block before the hotel) is still $22 a night. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant during happy hour which had half price bar entrees and cocktails. Overall the food was really good, and the cocktails were quite nice. The main menu looked pretty good as well. Free internet is only available in the main lobby as there is a charge to connect in room. This would be a good hotel to go to on business. While travelling for a quick vacation, it was nice, but you have to be careful about the extra charges as some are just extremely marked up.

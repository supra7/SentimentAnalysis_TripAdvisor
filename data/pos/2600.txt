We stayed in this hotel many times, and we love it so much. Last time we checked in was on December 19 and stayed there for three days. When we got there it was Jennifer at the front desk, what a wonderful person she is. She upgraded us to a suite, we were two adults and two kids. The room has two rooms, kitchen it was on the third room, what a beautiful service we received. Thank you thank you so much Jennifer, you are such a beautiful human being, outside and inside. You deserve a promotion. Our kids enjoyed our staying and even wanted to stay more :) all the service we received was great, the breakfast, the smile and everything. May God bless you Jennifer, and all. We will definately be back again. For sure.

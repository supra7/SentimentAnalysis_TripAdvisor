We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel Monaco. We were attending a concert at nearby Benoroya Hall and found this hotel to be an excellent place to spend the night. Check in was smooth and we loved our room with the striped wall paper and Sunshine, our pet fish. We made reservations at the hotel restuarant and had a delightful meal with an attentive waiter. (Try the catfish, it's delicious!) We'll choose this hotel next time we stay in Seattle.

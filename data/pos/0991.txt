I was curious from all the listings and VERY happy that I picked the Inn. The location is fantastic down the street from Pike Place and the original Starbucks, many shops and restaurants to choose. The staff are extremely friendly and professional. They upgraded my room to water view and were very attentive. The high speed is included and works, but does kick you off from time to time. Watch out at night by the market as there are lots of homeless people hanging around.

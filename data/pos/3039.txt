I stayed here with my brother for a few days. I wanted a hotel that was downtown and very central. After reading a few dodgy reviews about some of the hotels in Seattle I decided on this one as it seemed to be in a safe area of the city and had good reviews. We weren't let down. This is bang in the middle of downtown, perfect for all the things in downtown. It also wasn't on the freeway which other nearby hotels on 6th Avenue backed on to. We were on the 18th floor, there was no noise- from other rooms or corridors, or outside the hotel. It was quiet. The room was very very nice. Simple room but nicely decorated. Very clean and kept in good order. 2 massive beds, tv, clean bathroom. Minibar on offer (not that we touched it with the prices!). Staff seemed nice and helpful. It seemed very posh after having stayed in a more budget style of hotel a few days earlier, but saying that it didn't make you feel uncomfortable. It was nice. The prices were pretty reasonable considering it's a hotel at the upper end of the scale. The hotel had a little shop 'the daily grill' which sold breakfast items (croissants, hot drinks, sandwiches etc), we used this a few times, kind of expensive but useful if you're hungry and want something straight away. I would highly recommend staying here, it was very pleasant.

I stayed here recently on business and had a pretty good experience. My room was nice, as was all the staff. The valets were especially attentive and did a great job. I went to their bar a few times for drinks and apps and had a nice experience there, as well. It is super close to a lot of downtown shopping and the market. The concierge could have been a little more helpful, but I was satisfied otherwise!

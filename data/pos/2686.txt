Stayed here with two small children (4&6 yrs). Very nice location. Walked everywhere. Very clean. friendly staff. We loved the pool and hot tub. The view was awesome from the pool. Only negatives-charge for wifi. Total ripoff. Second, sort of weird thing- there was a screw embedded into the carpet (like it was put in from bottom up and then sawed off). My daughter stepped on it and required first aid (small cut). We were given a free movie as compensation. Third negative is cost of parking. Triple Ouch. Still, I would stay here again.

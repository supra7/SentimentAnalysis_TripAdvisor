From the warm welcome of the doorman to the perfect pillows to the crispy bacon, the Sorrento is warmth, comfort, and home-style all the way. I travel to Seattle regularly and have made this den my home away from home. If I am going to spend a night away from home, it better be worth it. In other cities, it's a question. At the Sorrento it's a given. On this particular trip I arrived with a large group of friends looking for a good time. While one hotel manager might have looked at us with concern, the Sorrento staff could not have been more welcoming. That, with the addition of their cultural programs such as Night School, actually made me sad at check out. The Sorrento owners and staff have made it feel like a home. And if I'm going to be away from mine, I'm feel right at home in theirs.

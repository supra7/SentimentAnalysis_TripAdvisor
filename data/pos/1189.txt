I stayed at this hotel in october 2011 and found it to be one of the best i have stayed in, in the US. The rooms were excellent spotless and very well presented and very spacious The outlook was great and the Staff at the hotel were second to none. I will stay there again, and would recommend this hotel to any one heading to Seattle. The Hotel is within walking distance of all the great shopping and the Pike Market was a short walk away. Excellent sea food can be had at the market.

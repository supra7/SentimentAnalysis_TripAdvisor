Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights while attending the Flower and Garden Show at the Seattle Convention Centre. The location was perfect....a short walk to the Centre. Had a few problems with the reservation and had to clarify it more than once prior to our arrival but the staff were always helpful in straightening things out. Also had a problem at check out but again staff were quick to rectify once problem was brought to their attention. Not sure if this is common or we were just unlucky. Lots of amenities within the hotel. Room was nice and the bed was comfortable. Very clean. Elevators were a bit slow. The location worked well for this visit but iI would consider staying closer to the downtown core and waterfront another time.

The front desk staff at Hotel Monaco was amazing, my husband wanted a very specific t-shirt from Seattle and the staff member made several calls to track it down for me. We also got excellent advice on locations to visit, places to eat and places to see while in Seattle. Overall, the hotel was very clean and well appointed and we had an excellent view from our room.

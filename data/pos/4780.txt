This hotel is located close to University Street in the University District. Grounds aren't anything to look at and the pool is very small, but it is clean, friendly and quiet! The rooms are pretty spacious and the staff are very friendly. The location was perfect! Parking was ok, well lit area and safe. They allow pets. Beds are comfy and the bathrooms were clean. I would definitely stay there again!

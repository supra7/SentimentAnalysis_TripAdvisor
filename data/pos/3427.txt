chose to stay at hotel andra the night before leaving on a cruise from pier 91. beautiful decor, large room, tremendously comfortable king bed. tremendous location and walking distance to waterfront, restaurants, etc. everyone in the hotel devoted to service. the restaurant in the hotel: "LOLA" is fantastic...make reservations in advance as it is packed.

Just stayed at this hotel for two nights on business. This is a huge place next to the convention center. The lobby and all the facilities are very nice and new. The room was average size but with all new furniture etc. It is in a great location for most on business. Room service was prompt and with good food. My issues involved actually getting a person to help you with anything you might need. When I arrived around 6pm there was one person working a very long check in line. Seemed light for a hotel that large. Later I asked for more towels, nobody showed. There were two crakers on the floor when arrived and they were there when I left. Wonder if they are still there? I would stay here again, it works very well for business.

My wife and I absolutely loved our stay at Inn at the Market. All the staff at the front desk are so friendly and helpful. We called before our trip and Maria the staff was so helpful over the phone to give us travel and transportation information. Taylor at the front desk was very welcoming when she checked us in. The Inn's central and most convenient location has been mentioned by other reviewers. We can't agree more. It is literally a hop and a jump to the Pike Place Market, especially to our now favorite bakery La Panier which is literally right across the street down the hill in a less than1 min walk. We love the decor at the Inn. It has an European flair in a understated and very cozy way. The Inn's courtyard is so charmiing, with a lovely sculpture at the center, surrounded by high quality small boutiques. The Cafe serves delicious French cuisine. The manager and wait staff are nice there also. Our room at the Inn has a partial bay view which is lovely. We also enjoyed hanging out at the roof deck common area to see the beautiful sunset over Eliott Bay. Seattle is a very charming city, and we find staying at the Inn at the Market really made our trip so special because of the friendliness of the front staff staff. The cleaning staff also greeted us each morning and afternoon with big smiles and warm greetings. The location, decor, services, and comfort level of the Inn are truly appreciated. We will go back to stay there for sure. In fact, we have already made reservation for the next summer and can't wait to return.

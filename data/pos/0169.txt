I have had the pleasure of staying at this Kimpton property many times over the past several years as I often travel to Seattle on business. I am always impressed with the staff - friendly faces, willingness to help under any circumstances - to be quite honest, the people are what keep me coming back. During my most recent stay here's a sample of what I experienced. As a member of the InTouch program, upon check-in I was assured that all of my preferences had been taken care of (extra towels, the Wall St. Journal each morning) but also received a gift certificate for $20 off any refreshments in my room, just for being a return guest! Within about 10 minutes of getting settled in my room, the phone rang. The front desk was just checking in to make sure that my room was comfortable and to offer any further assistance personally if I might need something. Perhaps one of the best moments was for nightly turn down service. When I opened the door, I was greeted with the most genuine smile I've seen in any of my travels. She offered me the complimentary chocolates, even some extra ones, and then said, "Enjoy your evening my sweet sister." From the "Welcome back" each night from the bell staff, to the kindness of the housekeeping staff, it's the little touches that make the Monaco one of my favorite places in Seattle to stay. I'm a sucker for a comfortable bed and soft sheets but it's the service that makes it a pleasure to be a guest of this hotel. I refer many of my colleagues and will continue to do so, all because I feel that the folks of this hotel truly appreciate my business.

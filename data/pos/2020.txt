The positives (location, cost, charm) outweigh the negatives (obnoxious-to-hostile front desk "service" on check-in, room not cleaned until an hour after we checked in, lack of shelf space or towel racks or hooks in bathroom, room key that functioned randomly). We liked the fresh air from four opening windows and minimal noise from the street (on 7th floor). Internet worked most of the time. Parking, only half a block away, is $12 - a bargain! The neighbourhood is not ritzy, but not at all scary either. We would go back, but hope for a better check-in experience.

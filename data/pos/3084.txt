We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton at the end of May for 2 nights. We had called ahead of a late check-in (because our flight arrived in the middle of the night). We were also able to request a late check-out time of 1:30 PM (with no additional charge) when we arrived. The lobby was nice and featured a small coffee shop and sitting area. It was also equipped with several PCs available free of charge to guests and a flat-panel TV. We stayed in the newly renovated Union Street Tower so I can't compare to the older Pike Street Tower. Unfortunately, our room was on the 4th floor so I can't comment on the view though I've read it's supposed to be good on the higher floors. The rooms are well-maintained and clean, the beds were heavenly, but the flat-panel TV was on the small side (32 in) for such a large room. They are currently doing renovation on the pool and fitness areas so I can't comment on that as well. There was a small, no-frills fitness area in the Union Street Tower. I would stay here again because the location was great.. it was within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and other shopping areas. Great for the pricelined rate of $87/night!

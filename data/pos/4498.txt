The Westin is perfectly located in downtown Seattle, with so many attractions a short 5-10 minute walk away! Shopping, shopping, shopping! Nordstrom's, Macy's, Tiffany's, the list goes on! All just a block or two away from the hotel lobby! Pike Place Market is a 10 minute walk.And the monorail to Seattle City Center and the Space Needle is a block away. Parking is expensive ($36/day self-park & $39/day valet)... but with everything so close by foot... who needs a rental car?!?! We were in a lovely room on the 38th floor of the north tower... with a wonderful view of the harbor and ferry terminal, beyond the entrance to the market. Being so high up, I did need to use ear plugs on two of the nights, as the building would creak a bit with heavier winds. Wireless internet was available free in the lobby, but in the room prices were too expensive. $10/day. If Hampton Inn can provide free internet, why is Westin nickel and diming on a service that modern customers have come to expect. Room service was good... dinner in the restaurant was hit or miss (one of the best entrees of our trip, and one of the worst). The week day staff was fantastic... pleasant, accommodating, going the extra step to ensure we felt taken care of, and not just another face in the crowd. Especially John, at the valet service.

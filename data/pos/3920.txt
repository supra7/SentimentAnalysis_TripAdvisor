The first time we stayed at Edgewater was for New Year's celebration 2009 and did it again last year, same dates. The rooms stayed the same but the big difference this time was the air conditioner wasn't putting out cold air even though we had it on cool instead of heat. I was actually sweating in the room and had to open the window for some cold air. I called the front desk and they offered a fan but then later called to say that they are out. By that, I'm guessing other guests were experiencing the same thing which I thought is a little cheap of the hotel to do something like that considering a one night stay averages at $280 per night. The first time we went, everything was great. The room was nice, we had an ocean view and got to use the fireplace. It was a great experience overall and that prompted us to do it again to make it sort of an annual vacation but after this time, we've decided to change our plans. The hotel is great overall, they offer a lot of amenities like a shuttle that leaves every hour to bring you to the shopping district or anywhere within 1 - 2 miles, Valet, great lobby environment, restaurant in the hotel, business center and gym. It's very pricey in my opinion but a great place to stay. I just wished I had known about the air conditioner.

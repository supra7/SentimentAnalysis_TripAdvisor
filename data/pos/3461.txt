This hotel is within walking distance of downtown and Pike St. market. The restaurant is very good - would recommend reservations for breakfast and dinner. I thought Tom's Big Breakfast was fabulous; but my traveling partner couldn't visualize squid in the morning (too bad!). The hotel is a couple blocks from East Lake mall, which is at the end of the light rail from the airport, and the start of the monorail to Seattle center. Taxis are always available if the distance or rain gets intimidating. The rooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms unique with a Northern European feel - simple and elegant. No bath tub (Queen room); but I loved the bathroom mirrors that didn't fog up! There's no sheet per se on the bed; so you might keep that in mind if you're with someone who needs more temperature regulation.

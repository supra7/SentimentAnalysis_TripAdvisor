We stayed in room 319 for 7 nights in May. It had a king bed, small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. It was on the rear of the hotel and had a view of the parking lot and next door hotel (see pics). Luckily, we did not come for the view. The room was spacious enough and the bed comfortable. The front desk personnel we talked to were always friendly and helpful. This is a good cheap hotel, but do not expect anything fancy. The bus to downtown stops right outside the front door and comes often. We preferred to walk most places, its an easy walk to the Space Needle, monorail and Experience Music Project / Science Fiction Museum and not much farther to go downtown and to Pikes Place Market. Room 319 has an adjoining room, the first few days the room next door had 3 chatty German girls in it. And the last day or so another group of girls had it who stayed up loudly until about 5am. I use ear plugs, so I could sleep, but my husband was somewhat bothered. Take your swimsuit, theres an indoor pool and spa which was great to soak in after walking all day. I found the hot tub to be super hot each time I went, the pool was always too cold for me, but I'm from Phoenix. The breakfast was plenty adequate for us, a bagel, coffee and yogurt are fine for us. There were other cold items and a waffle maker as well. If you like Thai food, please check out the Golden Singha about two blocks away, it is very good.

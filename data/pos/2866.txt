Spent a night at this hotel during a weekend getaway. Got a fantastic deal ($75/night) by bidding on priceline a few weeks in advance. Had been advised previously that street parking is FREE on weekends in Downtown Seattle. Found a spot near the hotel when we checked in on Saturday evening and left the car there all day Sunday while we shopped and explored. This really is the ideal location for tourists and shoppers as Pike Place, Nordstrom, Barneys, Pacific Place, etc are all within walking distance. Only minor downside was that the two "oversized" double beds were not oversized at all and a little firmer than we like. But overall, this is a fabulous hotel and our new favorite for Downtown Seattle!

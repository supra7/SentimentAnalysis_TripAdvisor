I stayed in this hotel last weekend for an event and had an amazing time. I highly recommend it. The style is a throwback to wood-panels, fire places, but doesn't come off as stodgy or old world. It's just super comfortable. The rooms are designed really well - the bathroom, beds, and sitting areas all feel like their own nice spaces. The staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating, and the restaurant was actually really great - which is not normal for a hotel! Couldn't recommend it higher.

Good Service. Would go back again Like the stay at the hotel. Comfortable rooms. Ask for rooms on the side of International Blvd. Since the rooms are closer to the airport, sometime you can hear plane taxiing at the gate.As a guest at the hotel, if you are planning on parking your car at the hotel premises, you would have to pay for parking, which was $9 a day. Beware of this extra charge, because the guests are not usually charged for car parking at other hotels.

My wife and I decided to visit Seattle for a quick weekend trip to get away for our 20th anniversary. We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than just a room. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikes Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotels wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptons pet friendly program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.

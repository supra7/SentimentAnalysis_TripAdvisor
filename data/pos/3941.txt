This hotel was exactly what we were looking for during our 4 night stay. We decided to upgrade to a waterfront room and we were not disappointed! I love the cozy sitting room beside the front desk area, and the very chill bar/restaurant within the hotel. The room itself has a plush 4 post and beam bed, desk, fireplace and tiled bathroom, also a balcony overlooking the water. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. They picked up everytime we called. The one negative is the daily valet fee if you have a vehicle. Overall, it was a wonderful stay. We were close to everything!

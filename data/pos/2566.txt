Although we have stayed at a few Hilton Hotels over the years, this one was initially a little harder to find primarily because we were looking for a more grand front entrance. Instead, the entrance to the hotel is rather small because the first 8 floors are the parking garage. The lobby is on floor 9. Parking is somewhat pricey at $28 per day. The hotel staff was excellent in the welcome and explaining that all dinning was at the tope floor. Our guest room was suprisingly smaller than we thought for 2 queen beds. The bathroom was especially 'tight'. Yet overall the room was very clean and showed very little wear. Nice flat-screen tv with good decor throughout. We had the continental breakfast whcih was excellent. Available was the large sausage, scrambled eggs, muffins, juice, coffee, thcik slices of bacon and even slices of salmon. The view of the city from the restaurant was not bad either. In all, we have a peaceful stay.

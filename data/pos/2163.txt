I have been to Amsterdam numerous times over the past 6 years, and the western canal belt / night streets area is my favorite area of the city. Beautiful canals, nice boutiques, cafes, higher quality restaurants, etc. Miauw Suites is a unique property with 4 rooms of different design. I stayed 2 nights in the souterrain suite, and 1 night in the white room. The souterrain suite is a good choice if you want your own kitchen, and separate living space. The white room, despite being smaller, was somehow even more charming with the high windows and canal view. You get a little more street noise in the white room, but I am sensitive to noise, and it did not bother me. I slept great in both, and I would stay in either room again. If you want to feel like you have your own apartment in what I consider to be the best area of the city for walking along the canals, this is a great option. In this area of the city I have also stayed in hotel ambassade, and hotel estherea. My personal preference is Miauw out of those three choices, but Ambassade is also a good property. Miauw is a good choice for couples who want some privacy and do not need a concierge service.

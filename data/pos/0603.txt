As frequent visitors to the Seattle area, my wife and I have stayed here many times and each time the experience is better. It really is right at the Pike's Market with all of the fun that is associated. The Inn at the Market is a super clean hotel with a great staff. It's a Must stay hotel for anyone looking to get right down into the Seattle experience. Great food close by!

Stayed here with 2 friends after booking on Hotwire for $96 US plus tax. I called the hotel to inquire whether a room with 2 queens was available. The agent said no, but would make a note on the file for us - I said we'd be fine with a rollaway too. The hotel was centrally located downtown, with a Starbucks next door, and there was the usual Kimpton wine reception in the lobby from 5-6pm, which was great after shopping! Aveda bath amenities (always appreciated!) and an adequate, if small, fitness room downstairs. We managed to avoid the $40/night (!!) parking charge by finding free street parking (after 6pm Sat) around the corner. Staff seemed friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and tasteful - love the goldfish in the elevator lobby, too! My only complaints: 1) not good sound-prooing: you can hear pipes running and doors slamming all night, and the vacuuming early on a Sunday was not appreciated; and 2) when we actually received a room with 2 queens (which were more like doubles), I did not expect to be charged $30 extra for this on my credit card... no one told me on check-in, and I did not get a printed receipt on check-out, I only discovered it 3 days later when looking at my statement online. In my opinion they DEFINITELY should have asked us if we wanted to pay $30 extra for the "upgrade" - it kind of defeated the purpose of the cheap Hotwire rate. Anyway, I'd stay again if I got a good deal, but just be warned about those extra fees... they can add up!

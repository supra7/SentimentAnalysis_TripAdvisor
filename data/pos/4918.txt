I've stayed here a few times and always enjoy my stay. Be sure to ask for a room that looks out on the park because there are a few interior rooms that are on the alley and early morning noise can be an issue. The restaurant is one of my favorites in the Kimpton chain. I love sitting at the counter, essentially in the kitchen, and talking with the chefs.

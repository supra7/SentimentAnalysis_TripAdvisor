We spent three nights in a wonder suite which was basically a one bedroom designer apartment . We usually stay at the Amstel or the Grand and this was very special as well. Of course you don't have all the help of a fine hotel but the location is top notch and you really experience the best of Amsterdam. I loved the 9 streets area which surrounds the apartment. I would go for the larger suite which is the whole floor of two attached town houses. The bathroom is smallish but really there are so many pluses like the all white interior and cool furniture and lamps; it all looks like an apartment you find in designer magazines. The kitchen was amazing and very elegant and cool. Also included is a Mac and internet which makes everything so much easier. Also I should mention you will have to tackle very steep stairs with your luggage so keep this in mind before booking. We would be definitely staying again. Our friends were staying nearby and they were very impressed by the place and the price. Really really nice!, I highly recommendy the Miauw Suites for a fantastic and classy experience of the best of Amsterdam.

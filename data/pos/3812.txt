We stayed at the Edgewater for one night in January 2011 and had a wonderful visit. We stayed on the top floor and had an amazing view -- water, mountains and downtown. The sunset was spectacular. We had a balcony and fire place. The room was compact but beautiful. All in all, we can't wait to come back!

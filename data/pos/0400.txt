Hotel location, decor, service and comfort level were all excellent. Great quality was consistent with other Kimpton properties. Typical of Kimpton, they had lots of unique special touches  giraffe and leopard print bath robes, funky room decor, and even a live goldfish in our room (ours came with a little sign that informed us that his name was "Matt"). They seemed to have a bit of a goldfish theme going on throughout the hotel, which was kind of cute. The room and bed were very comfortable and it had remarkably soft sheets. Ours was a "King Deluxe" room and it was bigger than your average hotel room. We had a gloomy view of an office building directly next door, but we didn't pay for a view room, so I can't hold it against them. Sound seemed to travel between the rooms quite easily. We had the misfortune of having a room full of kids next door, but the front desk responded very well by moving the kids to a different part of the hotel, rather than moving us. The only thing that I didn't like about the Hotel Monaco was the $27 per day valet parking charge, which is the highest I can remember paying anywhere. Overall, it's the best boutique hotel that we've stayed at yet in Seattle. We will definitely stay again.

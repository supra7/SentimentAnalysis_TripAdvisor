I'd had a very long and tiring journey from London, but the welcome from the Andra's reception staff almost made up for it. Very helpful, very friendly and very efficient - a real bonus when all you want to do is just check in and get to bed. All in all my short (2 night) stay was great. Very good location - just a few steps away from the main shops. Only a 10 minute walk to Pike Place market, and great restaurants very close by (Dahlia Lounge opposite was great) as well as in the hotel itself. Room was large and tastefully decorated - subtle and relaxed. Very useful kitchen area with sink. Bathroom was a bit small though. Bed was absolutely fantastic - perhaps the best I have stayed in. Room was very clean. The only drawback was that my room overlooked a building site, and the work started quite early each morning. Not really the fault of the hotel, and it did get me up out of bed I suppose, but could have done without it. All in all I would thoroughly recommend the Andra if you are staying in Seattle.

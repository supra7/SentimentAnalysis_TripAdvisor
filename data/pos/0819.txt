We stayed for one night at the Inn in downtown Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I would highly recommend the hotel for it's beautifully appointed rooms, superior staff, and fun location. Located right above the market we could watch the action on the street and out in Elliot Bay from our room. Our room was so beautiful and comfortable, we didn't want to leave. We even enjoyed in-room massages on the morning of our departure. Dinner at The Pink Door and breakfast at Bacco Bistro just steps from the hotel are also highly recommended. My only comment/recommendation is that the hairdryer provided in the bathroom was pretty low quality, the same model you'd expect to find in a 1-star hotel. I would have expected something a tad better in the hotel of this caliber.

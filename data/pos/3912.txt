I had an opportunity to enjoy a stay at the Edgewater in Seattle in March for an overnight before flying out of SEATAC. I travelled to Seattle on the Clipper so the location couldn't have been better. Just a 3 minute walk from the dock. While I was "aware' of the Edgewater and its past claim to fame (Beatles fishing from the window) I was completely blown away by the Pacific Northwest theme they have going on. It reminded me of the Doug Fir in Portland. My room was in great shape, spacious and had all I could ask for. I enjoyed the comfy chairs, fireplace and a really great bathroom. The complimentary internet access in the biz centre sufficed for my boarding pass printing and the bellman etc were all helpful. On checkin I witnessed the front desk clerk deal with a difficult situation with grace. Luckily I didn't have to park as every hotel in Seattle charges horrific nightly parking rates. The $30 nightly parking charge is actually less than many others I have stayed in most of Seattle's downtown hotels and I really enjoyed the Edgewater.

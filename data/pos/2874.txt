I stay here for business in Seattle on a frequent basis. The rooms are quite good for a Sheraton. About as good as any I have stayed at in the US, and definitely in the top 10% of US Sheratons. Good bed and bath, nothing worn out, etc. The gym is brand new and it is the reason I stay here instead of at the W Seattle. The rates are good and sometimes there are "shopping package" that offer $100 gift cards to Macy's for totally normal rates. The only problem I have encountered is with room service. They consistently deliver 5-10 minutes outside of the delivery window, and they never seem to think it's a problem. When you call they say that your food is on the way. They don't apologize for lateness, and they don't offer credits.

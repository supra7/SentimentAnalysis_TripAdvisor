I recently spent my 60th b-day at the Inn at the Market. I spent days searching through the list of hotels trying to find the perfect one. I wanted to wake up in a special hotel since I was really dreading this birthday. The minute we walked in the room we knew we were in the right place. The accomodations are huge and everything has a touch of class. The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up. I am a travel agent and would highly recommend this hotel. Linda Lawrence

We stayed at The Westin for a conference. We had an outstanding view, with a nice quiet room. We were very surprised at the quality of the room, given the price, which was much lower other conference hotels. The Westin is within an easy walk of Pike's Place, the Aquarium and shopping. It is also near the monorail. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

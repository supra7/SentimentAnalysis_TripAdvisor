I admit that I panicked when I saw the lobby. It definitely needs massive re-modeling of all public areas and some new outfits for the staff wouldnt hurt (one of them had a torn jacket). But  the room was great  lots of space and very comfortable (just the bath was way too simple  if the shower head was new and could have some options for massage it would have been great). We got a newspaper to our room and the location is awesome  the Airporter stops right there and its within a walking distance from everything. The staff was supper nice especially the concierges (Joe and Isaiah, if I got the names right) who had good recommendations.

We have stayed in many hotels in downtown Seattle. We go several times a year to catch some entertainment or just to get away. The Hotel Andra is the BEST place we have stayed. Fantastic location, great specials on rates, terrific friendly staff and very clean contemporary rooms. Loved the bar and all the adjacent restaurants. Can hardly wait to go back!

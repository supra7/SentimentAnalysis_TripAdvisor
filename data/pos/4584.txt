We stayed here for seven nights. We had such a long stay, they brought us a mini fridge when we asked. They provided complementary water daily. The housekeeping otherwise was just OK. I am not sure if they vacuumed our room for the entire 7 days! But the beds were always fresh. The beds were quite comfortable. The internet connect in the room had a few blips, but the hotel was great in fixing it. The room was a good size. The hotel has a pool, but to get there from the tour we were in, you would have to pass through the lobby in your bathingsuit. We were approached by an aggressive bum outside the hotel. Minus the homeless, the location was otherwise great. You could walk to everything. The lobby was nice and comfortable.

After a lunatic 20000+ miles of flying in the space of a few days, I had a night to kill in Seattle before an early trans-con flight back to NYC. Couldnt last out all night as was the original plan, so needed a hotel, and had none prebooked. This place was recommended to me , and was just a block or so from the excellent irish pub (kells) I just happened to have ended up in. Just one room left, at $220 inc tax. Excellent friendly staff, lovely decor, big rooms (im used to NYC so a rabbit hutch will seem big , but these were indeed spacious). Great views out over the water and it has free wi-fi, you just need to ask at reception for the access code. Place seemed spotless and nicely decorated, and more individual then the usual bland chain hotels that sadly prevail. The area felt fine-in the limited time I was there it seemed safe and near to bars, shops and the usual stuff. No drunken noise from the street either. It was very quiet, very comfortable and I slept well.Normally I like to add pictures and more detail to reviews, but due to the length of stay (or lack of it) I can't this time- sorry! When I return to Seattle this will be up there at the top of the list of hotels to use. Give it a try!

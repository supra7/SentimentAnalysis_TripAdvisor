We stayed at the Quality Inn while attending the AFBF meeting. The staff at the front desk knew most our destinations and had maps to draw walking routes on for us. As no Seattle streets go straight for long, the maps were very helpful! The breakfast host was fantastic. We stayed four nights and my husband said goodbye to him on the third morning, saying our plane left too early to eat the next morning. No problem, the young man said, I will come in early and you can still have breakfast. We love that kind of service! And the hot breakfasts made for a great start to our days. Friends of ours also stayed at this hotel. She had left her cane at home, and the hotel loaned her one for the duration of our trip. Again, I think that is above and beyond service. For $87 a night, we were treated like royalty with great breakfasts, helpful front desk people, and nicely made up rooms each night with out personal hot tub (the hotel pool was gorgeous, too).

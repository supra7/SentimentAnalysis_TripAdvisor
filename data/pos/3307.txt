The Sixth Avenue Inn was a good deal for the happening downtown Seattle area. It is within walking distance of almost anything you would want to see or do making it safe to party without worrying about who is going to drive. The rooms are incredibly outdated but if you can see past the decor, this is your hotel. The bells and whistles are kept to a minimum, which may be why the price is lower than some of the larger hotels. The restaurant on the lower level is a cool spot to grab a bite and drinks. The ambiance on the bar side is is a lot like the bar in the movie National Lampoon's Vacation. Dark yet comfortable. If the fire is not lit, ask them to...it makes it so much better for late night drinks. Be sure to leave extra time when checking out as a lot of people tend to leave around the same time and the one person behind the desk gets busy fast.

We just returned from a mini getaway and needed someplace to stay in the downtown area for 1 night. We found the desk clerk very helpful in getting us settled and to arrange parking. The rooms are small but quite cozy and the bed was very comfortable. Again the bathroom is quite small but adequate. I would book into this hotel on my next visit to Seattle.

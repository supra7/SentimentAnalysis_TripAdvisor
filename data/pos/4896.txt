We got this hotel through Priceline last minute and got a really good deal on it. Location was great...walking distance to all the hot spots. Service was great, room was clean and nicely furnished. The hotel was nice and quiet. Very comfortable bed and pillows. They also have a great complimentary wine hour between 5-6 every day. Overall, a really great stay.

We stayed in this hotel over new years, and we were not disappointed. The room had a VERY comfortable bed, and was well-appointed. The location was AWESOME - walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The only criticism I have is that there is construction going on at the hotel (around it) and it is hard to get to by car (we were going by address and didn't realize the plethora of one way streets in Seattle, so we had to drive around in a torrential downpour/holiday traffic to get to the hotel). The construction did NOT affect our stay - from our room, we couldn't even see it, but I think people should know about it! Despite the drawbacks, we would stay again, and even pay full price!

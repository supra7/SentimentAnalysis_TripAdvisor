We arrived early in the morning from a cruse, and were just looking to drop off our luggage at about 10am (check in is at 4pm.) . The staff was great they were able to get us into a room. The room was spacious and plush. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see. This hotel is typically out of my price range, but I would splurge again if I find myself in downtown Seattle.

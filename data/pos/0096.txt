We stayed here over Christmas time 2010 and had a very enjoyable stay. The boutique hotel is really nice, friendly staff and great location. They have a wine hour which is great, aside from the fact that the only wine they have is Barefoot. That surpises me for a 4 star hotel. I enjoy good wine, and can also drink not-so-good wine, just not Barefoot. It's horrible. I couldn't drink it, so had champagne instead which was great. And since our group was the only one drinking it, by the end of the hour we were given the bottle to finish. That was a nice touch. Hotel is clean and charming with it's boutique decor. Was a great stay, no doubt. I would just say, for the quality of the hotel, bump up the quality of the wine.

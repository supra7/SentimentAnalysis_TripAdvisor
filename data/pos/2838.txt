Sheraton is connected to the Seattle Convention Center, so what you are getting is a huge hotel with little personality. That said, for a big downtown hotel it was better than most. Location is great. Right in the heart of the city. Room was decent size, clean, bathroom was very clean :-). Beds were reasonably comfortable. Front desk help was polite. Expensive parking: $41 a night for Valet, $31 a night to self park 1 1/2 blocks away. Though nothing special I would stay there again.

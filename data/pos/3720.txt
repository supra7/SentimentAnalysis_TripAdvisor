We were surprised by a complimentary upgrade to the penthouse. Wow! Amazing! We've stayed in the ocean view rooms in the past, and they are amazing. Watching the sea water flow under the hotel is so relaxing...like being on a cruise ship but still able to enjoy land. The service is great; everyone was polite and interested in making our stay wonderful. The room service was delicious and worth the price.

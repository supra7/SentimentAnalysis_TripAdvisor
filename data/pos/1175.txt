Quality stay at this great location in March 2012! Easy walking distance to Pikes Place Market, 5th avenue shops and restaurants, and waterfront. We are Priority Club Plantinum level members so our upgrades to 32 and 33rd floors (2 separate stays) gave us fantastic views of the city. On our second stay, we decided to stay and eat at the hotel's restautant, the Regatta. My wife had the Mahi Mahi and I had the pork tenderloin. We did not have very high expectations because it's the hotel's restaurant. To our pleasant surprise, the food was outstanding! The Mahi Mahi was much better than the same fish we had at a very nice restaurant on the waterfront. I don't usually write tripadvisor reports, but I really wanted to do so and complement the hotel and restaurant team! Enjoy your stay!

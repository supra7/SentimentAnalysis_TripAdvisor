First of all let me say that the location is not to be believed. Literally steps from the Pike Place Market and close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The first night here was a bit rough as we had a city view room (only room available at the time of my reservation). Well, it's not a view as much as a room facing 1st street. It was very loud. Traffic noise until way past 1am! Needless to say I was "Sleepless in Seattle". The next morning I called the front desk and luckily they were able to move us to a "Courtyard Room". Much better! This was a bigger room and quiet. The rooms are comfortable and modest in size-the bed was excellent. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. There is no gym or pool on the property which is a negative for my family but they do give you a free pass to a local gym. Coffee and tea are provided in the lobby in the morning and apples and cookies are on a plate by the front desk in the afternoon. There are 2 restaurants you can order room service from but no children's menu or child friendly food. Luckily, there are so many restaurants close by we were able to get what we needed. Nice rooftop patio area to enjoy the view. I guess this review is fairly neutral-It's a nice hotel BUT...after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor I guess I was just expecting more.

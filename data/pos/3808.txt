We stayed here following a wet, miserable, two day ride to Conquer Cancer from Vancouver. I was filthy from the ride and soaking wet but was welcomed warmly and treated with great kindness. Our room was great - comfortable bed, quiet (even with the railway - you could hardly hear the trains), beautiful washroom and very 'spa' like and excellent service. We had a great stay and will stay again.

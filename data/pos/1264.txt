I took a trip to Seattle for a weekend in September with my wife and some friends and stayed in the Crowne Plaza. We were looking for an inexpensive place to stay in downtown Seattle with a good location and clean/comfortable accomodations. We booked the Crowne Plaza through Hotwire for a great place and were pleasantly surprised. The location was very central to lots of great restaurants and shopping and the room was very clean on comfortable - exactly what you would expect for any Crowne Plaza. My only complaint would be that the hotel was a little bit dated but given the price this was not a big deal. Defintely no complaints - would return to this hotel.

Unfortunately we never got to stay at the Inn at the Market. After flying from Montreal all day we arrived tired, only to be told that they were overbooked and we had to go elsewhere for our overnight stop in Seattle. The front desk told us they had arranged a room at the Alexis Hotel and the cost would be charged back to them, and they even paid our cab fare to get there. We were also told we could have a free night at the Inn at the Market next time we were in town. That's REAL customer service!

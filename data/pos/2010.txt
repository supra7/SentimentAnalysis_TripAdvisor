Our family usually stays at one of the bigger hotel chains downtown in Seattle and we walk ourselves to exhaustion, but this trip we decided to try an older and closer hotel to the Market and boardwalk areas. When we arrived we were checked in right away and Bob our Concierge was really super friendly and an all around cool guy! Our room was much bigger than some of the older hotels we've stayed at in Vancouver, so we were happy with the size right away and the bathroom was pretty large as well. I enjoyed walking the halls and looking at old photos and each floor is decorated uniquely. My only two complaints are the hot water nearly scalding me to death in the shower with no warning, and no little coffee pot in the room, but hey its Seattle there are coffee places at every corner. All in all we enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Thanks for having a little fan in the room as well!

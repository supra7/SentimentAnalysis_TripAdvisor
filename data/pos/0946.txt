We originally stayed at the Inn for our Honeymoon and decided to go back for our 7 year anniversary. The staff was amazing and went above and beyond to make us feel special for our celebration. Thank You so much The Inn and The Market. We will be back again soon. P.S. Get a waterview room it is worth it the view over the Market and Elliott Bay is amazing.

I visited Seattle with two friends and stayed at the westin hearing good things about it. We enjoyed our stay the beds were extremely comfortable and most of the service was great. The only issue we had we the concierge, it seemed that most of the time they were unaware of the area they were able to tell us how to get to pikes but other than that they were pretty useless. Overall we definately enjoyed our stay and would stay again!

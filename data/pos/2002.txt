I recently stayed at this hotel and thought it was exceptional considering the location and the price I paid. I could see the Pike's Market sign from my window. It was walking distance to the waterfront, stores, and seattle center. The bed was super comfy and I never had a problem sleeping. Everything was clean. The room was a little plain, but it had everything I needed. The staff was very helpful to me. They do not have free parking, however, if you do have a car, they offer discounted parking at a secure location one block down the street. Considering the outrageous parking prices in Seattle, the discounted rate was very reasonable, My floor was really quiet, eerily so sometimes. But I really liked it and would stay again.

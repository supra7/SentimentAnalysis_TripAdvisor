We stayed in downtown hotel Seattle for two night. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms wee very clean. Just minutes away from union street and 5th avenue. Starucks coffee next door. 24 hour room service was extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered pizza to our hotel at 12am. we had a good experience.

We stayed at the Andra with 3 other couples before our cruise to Alaska. We found the room very comfortable and the location close to activities. ( Just a few blocks walk to the Market and Waterfront) It is more unique and not standard hotel fare. We were returning from the cruise at 7am the following week and not flying out of Seattle until 10pm., the hotel offered to store all our luggage for the day of our return to Seattle ( even though we had only stayed there only 1 night a week earlier) so that we could spend the day downtown and not have to worry about the luggage. They offered to let us use the business office to check -in and print boarding passes. The Valet even got a scale so we could weigh our luggage. The hotel also offers to setup "town car rides" at $ 45 per car ( we had 4 passengers) from the airport to the Andra, and $25 per car from the Andra to the cruise ships. (also had 4 persons) This was much cheaper than a cab rides. For a quick and cheap breakfast there is Ralph's across the street, and a great Italian restaurant next door. The Andra went above and beyond the call of duty, and we would highly recommend the them!

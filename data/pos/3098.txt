Booked through Priceline at the last minute for a quick getaway for myself and my husband. We live about 40 minutes north of Seattle and came over the the ferry. Check-in was a breeze - we asked for a king bed (knowing that with Priceline you usually get two doubles) and not only did we get that, but were put in the newly renovated tower in a corner room! (#1252 if you are interested.) Great city views with a peek-a-boo of the water at the ferry terminal. The room was lovely - very neutral toned with great linens, flat screen tv, huge desk and an armoire/closet in it's own seperate location near the entrance. I have not one complaint about the room - it was lovely. We are dinner down the street at the Taphouse Grill - good food, not too expensive. For those of you who are beer lovers, they have 160 on tap. We could have eaten in the hotel, and the Cheesecake Factory and Morton's were also within walking distance. Then we walked to Pacific Place, did some shopping and saw a movie. Evenything is really close by so you can walk. Breakfast at the Daily Grille in the hotel was just so-so. I always think it's kind of hard not to make a good breakfast, but I guess I was wrong. So, for a bid of $100.00, I think we more that got our money's worth and I would definitely stay here again......

We recently stayed in this hotel for a week and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The rooms are great. They take you beyond the norm as far as decor goes. Really refreshing. The nightly wine reception was very nice. They had a nice selection of non alcoholic drinks for those that didn't wish to have the wine. The hotel itself is right in the heart of downtown. Easy walking distance to the Pike Public Market, shopping, 5th avenue theater etc. The staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and appreciated. When looking for a restaurant to go to one evening we asked at the front desk about a certain place. We were told straight out that the place was not worth the time or our money. They tell it to you straight up. If arriving by air at the SeaTac airport, you can hop on the Light Link Rail and arrive at a station just one block from the hotel. $6.00 instead of $50 for a cab. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone.

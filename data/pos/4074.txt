Beautiful hotel, lovingly preserved with impeccable service. In recent years we have been booking rooms in newer hotels, having been burned one too many times by historic properties that have not been kept up. The Sorrento has us back to realizing the joys of an architectural gem. Beautiful room and all of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. This location is a perfect fit for us - close to everything, but outside the thick of the action. We celebrated our anniversary and visited with friends in style.

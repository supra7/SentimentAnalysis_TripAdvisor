With a historic hotel, you get the beautiful linens, nice soaps, etc. Wonderful tea and coffee for your use in your room. There was also a fridge with goodies in it that you would pay for if used. Loved this hotel in the heart of Seattle. The Public Market was about 5 blocks and all the quaint little places to eat and drink coffee were walking distance. Close to the museum and great part of town. Would definately stay again. The room was a bit small but that comes with older hotels. They had a restaurant that we did not eat at, but seemed nice and a separate bar that of course with hotels, you will pay a much higher price for. The staff was wonderful and provided great service along with providing needed directions.

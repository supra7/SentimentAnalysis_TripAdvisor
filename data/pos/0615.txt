I have stayed at the Inn at the Market on more than one occasion, mainly because I enjoy being close to the Public Market when I am in Seattle. This is an older "boutique" hotel, so the rooms are not exactly large, but they are kept clean and tidy, although the furnishing are a bit dated but are in keeping with the style of the hotel. The front desk staff for the most part is quite helpful, especially at arranging a limo (at a good price) to and from the airport or for other excursions. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side (average room is probably about $250 a night), but if you are lucky enough to get a room with a view of the market and Elliott Bay, then it's worth it. If you get a "garden view" (which may mean a view of a brick wall) then not so much. The best aspect of this hotel is its location!

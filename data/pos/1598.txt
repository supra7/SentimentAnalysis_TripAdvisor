We were so lucky to attend a wedding on New Year's Eve at the Mayflower. Everything was wonderful from the moment we stepped out of the car in valet. They recognized the bride and everyone from valets to the front desk to waiters made sure to congratulate her. The front desk was very helpful with our early check-in requests too. I wish that I could remember names of the fabulous people who helped us! Kim at Oliver's was amazing and Andrew from events was great. The only issue that we had in our 4 day stay was a snippy comment from a 20-something staff member (he could have been a waiter?) that we stopped in the lobby. He told us that "it wasn't his department" when we asked for help with the temperature of the banquet room. The front desk jumped to the rescue and fixed the problem quickly. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Seattle!

We arrived at 10 am, fresh from an Alaskan Cruise and were delighted to find that our room was ready for us to occupy. Check-in was quick and efficient, no difficulty finding our reservation, and Reception staff friendly and efficient. Room was spotless and well equipped , but could really have done with having to bed-side cabinets and reading-lights. this apart the only other minor criticism for a couple of Brits was that there were no tea making facilities other than in a coffee filter-maker. these do produce tea (of a sort) but not what Brits like. Concierge and Reception were able to answer all queries about "how to get to .... how long does it take .... what buses to catch ... etc". This Hotel is an older building (c 1920's) and has the character that so many modern "people-processing plants" lack, whilst still giving service for the 2010's. Location is very good for shops. restaurants, Pike Place Market (an absolute must for any visitor to Seatle), mono-rail to the Space Needle, Museum, Art Gallery. We would most certainly stay there again if we were to return to Seattle at some future time.

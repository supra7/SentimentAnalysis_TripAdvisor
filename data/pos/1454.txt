I stayed at the Inn at Virginia Mason before and after surgery. The staff was very kind and helpful. The on-site restaurant was good and service was excellent. The room was small, especially the bathroom, but the price was very reasonable. Parking is extra but convenient. I would stay there again, since it was very quiet. Just what a post surgery patient needed.

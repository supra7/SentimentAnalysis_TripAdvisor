We had a very nice stay in Seattle at the Warwick, I would stay here again. The location is excellent for shopping and doing all the touristy things you will want to do, with an awesome grocery store across the street called Ralph's . We had a nice room facing the Space Needle which I would highly recommend asking for, as we also saw some rooms from the outside that I would not want to be in as the view would be non-existent. My only gripe was a couple of the front desk staff were very un-informed about the area and directions etc which I found highly unprofessional. But over all good place and enjoyable.

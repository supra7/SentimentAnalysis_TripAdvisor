Great neighborhood hotel in charming Queen Anne district. Many local restaurants around. Staff very friendly; high-end local bath products provided; free wi-fi in the rooms is very reliable; 24 hour grocery store around the corner and in-room kitchens made up for no breakfast in the hotel. Cons: 10 minutes walk from the monorail to downtown; shower head is too low for average height adults; bathroom facilities need renovation; street noise.

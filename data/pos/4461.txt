We stayed at the Westin for the two nights we were in Seattle. Asked for a room with a view and they delivered! The hotel was clean. Gym was large for a hotel gym- and had TVs for all of the cardio equipment. Short walk to the monorail to take you to the space needle and within walking distance from the Public Market. Nothing bad at all to say about my stay at the Westin.

My wife and I came here for one night. If you have only one night in Seattle and you want an awesome location so that you can maximize your time here, this is the best choice. They also have a very nice rooftop patio which has a fairly amazing (and often private) view of the bay. The room is quite good - clean, good mattresses and what you'd expect from a decent hotel. I should note that the rooms on the street side are probably a bit noiser than the ocean view rooms (due to the folks wandering the street at night), but we still had a great time. Recommended!

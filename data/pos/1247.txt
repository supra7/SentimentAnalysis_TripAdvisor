I go to Seattle monthly and stay at the Crowne about 60% of the time. It's a nice hotel with a really friendly staff. For being downtown, the location is really great. You can walk to everything. (mind you, that you'll have to walk up and down a hill to get to Pike's Market and it is quite steep). You are 2 blocks off the major shopping street. It is worth paying to be on the club level; you get access to the upper floor where they provide appetizers at night and breakfast in the morning. Very convenient for regular, business travelers who don't care about eating out at different restaurants every day/night or people who want to save money. Beware that parking is very expensive. But, it's like that everywhere in downtown Seattle. The workout facility is adequate. The hotel has provided me amneties when I've lost them at the airport (toothpaste, deodorant). Bathrooms are a little dated but they are clean and nice (and appropriate for the price.) Staff is very friendly. They offer a business center with internet but there's a fee and it's fairly expensive.

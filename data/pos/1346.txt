This hotel is gorgeous with amazing views, a helpful staff who will bend over backward for you and a prime location. It seems like 4 star and is just a magical place to stay. My only complaint is $27 parking fee per day plus $10 wifi per day which drive the price up. But it's worth a lot to be here. I felt so cared for and it was quite elegant. They give you may extras like unbelievably comfortable beds with down duvets, night lights, clips for the curtains, sleep kits with CD, earplugs and eye shades (none of which were needed) and free coffee and Twining teas. It is elegant and even the food was good there. I highly recommend it. Location was perfect, next to the W and Marriott but I'd rather stay at the Crowne Plaza any day.

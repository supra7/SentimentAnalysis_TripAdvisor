My mother and I stayed here in early May. We had double beds, and a first-floor room on the water. It was wonderful. Yes, the room was small--but not so small you couldn't get around. I've definitely stayed in smaller. The in-room fireplace was cozy. The room was clean--and I'm sensitive about cleanliness. The staff was very helpful. At least where we were on the water side, I couldn't really hear any noise; with the window open, you could of course hear ships going by, but I enjoyed it. The view was great. I slept through the night both nights with no problem, and I'm not a heavy sleeper. The bathroom was fabulous; I would love to have one like it (though I'm not a fan of the slow-draining vessel sink). Note that there is no tub--I would never dream of taking a bath in a hotel, but I'm sure some people might miss it. I don't think any of the decor looked dated at all--it was a modern take on classic northwest timber decor. The bar was swanky, with neato projections on one wall. There is indeed food served after 9pm, and they were gracious about my very specific cocktail request. Which they handled beautifully. My mother and I were able to walk everywhere in town, including to Pike's Place market. There is a steep climb up from the waterfront to the center of town, so be forewarned if you have problems walking. If you want to park in their lot, the valet parking is mandatory. I advise just budgeting it in. Also note that like most upscale hotels, they do charge a fee for in-room wifi. I can't wait until hotels stop charging. I'm not associated with the hotel in any way; I'm just so surprised to see so many negative reviews. If you want to stay on the water, be sure to request a room on the water. Also note that if you make the reservation through a service like Priceline, the reservation at the hotel may not match the reservation you made. This happens at every single hotel I go to, but be prepared, and consider calling ahead of time to confirm your room.

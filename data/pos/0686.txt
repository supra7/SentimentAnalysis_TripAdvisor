We stayed in to room types during our visit. We got a deal for a water view suite. This suite was very, very roomy! The main floor was the living room and small kitchenette with tv. The upstairs was the bedroom and bathroom with another tv. The view was amazing!! It was very clean and very comfortable. My only slightly negative comments would be lack of lighting in the bedroom. Since it was so large, the few lamps at either end of the room did not provide enough light for the middle of the room where the closet was. Also when I stay in luxury hotels, I do expect the bathroom to be way above standard - this one was large, but not with much useful space. There were no drawers/shelves to put toiletries. Also the water pressure was so low. Although there was a nice size tub, it would have taken forever to use it. Plus the shower head had little pressure and was not adjustable so rinsing my long hair took a good amount of time. For the last part of our stay we stayed in a smaller room with a city view. It was really nice - clean comfortable and very well lit. Also the bathroom had shelving to put toiletries and the shower head was adjustable so it felt like more water pressure due to its setting. The hotel overall was magnificent - its customer service was everything Id expect from its ratings. Also it location was great. Id definitely recommend this hotel. While the view from the water suite was outstanding, Id probably only book it again with a great deal because the smaller room was really nice and I liked its bathroom better.

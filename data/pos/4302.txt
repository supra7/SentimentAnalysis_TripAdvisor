We were promptly greeted by the staff and receptionist when we arrived. They demonstrated great professionalism and gave us a comfortable room with an awesome view of the Port of Seattle. The hotel is also in the center of the city, which makes it easier for us to get around the city. Would definitely recommend this hotel!

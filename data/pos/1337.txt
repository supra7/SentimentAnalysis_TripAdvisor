Stayed here for a famiy wedding. After reading other reviews (and asking the concierge) decided not to pay for the internet service. Location was perfect. Close to Pike St Market, Belltown, the pier, and Pioneer Square. The staff was exceedingly helpful and pleasant. Rooms were clean and well appointed. A nice feature was the "curtain clip" that held the curtains together so we could avoid the morning sun and get some sleep. Restaurant/Bar had good food and was reasonably priced

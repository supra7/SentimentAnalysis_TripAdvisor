I stayed at the hotel for one night in November. Without me having to ask, they gave me a complimentary upgrade to a small suite. They also arranged for a town car to drop me off and pick me up from a seminar at the Washington Convention Center. The Convention Center is a little too far to walk. The only negative thing was that the main restaurant was closed for renovations while I was there. Instead, the meals were served in the bar area. Given how nice everything else was, I didn't care.

We go to Seattle frequently for small getaways but have never stayed at the Sheraton before now. Reviews from others that mention a hotel lobby that is always incredibly busy aren't wrong but we didn't find the convention guests bothersome. Our room, on the 28th floor had a great view; and despite being so close to the elevators, it was very quiet. Our room was spotless and the beds incredibly comfortable; welcome after a day of shopping and sites!! The gym by far the best hotel gym I have ever been in; this gym had more cardio equipment than my own gym at home. We'll stay at the Towers again!!

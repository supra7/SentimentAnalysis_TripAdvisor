Stayed two nights at the Hotel Andra. Nice room, location just about everything was nice! The parking is a bit steep, but this is downtown Seattle. The restaurant next door, Lola, is quite good. I guess my only complaint was the odd front desk staff. They were never rude, but I cant quite put my finger on what it was about them. They were a bit indifferent maybe? The concierge was invisible, we never saw him or her, just their unmanned desk. The decor is fun. I like the old feel of the room shape (there is an actual closet!) but the fixtures are all modern. I will stay here again but perhaps on a higher floor. The third floor was fine with the fan going. We didn't notice the traffic noise at all! Also next time, I will get better price on the room! While we were at the front a person called in and was quoted a price way lower than what we paid! I guess I should have pushed the issue then and there, but we had such a nice time I didn't want to rock the boat!

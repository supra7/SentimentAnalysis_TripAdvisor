We do priceline most the time and quite often get placed at the Westin and are happy with it. The location is great, so is the view. You can save on valet parking by using the garage adjacent to the hotel via skybridge, $18 vs $36. The Icon grill across the street is great! The 2 double rooms have to soft of beds for my taste.

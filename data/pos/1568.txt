I recently returned to the Mayflower Park Hotel and again found it to be excellent. The hotel has an old world Northwest elegance...not overdone, warm and inviting. It is wonderfully located in downtown within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, as well as Seattle's numerous and very enjoyable shopping experiences. I stay there for business or pleasure as many of the companies I work with are also located nearby in downtown. As a single female travelling alone, one of the things I most appreciate about this hotel is the excellent and reliable staff. From the Valet to the Bellman, Front Desk and Concierge, everyone is friendly, respectful and willing to assist in any reasonable way. I recognize many of the employees from over the years, which, to me, means that there must be some employee satisfaction. Perhaps that is what puts the service over the top. I also really enjoy the atmosphere of Oliver's Restaurant at the hotel. The menu is a perfect size making for a quick and easy decision. I have tried most things on the menu and tend to like them all. My top recommendations are the crab cakes or the hamburger. Whatever you choose, get the fries as your side dish. I would travel a long way just for those. If you enjoy a cocktail, sit at the bar and watch the weather wash over the dramatically lit street sign indicating 4th and Pine Street. It is very mesmerizing at night. When I'm in Seattle my schedule is almost always overfull and I find the Mayflower Park Hotel to be a very lovely respite in the middle of it all. Many thanks to all of the wonderful employees and to the owners for keeping this charming historic property in place and thriving.

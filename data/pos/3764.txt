My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Edgewater about twenty- five years ago. So many times in life going "back" is a disappointment- things rarely seem as good the second or subsequent times as they were the first time. Our stay at the Edgewater after a twenty- five year hiatus was if anything, a few personal shortcomings notwithstanding, an even better experience than the first time. The views are still incredible; the building is well maintained; but most of all, it was the staff's genuine concern with our well being which made our stay such a memorable experience- again!

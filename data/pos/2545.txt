I made reservations online; I called because we were going to be arriving after 6:00 PM due to the ferry schedule. When I called they said no problem, we have plenty of rooms. On arrival, they told me they didn't have any rooms with 2 double beds - which is what I reserved, and that they had a King room that they could put a rollaway bed in, but it would be tight - and he could move me for the next day. Then finally another staff member said to check again that some rooms had been released. We were only staying 2 days. This could have been a nightmare, because my friend and I were being joined by my son for the second night. As it was there was no sofa or hideaway bed for my son and he slept on the floor. Thank goodness he had no problem with that.

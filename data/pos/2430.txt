Not really a four-star but better than a three star. Close to SAM, which was a main destination for us, a pretty good walk from Pike Market, and uphill but, hey, its good to get lots of exercise when on holidays. What we really enjoyed was being able to walk to two great restaurants: "Press" and "Anchovies and Olives" just off Madison east of the I5. Rooms were pleasant, gym was good, and we obtained a great deal on the price. Although I found the price of the parking high--$30/night--we were only charged for one night. I do hate being charged for in-room Wi-fi.

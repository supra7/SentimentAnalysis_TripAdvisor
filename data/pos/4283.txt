beautiful clean rooms. had a room on the 38th floor with amazing views of seattle. excellent central location to see seattle. food at cafe and room service was wonderful. 1 small problem- after returning from a day out, our door was left open after it was cleaned. thank goodness nothing was gone, however we have no idea how long it was open.

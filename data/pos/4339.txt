The Seattle Westin is a very nice hotel. Well worth the price of the room. The conceirge was very helpful. The room was spacious and the beds were very cofortable. Loved the lobby bar! The food in the restaurant was okay, but not really worth the price. There are plenty of other restaurants within walking distance. We did not have to wait on the elevators, like some other reviews stated. They always came quickly. Overall, a very nice hotel and would stay there again!

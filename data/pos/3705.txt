Put the coffee BACK in the Lobby in the early mornings! For the early birds. Pawning it off on a Starbucks in the Gift shop is not cool. I love this Hotel! One of the best amenities is sitting in the lobby early in the morning and drinking your coffee was a big part of staying at the hotel! Waiting for the gift shop coffee stand to open at 0700 on a Saturday was an insult! Keep the Charm of the Edgewater or loose the customer!

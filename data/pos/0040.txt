I spent many nights here on business trips over the past several years -- so many in fact that I (sadly) joked with the valets and the front desk staff that I saw them more frequently than I saw some of my friends back home. It is a good hotel, very well located and the service is excellent. The property has been refreshed over the past few years (and I believe is still being done).

I'm getting ready to stay at the Renaissance for the 4th time soon. I've had great experiences every time so far! I always ask for a room away from the highway mostly because I want the view. I have only stayed in a king room so far but the rooms are always awesome!! The beds are huge and soft and there are tons of squishy wonderful pillows. The parking price is a bit of a bummer but I've never had an issue with getting a spot and once they even waived the fee of one of our cars. That was awesome! It isn't "right" by Pike Place but it's only a 6 block walk or a very short cab ride so it's not a problem. The bar upstairs is pretty cool too. I always use Priceline when I book and I've gotten The Renaissance 4 out of 6 times in Seattle. I'm never disappointed when I stay there!

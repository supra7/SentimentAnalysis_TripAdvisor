I really enjoyed my stay at The Westin. Newly renovated rooms are modern, tastefully decorated and they have a nice layout. The view from the ceiling to floor window is amazing. Wether city or Sea View you will not be disappointed. Check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. I asked to be placed in one of the renovated rooms and the gentleman was happy to oblige my request. 23rd floor, city view was not a disappointment! The large King bed was comfortable and is situated where you can look out of the large window while in bed. Large flat screen TV, small sofa and chair along with a large desk; this room is one of the best I've experienced for attention to details and going above and beyond to make your room feel like your home away from home. Nice bathroom with deep tub for taking a nice long soak. Plenty of towels, make up mirror, toiletries and there is a list in the hotel room "Book" of items provided if you happen to leave something behind at home. It is the longest list of items I've encountered. Nice closet space with drawers to put your belongings along with a safe and plenty of hangers for your clothes. Room service was prompt and very courteous. My breakfast was delicious. Nothing like sipping hot tea with milk while looking out on the skyline of Seattle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys top of the line service and quality.

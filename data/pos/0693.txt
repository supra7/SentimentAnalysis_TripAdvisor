Staff was outstanding from bell men, front desk staff, to room service personnel. The stay was most memorable when my traveling companion and I ran into Katie from the front desk staff with a plate of gourmet cupcakes in the elevator. We casually commented how great they looked, and returned to our rooms later that day to find a message saying there was "something" special at the desk for us. Katie and her staff went out a purchased a variety of delicious cupcakes and had them delivered to our rooms! The room with a bay view is a must, and worth the small additional cost. The facilities are is pristine condition, and the location in the heart of the Pike/Public Market There is no doubt that I will be returning the the Inn At the Market.

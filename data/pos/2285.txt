we stayed at this hotel about two weeks ago and booked a queen room through their website for a total of $85 incl. all taxes. the room was not amazing, but clean, good tv, clean bathroom. we were on the 8th floor facing 4th ave. it is fairly noisy but acceptable. it got a bit warmer outside and the air con is dubious so would not recommend a high room when its hot. free use of the small but perfectly adequate fitness room is a plus, the only thing we missed was a fridge. all in all it was a great stay, we could walk to pike place market in about 15 minutes. the internet connection is slow but its free.

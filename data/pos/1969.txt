We only stayed at the hotel for one night. I enjoy older hotels with some history, and thought the Moore Hotel was beautiful! It was very reasonable, especially considering the location. There were 4 of us sharing a room. The rooms were clean, had a nice view, and there was enough room for all of us. We were on the 6th floor, and didn't have a problem with the noise. The windows opened, and there was a small fan, which was fine for us, but if it was hot, the room would have been hot. Fortunately Seattle doesn't get that hot! The service was great...and we asked them quite a few questions about the area! They did everything that they could to answer our many questions!!! I was surprised by the complaints about the service, however, I believe that the way you treat people...comes back to you. There were so many options for eating within walking distance. I loved being so close to Pike Place Market!!! Had fun at the Nitelite bar next door too! It was a local bar feel, and he bartender was great! I would stay at the Moore Hotel again, if I get to visit this lovely city again!

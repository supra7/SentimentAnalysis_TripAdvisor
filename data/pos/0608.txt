We walked everywhere...to the link station (that's how we came in for the airport), to the monorail for the space needle, to eat at cafe campagne and the pink door, all through the market, and down to the waterfront and aquarium. The bellhops were very friendly and helpful--had a challenge getting a cab when we checked out but not for lack of effort. The room is very average- smallish and the bed faces the wall rather than the entertainment cabinet which is a little unusual. Bed very comfortable, 5th floor patio not to be missed...we happily ate our piroshkys in a light drizzle for that fantastic view!

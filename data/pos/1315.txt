Stayed at this hotel during the worst snow in Seattle in 35 years. In spite of the problems they were facing, the staff were, without exception, warm and friendly, and the service at the front desk, restaurant (terrific food) and the bar was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone! If you have to be snowed in in Seattle, this is the place to be stuck!!!

I loved this hotel for the location as well as the price. I was in room 302 which had a view of the space needle. The heat was perfect, the shower strong and hot, the toiletries stocked daily, free coffee and newspaper in the lobby, and a huge selection of cable channels. The building was built in the 20's and has beautiful stained glass light fixtures in the hall ways and a beautiful crystal fixture in the main lobby. The staff was very helpful and when I asked for a hair dryer and for a room with an outlet, as I read here that someone had neither in their room, the girl at the front desk said, as she gave me a hair dryer, that if there wasn't an outlet she would change my room. There was and will be construction going on across the street but I was there on a Friday night and it stopped at 8 PM and when I left on Sunday, it still had not started. The location is a 15 minute walk to Pike Market and there is a parking lot that is cheaper one block down then the one right next to the building. There is also a post office a few steps away as well as a lot of stores to buy food & drink so you could use the micowave, stove or store your left overs in the refridgerator. I can't wait to stay at the Inn at Queen Anne away.

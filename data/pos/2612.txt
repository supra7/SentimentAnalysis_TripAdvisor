Many hotels in the Seattle Center area are very pricey, but this Quality Inn was reasonable. It had a great deluxe continental breakfast (bacon, hard boiled eggs, waffles, etc.), was quiet, and all the staff members were helpful and kind. I walked everywhere from the hotel, and nothing was too far away. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat!

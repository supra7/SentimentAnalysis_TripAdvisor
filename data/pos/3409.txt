My first time in Seattle and I was w/ a group on business for just 2 nights so I didn't choose the hotel. The rooms were spacious with a couch, but it felt awkward eating room service from the low coffee table since there was no table/chair. Instead there was a work counterop - which I loved because I could spread everything out. The Front Desk and Front Door staff were very helpful and genuine. I love to try the local cuisine when I travel so I felt really lucky at being within walking distance of Hot Pot donuts and several Tom Douglas restaurants. Lola's was in the Hotel and Dhalia Lounge and Dahlia Bakery across the street. I ate at Lola's 3 times, but that is another story I'm going to save for my separate post on Lola's. Convenience store was 3 blocks away and even though I didn't go, a group of people walked to Pike's Market and said it was nearby, but it was uphill. I'll just have to come back to Seattle on vacation!

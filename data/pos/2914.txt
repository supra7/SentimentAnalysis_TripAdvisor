My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle from August 19 - 21, 2010 for our anniversary. We had a nice room on the 24th floor of the Pike Tower. I was a little nervous at first because of all the reviews that the Pike Tower wasn't as nice as the Union Tower, but I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was nice, clean and had a wonderful city view. Yes, the decor probably isn't as nice as the newly renovated Union Tower rooms, but it is still nice. The location was great and so close to many great restaurants. My favorite place to eat has always been the Wild Ginger on the corner of Union and 3rd and this hotel is located just a short walk away. I'd stay here again and I'd be happy to stay in the Pike Tower again.

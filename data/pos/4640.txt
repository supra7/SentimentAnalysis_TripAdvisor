Great location. Staff was accomodating. Free upgrade upon check-in (per the front dest staff). Asked us if it was ok to be in a wheelchair accessible room - we said yes, not being in one before. Did not care for bathroom - water pressure was low in 36th floor room. Asked to change the next morning - switched to 34th floor room without any hassles. Stayed for 3 nights - enjoyed our stay. The concierge staff was extremely helpful - provided maps of city, restaurant suggestions, and Mt. Rainier tips. They definitely improved our trip. Only downside is a small indoor pool on 5th floor - did not use it or the hot tub. Exercise rooms (2) looked adequate w/ new appearing equipment. Lobby was stylish. Parking is pricey in Seattle and was also pricey at the hotel - $36/day for valet.

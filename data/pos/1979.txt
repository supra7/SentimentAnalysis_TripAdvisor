We chose this hotel because it was priced well under most downtown Seattle hotels and had good ratings on tripadvisor. We were not confident we would like it, but in the end we were very happy with what we got. The location was excellent as it was very close to Pike Place Market. The rooms were clean and nice. Not sure you'd want to be there on a hot summer night as there is no air conditioning, but there aren't too many of those nights in Seattle.

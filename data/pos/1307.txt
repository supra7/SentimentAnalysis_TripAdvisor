Spent from Monday Night to Friday morning at the start of our trip and 10 days later spent one sunday night at the hotel and experienced good things and bad. Will not dwell too long on the bad as the hotel management worked really hard to overcome these and were most considerate. The feeling is that they should not have happened. The biggest disappointment was that we had been looking forward to our stay and it was just a little bit of a let down. The front desk staff were a just not functioning and if they could get it wrong they did. Our first night late check in after a 27 hours of travel and a 9 hour time difference was a nightmare. On the other hand Silver from the front desk team, Terry the Concierge and Cristy Smith General Manager were superb. We had a Suite 3156 for the first stay and really were very disappointed at the shabbiness and age of the fixtures fittings etc. An overhaul is long due. On our second stay we had 3356 and this had been marginally updated but was still not all one would expect. On the bright side everything was very clean, a more than ample supply of towels and the usual superb Crowne Plaza beds. The Executive Lounge is too small for the number of rooms described as "Executive". It too is desperately in need of a total overhaul. We were most amused when at 3.30 in the afternoon standing beside the sign stating that the lounge is open 24 hours for the use of Executive Level guests to be told by a staff member "We only open at 5". We quickly discovered that if one was walking to the hotel from the front area the best way was to always use Pine Street and then along either 5th or 6th Avenue to Seneca. The other nearby roads all had pretty steep hills back to the hotel. If you are in the Piers area a good tip walk along to Piers 62/63 near the aquarium and use the elevators up to the Pike Street Market area unless you like lots and lots of steps to climb.

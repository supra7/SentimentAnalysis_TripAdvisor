The Sorrento Hotel exceeded my expectation in every way. From the moment I checked in I knew this was going to be a lovely visit. It is so nice to stay at this hotel. The concierge/driver staff ensured I reached my destination in time for my meeting. The bell staff was excellent. The front desk staff was friendly. Additionally, I loved that the hotel staff emailed me a head of time to ask for any preferences and more importantly, they honored my requests. The room was lovely. I also appreciated that the hotel manager followed up with me to ensure my stay exceeded my expectations.

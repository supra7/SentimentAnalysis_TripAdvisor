We stayed on December 15 and enjoyed all the sights and sounds of the Christmas season. The hotel is superbly located for shopping, dining and entertainment with theatres all around. Everything is within walking distance. The staff were warm and welcoming. Upon check in they handed us a cute gift bag filled with chocolate and a delightful Christmas ornament. Valet parking will cost you $30 for 24 hours....they do mean 24 hours. Check out was at 11:00 but we were able to leave our car parked until 6:00 pm. They also had an extraordinary hot cocoa and cookie display for the guests.....loved it. Our visit was festive and beautiful....the Mayflower really rung in the holiday spirit for me in a sweet and nostalgic way!

My husband I stayed at the Edgewater on our recent visit Seattle. We booked the room through a travel agent and was not sure what to expect. The outside of the hotel is not much to look but the room we stayed in was spectacular. Wow, what a view. We had a waterfront room with a private balcony overlooking Elliott Bay. All we heard were the occasional seagulls. In the evening the sunsets were breathtaking. You could see all the sailboats, cargo boats, tugboats, etc cruising in the bay. We had a view of the Olympic Mountains to one side and downtown Seattle on the other. I dont know about the other rooms but ours was "perfect"!! However there is one note I would like to add that the first day it appeared the commons areas of the hotel were a little dirty (maybe due to high occupancy) but the next day everything was clean and tidy.

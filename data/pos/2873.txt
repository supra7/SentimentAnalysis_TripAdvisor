I never write reviews, but I felt this recent stay needed some attention. We usually stay at the Sheraton Seattle when visiting (which we do often) because we can rely on their clean hotel and friendly staff. This recent trip, we decided to stay at another downtown hotel because it was closer to a wedding venue and we were traveling with an infant. Big mistake staying there! The competing hotel we stayed at was horrible and we felt in danger staying there (drunks, drug use, death threats and fights right outside our door) and the staff refused to help us with this. After not sleeping one single minute, at 4am, I had had enough, I called the Sheraton to check availability because we knew the hotel was clean and safe. Greg in reservations, upon hearing our story, found us a brand new room, in the quietest part of the Sheraton, at an amazing rate (less than the horrible hotel we were currently at). Not only did he do this, he told us to come right over and they would have the room ready. When we arrived, it was like they rolled out the red carpet for us. The valet men were fast, efficient and so nice. The concierge personally walked us up to our room and at one point, acted as almost a personal security guard when a drunk party goer wanted to see our baby. The room was clean and we felt safe. I have never enjoyed a hotel stay more. From now on, I am ONLY staying at the Sheraton when I visit Seattle. They have a guest for life.

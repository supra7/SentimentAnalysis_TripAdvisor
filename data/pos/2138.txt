It's a bit assuming to write an excellent review about a hotel as spartan as the Moore but this place is a real "value for money" find. The double room was large and clean and the bed comfortable while the staff was extremely helpful. But the relatively low cost isn't the main reason to choose this hotel. The main reason is that it's around the corner from Pikes Market, a block and a half away from the monorail and a 15 minute walk down to Pioneer Park. That's all we had the time to explore in the day we spent in Seattle.

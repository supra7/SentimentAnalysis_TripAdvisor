my boyfriend and i stayed at the moore november 2008 and LOVED it. the front desk personnel was friendly and attentive to our questions. we wanted to bring the bed home with us it was so comfortable! the street noise is to be expected downtown; but the walls seemed sound proof to us. we honestly didn't hear any other guest. SUPER CHARMING hotel i recommend to non family travelers on a budget who don't care for gyms, pools, or room service.

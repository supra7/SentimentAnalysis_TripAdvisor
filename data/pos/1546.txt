I read all the reviews, but questioned if they were "planted" or for real. Well, they were for real. Everything we asked for was taken care of immediatly. It was as if the desk staff knew what we wanted before asking. Loved the room, especially the kitchen and small reading/parlor. Robes were provided as well as coffee and tea. We did some shopping at the market down the street which saved us a few dollars on food but don't miss Peco's restaurant across the street. They have a Happy Hour breakfast between 9:00am and 11:am with just about anything on the menu for $6.00. Lots of other dining options within a few short blocks. Should we return to Seattle, this will be our first stop.

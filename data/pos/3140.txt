The problem with large hotels like this is that they all start to look alike. The Sheraton in Seattle is fine, and has upscale amenities, but the room still looks like every other. The same carpet. The same decor. The same overpriced minibar items. That said, the bed was fabulously comfortable, and the location was fantastic (walking distance to everything downtown). There was Starbucks coffee in the room, a safe in the closet, and convenient valet parking at our disposal (nevermind that it cost $35 a day to park!! Zow!). Seattle is not inexpensive - and for this particular weekend in August, the Sheraton was the best price downtown. My fiance and I were roomed in the newly remodeled tower, so the view was splendid. The bathroom toiletries could have been better, but the comfy king size bed made up for anything lacking. Breakfast at the Grill downstairs was adequate and overpriced. Best bet is to save your money and find something on the streets. There's a place at Pike's Place Market (easy walking distance) serving delicious crepes and much better coffee.

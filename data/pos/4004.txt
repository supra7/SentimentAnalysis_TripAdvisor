We stayed here on a business/pleasure trip. We stayed in room 311. Our room was beautiful. However, the bathroom was built for a short person, because the toilet is so close to the wall, that one must sit side-ways. The bed was very comfortable, complete with luxurious sheets and pillows. There is some street noise that may bother light-sleepers. The valet and desk staff are all very professional and helpful. This is a great place for honeymoons and special occasions!

This is a great hotel. The $ for value ratio is worth it.  Heating / air conditioning system is quiet and that aids a good nights sleep  Super comfortable bed with luxury duvet and multiple pillows  Well lit computer work area  I stayed 4 nights and our company negotiated free internet access; its such a rip-off to have to pay $10 or more a day for access!  Upon arrival, I walked to the Public Market and bought a lovely bouquet of tulips for the room. The hotel kindly supplied a vase.  Theres a huge (2 floor) fitness centre with great cardio equipment. Tends to get a tad busy first thing in the morning.

Absolutely love the central location - close to bus routes and shopping. The view can't be beat and the bed is absolutely the most comfortable one we have had. Staff is wonderful. Walking distance to our planned evening activity at the Triple Door. Thanks for a wonderfully relaxing and comfortable Valentine getaway! Can't wait ot come back!!! The only thing that could make this even more special would be more coffee in the room and a hot tub on the deck!!

Had a comfortable stay at the charming Monaco Hotel. Staff was friendly and competent. Lobby is fancifully decorated and comfortable with lots of little sitting areas. The free wine during the cocktail hour was graciously served and good. The sheets are nice, beds soft and the on-site restaurant is very good and just plain fun to look at. Then wait till you see the robes and slippers in the rooms. I won't spoil the surprise. Ann

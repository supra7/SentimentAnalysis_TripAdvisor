We had called priority club to see if they could get us into this hotel using points /2 queen size beds for our family of four as the website didn't have those rooms with points. The hotel was willing to do that. We also got the room with the conceirage level as we are platinum priority club members. We are so grateful to priority club and this hotel for doing that as it was a long way to travel across county to get to Seattle for the start of a vacation. The staff was great, room comfortable, easy walk to the waterfront, tram to the Needle, shops. Parking was a bit pricey but it's a city. The car was retrieved promptly. Easy to get to from the hi way. The elevators were very slow, so crowd in folks! Very quite hotel for sleeping.

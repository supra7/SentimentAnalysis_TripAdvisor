Like several other posters have mentioned, the Westin has an incredible location -- next to shopping and the monorail to the Space Needle, and only a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The room was clean, contemporary, with comfortable beds. The pool is indoors, but it's connected to a nice sun deck (somewhat small, but it was nice to have the option to go outside). The Gray Line Downtown Airporter was quick and only $11. That was great, because parking would have been incredibly expensive ($39!). I did need a car for a day, but there's an Avis directly across the street, so I was able to get a daily rental while avoiding the Westin's parking charge. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm in Seattle in the future.

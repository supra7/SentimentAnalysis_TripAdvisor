This is an older Westin that could use some updating, but overall it was clean and comfortable. Location is convenient to everything in downtown Seattle -- everything was within walking distance. Self-Parking is available across the street at the "Westin Garage". We paid $22/night for parking. The Westin bed was great. Free wifi available in the lobby. We ended up within range of some free wifi in our 28th floor room. Check-in staff was very helpful. I would definitely stay there again.

I don't usually like to stay at the big hotel chains, but I tried Priceline for the first time and got this hotel for $100/night. Front desk gave us one of the new Tower Rooms without asking and they were really quite nice. WiFi is not free - I think it is about $10 a day, but they have a few computers on the main floor by the elevator along with a printer. It was actually very convenient. Location is great - close enough to the I-5, really easy access to any of the trendy Seattle neighbourhoods. Shopping, Pike Place, etc. is also walkable. If you are there over the weekend instead of the Valet parking, simply park it yourself across the street in the parkade - it is less than $10 a day, versus the $30 the Hotel apparently charges. And they park it there anyway. Note - we did leave it overnight for a day during the week and the garage charged $30. Good option - really nice staff - super clean. Would stay there again.

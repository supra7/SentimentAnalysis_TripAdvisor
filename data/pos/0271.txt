...These people truly understand service. Our stay at The Monaco was no different than any other Kimpton Hotel meaning that no matter which one - they all understand how to serve their customers. It is so nice to be in a hotel where you get the distinct feeling that they are happy that you have chosen to stay there (vs the indifference I get from larger hotel chains). From the personal check-in (they know if you have been to one of their hotels before), to the freebies for wine, cocktails, breakfast. We were only to get one or the other, but they gave us all 3. Why? ...Because they could, and so they did. Had a little trouble logging my iPhone onto the (free for members) WiFi, so one of the guys at the front desk did it for me. Then called me 10 mins later to make sure it was still working. My only issue was the California blinds in the rooms.. stylin'- but they don't black out the room for sleeping. Seriously, if you are looking for a "hotel experience" rather than simply a place to crash, take a Kimpton. The Alexis...another Kimpton, just down the street from The Monaco is outstanding....but that's a whole other review.. Enjoy!

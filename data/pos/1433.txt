While I can see the point of the negative reviews I still love this place for the money. If you are interested in more upscale try their other property the MarQueen which is 2 blocks north. Pros: Great Price Friendly atmosphere Clean Great lively neighborhood (make sure you try the food at Peso's) that has more of a neighborhood feel than downtown. Free Shuttle (when it's not busy) Cons: Far from downtown (I like this neighborhood better than downtown, lots with-in walking distance, when you want to head downtown the monorail is a quick 10min walk or take the hotel's free shuttle). Unattractive Exterior. No Elevator All and all this is my favorite hotel in Seattle for the price, hands down.

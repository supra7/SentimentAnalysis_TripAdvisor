We stayed 5 nights at The Edgewater. Our room looked out over Elliot Bay and we loved opening our large sliding window and just taking in the view and sounds of the bay. The decor is what I would call Pacific Northwest. I loved our bathroom, specially the shower made from slate stones. The service was great. The lounge has a great happy hour (if you don't want to spend a lot of money on drinks, do not order Premium brands) and have terrific appetizers at a very affordable price. The restaurant itself offers great food and best of all, you can choose to have 1/2 portions incase you have stopped at the lounge first. The location is great with easy access to many places. The only thing I thought could have been improved in the room is the "drawer" space and the fact that they don't have free Internet in your room but do have a business center down the hall which has it. That's so retro!

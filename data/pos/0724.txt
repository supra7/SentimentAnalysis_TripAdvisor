Great hotel, perfect location, large, clean, and modern room with all amenities, exceedingly helpful and friendly staff, and the roof deck is not to be missed--it completed a wonderful hotel experience, whether enjoying morning coffee and (complimentary) newspaper, or an evening glass of wine and sunset over the Olympic Mountains. I will be back, for sure!

Booked a room through Priceline at about half the regular price. Pulled into the valet area expecting to pay a pretty penny to park my vehicle, and I was not disappointed. $35 for valet is pretty excessive, but what else are ya gonna do, I guess. Check-in and other staff interactions were smooth and painless - they even switched our room from 2 doubles to a king without any protest, which isn't always a given when you've used Priceline. Room was spacious and spotless, with a good view of the harbor and the surrounding office buildings. Great location downtown - about six blocks from Pike Place market, right in the retail core, a couple of blocks from the monorail station. A great base for exploring. I fully recommend this hotel, even if it is a bit nondescript and corporate.

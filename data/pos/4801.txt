We took our son back to the University of Washington and decided to stay at the University Inn. As soon as we checked in we were welcomed by a very friendly staff. Our room had been upgraded and we had been chosen as their VIP for the day. When we got to our room , there was a very nice gift bag waiting for us filled with some nice items. They provided a nice food selection in the lounge at 5:00 p.m. Fruit, meats, cheeses with crackers. Breakfast was also made available in the moring with a great varity of items. Rooms were very clean, nice pool and very close to campus and resturants. All these were in walking distance of the hotel. We would stay again and would recommend this hotel to all.

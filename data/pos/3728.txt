The hotel was amazing. Not just a view of the water, but ON the water. Fireplaces in everyroom. Cute rustic decor, and just a luxurious feel all around. Staff were friendly and helpful. Centrally located. A bit pricey for my taste, but I can't imagine anyone regretting the choice to stay at the Edgewater.

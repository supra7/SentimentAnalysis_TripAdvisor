Weekend getaway in Seattle... I chose the Vintage park since I have had good experiences with Kimpton hotels in the past and am in the InTouch frequent stay program. Kimpton did it again.... Beelyn and Lane at the front desk felt like friends after the first meeting and were very helpful in navigating Seattle for a first timer, they made . The upgrade to the Luxury Suite was delightful especially if you like to entertain friends. The Vintage Park is small enough that you get to know the staff quickly, yet large enough that it doesn't have that creepy B&B feel. Location is great! Easy walk around downtown or about a $10-15 cab ride anywhere else worthwhile. Seattle is not a "hail a cab" city so let the desk call one for you and one will be there in moments. The restaurant is pretty good, Sherry at the bar is an absolute delight and great to chat with if dining solo. On my next Seattle trip (which will be soon) there will be no doubt that the Vintage Park will be where I book.

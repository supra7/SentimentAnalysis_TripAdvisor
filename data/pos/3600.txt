This hotel is a lovely oasis of peace and calm. The service is competent but not overbearing. We were upgraded to a suite - I don't know why - but we loved having an extra sitting room. The decor is uncluttered yet warm and inviting and the bathroom actually had a place to put stuff! On Sunday morning the lobby was very inviting with the fireplace burning and a lovely ambience in spite of the modern/industrial decor.

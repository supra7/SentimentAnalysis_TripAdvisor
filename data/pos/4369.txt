The Westin was perfect for our trip. I combined my business trip with a mini-family vacation. Thanks to other reviewers, I remembered to ask the hotel for an extra fridge, and a step-stool which made our stay with a 3 1/2 year old much easier. It was great having a little sofa in our room so we weren't all stuck sitting on the bed or on the floor. We enjoyed the pool too, although I thought it was overly-chlorinated. If you plan to use mass transportation to see the sites around Seattle, the Westin's location can't be beat. The monorail to Seattle Center and light-rail to the airport are about a short block away. Several family-friendly restaurants, a food court at the mall across the street, and Starbucks, of course, are all nearby - meaning w/in a two-block radius (that was really important to us being with a toddler!) The cafe in the hotel offered an inexpensive breakfast option - coffee and pastry for $5. While a bit on the older side, the Westin is very comfortable and clean. Bed was super comfortable with crisp, white-linen sheets. The concierge was very helpful and staff were all friendly. If you're looking for something more modern with high-end shopping in front of your eyes, might want to consider the Grant Hyatt although it is farther from mass transportation. The Westin was perfect for us, though, and if we visit Seattle again, we'd probably stay there again.

My husband and I stayed in this hotel on a crazy weekend when we were attending a memorial service for my best friend's husband, and we were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary. Talk about mixed emotions. We booked a suite and the hotel put us in the Monte Carlos one. We were loaned a beautiful fan-tanned goldfish named Joliet for the weekend, and we visited with the three dogs who worked the front desk, along with their human companions. The room was decorated nicely (though the couch could have used a few pillows). The L'Occitane bath amenities are always a welcome sight. The room was quiet and peaceful. The wireless Internet access was wonderful until the server went down the morning we were leaving so we had some problems printing our boarding passes. The afternoon reception serves oenophile-satisfying wine from Australia and scrumptious cookies. The restaurant was closed for renovation for a part of our stay but when we finally ate there, the food was good and the drinks were even better. One word of caution on the restaurant: if you are a larger person, do not sit at the booths because you won't fit. I'm 5'6" and 125 lbs; my husband is 5'9" and 175. The table was smack-against his stomach; and though I had a couple of inches space, it would be mighty uncomfortable if the patron is any larger or pregnant. Bad design, in my opinion, though the place is decorated in a funky and welcoming way with metal and wood, and handblown glass light fixtures that you'd expect in Seattle, the capital of the US glass art industry. We'd definitely stay here again for any reason.

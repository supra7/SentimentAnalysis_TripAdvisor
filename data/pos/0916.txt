The service is phoenominal, very accomodating, professional, friendly and efficient without feeling pretentious. I highly reccommend the water view rooms, even as Seattle natives we were wowed by the view. The rooms are modern yet cozy and the bathroom is spacious and well appointed. Don't miss out on this Seattle gem.

We were there only for a night but that night was perfect. The beds were comfortable and had quality linens. We found the pillows to be too soft and it was late (11) but when we called downstairs asking for firmer pillow, we got them within five minutes. My girlfriend loves the bathroom products and still raves about them. Of course the best thing the the entire hotel is the rooftop. A perfect place to sip a glass of wine and look at the pike place market sign and the sound. You can't beat the location. There are tons of restaurants near by. My favorite is osaka teriyaki a block away. But watch out, there are a lot of homeless people and pan handlers walking around at night. But then you ARE in seattle.

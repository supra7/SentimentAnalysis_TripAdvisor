We stayed here while attending the Northwest Flower and Garden Show at the Convention Center in Feb, 2012, and really there is no place you can choose that is more convenient. It is right across the street. The hotel offered a great, reduced-price rate on the room and valet parking for the show, which was greatly appreciated. The hotel was lovely, the staff very helpful and friendly, and the beds were great. I've stayed in other distant hotels before for the Flower Show, and taken the bus downtown to the Covention Center. It worked fine, but nothing beats the convenience of being across the street. This is where I'll be booking for next year's Flower Show.

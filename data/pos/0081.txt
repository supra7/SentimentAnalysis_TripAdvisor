We had a great stay at Hotel Monaco. It was with trepidation that I traveled half way around the world with my nine year old daughter, however when we arrived, having emailed the hotel requesting early check-in, our room was thankfully ready. The check-in was fast and organised. Movie, voucher for my daughter and a mini-bar voucher for me. It is worth joining the Kimpton in-touch program. Best bits:The hotel is perfectly located, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. The beds are comfy, it has nice decor, the cleanliness was fantastic and the pet fish was a nice touch. Finally you can't beat the service, from the door staff, desk staff or restaurant staff, all great. My only word of warning is not to let your kids get to the TV remote first The on- demand is much easier for them to access than the regular programming. I'll end up with a smallish tv bill for on-demand Disney, but I'll put that down to exhaustion and not worry about it.

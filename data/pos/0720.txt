Everything about this hotel was fabulous: - The location, right next to the Pike Marketplace, is the best, and from the shared deck you have the best views in town. - The room we had was very spacious. It had two queen beds, two closets, and lots of room to spare. - The room had a coffee maker, dishes and utensils, and free Wi-Fi, something rarely found in high-end hotels. - Every morning we got the NY Times. - The front desk staff was helpful and knowledgable about restaurants, attractions etc. - There's a business center with two computers and printers available to guests for free.

We took shuttle from airport. Due to a major convention in town, we had to wait a couple of hours for a room. We settled on a different room in order to be accomodated sooner. Restaurants, movie theatres, convention center in the immediate area. Walking distance to major transit center and to the waterfront. Took the free bus line to Safeco Field. Many attractions to see, but not enough time. Will definitely stay at the Sheraton when we return to Seattle!

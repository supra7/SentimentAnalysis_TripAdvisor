For $55 (plus $28 for valet parking) I got a spacious corner room on the 25th floor in their "quiet zone" with what felt like a panoramic city view of Seattle.....I was impressed! Check in was good; the lady gave me the best room she could (no kings available) so that was cool. The lobby is nice and moderate sized....suprising considering this is 30 plus story hotel. Valet is the only option for parking; I was surprised how much but then heard the Sheraton charges over $30....the down side of staying downtown but whatever. Marble floors in the bathrooms, crowne CD player, no minibar or fridge, room service is open until 1AM which was good.....pricing is what you'd expect, but not terrible. Restaurants seemed a few blocks off, which is fine in the daytime. Vending ($2 for 20 oz bottle) and ice are on every other floor, which is odd. There is a business center but it's not free. The Crowne beds aren't as great as some comparable hotels in my opinion, but they look good. All in all, great for the value priceline usually provides.

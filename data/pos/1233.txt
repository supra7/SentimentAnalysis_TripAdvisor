There were a lot of little quirky things about this hotel, such as the elevator lights hidden by the hallway doors, but overall a nice place to stay. The hallway walls blocked your view of the elevator lights, so it was possible to wait for an elevator, have one come and go, and still be waiting. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and some were very nice. Spring for the higher floor, concierge room if you can swing it.

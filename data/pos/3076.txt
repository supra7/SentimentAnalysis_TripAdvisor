The Seattle Sheraton is a large hotel in a great location near shopping and the convention center. Since we were arriving late and staying only one night, I decided to try Priceline, and got the room for a bargain price of $100. We received a recently renovated room in the Union tower on the 16th floor. It was very nice with 2 queen beds, 2 chairs, desk, flat panel TV, and closet with safe. Coffeemaker with supplies were complimentary; other mini-bar items were for sale. The bathroom looked a little spartan but was shiny and super clean. Aside from being new, clean and comfortable, it was blessedly quiet! We heard no street noise and nothing from the surrounding rooms or hallway. I had the best night of sleep on our entire 6 night trip. Since it was late and quiet when we checked in, I was surprised at the crowds and noise in the lobby at checkout. However, there was no line and it took only a few minutes. We left our bags with the bellman and I was a little worried about how long it would take to fetch them when we returned (we were in a hurry). They must have a really good system because even though it was extremely busy, it only took a few minutes to bring them out and get us in a taxi. I would definitely stay there again.

This hotel is located in downtown and in close proximity to the Public Market (6-8 blocks) and Space Needle (about 20 blocks, cab ride cost $8). Starbucks next door, tons of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. I stayed here for 1 night after a business trip in Redmond. The staff at this hotel were attentive and friendly. I was put on the 11th floor which has an "express elevator" - bypasses floors 1-9. I had a queen bed and the room was quite spacious. The toiletries were from London and smelled sooooo good:). Also, the bed was quite comfortable- I slept like a baby. Hotel is very clean. CON: There is no ice machine on the 11th floor, you have to go down to the 10th. This is no big deal, but could be "nice to have" on the same floor:) I highly recommend this hotel. Next time i'm in Seatte, i'm staying here for sure!

Stayed here with a friend, he has a service dog and sometimes has a problem with hotels, but they were very accommodating to us, read a couple reviews that said the rooms were not up to par but was very happy with ours room was nice and clean, was able to open the window with a great view of the water, jack the dog enjoyed this also as the seagulls were flying quite close and even got a few of them to take some bread out of my hand from the hotel window (not many places you can do that in) the lobby was very comfortable looking and although the hotel was older I really thought it was clean and comfortable. Would defiantly stay here again !

Let me begin by saying that I am VERY difficult to please. We had just previously stayed in a high-end boutique hotel in Vancouver, and I was woefully underwhelmed. However the Hotel Vintage Park was beyond reproach, and I have absolutely nothing but praise for this hotel. AMAZING beds, huge rooms, beautiful view (we were on the top floor [11th]), and incredibly friendly and helpful staff. I broke a nail on my stay and the front-desk went out of their way to get me a nail file. What impressed me most is that we had booked through Priceline name your price and paid about 50% of their retail rate, and they still give us the best room in the place and treated us like royalty. Very centrally located (we were looking right over the courthouse and the awe-inspiring architecture of the Seattle Library) although the area itself doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of nice/interesting dining experiences. But it is in walking distance of the Pike Street Market and the SAM (both of which I also recommend) and plenty of public transit options including the greyhound station (although it was my first time taking the bus and I will NEVER do that again...but that's another story! :)

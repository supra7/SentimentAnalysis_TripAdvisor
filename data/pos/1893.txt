I chose the Mayflower Park for a quick business trip after my partner had a good experience a few months ago, and could only agree. This fine 1920s building has been handsomely restored, and my 12th floor room was immaculate and well-appointed, if perhaps a bit on the small side. Nice extras included an unusually large walk-in closet with two robes and in-room coffee from the excellent local Torrefazione Italia brand (not the usual in-room commercial brew). The housekeeping staff was unobtrusive, friendly and competent. I don't usually compliment hotels on their valet service, but in this case it proved another distinct plus, especially since parking (normally $25 overnight) had been included in my package rate (check for specials if booking through the hotel website). The valets were extremely quick to bring the car around when I called from my room, alert to pick up the keys whenever I returned to the hotel, and volunteered to give directions. As others have pointed out, the desk is sometimes very friendly and sometimes more or less indifferent, but I found it generally well-run. And it's worth nothing that the Mayflower Park is in an excellent location--within walking distance of all downtown shopping, Pike Place Market, the must-see new public library, and other major attractions; city buses are free of charge downtown and a car isn't urgently needed, and if you're driving to the University or points farther afield the location is also very convenient, notwithstanding Seattle's famously awful traffic. In all, a very handsome and well-run establishment, old-fashioned in a good way and very low-key.

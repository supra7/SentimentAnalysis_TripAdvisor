Our rooms were arranged by 5th Avenue Theater, and we could not have been happier. The corner rooms are spacious, the beds and pillows simply wonderful - almost as good as Westin's Heavenly Bed! We were happy with the big bathrooms, great downtown location, good service and quiet night's sleeps. I would stay here again, especially at the good rate the Theater got us. We were in town for an off Broadway show.

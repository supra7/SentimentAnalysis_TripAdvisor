Location is great (within walking distance to Space Needle and other attractions); free parking (a big plus), clean, well designed rooms with a kitchenette and even a dishwasher! The breakfast was the best variety I have ever experienced. Staff were efficient and professional. Rooms were quiet. The indoor pool and sauna made the stay there close to perfect!

A lot of nice hotels in downtown Seattle are kind of pricey. This hotel, with a location just steps from shopping and the fabulous Pike Public Market, was a great place to stay. Yes, it is an older property. The rooms are a tad on the small side, as are the bathrooms. But the staff is extremely friendly and the room was very clean. I got a great room on the 12th floor with a corner view. The bedding was comfortable. Room service was fast, not terribly expensive, and delicious. I got a "coupon" for a free appetizer which I unfortunately did not get to use, but it was a great stay.

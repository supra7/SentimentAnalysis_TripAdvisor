I have stayed in Seattle many times, for business and pleasure. For convention use this hotel is a tad far but for pleasure and "doing" Seattle it is right in the thick of things, close to the Pike Market, shopping, monorail, and restaurants. We got a great rate and had a first class experience. A small hotel with very courteous staff. Will definitely stay there again.

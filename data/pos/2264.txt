My 10 year old daughter and I took a quick trip to Seattle this summer to get some mother/daughter time in. We were on a budget and got a very good rate at the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed having a coffee shop and sushi restaurant in the hotel. The best of all worlds! That said, the room was a bit dated and small. The room had a very European size and feel to it, but was not without it's charm if you're tired of box hotel rooms.

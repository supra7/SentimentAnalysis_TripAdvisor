Superb place, simple but stylish and very welcoming. We absolutely loved the artsy interior and the layout of the place. Staff couldn't be more helpful and even gave us a free upgrade on our last evening after they made a mistake with our room booking. The only downside was our first room was above a busy, noisy bar and had no air con but the fan cooling us down also provided a good, steady alternative noise to the bar! No question though, we'd stay there again if we were in Seattle.

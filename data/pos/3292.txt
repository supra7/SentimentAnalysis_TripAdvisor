From the moment we checked in, throughout our stay right till check out all the staff provided smiles and cheery hellos. The room was comfortable and clean, great value for the price. The location couldn't have been better for us, a short walk to Pike Place Market an even shorter walk to the monorail and the downtown core. Around the corner to Grayline for the airport shuttle. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. This is certainly a place to shortlist if you're looking to stay in Seattle.

We stayed at Inn at the Market for a long weekend and had a delightful experience. The staff was very helpful. We stayed on the 6th floor with a view of the Sound. By the little courtyard entrance was a great place for breakfast, Bacco. Also, two french restaurants, Campagne and Cafe Campagne. The Inn is within walking distance of many fine restaurants. The Market is just a short walk down the hill. It also features a nice patio overlooking the water. We will definitely stay there again.

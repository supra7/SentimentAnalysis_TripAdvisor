I booked the Edgewater Hotel because it had good reviews, and met the requirements for my wife's' happiness: Be on the water or a view of it, and have a fireplace. It also provided a close location for the Opera we were attending that night for my wife birthday Our arrival was met with friendly valet and check-in staff. Upon arrival they notified me I had be complimentary upgraded to the Beatles Suite -- now, mind you, I didn't even know what they were talking about. When they told me the history I thought, "huh, this should be pretty cool." Man. It was AWESOME. The room is HUGE. Decked out in Red and White and wooden decor. Little did I know my wife's affinity for British style and the Beatles. Having the Beatles pictures, books and memorabilia made the stay totally unreal. Icing on the cake - a CD with all their hits to listen to as we lounges in the spacious room. The room was immaculate (and my wife is very meticulous) comfortable and cozy with a shower and a large bear-claw tub (ah-yeah). The restaurant was great - a spectacular view of the sunset, great service and delicious food. At night, I stopped in for a bit and it was a lively and fun atmosphere. My only regret is that with our planned night out, we didn't have time to enjoy the room and hotel as much as we could have. The next time, the hotel will be the destination. Period. We had a great time and really did not want to leave.

I was a little concerned about the location of this hotel at first (a little ways from downtown, in the University district), but my concerns were unfounded. The hotel was very clean, offered free evening cheese and crackers, and a great continental breakfast (fresh Belgian waffles!). Our room had a nice little balcony, which was perfect for the cool September evenings during our stay. They even offer a free shuttle that will take you from the hotel to downtown Seattle. We didn't use it (we had a rental car), but I was impressed that it was offered. The pool looked great, although it was a little chilly to give it a try while we were there. The parking is secluded, well-lit and safe, so no worries there either. The University of Washington is a few blocks to the east from the hotel. We found some great microbreweries and all kinds of great food in that area - Thai food, fish & chips, Mediterranean food, anything. It was a great place to stay at a great price. Don't waste your money on the overpriced downtown hotels!

For price versus value I don't think you can find a better deal. Very friendly staff. I've stayed there three times. Twice I was on the back side of the hotel and the room was a little larger with a tub in the bathroom. Once I stayed on the front side and the room was a little smaller with only a shower. Still, it was fine. They didn't charge me to use the in-room safe. Great location. It's only a few blocks from Westlake Center so you can take the Link Light Rain from the airport (just $2.75) and walk to the hotel. You can also catch the Monorail at Westlake Center to go to the Seattle Center and Space Needle. Reasonable walking distance to Pike Place Market. The hotel charges for parking but you can park on the street for free after 6:00 p.m. Also, Enterprise has a rental car office a few blocks away. You can pick up your car the morning after a stay in the hotel or drop it off the night before a stay in the hotel and avoid the parking charge. The restaurant and lounge are also nice. I never eat at McDonald's, but if you like that, it's only a block away.

Mayflower Park is the nicest hotel in the best possible location. My husband and I researched several different hotels when deciding to travel to Seattle for vacation. Mayflower Park seemed to be the best for location and price. We were definitely not disappointed. The hotel is beautiful-outside and inside. Our room had a terrific view (see pic below) of some of the downtown Seattle buildings. The staff was friendly and helpful from the first minute. Our week-long stay was a pleasure. We had delicious food at both Andaluca's and Oliver's (the hotel bar). Great place to stay.

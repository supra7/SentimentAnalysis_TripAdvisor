I recently stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for a convention and everything about the stay was perfect. The check in process was smooth and painless, the concierge desk was well informed about everything around the city, the entire property was clean and well maintained, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, and housekeeping was efficient and prompt. I really enjoyed the art in the lobby especially the Chihuly piece located next to the gift shop. Plus, you cant beat the location of the hotel! If there was one thing to complain about, it would be the bell desk. I almost felt like they were doing me a favor by assisting with my bags. Overall a great stay and will stay there for all future visits.

My wife and I came on a getaway for a long weekend. Our we landed very early on Friday, November 11, 2011, and by the time we got to the hotel it was only 9:00 a.m. We planned on leaving our bags there until we could check in but they had a room available for us right away which was a pleasant surprise. The staff was extremely professional right from the start. The Floor to ceiling glass windows that look out onto the ocean in the lobby/sitting area is truly a highlight, we sat numerous times just reading on the leather chairs facing straight out. It was very peaceful and relaxing. We had a regular "city view" room, nothing spectacular beyond simply being a 'hotel room'. The bathroom was completely redone and modern which was nice. The location is awesome right downtown. Pike's Place is the furthest away and it's about a twenty minute walk at a good pace. There is a free shuttle that'll take you anywhere in the downtown that leaves at the top of each hour which is a huge bonus when the weather is ugly. Never ate in the restaurant in the hotel, but ate at a number of sushi places right close which did not disappoint. Breakfast too was also 5 minutes away at a cute little quaint cafe. I would recommend staying at this hotel to anyone. The city view room does face the railroad track which is 'right there' and they do offer ear plugs, although neither myself nor my wife every woke up with the trains passing. Then again, we have two small kids who were not with us so we definitely did not have any issues sleeping! Enjoy!

We stayed at this hotel several nights while in Seattle. The hotel is convenient to downtown Seattle, located very close to the space needle and within walking distance to Pike's Market, however be ready for the steep hills on the way back. My advice is to take the city transit to help shorten the walk. The last day we were there our plans got changed and we had to rearrange some of our nights. John, the manager that morning was so nice to help us, he arranged for a rental car and gave us directions and comments on our desired plans. Jennifer was very professional and helpful also. She was nice enough to talk to choice privileges so I wouldn't lose my points. Thanks to both of you.

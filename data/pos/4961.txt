From the moment I arrived at the Vintage Park Hotel in Seattle, I was a welcomed guest. The staff greeted me with smiles as I arrived in the garage. In the lobby I was quickly checked in and my three dogs were each offered a treat. The room was spectacularly decorated with the wine theme as advertised. I, and my three dogs, enjoyed the ability to open the windows to allow fresh air in. The windows are appropriately nose height for my k9's, offering them a view and smell of the city. On our first walk outside of the hotel, the staff offered locations to doggy bathrooms guiding us right to them. As with other Kimpton properties the service and amenities were top notch. I dined at Tulio, the restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Like a fine wine pairing at a great meal, the dining experience only added to the value that Vintage Park offered. I enjoyed the meal and the stay very much. When I return to Seattle I will return to Vintage Park. Pro's Windows that open Large Spacious King Room Views Wonderfully Welcoming staff Great food at Tulio Close to all that downtown Seattle has to offer Con's As with many older hotels that have been remodeled the bathroom was a little cramped, (but I don't get a room for the bathroom). Internet was intermittent and slow (it was a vacation so I didn't mind)

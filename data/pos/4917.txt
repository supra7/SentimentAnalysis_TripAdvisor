This Kimpton carries the tradition of excellence that have made us Kimpton addicts! The convenience, style and customer service is outstanding! Kallye & Lane from the Front Desk went above and beyond to make our visit special. If Kimpton could clone them for each and every location...and available around the clock there wouldnt be a need for any other hotels on the planet. We often bring our Springer Spaniel along on our travels and the dog friendliness is impeccable! She had an other amazing visit with us in the great city of Seattle. I just cant say enough fabulous things...room service, new Healthy In Room dining options, pet friendly, delightful cozy beds, central location, parking and excellent customer service. Thank you Hotel Vintage, and especially Kallye and Lane for making it over the top!

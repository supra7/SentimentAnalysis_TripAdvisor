We booked a great deal through Priceline.com. We had booked two rooms and they graciously gave us two adjoining rooms side by side. So we were able to keep the door open in between and it felt like we were all in one big condo! The rooms were large, clean and the view was beautiful. The concierge was vey helpful and gave us a dinner coupon to a local eatery. We loved the hot tub and pool and the location to everything downtown was exceptional. The only downfall was there was a large event so there was no self parking and the valet parking went up $10. It was a fantastic stay and I hope to always stay at the Westin!

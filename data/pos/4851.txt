Having travelled by Amtrak from Vancouver where we had been at a very up-market (and much more expensive) hotel a slight re-adjustment of expectations was necessary but that didn't take long. Although the train was late and it was after midnight but we received a bright welcome.Breakfast in the morning seemed initially like a rugby scrum but it works and somehow you do find a seat. It's very efficient with any shortages readily replaced, and you can make your own waffles.Everything was easy going and generous - free coffee, afternoon snack, internet etc. Staff on the desk were exceptionally helpful and efficient. We deliberately didn't have car for this part of our trip but location wasn't a problem. As well as the free shuttle we found the metro buses frequent, cheap, easy to use and the drivers extremely helpful. Although there are many cheap eating places around, with our student days long behind us we were initially disappointed with dinner options without travelling downtown but at Roosevelt and 50th there are two very acceptable restaurants, one Italian (wine half price on a Tuesday! - we were just lucky) and one Indian.

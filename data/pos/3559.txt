My work responsibilities have taken me to Seattle 4-6 times a year over the last five years and I now have stayed at Hotel Andra about two dozen times, 2-5 nights each stay. In that time period, I have had to travel extensively elsewhere (domestically and internationally) as well but this is my favorite hotel. Apart from a superb location at the seam of downtown Seattle and Bell Town with all its wonderful restaurants -- a location which cannot be beat in my view -- this non-convention style hotel is very contemporary in its furnishings, has comfortable beds and efficient workspaces (with easy internet access), and has two excellent restaurants on either side (one accessible through its lobby). The breakfasts at Lola are just outstanding; on the other side, Assaggio is a terrific Italian place for dinner (and across the street one can have an excellent lunch or dinner at Dahlia Lounge). Most of all, the staff is particularly friendly and responsive, happy to accommodate reasonable requests for favors. And, as if that were not enough, as a news junkie I really value the fact that one only has to ask and, presto, you have a free copy of the New York Times (including Sunday's!) at your door each morning!

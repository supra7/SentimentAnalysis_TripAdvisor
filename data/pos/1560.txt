If you don't need an elevator, this is a wonderful find in the Queen Anne district near Seattle Center. My room on the third floor was enormous, with separate well stocked kitchen and eating nook, living area with large couch, and recessed king sized bed, all very elegant and comfortable. Highly recommended.

I stayed here for a week while attending a conference at the downtown conference center. In short, this place was pretty swanky, very clean and comfortable. Rooms are very well appointed, and the views from the upper floors are fantastic. Hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and the conference center. I would definitely stay here again for either business or personal travel.

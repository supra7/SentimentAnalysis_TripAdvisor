We stayed here after disembarking from a 2 week cruise to Alaska. This hotel is centrally located, very roomy, comfortable beds, but rooms with 2 beds were all double beds, no queens. My two teenage boys sharing a double, were glad it was only for one night! We walked to Pike's Market and the Monorail that takes you to the Space Needle. There must be a coffee shop on every corner in Seattle! At the monorail station there is an indoor mall that has a substantial food court. (We were still in that cruise mentality, and my boys can be picky!) Cheesecake Factory is across the street too. There were at least 3 people in the lobby with their dogs, big ones, little ones, even a puppy! I love dogs, so this was a plus to me! Very nice hotel and the concierge is very helpful with directions, and suggestions.

We stayed on the 12th floor of the Deluxe Union tower on a Saturday night in December. It was busy--everyone seemed to have our idea of shopping and seeing a show. I give the hotel credit for speedy check-in/out, and the relatively fast valet parking system, which was packed to the gills during check-out. We chose this hotel over the Red Lion on 5th Avenue, which is a great location, but is starting to show its age. This room was the same price and sounded much nicer. It was. The flat-screen TV was appreciated, as were the nice sheets and bedspread. Three chairs and the beds gave us an ample lounging area. The bathroom was immaculate, and had modern new fixtures. Compared to the older Red Lion, we found the room much smaller. Not cramped, but only just. On an excellent customer service note, I called down to Guest Services to request an extra blanket, and they apologized for not already having one in the closet, and for the delay in bringing it up (about an hour) and gave us a complimentary in-room movie! Quite impressive. Other notes--the room was quiet, with only the faintest of outside noises (some street noise, could hear the shower running next door).

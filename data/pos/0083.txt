We usually prefer a more modern aesthetic, but the somewhat 'quirky' decor was fun and a welcome change. Booked an excellent rate on their site and then was upgraded on our arrival and given multiple perks. (Well worth joining the Kimpton loyalty program.) Thoughtful in room touches such as use of yoga kit. Complimentary lovely local wines poured at the wine hour. Helpful staff. (Looking forward to my upcoming stay this weekend at their sister hotel, the Alexis.)

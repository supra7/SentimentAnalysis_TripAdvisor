We stayed here three nights, as part of a wedding weekend. Aside from not being exactly "our style" in that we usually stay at new, modern hotels, it was a great stay. This is a very old/historic (but well maintained), independent hotel. It is decorated quite formally, and the rooms are a bit formal and floral - again, not our style, but it suits the historic character of the hotel. The room itself was fine - clean, slightly older bathroom fixtures, but nice toiletries (appreciated that they were in large, fixed bottles; better for the environment, and the stuff itself is higher quality that the small bottles you usually find in hotels). The shower head was really short (!), but probably not an issue for people that are not exceptionally tall. The bed was comfy, and the room had all the normal appointments (hairdryer, closet, iron, TV, desk, chair). The hotel has free wifi that worked well. The staff were very friendly. The elevator was a bit slow (long lines during busy check-in/check-out times). The location really can't be beat. It's less than a block from the light-rail to/from the airport, about two blocks from the main city bus corridor, and about 5-8 minutes walk to the famous Pike Street market. There's a movie theater about two blocks away, and great shopping is all around. We also explored a bit further afield near the university and lakes areas, Fremont, etc. all via bus from right hear our hotel.

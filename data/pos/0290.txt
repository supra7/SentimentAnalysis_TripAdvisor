The hotel is very upscale, but not in a stuffy, overly formal way. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and went out of their way to make sure my stay was as pleasant as possible. The room was very clean and comfortable. The exercise facility was just OK, but they offer a daily pass to a nearby health club at a fairly reasonable price if you are in need of a more extensive facility. The evening wine reception with the fortune teller, masseusse, etc was a very nioce touch.

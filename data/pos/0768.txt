Stayed at the Inn at the Market the end of June with my two daughters. We had a double bed room and a great view of the market and the water. We were at the end of a long trip and I wasn't sure I even still wanted to stay in Seattle - but once I saw my room and location I totally changed my mind. The beds were cozy and loved the chocolates at night with our turn down service. Loved being so near to Pikes Market and being able to walk to get breakfast, coffee, and just to eat and look around. The Inn does have restaurant service but we didn't try it - but it sounded great. Just not too child friendly. I'm not sure the Inn really is looking for children clientle as there were many couples. However, we never felt uncomfortable. My kids loved the room. I really appreciated that everytime I asked staff for directions they always gave me excellent tips and I soon discovered we were really close to everything we wanted to see!! I also appreciated the free business center, coffee in the room, and the cookies and apples at night,. This hotel is not cheap but it definately was worth the splurge. It made out time in Seattle extra special. Would highly recommend it.

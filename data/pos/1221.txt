My brother and I stayed at the C Plaza for three nights in August and attended two Mariner games. The hotel is in a good location, however, not for those who have difficulty walking hills. We were only a short walk from great restaurants, bars and shopping. Cab's to and from the games were under $10.00. I would definitely stay here again.

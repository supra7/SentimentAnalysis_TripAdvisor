My husband & I visited Seattle for our anniversary and used our Starpoints to stay at the Sheraton. We were able to check in immediately and were given the option for a higher floor for a partial view of the Sound (which we took). The room was very spacious! We were in the older tower, so the decor could use a bit of updating, but I have zero complaints about the property. The location was superb - made an excellent base for exploring the city. We used the updated fitness center a couple of times to work off all the great Seattle food. We also found the boarding pass station in the lobby to be very helpful. If you're visiting Seattle, you can't really go wrong with the Sheraton.

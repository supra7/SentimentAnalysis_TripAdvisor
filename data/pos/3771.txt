Overall: BEAUTIFUL! I was upgraded to a stunning water front room and I could not have been happier. I took a relaxing bubble bath and enjoyed the sounds of the pier. I will definitely be back. This hotel was extremely delightful and I could not have asked for anything better. Top quality! I will recommend it to EVERYONE I know whose travels take them to Seattle! :)

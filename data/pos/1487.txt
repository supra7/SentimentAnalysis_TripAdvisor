We stayed here for 6 nights on our vacation to Seattle. My husband said he felt like he stepped into another time when we entered the lobby. It is an old building that has been well taked care of. The rooms have lots of space which is great for longer stays. The staff was really helpful. I slept much better than I usually do in hotels; we didn't hear much noise from outside at all. If you are accustomed to staying in modern hotels, be aware that there are a few quirks that come with staying in an older building, such as variable water temperature in the shower and lack of counter space in the bathroom. The breakfast offerings were limited, but there is a refrigerator in the room and a few stores within walking distance, not to mention great restaurants nearby. This is a great location - many attractions are within walking distance, and there is a bus stop nearby. Overall we had a great stay.

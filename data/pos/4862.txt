We loved this Inn, simple and clean. It is located just a few I5 exits away from DT Seattle. Easy access to major attractions. Our room was fresh and I really liked the extra vanity outside the bathroom. We have a 3 yo. This was the last leg of our week long road trip, so the complimentary use of a washer/dryer was a very pleasant surprise. We really like the quietness of this location. I just wish the ac/heating units in hotels (any hotel) can run a little quieter though. Nonetheless, we'd definitely stay here again!

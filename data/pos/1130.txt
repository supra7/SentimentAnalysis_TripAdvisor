I booked a room here for very cheap for me and my friend to stay in. Once arriving- they told me it was a "shared bathroom" situation. So I upgraded to the real room, WITH a bathroom, for barely 50 bucks more. This room was awesome. I loved it. I had a great time. Don't bother staying at this hotel if you have hang ups about hostels, or anything trendy. If you love design, and art direction- STAY here.

Located in downtown Seattle we were able to leave our car parked for most of our visit. We were within walking distance to Pike Place, great shopping and restaurants. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we went to eat and it still was not ready when we got back. I would advise letting the staff know if you will be arriving at check in time so your room will be ready. The room was clean, the staff friendly. Our only problem was no air conditioner, Seattle was having unusually warm weather and we had to attempt to sleep with the windows open. This was difficult because of the location, nightclubs, sirens and garbage pick up very early. I would recommend this hotel for anyone on a budget. It was very reasonably priced and has a lot of history. And check out the painting on the elevator.

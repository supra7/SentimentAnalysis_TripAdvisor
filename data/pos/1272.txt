As we travelled back from Vancouver on Amtrak at night, I chose to stay at the regular chain hotel for one night. Instead of two rooms, we got one King-bed suite. The room was large and clean, but we could not find a way to turn one floor lamp on. There were a few long hair left in the bathroom. The front staff was very helpful even at late night. Room service was also good too. There was a view of Space Needle. But the wall was so thin that you could not hear TV when the guests next door happened to be loud talkers. It probably is hard to complete with new stylish hotels, but I think they were trying hard by rennovation and the good service.

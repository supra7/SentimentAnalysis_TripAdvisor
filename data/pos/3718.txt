We stayed at the Edgewater for 2 nights in November 2011 and loved it. All of the staff was very friendly, the front desk upgraded our room to a waterfront veiw with a bear claw tub for free.The roomservice was delicious we ordered room service 3 times during our stay because the food was so good. We wanted to stay in our room and enjoy the view while eating. The bed was very comfortable we had a great sleep, loved the fireplace it was so cozy we wanted to spend the whole day in our room. We will definitely be back :)

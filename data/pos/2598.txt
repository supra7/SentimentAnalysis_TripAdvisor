I liked this place a lot. The hotel seemed very nice and the staff were quite friendly. This hotel is great value for money when you consider the location and the facilities. The pool was very nice, if a bit crowded. The breakfast was excellent with hot/cold selection. Our room was a little small but nice. Overall, location was excellent. I think it would be hard to find a better location for the price paid. It was crowded over Presidents Day weekend but that speaks volumes about how affordable the hotel is. Shuttle service was good. Staff seemed quite nice. One returned my social security card after I dropped it which was very helpful. Overall, very nice stay in an excellent location!

At first, I was nervous, because I book through Hot Wire. After I learned about which Hotel we were staying at and read the reviews, I was nervous, so then I decided to call and just make sure I had two beds. The woman I spoke with was rude, it seems you get treated differently when you book through a 3rd party. She said " I could not request anything because of that reason". That maybe even more nervous. So I decided that when we arrive I was going to go and be nice ,but prepare myself to be firm. When we did arrive, I was surprise. The gentlemen was very nice and he did make sure I had two beds and even gave me a room with a view. It is a very nice and elegant Hotel. The location is awesome. We walk every where. The parking is steep. But that is the city for you. I would definitely stay here again.

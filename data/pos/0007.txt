I stopped here just for the night on a road trip. It was kind of expensive, but the room was very clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the bath products were great. Since I'm a light sleeper, I asked for a room on the top floor away from vending machine and elevators, and the front desk clerk was very gracious about it. I forgot to ask to be on the side away from the interstate, but the room turned out to be on the quiet side anyway. I would definitely stay here again if I were in the area.

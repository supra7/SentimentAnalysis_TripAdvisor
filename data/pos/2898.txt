Excellent stay, rooms in comparison to other nearby hotels were smaller and some could use a refurbishment especially with the tile in bathroom and carpet immediately on entry area. The concierge was not easily accessible and certainly not as knowledgeable as other area hotels (Grand Hyatt). I was not impressed by the ambiance and availability of items at Breakfast. Hotel front desk was helpful on checking in but had to be drilled for upgrading for Starwood status and then had to wait for a room to come available and was only checking in am hour early. Amenities (pool exercise room) okay but found similar or better at other hotels near by or closer to Pikes Place and Cruiseport. Would really like to see a park on cruise or cruise terminal shuttle inclusive rate for hotel and better concierge services for activities. Found other Starwood properties in downtown in better overall facility appointment. Overall the hotel is good but you should closely compare other area hotels in order to obtain best value.

The Sorrento is 100 years old, and when you step into the lobby, it's like stepping back in time or like being in Europe. There is lovely antique style furniture, beautiful wood paneling, a jazz pianist playing, and a fire burning. The staff is wonderful. Very accommodating. I was on a business trip, and most hotels for business use charge for internet access, use of the business center for faxes, etc. This is all free! Also, there is a free town car (a London cab) that will take you downtown when it is available. This is the only thing that I would say not to rely on, because it is often booked. (I was there a week, and got to use it I think 3 times). The restaurant is also excellent, with great service there too. The rooms feature a living room with separate tv (2 tvs in each suite), a separate bedroom, and a spacious bathroom area. There are even books about the history of Seattle and the hotel in the rooms.

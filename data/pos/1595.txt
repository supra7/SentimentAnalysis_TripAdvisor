Right in the middle of downtown, the buses, trolley, monorail and light rail are all accessible, and they have valet parking for those who need their own transportation. It is an older hotel that has been lovingly kept up, retaining its beauty, charm and identity, yet has incorporated the modern conveniences where you would wish them. Staff are knowledgeable and pleasant, The beds are comfortable. Although near everything, it is quiet. If you prefer to avoid the sterile 'bed in a box' of many hotels and crave a sense of history and identity, this is the place for you.

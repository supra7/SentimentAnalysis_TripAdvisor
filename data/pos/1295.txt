We have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel in downtown Seattle. This hotel is an excellent choice for any stay in Seattle. We have been to this city three times and would highly recommend that anyone stay here. The staff is extremely accomodating and pleasant. We stayed on the 29th floor which included the breakfast and appetizers in the evening which is well worth the extra money! The room was very clean and spacious. Ask to face the space needle which also gave us parital ocean view. The location could not be better especially as far as the shopping goes and downtown tourist attractions. We will definitely return. Hats off to the wonderful staff!

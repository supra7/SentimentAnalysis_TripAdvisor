We get to enjoy Pacific Plaza Hotel, Seattle, Washginton at least once a year when we go to Seattle in March. (which is not enough). It is a wonderful place to stay. They are very accommodating and courteous. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Great place, great prices, great people!! Once you go, you won't go any place else. Enjoy your stay!!

Hotel is staffed by friendly folk and is located in a safe area. I walked about at night with no problems. It ois a five minute walk from convention hotels, shopping and in another direction is a wonderful Whole Foods that serves breakfast, lunch and dinners!! Rooms are large so one does not feel confined. Bathroom fan was a llitle noisy and towels not the fluffiest but still and all a great hotel to know about. Did have a fridge in the room.

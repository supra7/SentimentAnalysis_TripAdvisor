We were pleased to end a long trip at the Westin. We were out in this area for two weeks and were used to staying in 2BR condos so we were concerned about the size of the room. It was a King with DBL sofabed. We were all comfortable sleeping and the shower was wonderful. As far as the elevators go, it wasn't that bad, an extra 5 minutes isn't going to ruin a nice stay. We were on the 36th floor and faced the space needle and Puget Sound. We really enjoyed the view and the Concierge representatives were great at recommendations for dinner. The little cafe in the lobby is fabulous for breakfast, good hot food and cold basics as well. We ate there rather than go out. We felt the turndown service was excellent and any requests we had were answered immediately.

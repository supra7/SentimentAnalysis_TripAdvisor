Me and my wife got a great deal off priceline for this hotel and we were very happy with our stay. Staff were very friendly and always helpful. Rooms were quite spacious and looked modernized. The washroom was really nice and really bright. The lights around the mirror were visually stunning. Just a tip... If you really want a quiet night, you may want to request for a room without an adjoining door to the next room. We were able to hear the next door neighbors even though they were speaking on a normal volume. Lucky for us it was people from our group. I will be coming back and will definitely recommend Renaissance Seattle Hotel.

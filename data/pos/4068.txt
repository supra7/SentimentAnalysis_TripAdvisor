If you're looking for a boutique hotel with classic turn of the century details, this is the hotel for you. We chose to spend our 12th anniversary here Jackie at the front desk was wonderful as we checked in and upon reaching our Junior Suite room we were delighted to find a bottle of white wine waiting for us compliments of the hotel (not something we had ordered) - now that's classy! Dinner in The Hunt Club did not disappoint. If you're looking for a romantic hotel in downtown Seattle---this is the hotel for you. We'll be back....thanks for the memories.

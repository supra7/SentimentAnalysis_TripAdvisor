A night at the Hotel Andra exceeded expectations for these Seattle parents.....so close yet so far from home. Hotel Andra is close to everything that is downtown Seattle, Belltown, Pike Place, the center of all and all accessible on foot, yet secluded and private within the immaculate suite. The staff made us feel welcome and offered assistance, though maintained appropriate distance so as not to overwhelm. This well traveled couple was impressed and hope to indluge annually at the hotel. We will certainly recommend to all!

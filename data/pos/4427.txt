We got the hotel at a great price on Priceline and for the price the hotel was excellent. The room was nice, location fine, bed was dreamy. Parking expensive (now $39/night - and the same price for hotel guests as general public). The check in staff didn't seem to try very hard...they were not rude at all...but not warm either. The car parking guys were great - at least if I had to dish out $39 + tax each day - they were very friendly). Pool and hit tub were great. Elevators were almost always a nightmare - only 3 of them for 44 floors!!!!!! Sometimes the waits were scary - 10-15 minutes - and sometimes, even then, they were full and you had to wait (the only really "bad" part of this hotel). I did appreciate a late night McDonalds right next door :)) We were starved late at night - and it was an easy trip there (except...ugh...the elevators!!)

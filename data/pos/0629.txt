We have stayed at The Inn at The Market 3 times and will be back every time we're in Seattle. The location itself is amazing, but when you add in the staff and the facilities it becomes our very favorite hotel period! The rooms are spacious, the beds comfortable and the water view rooms let me know for sure that I'm in Seattle! I love being able to watch Pike Market come to life and the ferries crossing the Sound. This hotel is a splurge for us, but we never hesitate to make our reservations!

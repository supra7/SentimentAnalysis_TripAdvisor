We stayed there for 3 nights and enjoyed the service throughout the stay. The concierge at the main lobby always serve with a smile, which really lift up your spirit at the start of the day. Great fitness and pool facilities. Excellent value for money. Key Pluses: Location is very good: Walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Waterfront. Room amenities are good, coffee machine & starbucks coffee provided, great gym, heated jacuzzi. Pickup location for Mt Rainier tour Minus: No boiling kettle (only coffee machine) in the room. No free internet. Room design a little bit dated.

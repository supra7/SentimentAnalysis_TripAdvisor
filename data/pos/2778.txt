My family of 4 stayed at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel on August 20th, 2011. It was a very nice hotel in an excellent location. We walked only about 4 blocks to get to Pike's Place. Later in the day we walked to the Space Needle which was about a mile but when we took the monorail back it stopped only 2 blocks from the hotel. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were nice and clean.

The staff is fantastic! Everyone is friendly, helpful and courteous. The bar has excellent bartenders and attentive wait staff. The restaurant Andaluca is top notch - always good wine recommendations and THE BEST Paella (which can also be ordered in the bar). I've had Paella in Spain, Andaluca's is better! The wait staff in the restaurant is also knowledgeable, friendly, dedicated to customer service. Location is great - easy to get to any part of Seattle, across the street from Macy's and a quick walk to Pike Place, even in the winter. I have been staying at Mayflower Park every other week for the past 4 months and from the first day everything was terrific. There a loads of restaurants within walking distance if you want to venture out. My favorite rooms are the Deluxe rooms, which are a bit more spacious, but, the regular rooms are good too. The beds have really nice pillows of varying densities. The rooms are always clean and the housekeeping staff is very nice. I would recommend this hotel above any others, which I have stayed in several. The Mayflower Park has it all - charm, outstanding service, class and reasonable rates.

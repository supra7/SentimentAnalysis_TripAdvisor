We only spent an evening and night here but had a great experience since the staff was very helpful and kind. I was happy to be able to leave my car for a few days while I took the Clipper to Victoria, BC. Seattle traffic can be a little noisy but we had no trouble sleeping. The roads are very congested outside the hotel at certain times of day. For seeing the city it is a perfect location.

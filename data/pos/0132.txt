I stayed here with my boyfriend for two nights on a very busy weekend in Seattle. I was happy to snag a room here for a better price than a lot of other hotels in the area. Kimpton never disappoints. Definitely join their 'in touch' program. I got upgraded a room level and a mini bar credit. The front desk staff was super friendly. The decor is a bit overdone, but the room was a good size, clean and the bed was comfy. The wireless was not good, I just used my 3G all weekend. The restaurant serves a surprisingly good breakfast. Valet parking is expensive, but I think that's standard downtown.

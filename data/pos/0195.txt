This was girls getaway. I found this hotel through priceline "name your own price" and it happened to be super value compared to what they offer: pleasant housekeepers, complimentary gold fish through out your stay, wine in the afternoons and chocolate every day :) I supposed to pay more than what I paid (thanks priceline) Do not forget to become Kimpton member, it comes w good benefits. We miss Derrick "Gold Fish" and wish that their prices are more affordable for the budget travelers like I am :/

This hotel is in a great location, a few blocks away from pike's place and also only a block away from the light rail. It is very easy to get from the airport to this place spending only $2.75 on the light rail. The cab ride is close to $45 and takes around the same amount of time (~40min). Its also close to the monorail which you'd take to the space needle. All in all, good location, good service and helpful staff.

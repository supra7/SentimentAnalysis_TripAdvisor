We stayed 2 nights & were very pleased with the hotel & our rooms. The rates were reasonable for such a nice hotel. The lobby is very well decorated with plenty of plush seating. We didn't pay the $20/night parking, because we took the rail from the airport for $2.50/pp to the station connected to the hotel and it was not a problem at all if you have only 1 bad with rollers. The shopping mall is also connected to the hotel. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly from check in to check out. The rooms were nice with unlimited quality shampoo, conditioner, and lotion dispensers & soaps. The bed was very comfortable & our room had a good view. The room was quiet & very pleasant. The staff left a couple truffles in our friend's room, who was celebrating a b-day. The Andaluca restaurant was excellent for breakfast and the food & drinks we had in the bar one evening were extremely good as well. The hotel was centrally located and we walked a few blocks to almost everything (to Pike Market, Argosy cruise station, to the railway which travels to the space needle, ducks, etc). There is also a PF Changs across the street, very convenient, & Starbucks is on the same block. The only negative experience at this lovely hotel was that the fitness room is too warm; the portable A/C unit just could never cool the room enough to enjoy your workout. Otherwise, everything else was wonderful and I would definitely return to this hotel.

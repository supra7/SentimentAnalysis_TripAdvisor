I am a Kimpton In-Touch member and just want to say that the staff at the Vintage Park were excellent and great to interact with during my 2 night stay. My room was quiet, clean and quite large. It is in a great location, close to good resturants, shopping and an easy walk to the Market or Pioneer Square. Also if you fly to Seattle you can take the Sounder to the University Street Exit and it is a easy (well there is one uphill) to the hotel.

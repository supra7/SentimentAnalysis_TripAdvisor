I was nervous about booking this hotel after reading the reviews. I am so glad that I did. I had a fabulous view of the space needle (that has chirstmas lights on top for the holidays), and puget sound. It is also easy to find street parking around the hotel. It is within walking distance for all the sites and the indoor pool was great to keep the kids happy.

This hotel couldn't be better located in the heart of Seattle. You literally have everything within a stones throw away. Whatever you're in to, whether it's a bar, restaurant, club, movie, arcade, they're all really close. I recently stayed here on business with my family traveling along and it was amazing. We ate at the Cheesecake factory one night which was pretty good. We also visited Gameworks twice which was a blast for the whole family. The wife and kids saw a movie across the street at the theater as well. This hotel has alot of class and the lobby is amazingly beautiful. We definitely enjoyed our stay here and will hopefully be back some day soon.

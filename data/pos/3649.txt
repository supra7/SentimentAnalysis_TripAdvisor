I found that the staff was very knowledgable ,and willing to assist with any question or service that you may inquire about. The rooms were excellent and very clean. The waitress and bar staff were also excellent and I found that they made the experience also pleasurable. The continental breakfast was good and light. Your location to transportation was well within walking distance and the hotel was in an great location. Thank You very much for your service and will stay there the next time I visit Rome.

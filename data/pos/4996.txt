We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We arrived at noon, several hours before check-in and our rooms were ready. My daughter and I stayed in a double queen room. Originally, I had booked a room with two double beds, but after signing up for the free Kimpton In-Touch membership, I received an email offering an upgrade for $15. We chose the upgrade and are so glad we did. Our room was very clean and spacious, with a nice couch and a chair. Our friends booked a double room with no couch, so our room became the hub to meet and plan our day. The room was well appointed with very comfortable beds. The bathroom was small, but had everything you would need, including hair dryer, q-tips, cotton rounds and amazing hair & soap products by Glichrist and Soames. We took advantage of the wine hour, which is held in the cozy reception area that has a lovely fireplace, as well as the free coffee and tea the next morning. The hotel is dog friendly and we met several new canine friends, but the hotel never smelled like dog. The staff was friendly and helpful. And best of all this was one of the lowest rates we found in the city!

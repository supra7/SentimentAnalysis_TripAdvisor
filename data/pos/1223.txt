We spent one night at Crowne Plaza. It is right off the highway from the airport. The rooms were nice and big. I thought the room rate was a little pricey but that is the trend nowadays. It had a nice HD TV inside with plenty of channels to choice from. I had a great view of downtown Seattle. We were on the fifteenth floor. I heard this hotel was steps away from pier 66. They were wrong. It was at least two miles away. You cannot walk it with luggage. We took the shuttle and it cost us $10 each. We were told there is a buffet, we assumed it was free but it cost $15 a person. We were only staying one night there before our Alaskan cruise.

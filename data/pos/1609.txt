I stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel every December when I go into downtown Seattle for a concert. It is an old, wonderful hotel in great condition. It is located right in the heart of the shopping area and you can go into Westlake Center for shopping and restaurants without going out side. From Westlake Center you can access Nordstroms, Pacific Place and Macy's all without going outside. The bar is the greatest atmosphere and the restaurant is also. Great service, friendly staff. Everything you can possibly want and more.

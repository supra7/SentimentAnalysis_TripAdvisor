We stayed at the Westin Seattle in August for three nights and would definitely stay here again. This is a very large hotel, over 800 rooms, but other than the concierge usually having a line I never really felt like we were in a big, difficult to navigate hotel, which was nice. The location was good and there are many nice restaurants within walking distance. I originally booked a base room on the hotel's web site. The next day I got an email from the hotel with several upgrade offers. For an additional $100/night we were able to upgrade to a parlor suite (2 bed/2bath) which was a great deal for two rooms. When we arrived they gave us the option of taking two connecting rooms with deluxe views instead of the suite in the other tower. The views from our rooms, 3931 and 3932 in the North Tower, were amazing!! We were directly facing the Space Needle with Elliott Bay to the left. The rooms have been redone and are very spacious. As we expected, the Westin Heavenly Beds are, well heavenly! Although the concierge desk was usually busy Christine helped us with a smile and was able to get the dinning reservations I asked for. The pool and exercise room were nice as well. We enjoyed a quick, hot breakfast in the Fifth Ave. Corner Caf every morning. There is a small computer center in the lobby with an hourly charge.

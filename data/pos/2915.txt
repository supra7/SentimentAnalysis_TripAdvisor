I booked this hotel for a night while our US NAVY ship was in town for the Seattle Sea Fair. I e-mailed management after booking a reservation through a third party because I had read some negative reviews with regards to room quality when booking this way. I just wanted to make sure that the room had two queen beds as I was sharing the room with a shipmate. Mr. Battersby of management responded that all was good. When we arrived we could not have been more pleased, the hotel treated us great and even upgraded our room. The bed was comfortable,linens were clean and fresh, pillows perfect and the location of the hotel is in easy walking distance of the Pikes Place Market and other shopping. A short bus ride or the monorail will get you to the space needle. All in all a great stay for a couple of tired Sailors wanting to get on shore for a few days and sleep in a comfortable bed for the night. Thanks for the great hospitality. US NAVY CHIEF

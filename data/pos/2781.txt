I booked a room here for a great rate on Priceline.com and was so happy when I saw the location, the beautiful room, clean everything and super friendly service. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. WARNING: EVERYTHING costs extra so watch out for the fees lurking everywhere, overpriced room service and check your credit card statment a few days after you leave. I had an accurate charge from Priceline but then a mystery charge from the Sheraton itself for $191. When I called to inquire the lady was very nice and said it was an error on their end and would be fixed but still glad I caught it!

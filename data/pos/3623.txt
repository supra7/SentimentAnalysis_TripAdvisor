We just came back from a long weekend trip to Seattle and I cant wait to get online to review Hotel Andra. During our stay at Hotel Andra, I couldnt find one thing I didnt like (okay, the bathroom was pretty small but it didnt really bother me). The service was superb; all of the hotel staff was very professional, courtesy, and very friendly. We had an Andra Suite (like a Jr. Suite); room is relatively big with a mini bar in the room. The dcor was very nice and tasteful. Hotel was very quiet (even though I understood that they were sold out during our stay). Lola restaurant food was very good  one of the best meals we had in Seattle. Location couldnt be better; not to close to all the busy tourist spots but yet nicely located close to everything. We walked to Westlake area, Belltown, Space Needle, Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square  everywhere -- from the hotel. You probably read other reviews about the bed and it is sooo true; best hotel bed Id ever experienced. During my visit, I have looked at all other hotels in Seattle downtown area and I wont stay in any other hotels except for Hotel Andra. I totally recommend this hotel.

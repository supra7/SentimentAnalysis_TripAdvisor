Stayed here with 10 family and friends before and after an Alaskan cruise Staff wonderful and attentive altho very busy Room was small but adequate clean and comfortable Pool opened at 6am and was heated great for morning exercise and relaxing after a day on the town Breakfast was all you could want and then some Hotel transportation was easy and great people -as we had a lot of folks and luggage Convient to city transportation would highly recommend to anyone

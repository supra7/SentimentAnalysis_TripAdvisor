Great stay at the Westin. Had a room in the north tower facing Lake Union. Also could see Mt. Baker, a 10,000 plus foot volcano in the distance and the Cascades. Staff was professional. Few minor room problems (bathroom needed a bit more cleaning, windows dirty, etc) taken care of promptly. Food at my lunch event was superb (and healthy). Location couldn't be beat--3 blocks to Pike Place Market, next to shopping. Fitness center a disappointment--two small hotel rooms with a few exercise machines. And don't touch the mini-bar. Potato chips and other snacks left on top of it and if you so much as touch it, the infrared sensor charges you for the whole tray. I demanded they remove these items and lock the mini-bar (which they eventually did after initially balking at the request). The Westin charges enough without nickle and diming you on such a nuisance. And yes the rooms need remodeling (or at least a thorough carpet cleaning) as other reviewers noted.

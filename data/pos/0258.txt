We had already booked 5 nights at the Arctic Club Seattle but arrived early and booked into the Monaco for one night. How we wished we had booked here instead of the Arctic Club! Lovely rooms, great service, excellent position and the bar and restaurant were really wonderful. Sadly we had to move after only one night but we would reccommend this hotel to everyone.

Can't go wrong with this hotel. A true classic. Staff very nice, super efficient. Bell staff amazing, front desk very courteous and helful. Great location, and the restaurant that serves the room service has the best scrambled eggs.. not sure what they do to them, but they are so so so tasty! :) Stay here when in Seattle..you will be very happy.

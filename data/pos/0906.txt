If you want to get the flavor of Seattle this is the place to stay. Besides the convenient location to all the action (Pike Street Public Market) you are near transportation, restaurants, shops, etc. The hotel rooms were spacious (as well as the bathrooms) and well-appointed. The staff at the Inn is wonderful, from housekeeping to front desk they are friendly and accommodating to a fault. Even though we were near transportation, we found it easy and interesting to just walk to everything. The rooftop deck was wonderful. We spent most evenings up there to view the bay and Mt. Ranier. We would definitely return to stay at the Inn.

Wow, The Inn at the Market was a perfect hotel choice for our recent stay in Seattle. This was our first visit to Seattle and I wouldn't change a thing about our visit! It is in the Pike Place Market which is a fun venue. We did quite a bit of traveling around the city and whenever we mentioned that we were staying at the Inn at the Market, everyone knew the property and confirmed that we had picked a city treasure. The hotel has the fabulous 5th floor patio which can't be missed and an inviting courtyard within the market area. I am a stickler for smells and this hotel was exquisitely maintained and had a clean, fresh smell. I loved the property from the moment we arrived and felt privileged to be a guest.

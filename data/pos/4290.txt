I recently stayed in the North Tower of the Seattle Westin for three nights while attending a wedding. The hotel check-in was efficient and the room was a good size. The bathroom and beds were up-to-date and of high quality, though nothing stood out --- it is definitely an impersonal, super-large hotel chain. Having said that, everything was uniform in high quality. The view was the best part about the Westin - from the 39th floor (and the 45th where family had a suite), we had floor-to-ceiling views of Seattle: Lake Washington, Lake Union, the Space Needle, Mount Rainier (depending on the side of the building). Housekeeping called about when to clean our room and came exactly when we asked (an odd time of 5pm). The concierge was helpful with printing out my reading for the wedding and with helping me make it to the Downtown Airporter, which conveniently makes a stop right outside of the Westin. I ordered a club sandwich from the bar downstairs and was also served hot tea, which they refilled without me having to ask. I think Seattle's Westin is a safe-bet quality hotel, it just lacks boutique or five star hotel charm/amenities.

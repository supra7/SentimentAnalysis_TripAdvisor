Mayflower Hotel was excellent. The location is absolutely perfect - a nice stroll to the Pike Street Market, with some awesome shopping close by - Macy's, Nordstrom, A&F, J. Crew, etc. just a block away. The hotel was clean and comfortable with good beds, and the lounge made a wicked G&T! I was particularly impressed with the help we received from the concierge - he came up with a couple of great restaurant suggestions and was very helpful to newcomers to the city. The bathrooms are, indeed, small. Not much room to put a toiletry bag. Our room was on the 10th floor and it was very spacious - two queen beds and lots of room to move around. I'd stay there again without question - the location and comfort of the hotel were exceptional.

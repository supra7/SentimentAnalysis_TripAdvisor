The location of the Sheraton Seattle is exemplary. Seattle Center (Space Needle), Pikes Place Market, the Waterfront, Capitol Hill and Museums are all within easy walking distance, and a bus to Bellevue is easy to come by. We even took a cab to a restaurant in Ballard and it wasn't very expensive. The rooms are nice, clean, average size. I was a bit disappointed in the tub, which was tiny (I'm 6'2" and like to have a relaxing bath when I travel), but definitely serviceable. The main down-side of the hotel is that everything costs extra, from wi-fi (how can hotels still charge for this?) to toll-free calls (I called my 1-800 number to call my home voice-mail and it ended up costing me $2.00), and the parking, which is exorbitant ($35 for valet, $28 for self-park). My advice would be to not even bring a car into downtown Seattle. Street parking is pretty difficult at all times. The concierge was very knowledgeable and friendly. The fitness center, pool and jacuzzi on the 35th floor of the old tower was nice, although the pool seem over-chlorinated. The view from up there is great. Walking around downtown I saw a few B&Bs that might have been a more distinctive stay, but the Sheraton did us well. We paid $142/night via Priceline.com.

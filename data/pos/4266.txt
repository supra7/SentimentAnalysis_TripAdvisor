Thank you to everyone for making our stay in Seattle enjoyable. The view of Puget Sound, with it's constant ferry traffic, kept my husband busy with his binoculars, as I was getting a taste of the city. The Westin's staff was helpful, food was great, and I'm now a firm believer in Valet parking. It's definitely worth the extra dollars spent!! Again, thanks. Dan and Evelyn L.

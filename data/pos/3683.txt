We stayed here to celebrate my birthday recently. The grounds, bar and lobby of the hotel are very nice, with a lodge feel to them. The rooms are not quite as nice, but still okay. We stayed in a room with a parking lot/city view and it seemed like the bathroom had been recently re-done. It was a very modern bathroom, which clashed with the lodge feel, but we liked it a lot. The bed was super comfortable. The views from the lobby and bar are breathtaking and the Christmas decor was lovely. Drinks in the bar were good, but very expensive, which we expected, since there are no other bars around. They also have a starbucks in the gift shop, which we liked. The Edgewater is definitely a great deal for Seattle, but it is a long walk away from downtown, so you have to drive if you want to go anywhere. And parking is over $40 a night, so be prepared for that expense.

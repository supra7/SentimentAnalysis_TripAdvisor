We love the location. You are within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and downtown shopping. Easy cab ride to the cruise ship terminals. The staff was very attentive. Nice amenities (restaurant, fitness room and pool). The rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall glass exterior window walls that provide great views. Light sleepers (which we are not) may find these window walls provide the background sounds of the city a little too much. We will return the next time we are in Seattle.

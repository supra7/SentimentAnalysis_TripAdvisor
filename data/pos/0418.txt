My husband and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle for one night in March 2012. We decided to try the Warwick because the room price at our usual hotel had increased about 30% in the past year. Except for a few nit-picky things, we were quite happy with the Warwick. We thought it offered good value. The Warwick is within a couple blocks walking distance of shopping in downtown Seattle and the rooms were nice and pretty clean (the bathroom tap had obviously been missed in the cleaning by the look of all the water spots). I also noticed the veneer on the bottom of the bathroom door was split and coming away from the wood (it looked like it may have withstood a "flood" or two) and the fixtures were a bit outdated but all this is easily forgiven considering the dollars saved bought us a lovely lunch at a nearby Tom Douglas restaurant. One last note, "valet" parking was included in our room package but when we arrived (via a circular route because of all the one-way streets) we were told that, no, their "valet" parking is where you park the car yourself in a garage around the corner (which we just passed trying to get to the front of the hotel) and then had to drive another 4 blocks around (because of the one way streets) to "valet" park our own car. Really? They should state that the cost of parking is included, rather than "valet" parking. Lastly, checkout the following morning was a dream. The service we received was excellent. Taking all this into account, I will return if their prices continue to undercut the competition.

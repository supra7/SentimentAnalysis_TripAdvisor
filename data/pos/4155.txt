Every year we stay at the Sorrento during the Christmas holiday. The staff is always friendly and helpfull. We love the old European feeling it has with the different shaped rooms and cozy feeling. It is a true highlight for us, the hotel is always decked out for Christmas and with the fire going in the lounge it makes the perfect end to a day of shopping or theater in Seattle. A tradition we look forward to every year.

Stayed here pre-cruise and could not have chosen a better location. We walked right out of the hotel to Pike Market, to Post Alley ( Pike Place Chowder), to the monorail for a 90 second ride to the Space Needle, and a short, easy walk to the waterfront for shopping and seafood. The hotel is immaculate, the rooms spacious and comfortable and the 6th floor terrace has views of Mt Rainer and Elliott Bay. Also great for people watching and the Pike Market. The life blood of this hotel are its bellman. Caleb and a dark haired gentleman were professional, kind, informative and went out of their way for us and other guests. The front desk staff are great and called us, as promised, when our room was ready. Housekeeping staff were friendly and always greeted us. If you are looking for a prime location where you won't need a cab or rental car, where you are assured clean and comfortable rooms and bedding, and where customer service is alive and well and the intent is to surpass your expectations, stay here.

My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel! I loved seattle and this hotel made our trip even better! We especially loved the lounge area! During our down time of our trip we would go down there for a drink or two! The manager there especially made us feel so welcomed and made us feel special! He was so sweet and catered to our needs! He was also helpful giving us ideas of things to do in this lovely city!! They had excellent food too! We stayed in one night and had dinner down there!! When I go back I am gonna stay there again!

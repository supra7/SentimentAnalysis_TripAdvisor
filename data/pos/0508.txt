The Warwick Seattle is in the heart of Seattle so its a 20-30 minute walk from everything! Took us 25 minutes to walk back after a Mariners game and Monday to Friday you can hop on the bus for free! Lots of cruise people are complaining about check in time and check out time. Hello universal check in time is 3:00pm and check out 11:00am or 12noon!!!!! Most hotels (especially cruise hotels) let you purchase an early check-in and no its not a cash grab its because every one getting off your boat is asking for early check-in as well so this fairest way to allocate this. I found the staff to find the right answers they were in no way 5 diamond but were professional, management were just a little aloof but all in all nothing to complain about. The rooms have been recently updated we received a room on the top floor facing the Space Needle breathtaking view and very well appointed room. The pool and fitness floor is far from luxurious but its there and clean. Depending on your rate this hotel can be a great deal as long as the rate youre paying isnt any more than younger higher recognized properties you will in now way bee disappointed with you stay!

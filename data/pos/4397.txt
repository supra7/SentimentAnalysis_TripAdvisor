The hotel looks a little worn from the outside, but the inside is very nice, what you would expect from a Westin. The hotel consists of two towers. We were on the 30th floor, north facing on the northern tower. We looked out at the Space Needle and had an amazing view (or would have if the weather had permitted us to see further). The towers are circular, so the rooms have a unique shape. All rooms have windows looking out, so the room is kind of the shape of the pie piece (without the point). However, they did a great job setting this up and it didn't seem awkward at all. Very nice hotel.

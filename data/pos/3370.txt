This was our sixth year to stay at the Andra at Thanksgiving. The staff as usual were wonderful, welcoming and helpful. I was disappointed the bathtubs have been removed in some rooms in the renovation, but the manager has noted we prefer one with a tub for next year, and I'm glad that is an option. The new showers are nice looking, but impossible to turn on and adjust without getting wet. We were on a high floor and facing away from the street, which eliminates the street noise. Next time I will ask to be away from the housekeeping closet--noisy during "nap time." I love the location to so many Tom Douglas restaurants, although Lola (in the Hotel) is not my favorite for either service or food, but Serious Pie, Dahlia Cafe and Dahlia Bakery are across the street. It's also a great location if you're running the Seattle Marathon, less than two blocks from the official race hotel and about one mile from the start of the race.

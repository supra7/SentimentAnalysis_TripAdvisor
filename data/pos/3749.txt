I just wanted to say my stay at The Edgewater was the single most pleasant and rewarding experience I have ever had at a hotel period. I will not hesitate to highly recommend The Edgewater to any and all friends and people I meet who tell me they are traveling to Seattle. From the cozy fireplace to the waterfront views, even the bathrooms were stylishly done. But for me it was the Staff and the "nothing is too much" attitude and profesionalism. My hat off to you all.

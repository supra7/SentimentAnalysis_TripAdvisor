The hotel famous for the Beatles staying there and fishing out of their room. Can't say enough that is good about this hotel. Nicely located, great service, fantastic gourmet restaurant which is very reasonable. Rooms are quirky, comfortable and the seaview ones have great outlook. Been going to Seattle for years on business - wouldn't stay anywhere else now - you pay a bit more but worth every cent. Only gripe - no pool, and I haven't found a gym yet.

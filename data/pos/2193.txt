I stayed here on a stop over between trains. I was only in Seattle I night. I found the city enchanting. The hotel was very good, very central and very accommodating of me . I had an eraly checkin as my inbound train arrived early, and the staff were very good about sorting out a room for me as soon as possible. The bellhop was excellent as were the counter staff. Well worth staying for a longer period, which I hope to do.

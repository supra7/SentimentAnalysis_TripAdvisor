Way overpriced, but it seems most of Seattle is. We had a nice waterside room with great views. Clawfoot tub that opens up to the view. Good location, walking distance to pikes market and the space needle and other touristy stuff. Expensive restaurant and bar in the hotel. Food was good, service was as well, but expect to pay for it. The worst is $34 a night to park unless you want to leave your car out on the street a block away. I wouldn't, Seattle is full of homeless and others who might mess with your nice car. Seattle is a dump and the edgewater made it tolerable for one night for a high price.

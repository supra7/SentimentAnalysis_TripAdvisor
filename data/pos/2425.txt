Unless the hotel is a true world wide 5 star i do not give more than 4 stars for the review. Hotel was clean, roomy, good service. Normally because the =y charge for internet, I would only give 3 stars, but the deal they gave me included free parking or breakfast for 2 as a added bobnus, so for this review i will up the review to 4 stars. i would stay there again on my next visit

We stayed in this hotel in May 2006 for a conference. The hotel was pointed out to me by some colleagues as a cheaper alternative to the 'official' conference hotels (which were full anyway). Unfortunately the only affordable room available to me was a smoking room, but ultimately it wasn't too bad (the room didn't smell too much like smoke). The room was of decent size, with the usual amenities. The location is pretty good, within about 15 minutes walking distance from the conference center. Staff was friendly, the manager who I had contacted by e-mail regarding my late arrival was very pleasant to deal with as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting for a conference. If you are planning to sight see in/around Seattle I guess it would also be alright - I didn't have too much time to do much of that myself though.

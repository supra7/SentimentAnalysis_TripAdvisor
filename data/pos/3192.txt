We stayed here for our anniversary in the summer of 05. First, you absolutely can't beat the location. All the major sights are easy walking distance. We had family staying at the Warwick and they often had to take a taxi to some of the places we met them because of the walking distance. The room was great, we didn't use any of the restaurants or cafes in the hotel so we can't comment on them. The bads: While valet service is easy to use, it's way too expensive in my book. $36.00? Yikes! Plugging in to the Internet service in the room cost $9.00, unacceptable to me considering the hotel and star rating, and also considering I've stayed in many hotels at half the price with free DSL or free wireless. I expect more from a Sheraton. Elevators are slow, often quicker to take the stairs. Check in was a bit of a hassle. Tried to check in 30 minutes before official check-in time, was told to come back because my room wasn't ready. Came back 15 minutes later, told to come back again. Came back to counter at exact check-in time, my room was ready. Coincidence? Doubtful. I got the impression they were making me wait until the actual check-in time to let me register, not cool. It's not like I was trying to check in two hours early. There were obviously rooms ready, they just didn't want to let me have any of them until the official time. Would I stay here again? Yes. Despite the irritations, the location still wins out for me.

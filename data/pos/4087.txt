We had a wonderful stay at the Sorrento. The room was wonderful, the staff was very helpful, our free ride to and from the Space Needle for dinner.... It was lovely. And I love that they change the carpet in the elevator every day! (It says the day of the week..very helpful on vacation!!) I would highly recommend this hotel.

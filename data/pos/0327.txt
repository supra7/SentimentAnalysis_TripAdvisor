East coasters who had never been to Seattle....wanted to explore city before an Alaskan cruise. Stayed 3 nights pre-cruise and glad we did. Booked a lovely Monaco suite. Hotel has lots of character and the attached restaurant is great..Sazarc I believe is the name. Ate their 3 times including once after returning from cruise. Highly recommended!

We stayed here March 22-25 for a conference. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel abuts the highway on one side and sits on top of a hill. Everywhere you walk (other than across the highway to First Hill) is downhill....until you need to walk back up, of course. It wasn't a problem for us, but might be for others. Our room on the 22nd floor was quiet. The elevators were a bit slow at rush hours. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and well designed. There was a plug, a mirror and a light everywhere you needed one, plenty of room to unpack and even a mini fridge with complimentary bottled water. The bathroom, while not particularly large or luxurious, was spotless, and more than met our needs, with plenty of counter space, towels, Aveda products and perhaps most importantly, water pressure. Our only complaint about the room was that the thermostat had a motion-detector which did not detect our presence at night when we were asleep. It wasn't a huge problem in March (so we did not call maintenance), but might be in August. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and competent. If I could give a 4 1/2 star rating here, I would. We especially received great service from Fred, the concierge who helped with dinner reservations for a group of 8-12 two nights in a row. Both dinners, at nearby Sip and Tulio's, were great. Our meals in the hotel's own Maxwells and the Lobby Lounge were good too.

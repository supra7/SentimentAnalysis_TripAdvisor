This is the third time we have stayed at the Inn. We enjoy the smaller hotel atmosphere. Cleanliness is outstanding. Late afternoon snacks and complimentary breakfast are very good. Staff is polite, knowledgeable and helpful. Traditional rooms may be small, but very adequate. Consider asking for quieter room availability to avoid outside traffic noise. We highly recommend this hotel. The Portage Bay Cafe next door is great for brunch or lunch.

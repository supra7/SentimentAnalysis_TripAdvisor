I normally stay in a bit less costly of hotels when traveling, but this hotel's location was perfect for my step mother who was traveling with us. It is within steps of the Market. We received a double room on the fourth floor, where both windows either looked out over the sound or the market. I couldn't have gotten a better view! It was beautiful. The beds were actually very comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. Maid service daily did a great job picking up after our family. And turn down service left us a local candy on our night stands. The champagne, the cappucinno, and the milk chocolate were the best. The concierge night men were so friendly and helpful. They even had umbrellas to loan out, which was great since one of ours broke in the wind the first night. The only negative I have is the room service menues. The breakfast from Bacco's was just ok. And the night menu from the french restaurant was so limited none of us found anything at all interesting, which resulted in a quick walk to McDonald's instead. Completely and totally worth the money

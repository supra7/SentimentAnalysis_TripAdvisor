The hotel staff couldn't have been more accomodating. They sent up a hand written note of congratulations on our anniversary stay. Grocery Market across the street, very convenient. We bought wine there. We walked everywhere downtown, Westlake Center, Pike's Place, Bainbridge Island Ferries, Ivar's Salmon House on the Pier and La Pannea for breakfast every morning at Pike Place...great coffee and wonderful pastries. The staff at Margeux's in the downstairs restaurant was quiet pleasant as well. Great view of the space needle. We'll be back!

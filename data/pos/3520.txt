Excellent service and extremely comfortable bedding. One of the quiestest rooms we have had ever had. Warm and personal service from front desk. Lola (restaurant) had excellent happy hour and incredible coconut cream pie. We had been concerned about reviews mentioning street noise. We had originally requested a lux suite but the front desk showed us where the room was and suggested we switch to a queen on a higher floor in the back of the hotel and the room was amazingly quiet. BTW, the queen room was more than adequate size and the suite would not have been necessary. The location is perfect--you can see Macy''s from the front door and there are a number of good restaurantsm coffee shops, bakery all within a block. It is an easy walk to both the Space Needle in one direction and Pike's Market in the other. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Came to Seattle for a football game. Hotel was perfect location close enough to walk yet also close enough to the city center. Loved the hotel we had a pet goldfish on our room throughout the stay, the staff was very accommodating . The only downfall was the bar ran out of our type of beer one night but that was completely stocked the next day!

This was a nice enough hotel. We got a good deal online so whatever it ended up being we were ok with. The price for parking is outrageous so I probably would not return simply for that reason, well maybe if I don't have a car next time. The hotel is in a good area, pretty close to the monorail if you are interested in riding it and a short enough walk to Pike's Place Market. We did have one unfortunate experience with the staff. My husband called down to guest services our first night and asked the gentleman who answered if he was who he needed to speak to in order to request a wake up call. The gentleman who answered was very rude and replied in an unpleasant tone "what time." My husband said 7am and the gentleman hung up on my husband. Needless to say the next morning we did not receive a wake up call. We meant to complain but didn't want to let it ruin our vacation so we brushed it off. Besides that little bump the rest of our stay was smooth.

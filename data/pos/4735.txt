Friendly, helpful staff, the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced in a hotel, and a nice outdoor pool (not so nice if the weather were colder, though). The location cannot be beat. Breakfast was included so can't complain about the lack of variety. For a hotel in a big city, it was a great value, clean and comfortable. We'd definitely stay there again.

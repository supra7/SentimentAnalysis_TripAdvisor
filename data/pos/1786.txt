We had selected the Mayflower Park because of its location and the online price offering... plus the reviews on TripAdvisor. We were very pleased with the results. We arrived from a late flight... and were greeted with enthusiasm by the doorman and the receptionist. We were too late for dinner, but eventually found ourselves in Oliver's, the Mayflower Park's superb bar, and ordered two of their famous 'best' martini's. And they were. During our two night stay... everyone was friendly and helpful. While we had opted for the lowest priced room, it was very clean, although somewhat small. This is a prime location... for Pike Place Market, the monorail, the light rail to the airport, restaurants... and shopping.

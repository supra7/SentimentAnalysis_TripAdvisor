This is one of the best places we have stayed in some time Front dest staff very helpful and informative, near the nmarket, ferries,, and anything elsae one could want in Seattle The room is great, clean, bed turndown each night, and best of all, the deck loverlooking the harbour. The beds are the most comfortable we have had in a hotel in some time.

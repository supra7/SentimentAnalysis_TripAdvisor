My girlfriend was visiting town, and we decided to stay in the Hotel Andra. One of the biggest deal sealers for me was the spacious room depicted on the website. We stayed in the lux suite, which at 550 sq feet, is massive compared to the nearby competitors, e.g., the Westin, etc. Needless to say, after checking in and opening up the door to what would either make or break our 3-night getaway, we were relieved to be met with a modern, spacious, and clean living space. The room was partitioned into a living room and bedroom, creating an almost apartment-like atmosphere. The living quarters was of a very modern decor, consisting of a glass coffee table, glass desk, orange ottoman, funky rug, and suspended flat-screen. The sleeping quarters were equally appealing, as it had two sets of blue lights draped along the bed's headboard. Overall, the room felt new and fresh. The amenities were very sufficient. The shower actually had three dispensers fixed on the wall: luxury soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Perhaps one of the biggest letdowns, however, was the fact that there was no bathtub. One would expect to find a tub in such a serene and romantic atmosphere. The lobby is just fascinating, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. One of the housekeepers mistook my champagne glass for the hotel's and took it along with the rest of my leftover room service. Needless to say, it was literally returned within minutes of my calling the front desk. I highly recommend this place. If you're flying to Seattle, you might want to consider using Orbitz's flight + hotel vacation package. You will save at least a thousand and will get a very good rate on this hotel.

Wonderful gem of a place. Great value and location for going to the Conference Center (I suggest walking via beautiful Freeway Park). Room was spacious, staff was friendly, internet was dependable, and the food was fantastic. The Rhododendron restaurant in the lobby is open weekdays and has good quality at reasonable prices (as well as fun and friendly staff). The inn is attached to Virginia Mason Hospital, so the room service calls down to the hospital kitchen, but the food was actually great and incredibly cheap (milkshakes and personal pan pizza to your room at 10pm for 8 bucks? Sure!) I started ordering room service because it was cheaper than everywhere except McD's and a better value. Only downside was that it was an old building, and the bathrooms reflected that in the fixtures. Still, for the price, and access to that room service? Excellent value and highly recommended.

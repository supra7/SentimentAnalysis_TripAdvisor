First off, you rarely see marble like this in Hotels anymore. It reminded me of a nice boutique hotel we stayed in, in Athens, Greece. Maybe being from New Orleans I have learned to appreciate the preservation of things built well. The hotel is within walking distance of everything in the downtown area. The staff was great and upgraded us to a room with a view of the space needle which is a perfect view from the Warwick. I love the fact that you can open the big sliding glass doors to the outside something else you rarely see in a Hotel anymore, windows that open! Other places were much more expensive I'm glad I picked the Warwick.

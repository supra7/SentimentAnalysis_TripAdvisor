The hotel is located about 2 blocks from the Link Light Rail Westlake Station, the best and cheapest ($2.75) way to get to/from Sea/Tac. The hotel is twin 47 story towers so you have a pretty nice view of downtown and Elliott Bay. The room was nice and they seemed to make the most out of the available space. The Corner Cafe is overpriced and they charge excessively for any business related need ($50 to accept boxes from FedEx). Internet in your room costs so just use your lappy in the spacious lobby were it's complimentary to get online. The Westin is about 5 easy walking blocks to the Pike Market as well as the Convention Center. No major complaints (I'd stay there again)although you seemingly have to pay inflated prices for everything although that's probably true for all downtown hotels.

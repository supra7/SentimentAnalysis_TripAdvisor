My girlfriend & I organized a weekend in Seattle to see a show, shop & take in the Seattle sites! We travelled on the Clipper from Victoria & booked the Mayflower Park Hotel as one of their recommendations. From the moment we checked in, we felt like VIP's and nothing was too much trouble for the friendly & very efficient staff throughout the hotel! We thoroughly enjoyed the facilities in the hotel, with 2 visits to Oliver's lounge! What a fabulous place for ambience, delicious appetizers & a great variety of drink selections! The concierge was very helpful with suggesting restaurants & directions to the Pike Street Market, shopping areas & the theatre for the musical, 'Mary Poppins'. We were within walking distance for everything, which was fabulous! Many thanks to the Mayflower Park Hotel management & staff for such a delightful stay! Lindy Van Alstine & Mary Garraway

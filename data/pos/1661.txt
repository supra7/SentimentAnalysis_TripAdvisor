We only stayed one evening here after our cruise and it was lovely. The check in person was very friendly and helpful, the (deluxe) room was large and the linens were great - pillows, bedding, towels, etc. The room was very clean and decorated in a traditional style. The lobby area was lovely with chandeliers and fresh flowers. All the employees there were wonderful. They had a happy hour that had shrimp coconut, breaded shrimp, vegetables & dip....it was great. They kept our luggage the next day until we departed. They also have free internet service. The hotel was much classier than the one we stayed at before our cruise (the Warwick).....a little bit more money but it was worth it. We would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again.

The bed had Frette linens and was comfortable. The sheets had some stains and a hole. The room was large and the bath nice, but there was a constant noise all night long and I couldn't figure out what it was. We were on the top floor so I settled on it being noise from the roof. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. No view on the back side but I was warned. I wanted a higher level and that was all that was left.

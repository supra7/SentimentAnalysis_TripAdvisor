Hotels in Seattle are ridiculously expensive so if you can get a good internet deal, thats a bonus. We managed to do that for one night at the Crowne Plaza and were pleasantly surprised when upon check in, we were upgraded to a larger room, with a great view of the Space Needle. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable and there was a little 'pamper' pack waiting for us. Why do these large chain hotels charge for internet? We've stayed in many smaller hotels that offer free wifi and I find it hard to believe that larger hotels couldn't do the same. Surely these days, providing internet is like providing TV access, everyone wants it. Also, upon checking out, we asked the bell clerk where the taxi rank was and he just told us it was up the road. I would have thought for a hotel of this standard, he would have offered to call a cab for us or flag one down, instead of us having to drag our suitcases up over a busy intersection.

This hotel was very nice - the lobby, the rooms, and the location. The location was fabulous - my husband and I were able to walk everywhere we went - to the shops, market, restaurants, bars, docks. (There are a lot of hils though - down towards the shopping district was a bit flatter!) We never ate there, so I can't comment on that; but there were plenty of great places around, and the lady at the front desk gave us a breakfast recommendation that was one of the best breakfast I've had ... Lola, right on 4th St.! It was a great weekend, everyone was super nice, and the accomadations were excellent. I would love to go back!

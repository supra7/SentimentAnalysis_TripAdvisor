Just held my daughter's wedding reception in the Forest Room and all attending stayed at the hotel. It was beyond wonderful - accommodations, staff unbelievably helpful and friendly, food delicious (I have four lbs. I didn't have when I left Fort Lauderdale to prove it!!). All in all, I would recommend it to anyone for a wonderful Seattle experience - I would stay no where else. The waterfront views and those of Puget Sound are exceptional. Easy walking distance to Aquarium, Pike Street Market and tons of restaurants. My son ran every morning and enjoyed new sights every day. Also, easy walk to the fabulous downtown area, which is full of fun and great shops.

This charming hotel is in an excellent, safe location within walking distance of interesting restaurants, theaters, the Space Needle, the Experience Music Project, the Pacific Science Center, and public transportation to both downtown and the U District. The staff was friendly and helpful. A bonus is the complementary shuttle service to downtown. Our room was clean and comfortable, containing a kitchenette. Although the hotel was full, we did not hear any other guests, indicating good soundproofing in the walls. My only complaint is that the ceiling fan and window air conditioner are noisy, but they don't need to be turned on. In addition, we could hear water running continually through the pipes, slightly distracting us during the night. However, these minor annoyances do not detract from the remarkable value of this hotel.

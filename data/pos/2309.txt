I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The room was clean, small but comfortable, everything worked well, and the staff was all very pleasant. There is a cardio room with an eliptical, bike, and treadmill, that I think is new. I used it and it is small and worked well for my needs. I looked out to the new Seattle Library, which was fantastic. I walked everywhere, but remember that the downtown area is in the "free zone' of the Metro, so you can hop on a bus and to to another part of the free zone. And, I had 2 beautifully sunny days in Seattle! A fantastic place!

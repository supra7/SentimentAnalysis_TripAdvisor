We stayed at the Moore hotel for 5 nights in May. Location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to Pikes Market. Room was spacious and clean, bathroom was good. Even though it is in an older building, everything in the room was in good working condition. Excellent value for money considering how expensive hotels are in Seattle. Friendly front desk. We traveled with our 1 year old, and there is a crib available for use. (There was some confusion when we arrived as to whether the hotel does have portable cribs - but they do!). Would definitely recommend the Moore hotel.

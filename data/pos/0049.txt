I booked a room here that they upgraded to a lovely suite (with separate elevator I might add) for just a few extra bucks. I stayed here on my first visit to Seattle and I was not disappointed. I ordered room service for dinner my first night and had one of the best burgers ever, and the gentleman that delivered it could not have been nicer. The staff greeted me everytime I left or came back to the hotel. A big plus for me was the free copies of the NYTs in the morning and also coffee and wine (free ) in the lovely lobby area. I would definitely return here without a doubt!

The vintage was a very nice stay. we stayed 2 nights and enjoyed it very much. If there was a down side the view out back wasn't that nice, but once the lights are out it's all good. Quiet, clean tidy, well appointed. I had quite a number of questions for the front counter and they were very patient and worked at ensuring my questions were answered, The free coffee downstairs is nice and even nicer is the wine tasting. Nice opp to conect with other visitors. Choice of paper in the morning which was a nice touch.

Chef Cindy was the best I have ever met. She really makes you feel "at home." She is meticulous when preparing the food. She gets your order as exact as possible. She is very friendly, courteous, humorous, etc. My wife and I loved her. The staff was very nice and helpful. Our room was very clean. The manager, Jim Miller, came out to see how we were doing. I told him and Cindy that I did not know the great treatment/service they provided still existed.

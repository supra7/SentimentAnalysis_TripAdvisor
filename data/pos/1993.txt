We stayed at the Moore for two nights. It was exactly as I had expected - very convenient to downtown Seattle with clean but pretty bare-bones rooms. We weren't looking for a luxury hotel, so this fit our needs perfectly. Staff was very friendly and all the necessities, including a small fan since there was no a/c, were there. Couldn't ask for much more at such a good rate. I also enjoyed the fun decor.

For a classy hotel close to downtown but away from the hubbub, stay at the Sorrento. We got a "Sweet Dreams" package, which included a king room, valet parking, and hot breakfast for two. It was truly a sweet deal. From the minute we arrived, we were treated like royal guests. Service was impeccable. This is a hotel with atmosphere - it's historic, built by architect Harlan Thomas in 1909 in Italian Renaissance style with a handsome interior decor. Our room was bright and airy with a luxurious king bed (love those plump pillows) and marble bathroom. We had all the amenities: WIFI, flat panel tv with free HBO, bath robes and toiletries. This was our perfect choice for our first night in Seattle, where we could relax and not have to go anywhere after a long day of travel. The hotel has its own bar and restaurant, so we enjoyed a drink during Happy Hour (half off on wine and beer) in their clubby Fireside Room, with its tiled open fireplace and mahogany-panelled walls. We then dined at their Hunt Club restaurant and had a very good meal with attentive, friendly service. After a quiet night's rest, we enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the same restaurant. Some people may prefer to be in the heart of downtown, but we were grateful for the quiet of the more residential neighborhood of First Hill. The hotel offers a free car service to downtown, which is minutes away. There is also a good cafe/coffee shop just across the street for a good cup of Joe, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items. My only complaint, and it's small, is that the music at the Fireside Room was too loud and really not appropriate for such a classy place. Maybe some of the old classics would be more in tune with the clubby chairs and dark panelled walls. I must say, when we requested the music be turned down, they complied graciously. But that's a mere quibble. This is a hotel we would happily return to if we come back to Seattle.

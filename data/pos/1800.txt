I grabbed this good deal on Hotwire for about $80 per night. Of course, being right in the city, we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for $20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State, and a great way to end our vacation. Since we left the car with the valets (and didnt want to pay for parking around the city), we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel, and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks), but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks). We stayed on the 8th floor, looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.

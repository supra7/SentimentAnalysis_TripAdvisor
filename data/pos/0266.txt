We stayed at the Hotel Monaco over Fourth of July weekend. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and decorated in a very funky style that I would never in a million years copy for my own home, but was a fun departure from boring for the weekend. The hotel was centrally located downtown, quite close to the Market and the ferry terminals. It was a great value and we would definitely stay there again.

This hotel is fantastic in so many ways. Check-in was a breeze as we were warmly welcomed. Upon inspecting our corner room, I saw that it was 2 double beds for our romantic getaway, which was not what I had planned. In a few minutes after calling the front desk, the clerk personally came up to accompany us to the same room 2 floors higher with a king bed--perfect! It was a suite but we have never seen such spacious hotel accommodations. The living room was huge & the bedroom oversized as well. The bathroom was tiny, but not a problem. We have a round window that opened from the shower & it was fun to open it a crack & watch the street below as I showered! However, the street below was a problem overnight because the Sorrento is 2 blocks from the Virginia Mason emergency room entrance where all the ambulances begin & end. I was awakened by sirens all night long, & this wasn't even over a weekend! That is the only negative aspect of our stay, but it's enough to keep me from going back. We ate in their restaurant which was outstanding. We frequently utilized their free shuttle service to the downtown area. It is also close enough to walk if you have the energy and time and aren't carrying a boatload of shopping bags. We did not need a car while we were there which meant we did not use the valet. The staff was outstanding in every encounter I had with them. The beds were great, the view isn't great, but the windows were large. And the interior of the hotel is just plain gorgeous. The coffee bar is very nice since we love French-pressed coffee & there is a small frig in the room as well. I only wish it was in a quieter location. I booked this stay through booking.com and was pleased to find that this did not affect how we were treated at all.

Im not really a review person, but I felt compelled to write one for the Sorrento because frankly I hope they open one in every city around the globe! Even though there is much to explore in Seattle, I had a hard time leaving the cozy lobby of the Sorrento. With it's soft lighting and comfy couches, its easy to find yourself still by the fire- hours later-listening to someone playing the baby grand while sipping a glass of wine. My room was extremely spacious with big windows that you can actually open to get some fresh air, the bed was like a thick puffy cloud, and there were many tasty treats in the room. I'm looking forward to my return to the Sorrento Hotel very soon!

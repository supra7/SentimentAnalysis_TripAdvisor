You can believe all of the reviews, this place really is great. It is what hospitality is all about. My daughter has just graduated from UW and this is the hotel we have stayed at from day one, and we kept coming back. From the pleasant and welcoming lobby, 24 hour offering of quality tea and coffee, outstanding free breakfast (make your own waffles, hard boiled eggs, cereals and oatmeal, etc.), afternoon snack, free shuttle service around town, convenience to UW campus, comfortable and clean rooms to free parking, you cannot beat it. My parents even drove up with their dog for the graduation and they accomodated them with one of their pet friendly rooms. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. They do a great job!

We stayed at The Westin Seattle August 12-15, 2007. We loved this hotel. The rooms are a good size with a sitting area and a very comfy bed. This hotel is located in the heart of downtown so you can walk to shopping, Pike Place Market and many restaurants. The staff was helpful and answered any questions we had. Beware that the parking is $32 a day. Although that may be typical for downtown parking but I was under the impression it was $16 a day so it was a shock when we checked out. We were traveling with our 4 month old baby so we did not eat in the hotel restaurants. The Westin gym was excellent with t.v.s on all cardio equipment. The pool and hot tub in the north tower are very nice. I would recommend this hotel. The Westin does not disappoint.

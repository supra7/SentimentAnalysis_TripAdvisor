When we first arrived the front desk girl was absoulutly amazing. Very friendly and helpful. Only thing I was upset about is we were told during reservation making our room king suite with jacuzzi tub was on a upper floor so you can see the space needle. Well not so much. Got a great view of the rooms of the travelers lodge. Lol. Wasn't a huge deal. Still had a great time for our first time there.

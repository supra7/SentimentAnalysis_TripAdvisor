we walked 4 blocks from the westlake lightrail station too the warwick and had no problem at all finding the hotel. the hotel checked us in within minutes with a freindly welcome and smile. the room was large enough too not feel cramped and the step out balcony was a great benifit. we saw the space needle straight out of our balcony door on the 8th floor. the sitting area with a fire place in the loby was nice and quiet. also the bar had a very freindly and helpful bartender. we did not eat at the resturant on site. the cinama was right across the street and we did not have any problem with any street noise. the only people we saw hanging around the cinama where passengers waiting for the bus. the room was very clean and the bathroom was in good clean condition and everything worked fine. the free ammenities in the bathroom were of good quality and looked new. we had a great nights sleep on the queen comfortable beds with no noise from anything in the hotel. the walk too pikes market and the waterfront was very easy too get too. go straight down lanora street and acroos too pikes street. the walk back was a bit of a struggle with the hill going back up. but that happens with all hotels that are above the hill downtown. a small convenient store was a block away that had the soda and wine we needed too take on the ship. the prices are high but that is too be expected. we got up early and went back down too the market but nothing opens up except the coffee shops untill 9am. so we caught the monorail at the westlake station and went too walk around the space needle. our check out in the morning was quick and easy since we had used the credit card too book the room. a cab ride too pier 91 was $15 plus a gratuity. it was a wonderful place too stay for the night and i will definetely use this hotel again.

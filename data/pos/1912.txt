This is a perfect hotel in a wonderful spot. Not only were the staff friendly and knowledgeable, but the room was terrific. It was very comfortable and had all the amenities. I will stay here anytime I am in Seattle and recommend it to all. Be sure and call the hotel and ask about specials. If you don't ask, they won't tell.

The ambience of a stately old hotel cannot be replicated. The cool marble bathrooms, the luxurious beds and great pillows, the cozy bar and fireplace are from an era when "hotel" meant 'stay a while' and 'relax'. This is the kind of place that is hard to leave. The staff are young, helpful and courteous. We stay here at least once a year and our enjoyment never diminishes. Our stay at the Sorrento is always an important part of our plans.

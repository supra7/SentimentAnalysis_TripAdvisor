I stayed at this hotel for a few days as a little vacation. At first I was nervous because I read some bad reviews of this place online, but the price was great for a student so I decided to stay. I arrived early from the airport and couldn't check in yet because it was so early, but they held my bags for me and gave me a walking map so I could go visit the nearby Space Needle and Experience Music Project. The location of this hotel is amazing, right by everything I wanted to see! I didn't realize until I checked in, but they have a free continential breakfast in the morning with great muffins, bagels, fresh fruit, juice, and coffee/tea. The staff was friendly and helpful and answered all my questions. They even called another room above mine where the guests were being too loud for me to sleep and asked them to be quiet. I appreciated their help so much, I'll certainly stay there again.

I'm a Seattle native and have driven past the historic hotel thousands of times, always wanting to stay there. My husband surprised me with a stay at the Sorrento for my birthday this year. The Sorrento was even better than I expected. I love its historic charm, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Thanks to the complimentary car service, we left our car in the garage and played tourist in our hometown. The car service dropped us off downtown so we could shop, eat and sightsee, then we rang him when we were ready to return. He was there within minutes to wisk us back to the hotel where we had a drink in the fireside room and listened to live jazz. The whole experience was top-notch! I highly recommend the Sorrento Hotel for visitors to my amazing hometown.

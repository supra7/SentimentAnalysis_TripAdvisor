Westin is right in the middle of the shopping area of the downtown and exactly one block away from the light rail station which connects downtown to the airport. The fare in about 3 dollars. Most helpful reception, service will do just what you ask them for. The gym is a typical hotel gym. The pool and tanning area looked attractive, but I didn't use either. The structure of the conference center suggests that the hotel is designed to host large conferences. What this means for the holiday traveler hard to say. The room didn't disappoint in any way. Everything was well designed and of consistent quality of construction. The only exception was the tub and the shower curtain. The tub was a basic plastic tub found in any hotel and so was the curtain. I didn't give it a high value score because I needed specific dates and the bulk bookings ran out of stock so I booked through expedia. If it didn't then the value would be excellent.

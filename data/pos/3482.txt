This hotel has a modern fashionable, vibe, but remains relaxing, comfortable and friendly. The rooms are spacious and (most importantly) quiet and comfortable. I really can't say enough good things about the staff and management - they really take that extra effort to make sure you have everything you need to make your stay relaxing and comfortable. The hotel staff was, without exception, friendly, courteous and efficient, particularly the bellmen and the valets - very attentive, friendly and prompt. I have stayed in many world class hotels, including the Fairmont Olympic, but frankly, the Andra (and sister hotel, Mondera, in Portland) are really something special. Oh, and don't forget Lola next door! Order the doughnuts with marscapone and house-made preserves.

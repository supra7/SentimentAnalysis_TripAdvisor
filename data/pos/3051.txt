Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 6 nights for a work-related conference and to visit family in the Seattle area. Loved the central location just 5 blocks from Pike's Market and the original Starbucks and 3 blocks from a main city bus depot. The room was large and very clean, good quality linens. Lobby was a nice place to wait for colleagues and catch up on email with 6 computers available to guests. Great hotel.

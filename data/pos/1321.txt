We booked a double room on the executive level, which costs a bit more but is well worth it. Our room was spacious, with a spectacular view of the city, Space Needle, and part of Elliott Bay. Our beds were comfortable and, as they hotel promised, our floor was quiet, except for the second night, when a bunch of drunks were in the executive lounge talking loudly after 11:00 p.m. We called the front desk, and they immediately addressed the issue and it was quiet after 15 minutes. Staff is courteous, friendly and attentive. That alone makes this place noteworthy, in my book, as I have had too many incidents with rude hotel staff in my lifetime. Staying on the executive level provided us with nice amenities such as "quiet zones", complimentary evening hors d'oeuvres, bottled water, complimentary continental breakfast, a room safe, mini fridge, among others. The only reason why I did not give this an excellent rating was the elevator issue. They have four elevators, but only two were in operation, which made it very slow going! Fortunately whenever staff saw us waiting, they allowed us to use the faster service elevator they use themselves, which is another reason to laud the great staff at this hotel. Valet parking is $30.00 per night, which is standard for a downtown Seattle hotel. Parking is secured, which is better than at the Hilton. Our location was great, allowing us to walk everywhere and experience the bustle of downtown Seattle, yet when we returned to our room, it was like a peaceful, private oasis. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and will certainly stay again when I want to spend the night in downtown Seattle.

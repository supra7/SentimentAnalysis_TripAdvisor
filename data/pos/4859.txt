We stay at the University Inn several times a year. We love so many things about this hotel: the great location in the U District (Go Dawgs!), the friendly staff, the clean and modern rooms...all offered at excellent rates. The University Inn is an exceptional value. We always feel so comfortable at the University Inn. The complimentary breakfast offered each morning in the lobby is really impressive. My husband especially loves the Belgian waffle irons and I am partial to the hard boiled eggs. Warm apple cider and hot chocolate are always available in the lobby. I cannot say enough about this property. Also, a huge bonus is that Pagliacci will deliver their amazingly good pizza right to your room! You will be comfortable and feel cared for at the University Inn. I cannot even consider staying somewhere else when in Seattle.

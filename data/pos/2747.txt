Got a great deal under $100 for the Sheraton. The positive: Walk to Pike, Shopping, Convention Center. Free wifi in lobby. Room was basic but clean and satisfactory. Great Coffee just down the street! (Monorail Codfee) The negative: Parking is $35!! At a lot a block away! Latte in lobby cafe was the worst I ever had. Lobby feels cold and uninviting. Pool and exercise area overlooking the city on 35th floor. Overall, a good place if you don't want to drive. No wow factor, but worth the price. I would stay again.

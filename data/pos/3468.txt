This is a great boutique hotel, with the standard sleek modernist decor. The rooms are extremely comfortable, with nice pillows and sheets. The room was large enough for me to be very comfortable. There is a great restaurant (Lola) in the hotel which serves a sort of fusion Greek tapas. The staff seems a bit surly (or perhaps just stretched thin during my stay) but they are professional and took care of all my needs, including a last-minute change of arrival due to weather. Stayed here instead of at the big conference Westin around the corner where my meeting was being held-- it was a good choice as I was probably closer to the meeting rooms than some of the guest rooms in that massive hotel.

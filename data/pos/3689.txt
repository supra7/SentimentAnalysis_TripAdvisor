Made reservation online which went very well. Received a very nice King bed room with a beautiful water view. Prior to my stay I received an offer to upgrade our room for $40.00 which I did not respond to. I was thankful that a previous reviewer noted the addition $36 + valet charge so was not surprised by it. I would stay again and would want the same room. It was spacious and warm once the fireplace heated the room. It had a great bathroom with doors that opened to the room. It had a shower and big claw tub. I loved the bear foot stool and the northwestern decor.

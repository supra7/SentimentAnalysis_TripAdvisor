You can't beat the location just one block from the water, the best seafood, restaurants and Pike Place Market. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was large, very clean and the bed was extra comfortable. This location was much better than towards downtown (near Nordstroms) where things are scungy. My husband and I loved our two-night stay here I would definitely stay here again.

Despite the negative reviews some others have said about The Westin Seattle, we had an absolutely fabulous time. We were placed on the 35th floor and had a view of both waterways of Seattle. We felt like we were living on top of the world! The king beds are incredibly soft and they had a two-headed shower system for total relaxation. The lobby was chic with a lot of businesspeople lounging and it's within steps of a wonderful pizza joint-- Serious Pie-- and of course, as many Starbucks coffee shops that you need. Perfect location, beautiful hotel, great rooms-- what more could you want? I would definitely ask for a room on an upper floor-- totally worth it!

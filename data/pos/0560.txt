We had stayed at the Warwick mostly because of its central location (in the heart of downtown and close to Qwest field), and figured with its reasonable price and free shuttle - why not try it? Even before we had arrived at the hotel we received great customer service! Well, we were lost (google directions weren't very good) and it was dark, so we called the hotel and the lady who answered the phone stayed with us on the phone directing us to the hotel until we dropped our car off with the valet. The parking may be pricey, but the free shuttle service the hotel has, more than made up for the cost! Also, because we were in downtown we walked to Macy's, Bed Bath & Beyond and to the mall. The restaurant in the hotel was very good! But a tip - make reservations for Sunday brunch because it gets quite busy. The service was great, the rooms were very comfortable and clean. The water pressure was lacking but that was the only con during the whole trip. We had a paper delivered to our door every morning...what can I say except that we have already booked another trip to Seattle this November and we are of course staying at the Warwick again!

We were awoken to loud violence in the room above ours. We weren't sure if someone was being abused, hurt, or killed, but once we called the front desk which alerted security which further alerted the police. It took over an hour for the ruckus to end, but once it did, we did not feel secure staying in the room right below the violence ridden one. They easily moved us to another room, and awarded us with points because of the problem. The staff did what they could, although could have been quicker, and the hotel has very nice furnishings.

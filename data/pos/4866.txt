Not too far from the airport, but not close to downtown. You have to take the train or a cab to reach downtown. It was a decent price for the room. Clean and semi-quiet. It was not ready when we arrived but they let us in anyway while the maids were cleaning. Nice staff. Right next to the Space Needle so that was awesome.

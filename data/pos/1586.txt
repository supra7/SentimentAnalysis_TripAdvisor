My recent two night trip to the Mayflower was great! Upon checking in, I found that I'd been upgraded and had a nice large confortable room with a king size bed. The staff was fantastic, (front desk, out front, conceirge and restaurant) helpful, pleasant, professional and went the extra mile. Whether it was walking me to a specific door and giving me directions, arranging for cabs or ensuring I had the copies I needed for a business trip, they really provided great service. I'd definitely stay here again... reasonable rate, great location and overall a really nice hotel experience.

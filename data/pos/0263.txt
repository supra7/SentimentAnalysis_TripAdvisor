It is pretty evident from the get go that the staff at this hotel want to make your visit a memorable one. From check in to check out we were treated in a warm and friendly manner with people going out of their way to cater to our every need. That in itself makes me want to return. The hotel is within walking distance to the Heart of the City. It is extremely quiet considering the location. The rooms are spacious and super comfortable, with well appointed large bathrooms. We noticed refillable bottles of shampoo and soap, which indicated their efforts to minimize waste. They offer complementary coffee and pastries in the morning in the main lobby. In the evening they host a complementary wine tasting event which allows you to mingle with other guests and share dining and/or shopping tips. Very pleasant. The hotel restaurant is not outstanding but certainly adequate for a casual meal or Happy Hour. We enjoyed our meal there but if you are looking for a gourmet experience there are better choices close by. We will certainly make this our regular Seattle hotel based on location, comfort and service.

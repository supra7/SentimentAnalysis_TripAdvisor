Our family of five stayed two nights at the MarQueen and were very comfortable. We got a suite with 2 king beds and a pull out couch. The room size was enormous - it had three separate areas including a large kitchen area. The beds were luxurious, plush bathrobes in the closet were a nice touch, the front desk staff was warm and helpful, and continental breakfast was included and ample. When we travel as a family, we usually stay at a cheaper chain hotel, but the MarQueen pricing was similar and we felt like we were in a bed and breakfast. Our teenagers loved this experience and we'd definitely stay here again!

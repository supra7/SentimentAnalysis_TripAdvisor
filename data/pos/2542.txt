We stayed for a night in September to sightsee in Seattle before moving on to Hawaii for the rest of our vacation. The hotel is well situated for everything we needed to see in the City and close to excellent restaurants. We were allocated a great room on the 25th floor with access to the Exec Lounge where complimentary canapes were served from 5-7pm and drinks were available thereafter. This was the same place where breakfast was served next morning - great views across the bay to start the day. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and we felt welcomed and valued guests. The hotel is showing signs of age and the room decor is a little dated but all in all we were very happy with our experience and we'd recommend the Hilton Seattle for your stay in the City.

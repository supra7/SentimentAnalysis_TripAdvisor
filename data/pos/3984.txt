I really enjoyed my stay at the Edgewater. Things are pricey but you do get what you pay for. I had an amazing harbor view room, they hang out over the water and the windows open. On afternoon I hand fed some seagulls! The staff was also great. Everyone I encountered, from front desk to maintaince, smiled and said hello. It was nice to see customer service taken so seriously! The only slight drawback is the location, there aren't many easy walks. The closet places to eat and shop are up a pretty steep hill. The good news is that the Edgewater has a shuttle that will drop you off anywhere downtown (and pick you up!).

Older hotel in Downtown and walking distance to major attractions -- Space Needle, Monorail, Pike Place. Stayed 3 nights over a long weekend. Room was very clean and had everything I needed. Hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Restaurant is nice and well priced. The staff there is great. My friend has some dietary restrictions and they tried very hard to work with the chef to accomodate her needs. I had heard about the "gentlemen's club" behind the hotel and was a bit worried about the noise so I asked for a room on the Sixth Avenue side. Fifth floor was quiet with just the usual city street noises in the morning, but being downtown I expected that. Hotel is non-smoking, which I appreciated, so don't stay here if you smoke. Someone on the floor must have been smoking in their room because it made the entire hall like cigarette smoke one night. If you want luxury then probably not the place for you, but if you want a reasonably priced hotel with a great location and friendly staff, then stay here.

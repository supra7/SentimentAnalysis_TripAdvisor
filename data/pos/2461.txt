Very clean, very helpful and nice staff that seem so happy. When I checked out super early to catch my 7 am flight, I rushed out of my room and left my earrings. When the hotel, they found them in the room for me and arranged to have them shipped for free!! This hotel is in a great location to walking to downtown and pioneer square. Definitely recommend staying here.

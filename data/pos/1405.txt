What a great find this hotel is - perfectly located for the Space Needle, McCaw Hall and on bus routes to all parts of Seattle. The room we had was large with a kitchenette, bath and there is tea and coffee avalaibel 24 hours a day in the hotel lobby. The included breakfast was great and the gardens of the hotel where we sat and ate it are immaculate! We would definitely stay here again!

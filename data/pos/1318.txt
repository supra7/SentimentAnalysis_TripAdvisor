This was my second stay at this location. Great view, nice room. As a Priority Club Member(Intercontinental Hotels' Loyalty program), I was given a nice little package upon arrival, which told me I could locate my complimentary drinks and snacks in the refrigerator in my room. You guessed it, no fridge, no snacks, no drinks. Not that big of a deal, just an irritating detail. Elevators are SLOW. Give yourself about ten minutes to get down to the lobby. Also, water pressure/hot water in my room was abysmal. Valet parking is mandatory, and costs $30.00/day. Ridiculous, but par for the course in Seattle. The good: nicely accoutremented room(save for the missing fridge), with a brand new, huge flatscreen, comfy beds/linens, and a giant window to look out over the city. Spectacular view. Internet service was fast when it worked, which was about 80% of the time. This will set you back $10.00/day. I recommend it, but cautiously. Seems like you should get just a little more bang for your buck at these prices.

Stayed here for 3 night precruise. We were pretty exhausted arriving after almost 24 hours of flying as you can imagine. Check in was swift and efficient, perhaps a little clinical but I didn't care, I just wanted the room fast! The rooms turned out to be spacious, comfortable and everything worked. The coffee in the room was delicious! You can't beat the location, it is close to everything.

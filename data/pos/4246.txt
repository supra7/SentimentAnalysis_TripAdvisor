The Westin staff are friendly and helpful, the place is clean and the beds are very comfortable. The room I was in was spacious and decently furnished. The location is very convenient for most Downtown stuff -Pike St Market, Shopping, Convention centre etc. It's clean but clearly been a while since it was decorated, and the lifts do seem a bit ancient. The swimming pool was good and I enjoyed its use, though the broken lockers in the locker room were a minor annoyance. My only real gripe with the stay is the quality of the Wireless Internet - fortunately it was included in my corporate rate, but for $10/day I would expect it to be far more usable than it was (forget using Skype). So, maybe wouldn't rush back but a decent hotel i'd stay in again.

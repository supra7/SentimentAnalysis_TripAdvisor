This is a great classy hotel in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is a very short 10 minute walk to Pike's Market, the downtown library, Belltown area, and many other areas. We booked the tickets through priceline and we were able to get a great price. Our room faced 6th avenue and had a view of the water in the distance. Pros: location, comfortable bed, very helpful staff, and they stored our luggage even after we had checked out. Cons: you had to pay for internet access daily. I would definitely stay here again.

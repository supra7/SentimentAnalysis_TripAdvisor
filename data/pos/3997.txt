We stayed here the second night of our honeymoon! It was fantastic and we both loved it!! Room was small but cozy with one of the best views I have ever seen!! Nice deck and fireplace and so relaxing and quiet. Wonderful gift shop downstairs and awesome lobby. We got a great deal through Hotels that included a waterfront view, parking and a full delicious breakfast which could either be room service or at the hotel restaurant on directly the water!! It is a great location, a nice walk to many attractions and restaurants. We walked to lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory. The staff was a little snooty, but not rude. The concierge was great and recommended an awesome sushi restaurant for dinner. Sushi was very fresh, they had a tasty and creative martini menu, and a good, free, live 3-piece jazz band playing. We took the hotel's free shuttle there and took a very pleasant evening stroll back to the hotel after dinner. The next day we flew to Hawaii, but have often said we also could have spent our whole honeymoon at the Edgewater. Highly recommend!!

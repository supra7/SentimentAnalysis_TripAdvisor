Stayed here for New years and it was wonderful. I have stayed here many times and never had many issues although we are pretty easy to please. I had some issues clarifying reservation information and prices due to the holiday. However, I sent an email and was helped very quickly and efficiently by the reservations manager. We were in an Executive Suite (with a view of the space needle) on the 27th Floor. The even numbered rooms face the city and have the amazing views of downtown. Check in was quick and easy. I have stayed in these rooms before. They have a fridge and TV in the Living room and a desk. The bedrooms have a King bed, flat screen TV and youll will find a welcome kit on the bed with ear plugs, lavender spray, eye mask, etc. the bathroom is located off the bedroom and is nice with a spacious shower. For those complainers and nit pickers, the carpet is starting to wear a bit and the room feels a bit older with living room furniture that is worn down. Bartender was friendly and efficient even though they were short staffed. He seemed to know what was going on. I have worked in the restaurants and I could tell some of the bar/restaurant servers seemed confused, but it was a holiday so who knowsThey just kept asking the bartender about what wines they carried and what drinks, stuff like that. And thats just me having that restaurant background so I always examine servers and operations closely. We enjoyed our stay and always like staying here. Friendly staff, great views, and location to everything make it a good choice.

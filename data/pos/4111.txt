I am a frequent business traveler and stay at the Sorrento, on average, once a week. The staff provide the most amazing customer service and I have come to know many of them on a first name basis - I watch how their customer service is consistent whether you're a frequent traveler such as myself, or a brand new guest. The hotel is quiet, cozy, in a great location and affordable. The rooms are very clean and the ambiance is unmatched! The hotel bar is gorgeous! They recently changed their menu, and while some of my favorites are no longer available, the quality of the food is still exceptional. Whether you're a business traveler in need of fast service and wifi access, or a couple celebrating a special weekend - the Sorrento is the place to be! My favorite hotel in Seattle - business or pleasure!

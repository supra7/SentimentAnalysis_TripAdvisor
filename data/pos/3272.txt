After looking at a number of higher priced hotels in downtown Seattle, we opted for the Sixth Avenue Inn and were quite pleased with the choice. Nothing fancy, but clean and very well located to walk Seattle. It's probably 10 to 15 minutes to walk to Pike Place and the waterfront, and 10 minutes the other way to Seattle Center and the Space Needle. The hotel itself is a bit old but well managed and the surrounding area is just downtown Seattle, nothing more and nothing less. Definitely would recommend staying here, saving a few bucks and spending it on a nice lunch at the Space Needle.

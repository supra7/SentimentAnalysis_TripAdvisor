We had a great stay. The hotel is in the middle of town so you could walk everywhere with ease. The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful. The concierges were excellent and were always happy to advise and give ideas and directions. They even booked all our trips which saved us time. . All attractions were good and within walking distance from the hotel The rooms were very comfortable and offered all comforts. Having the internet was handy. We were happy with our stay and after five weeks in other hotels in USA we couldn't complain. Seattle is an interesting place and in the 5 days it only rained one morning which was great for Seattle we believe. In fact it was warm and sunny. A thoroughly enjoyable stay

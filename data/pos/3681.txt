We chose this waterfront hotel for the location and the larger rooms can hold a family of five. Being the only hotel on the water, it was enjoyable falling asleep to the sounds of water lapping. The hotel rooms all have working fireplaces, really! Welcoming you is a black teddy bear on your bed. The bathrooms were modern, slate tiles with a soothing rainshower. On each visit, we had waterfront rooms, we did not visit the restaurants, however they looked quite nice. The hotel is situated on Pier 67, perfect for a walk to Pioneer Square, Pikes Place Market, all the fun restaurants on the Pier, as well as the Olympic Nature Park. We took the hotel's courtesy vehicle when possible; this was a very nice benefit. If you are taking a cruise on the Norwegian Cruise Line, their pier is literally right next door. Each morning we woke up to a large cruise ship, we never heard them arrive. Anyway, this make for a very convenient stop the night before a cruise...wish I had thought of that when we traveled by cruise to Alaska.

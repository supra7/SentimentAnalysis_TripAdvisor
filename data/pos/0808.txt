This Hotel is perfectly located downtown Seattle. Right next to Pike market, the waterfront, and great shopping. Waking up every morning to the smell of fresh baked pastries and hot coffee down at the market is wonderful. The hotel does not have a restaurant but has many great dining options in the area and the staff was very helpful about reccomending where to dine. At first I was disapointed that there was not an in house workout center, but was more than happy when given a pass to the downtown athletic club. The view from our room was amazing right over the water and market

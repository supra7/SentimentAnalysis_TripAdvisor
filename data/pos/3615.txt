I am in Seattle at least 4 times per year and always stay at the Westin or Hyatt. Because both were sold out, I tried the Hotel Andra. I was there for three nights and by the end of the third night, I new I would be back. Yes, the beds are great, and the rooms are modern cool. They charge for Wi-Fi but if you eat in the restaurant(which is top notch - especially for breakfast), you can log on for free. The deciding factor was the staff. Every person I encountered went out of their way to be nice and helpful. Always greeted with a smile and by name. The other hotels are nice but a bit too impersonal. Hotel Andra was really a nice break from the norm! I also highly recommend the Italian restaurant next door and Ettas about a 10 minute walk away.

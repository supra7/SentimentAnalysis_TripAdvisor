We loved the Inn at Queen Anne. My husband and I came to town to see Bon Jovi and we searched on line for hotels near the Key Arena. We were a little apprehensive due to the negative reviews, but found ourselves a hotel that we will return to again and again. You can't find a deal like this anywhere in Seattle. This hotel is not the Westin but it has a lot of charm and is in a perfect location.

My wife and I just spent the weekend of Jan. 12-13 at the Hotel Andra. The hotel staff including the doorman were always helpful and cheerful. We were upgraded to a jr. suite without asking. The suite was well appointed with a large work desk, flat screen tv, in room coffee maker, morning newspaper and a hide-bed/sofa combo if needed. The seperate bedroom included another flatscreen tv, a wonderful king sized bed, robes and extra pillows/ blankets in the closet. Yes, the bathrooms are a little small but come well equipped with all the bottled goodies, hairdryer and even bottled Oxygen if needed for hangover relief. The Hotel Andra is located in the Belltown area of downtown Seattle just a few blocks from the Pike Place Market, shopping at Nordstroms and the Pacific Place Mall. Many nice restuarants close by including our favorite spot for italian, Assaggio Ristorante which is located right next door to the Andra. The hotel has a very nice place to have drinks inside their restuarant with a greek flare, Lola's. We will return to the Hotel Andra next time when staying in the Emerald City.

Was there for 2 nights, Dec. 9-10. We stayed on the 29th floor, had an incredible view of the Space Needle, and the Bay. I booked a double bed room, the beds were small (full size). Only used 1 bed, definetly cozy for 2 people though. The hotel staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The prices were excellent. The valet parking was rather pricey too. Would definetly like to stay again with my Beautiful.

First time in Seattle and first time in a Kimpton Hotel. Great experience for both. Hotel was VERY conveniently located and we were able to walk to everything - Pike's Market, shopping & great restaurants. We already had made dinner reservations elsewhere, but did do apps and drinks at Sazerac's in the hotel. Great atmosphere and food. Would definitely eat there on our next trip. Nice completmentary wine hour where we met some other guests and got some suggestions for places to see. Staff was very accommodating. Overnight parking fee was pretty spendy, but it appeared to get the going rate.

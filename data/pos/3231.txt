We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel room. This is an older hotel and the carpet could have been a little cleaner. Overall, the room was clean the beds were fine and the staff was very helpful. The location was great for all the fun stuff to do in downtown Seattle. Compared to the price of some of the other hotels within a block of this one it was very affordable.

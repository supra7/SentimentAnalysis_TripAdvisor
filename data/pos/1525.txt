It is just a short cab ride to dowtown or if you can walk maybe 8 to Seattle Center and you can catch the monorail downtown. So many great restaurants within blocks, spendy or cheap. We used the grocery store just a block away to take advantage of the in room kitchen. It is a beautifully remodeled old building that is a real change from standard hotel rooms. Beds were very comfortable, just don't probably want to sleep on the pull out bed, but very comfortable, cozy sitting area. Staff was always pleasant and helpful.

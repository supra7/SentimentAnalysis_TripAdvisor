I loved this hotel. I had a wonderful view of the space needle and was literally 10 minutes walk from all the major attractions. My favourite part however was the bed; Oh my, how comfortable was this bed!?! Well, I could've slept for years on this bed! I went to the gym and it was a decent size and had all the usual equipment. The pool looked like it was a good size, but it was full of kids, so I stayed clear of it. Very enjoyable stay, highly recommended.

In Seattle for a conference with work and stayed at this hotel as it was one of the conference choices. Ironically we found a price online much less than what we had paid through the conference board, but that is to be expected as the date grows closer. Took a shuttle bus from the airport and were the last stop on his route so didn't arrive for check in until well after 7 pm but check in was a breeze and we had a fabulous view even at night from the 33rd floor. As we were in the city that week I really liked that the building was pretty easily identifiable from the ground and pretty centrally located to shops and restaurants. The staff was great, the room was spotless, and the menus at the shop and restaurants were good and reasonably priced. I love the heavenly bed. Did not get to use the pool or the exercise facilities at all, but my roommate did and she really liked the work-out area. Check out was flawless.

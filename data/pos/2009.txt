I think you will either love or hate this hotel - I loved it. You can't beat the location and value for money - close to Pike Place Market and the shopping district. You can walk most places and close to monorail for Space Needle and buses in centre are free if you need one. Okay so its very dated and the paint is peeling on the walls but the room was a good size and had a nice bathroom. Only a fan but with the weather in Seattle that's not a major issue. Staff were friendly and helpful.

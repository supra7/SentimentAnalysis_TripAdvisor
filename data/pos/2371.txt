Friendly staff, and generally a good vibe here. Like the concierge right at the door, and he pointed out some good restaurants. Strangeness in the HVAC in the meeting rooms. Sounded like a helicopter landing. This on top of the too-loud incipid hallway music that made its way into the meeting rooms made for some suckage. Photos are of the Presidential Suite, which had some great views and was nice enough, though lacking in some of the items (corkscrew? glasses?) that you would expect to find in any suite.

I was travelling to Downtown Seattle on business, and chose the Sheraton since the place I was going was literally a block away. My experience with some large chain hotels is that they tend to be loud. I found this Sheraton to be nice and quiet. The rates seemed reasonable for a downtown location, and I had a corner room with views down 6th and toward the water. There are a number of restaurants in close proximity, and the Daily Grill in the hotel had good food. There are more than one movie theaters near by for those who are interested. In general, a good stay, good sleep, good food and a friendly staff.

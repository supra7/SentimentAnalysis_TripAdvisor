Recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 10 nights.The hotel is situated in an excellent location downtown and proved to be an adequate base to explore the cities attractions and sights and the surrounding neighbourhoods.Our room was very spacious and well equipped and provided us with fantastic views.From the moment we arrived the service we received was of the highest standard,very professional and efficient.Particular mentions must go to Dylan on reception who offered a warm welcome after such a long journey and to Kimberley who worked the bar/lounge area in the evenings and always went out of her way to greet us with a smile and a friendly word.Had a fantastic time in Seattle and would not hesitate to stay here if visiting again.Overall a very satisfying and comfortable stay.

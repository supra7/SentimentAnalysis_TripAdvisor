I used Priceline and landed a room that's normally $275 per night for $130, so before showing up I was already pumped. We stayed one night in Seattle after finishing an Alaskan cruise. The hotel is in a great location, short walk to Pike's Place and the Monorail which then takes you to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project, so we were able to hit all of the tourist spots in one day. The hotel is round so every room has a great view. All and all I would recommend it, especially for a good price.

This was quite lovely, small rooms but very clean. I was scared from the reviews but as usual the hype was overrated. I had a double bed room, actually had two rooms which I didn't need but that was what I booked on Hotels.Com for the special of $149/night. Parking validated with the hotel is $21 overnight stay. Very Close to EVERYTHING, including Bainbridge Ferry, Downtown Shopping area, Pike's Place Market. Mini Bar looked expensively scary so I didn't touch anything in there. Bathroom was small but I have stayed in old hotels before and this is just the way they were built. No real view as I was in the back of the building but then again I didn't spend the evening looking out the window. GOOD CLEAN HOTEL, Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby and it was awesome. The elevators worked the whole time I was there, then again I only stayed one night. Everyone was very sweet. There was no wine reception as the hotels.com web site stated but I asked what compensation they would give for that and they sent up two small small bottles of White Zin. I'm not really a wine drinker so it didn't matter much to me. I would definitely recommend and stay here again.

The hotel is somewhat located outside of downtown, but they have fine parking space and a free shuttle service. You can find some nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. We liked the room (highest floor, parking side) it was quiet. Staff was very helpfull. Minusses were temperature of the outside pool and not enough tables and seats for the (complimentary) breakfast.

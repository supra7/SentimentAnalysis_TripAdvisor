This Hotel Monaco, like others, is a unique hotel experience that surpasses your average, standard, nice hotel. If you like the large chain hotels (i.e. Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) and prefer that type of standard room and amenities, do not stay at the Monaco. In my opinion, those hotels, while nice, begin to all look the same after some time. However, if you prefer a smaller, boutique-type hotel with surprising, unique and whimisal rooms, you'll love it here. The service at the front desk was excellent. The wine happy hour was very nice, serving local Snoqualamie wines. My room was wonderful with a wall of windows and window seats. I was happy to discover that windows also lined the wall of the bathroom - which I have never enjoyed in a hotel. (It is nice to have some natural light in a bathroom!) The Monaco offers an easy walk to the waterfront, shopping and Pike Place Market. One point worth mention: if you are walking to the waterfront, do not walk down the street at the corner of the hotel - the sidewalk there is very steep downwards. Instead, walk down 4th street towards the Market, and head down to the waterfront a few blocks down - the sidewalks are not so steep and scary there. And while you are staying at the Monaco, do not miss going inside the Seattle Public Library across the street. It is an architectual masterpiece and definitely not your average "library." Tours are also given daily. I've stayed at other Monaco hotels and thoroughly enjoyed this one, like the others. Any time I have the opportunity to stay at a Kimpton hotel, I will. I might also say, though, that the Kimpton Hotel Vintage Park, up the street from Monaco in Seattle, is not as impressive, but stays true to the unique hotel experience. If you have a choice, go Monaco.

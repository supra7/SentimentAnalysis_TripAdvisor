We stayed 3 nights with two children ages 5 and 7. Visiting Seattle for a sightseeing adventure. Hotel is located in the financial district across from the spectacular Seattle Library. It is a quick five minute walk from the Monorail and Pikes Market. The room was clean and quiet. We loved our goldfish and appreciated the kind attitude the staff had toward our kids. The cleaning staff was extremely thoughtful and friendly. The concierge was somewhat condescending and not 100% knowledgeable of the area. We asked if there was a spot to get ice cream and were told, "Seattle is not that kind of city". The next day we stumbled across a gelato shop two blocks away. There are several higher end restaurants, but if you want some mom and pop local flare within walking distance, they cater to the business lunch crowd and close at five. Unfortunately, we won't be returning because the "free internet" you get with the Kipton program did not work. I had a big work deadline and needed to upload a file. The transmit rate was 0. The front desk staff told me to call IT. I spent 30 minutes talking to them with no luck. Finally I packed up and headed to Starbucks next door, but they closed at 6 p.m. Very frustrating and a deal breaker for me.

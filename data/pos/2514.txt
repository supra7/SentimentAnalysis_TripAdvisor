We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last weekend. We arrived on Friday and left on Monday, and had no problem checking in or out, which took 2 minutes. The room wasn't too bad except we were assigned a room facing the freeway. The noise from the freeway didn't bother us at all and we were on the 10th floor. The bed was nice and comfortable. The most impressive service at this hotel was the concierge. Fred, one of the attendants took care of quite a few things for us before we arrived. He was very helpful and friendly, made some good suggestions to help us plan our weekend, saved us time and money. Overall it was a great experience and the service level was what we expected from a Marriott/Renaisance hotel.

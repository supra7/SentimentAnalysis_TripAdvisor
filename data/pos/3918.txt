This hotel was beautiful. What else can I say? I stayed on the first floor and then moved to the 3rd. The first room was gorgeous, but the walls were a little thin. My 3rd floor was much quieter. The rooms were identical, but I had a better view the second time around. Ask for a room higher than #1. If you can get waterview even better.

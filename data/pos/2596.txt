We stayed here one night in March. They were so so friendly and helpful. The room was updated, clean, and quiet. We had to check out early to make our connections but needed a quick bite to eat. The complimentary breakfast was a wonderful surprise. Usually these breakfasts contain mostly high carb items. The Quality Inn had scrambled eggs and bacon. They also had a tray of grilled onions and peppers to add to your eggs. The breakfast was a delicious treat!

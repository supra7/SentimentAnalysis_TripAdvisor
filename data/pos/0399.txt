We stayed in a suite at the Hotel Monaco which was just a few $ more than the quoted room. The valet met us and arranged for a bellman to get our bags and bring them to our room which was on the 9th floor tucked into the corner around from the elevator. It was amazingly quiet. We at at Tulio's at the Hotel Vintage Park. The chicken was scrumptious and the risotto was heaven with a hint of orange. It was roomy and included a 2-person jacuzzi tub in the bathroom in addition to shower stall, marble vanity and AVEDA products. After our roadtrip of 9-1/2 hours, the jacuzzi was welcome relief! We didn't order a goldfish pet but they were in the lobby downstairs, referred to as the living room and also in our elevator lobby. The king-size bed with soft, luxurious linens and comforter lulled me to sleep. I wouldn't miss dinner at The Georgian Room at the Fairmount around the corner. It too was amazing and costs almost the same as Tulio's. Food, service and atmosphere were outstanding! It's about 3 blocks downhill (ie up hill when you return) and 2 blocks over to Pike Place Market. You can walk to the Space Needle but allow 30-45 minutes and buses are free within the downtown area. So if you do hop a bus to the Space Needle, it costs $1.25.

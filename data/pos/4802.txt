An urban boutique hotel that's perfect for university-focused guests. It appeared that most guests were just that. As for me, I was tagging along with my husband who had business that was not in the U-district. But both my children are college students who live close by to this hotel, so it was a good choice for us. The hotel tries hard to be artsy, upbeat, and, well - boutique-y. It certainly succeeds in the common areas, which are nicely furnished and decorated. The rooms themselves are plain but efficient, clean, and sufficiently stocked. It is not an excessive place, which I like. You get just enough of everything for your needs without being wasteful. There's continental breakfast, which is a plus, given the lower-than-expected nightly rate. Ample free parking, which is a big deal in this tight parking area. Free shuttle service - wow! All in all, a good value for an urban hotel. OK, so the urban part: location is not the very best, a tad seedy. Close to the freeway. But this is urban living.

Hotel pros: location (walking distance to everything), cleanliness (it felt like we were the 1st people to use the room), decor (very modern, but comfortable, not cold), hotel restaurant (Lola's food was excellent, we had dinner and breakfast there), hotel service (everyone was very friendly). Hotel cons: only one: the toilets have industrial force flushes, so they are VERY loud and a little scary, but that is my one complaint and it's such a minor one. This will be the hotel we stay at every time we stay in Seattle!

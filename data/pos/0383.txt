-Big plus - Internet access with cable, not just wifi, is free in the room. If you have problems connecting (e.g., work VPN), you can press a button on your phone and immediately be connected with an internet specialist that will assist you. -I found a better rate with the hotel after booking with Quikbook, and the hotel updated the rate without me having to go back to Quikbook to cancel. -Goldfish is only available upon request, not automatically waiting for you in your room. So don't forget to ask if you want one. -Concierge and front desk were especially friendly and pleasant, I thought, and not the typical attitude you find with a concierge of a comparable or even fancier hotel, say across the street. -Only downside is the sound-proofing, the hotel was quiet for the most part, but I could hear my neighbor through the wall occasionally. -Another downside is there is no bellhop waiting for you when you arrive. This is the type of hotel where you will drag your own bags into the lobby. I was annoyed that after I had retrieved my bags from storage and dragged them most of the way out to the taxi, then the bellhop offered to help, as if I was going to tip for that last-second, too-late help.

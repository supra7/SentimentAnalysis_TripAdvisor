I stayed one entire week at the Hotel Andra & I had a blast; it was my 1st time to Seattle & I was very impressed; the hotel was centrally located to all of the fun/points of interest; the staff made me feel extremely welcome and always had recommendations for things for me to do which was extremely important as I was traveling alone. I will definitely stay at this hotel again; it's not real fancy like some of the hotels I stayed in for business but it's got a cool, hip vibe that I liked and it was clean; I highly recommend it as a great place to stay for business or leisure. I'm pretty picky when it comes to staying in nice hotels and this made the grade for me.

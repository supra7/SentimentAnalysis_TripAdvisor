Stayed 3 weekend nights here during a wet weekend. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of the shopping district, many fine restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc. The room was excellent, everything in perfect working order and the staff collectively went out of their way to make this a very enjoyable stay.

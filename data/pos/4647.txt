We just returned from two nights in Seattle. Got a great price from Hotwire so couldn't resist staying here. While the location is great (short walk to Pike's Market, down the street from Nordstrom and Macy's, lots of restaurants), something about the the hotel being so huge and the lobby so full of people, conventions, etc etc. made it not exactly the place for us. We had just come from staying in a boutique hotel in Vancouver which was oh so much more relaxing. The first night we got in late and unfortunately the coffee shop and restaurant were both closed. The bar was busy and very noisy so not very tempting. However, I must say the room was lovely, large and overlooking the space needle. Downfall is that they didnt have a king bed, even a queen bed would have been nice but these were doubles? Considering the size of the room, two queens would have been great. Beds were very comfortable though. While the Westin was lovely, it was just too busy and large, and would look for somewhere else to stay.

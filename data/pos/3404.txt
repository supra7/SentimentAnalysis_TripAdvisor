I was originally planning to stay at Westin Seattle on my most recent business trip to Seattle as usual, but my business partner recommended this as he knows I love boutique hotels. Hotel Andra was just what I wanted, and it actually reminded me of some New York boutique hotels like Chambers, Shoreham, Hudson etc. which are my favorites, of course at a much more reasonable price. My room is a semi-suite room and had enough open space for me to do some workout. The bed and bathroom were very comfortable. I liked the lobby design and atmosphere too. The hotel restaurant Lola serves excellent breakfast and dinner with high quality local products. It is worth going to Lola during the trip to Seattle. I will come back to Hotel Andra soon and this will be my regular place to stay for sure.

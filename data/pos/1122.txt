It's not a boutique hotel at all, and it's not a Marriott or chain-like in any way. This will satisfy all of your hipster yearnings, from the modernist furnishings to the lack of elevators and boxed water. Good beds, sheets, pillows, towels, and a very happening neighborhood if you want to party with the twenty to thirty-somethings. Breakfast is in the basement and is self serve, including make your own waffle. The coffee is not strong enough, but it's all you can drink. We would stay here again.

We stayed here just yesterday (19th May) with family from the UK. We were originally just looking at booking a Best Western Hotel, for one night only, and when I came to book it, the rate had gone up, so looked again, and decided I'd take a risk, never taken before by booking with hotwire.com. We paid $100 plus tax for a four star hotel, and after paying, we were booked in at the Sheraton. After reading the reviews on here, as always, I thought we had got a better deal straight away than the $140 per night in a Best Western. We drove down on Thursday afternoon, checked in and the rooms were great, good size, nice sized bathroom with a good shower head and clean towels, flat screen tv, lovely & comfy queen sized beds, decent view in the heart of Downtown Seattle. We went out for most of the day, then had a dip in the hotel pool, and hot tub on the top floor. Nice clean pool area, plenty of free towels to use, there is also a gym for guests free of charge too. Had a great nights sleep, and for $100 per night in the heart of Downtown Seattle, there is no complaints from us!

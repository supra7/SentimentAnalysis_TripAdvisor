We spent the weekend at the Seattle Sheraton. The hotel was very well maintained. The public areas were very clean and tastefully appointed. Our standard room was very large, very clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Even though the hotel was booked solid for the weekend (1,200+ rooms), our floor was quiet - no inside or outside noise the entire weekend. The restaurant was very nice with both the food and service being well above average. The same can be said about the lounge. Prices in the restaurant and lounge were typical of all hotels - high. The hotel was conveniently located for us. About 5-6 blocks from Pike Place Market and very near a ton of shopping choices. We'd stay there again in a minute.

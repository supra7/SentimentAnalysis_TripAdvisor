The Sheraton in Seattle has the best location with what you would expect from an newly renovated Sheraton. Quick tip, they have an airpot shuttle which cost $11 per person and stops running at 9pm(through GreyLine so it is not direct), take the LIGHT RAIL instead. It is super easy, runs more often, is faster, costs $2.25 per person and drops you off within two blocks of the Sheraton. The room where we stayed, in the Union Tower, was awesome. Try and stay in that section of the hotel since it is newly renovated. Only gripe is the sheets were a little rough. The pool and hot tub are nice but the fitness center is top notch. Location is what makes this hotel so great. You are right downtown with a short walk to Pike Place Market, and there are plenty of great bars, restaurants and shopping within blocks of the Sheraton's doors. Internet does cost a fee in your room, but there is free wi-fi and plenty of computers in their huge lobby/lounge area. Overall, this is the perfect location for a hotel in Seattle and it offers good service and high quality accommodations.

Hotel was great, great staff service. great bar, great restaurant but kinda pricey; room was small but awesome and no refrig, no micro. No Parking available, you must valet and that's $20 bucks a day (would have been nice to know that ahead of time). but the location is perfect! You're five minutes from everything - downtown shops/bars and Pike's Place. We had a great 3 days there!

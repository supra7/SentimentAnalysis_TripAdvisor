Only stayed for one night and did not require any services but our room was clean and nice looking. The hotel is walking distance to Pike's Place Market, waterfront and the bus station which was great as that was out mode of transportation to our next stop. I was stunned that there was a daily charge for wifi in the room -- you've got to be kidding! Wifi was available for free in public areas, which I used but that was really inconvenient.

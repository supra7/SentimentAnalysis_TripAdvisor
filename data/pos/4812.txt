We stayed here for four nights in May. The hotel is spotless, our room had a comfy bed, and a nice view of Downtown and Mt. Ranier. The staff members were all very pleasant, and the location was ideal for city sightseeing. The complementary breakfast was just right, and evening reception (snacks iced tea, and lemonade) was an added treat after a day of sightseeing. To top it off, the free parking was a definite plus in this city where you can spend a fortune to park. The neighborhood was vibrant and comfortable to walk in, the university is vibrant and attractive. All in all, we were very happy with our decision to stay here.

I love this hotel. It is close to bus lines, the light rail, and all of the things that you want to see in Seattle. I can walk to Pikes Place and the Space Needle, or for $2.50 I can hop the light rail to the stadiums. For $4.00 I can take the light rail to the airport. The rooms are beautiful with floor to ceiling windows. You can get a city or water view and since the buildings are in the round you can see everything. I normally ask for a higher floor to improve the view and decrease the city noise. Staff are great. You must stay here on your next trip to Seattle.

My hubby and I visited the Mayflower Park Hotel for 2 nights towards the end of September to celebrate our anniversary. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff. They are super friendly and helpful. On the night of our arrival they left us a box of chocolate truffles with an anniversary card signed by each staff member (which we thought was very sweet). The location is perfect. Everything is within walking distance. You can walk underground to the mall and Nordstrom & Macy's is right next door. Be sure to get the 11% off Macy's coupon for 5 days from the front desk...we found it very helpful. Besides all the touristy stuff, be sure to take the tram along the waterfront to Pioneer Square. It's a bit like a clean version of NYC and has so much character. Overall we had a great trip and our stay at the hotel was very enjoyable (loved the Aveda products supplied too). The only negative thing I would say is that the bathrooms are a bit on the small & old side. They should probably be upgraded...but then again, it goes with the rest of the hotel. Very charming with a great atmosphere!

My mom & I were planning an Alaskan cruise on NCL and booked this hotel based on internet research. It was better than expected and we had a terrific stay. It was super convenient to pier 66 (right next door). Tourist attractions were close by and the hotel staff were very helpful with maps, directions and advise on sightseeing and getting around. We never once felt the need for a cab (and my mom is 70). The room was "cityside". We couldn't see the water from our window but we could see the Space Needle. The lobby had one of the best lobby views ever, big comfortable chairs, tables with board games and newspapers. And stuffed salmon on the walls. And trees. Breakfast was a little expensive but convenient and there were plenty of dining choices a short walk away. The bathroom was so pretty, I'm going to remember it for the next time I remodel my own. Edgewater helped to make my first impression of Seattle exceptional.

It's hard to find anything wrong with this hotel. The location is perfect - everything in downtown is within walking distance and the hotel is magnificent. The only complaint I have is this hotel has taken to the same habits other large hotels chains have - "additional charges" - parking is expensive at 35/day plus tax and wireless internet is 13/day plus tax. This was not a surprise as the man at the front desk was very clear about it, but why don't they figure these expenses into the regular rate? Outside of that, the hotel is probably the nicest I've stayed in - the bed was comfy, elevators are really quick, and the front desk staff is very accommodating - I had to leave around 4am and still was encountered with a friendly response.

Our room wasn't quite ready at check in, they held our luggage after suggesting we could have another room, but the concierge recommended we wait for the one we'd been assigned. Good call! We had a corner room on the 8th floor with an unbelievable view of the bay. Service was outstanding, location perfect. What a splurge. If you can, you should definitely stay at the Inn.

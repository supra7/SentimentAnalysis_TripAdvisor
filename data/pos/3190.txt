My wife and I stayed for one night over this past Veterans Day/Rememberance Day weekend. We booked this hotel through priceline at a very low rate. This is certainly a good hotel, and a very good value considering the rate we got through priceline.com, but we didn't find anything particularly special about it. When we arrived, we found that there was no self parking available, only valet parking. The cost of valet service wasn't really a problem here, but considering the size of the hotel, and the number of guests coming and leaving, there is a lot of congestion in the front and a considerable wait time. Check-in service was quick and friendly. The room was clean and comfortable. I read that when the hotel was renovated in 2002, each room was furnished with some Chihuly drawings. They can be seen in the attached photos. The hotel is very central to a lot of good shopping centres, Pike Street Market, and lot of great restaurants. So overall, no complaints, it is a very good hotel. However, for reference, I stayed at the Seattle Grand Hyatt in January 2005 - that was a fantastic hotel - but costs a lot more too.

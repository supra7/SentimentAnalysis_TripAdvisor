This hotel was right in the middle of downtown seattle. I went with my good friend for a weekend getaway and to check out some clubs in seattle. The hotel was perfectly located where we didnt have to take our car out of valet for any reason; walking distance to shopping center, pikes place and the monorail which takes you to the space needle. a valet for 2 cost more than the room itself as i paid $70 a night via pay your own price. With parking it resulted in the room being about $105.00 per night, which is still a great steal for the location and quality of hotel. I would have paid out more if I stayed at a hotel further from the city center and had to pay parking fees downtown. The lobby is gorgeous, but, the rooms remind me of a 3 star hilton..which is fine for me. I believe this hotel is primarily 4-star because of the location and restaurants located within. The pool is not 24 hour which was a little disappointing as my friend and i wanted to take a swim after clubbing one night, but it was alright. oveall a fabulous hotel! :) Very Comfortable and clean and definetely worth the pay your own price! :)

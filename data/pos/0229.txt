We spent our 40th anniversary at this hotel. Not only was our dog made welcome, we were made welcome each time we left and entered. The staff was unbelievably wonderful in all ways. We were given a bottle of champaign, and candy by the consierge--great advice on closeby restaurants, and they clearly loved our dog who received a raincoat for the Seattle weather. Coctail hour in the evening and free drinks at dinner--one could not rave enough about this hotel. Clean through and through. The Levins

Took wife and kids to Seattle for the weekend for a shopping trip. We had a great stay at this hotel...great comp breakfast and very nice for the kids to swim in an indoor pool in November. Excellent location as the space needle is 2 blocks away and easy to get to public transportation. When asked directions to shopping malls the girl went online and printed us mapquest directions to a couple malls. Will be back!

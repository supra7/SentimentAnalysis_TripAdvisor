19 Jun 2010 This room was booked through the company's travel agent. The room was spacious, neat , inviting and great to relax after a hard day's work. Internet connectivity was good. Excellent food, courteous staff, clean and neat environment and the perfect location in downtown Seattle, with a quick walk to the waterfront made this the right place to be on a working day. Good eateries and shopping areas in the vicinity make this an attractive hotel for business and leisure travelers. Highly recommended.

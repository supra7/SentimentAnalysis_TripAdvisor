My daughter and I (the mom) stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for two nights, Fri./Sat. in May. I was able to book a "week-end" special, so it ended up being cheaper than staying at the Best Western near the Space Needle. We couldn't have asked for a nicer room. It was actually a "handicap" room, and it was spacious. We had two over-sized double beds, which were more like queens, a huge bathroom, and a large picture window overlooking downtown. The room was located in a little alcove, so there was no noise from people walking by in the hallway. The Sheraton is located in the heart of the city, within walking distance of everything. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely stay at the Sheraton Seattle again.

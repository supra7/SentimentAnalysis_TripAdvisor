I always like a less-modern place which doesn't seem foursquare and predictable, and which has pianos for you to play AND free wifi, merging old and new neatly. The staff are friendly, courteous and helpful. The public areas are delightful and welcoming, affording good interaction among guests. Wood-panelling and human-scale design makes it a very pleasant place to be. The lift's old-school petite, and there's only one, adding to the charm, if not convenience. But they have a staircase and I prefer them for my health in any case, though it'd be better if they'd decorated it beyond some amusing paintings on each floor. Rooms are spotless, if small by modern standards, with restrained style, mid-quality furnishings, very comfortable bed, nice desk / chair, and lovely cushions. Bathroom is good, with openable windows, but no fan. Excellent soap and shampoo, which indicates they're trying to look after you. Hot water is at a premium, however, and having had two lukewarm showers in November, this is one major reason they don't get five stars. Although they had a free shoe-shining service, which is nicely traditional, and of which I availed myself. They hid the fridge in faux-drawers under the TV, and I missed it until I checked out! no wonder there were no ice machines (you ring to reception for ice) Room service menu looks good, if you need it, and my friends said it was very good. They have a gym but no pool AFAIK, but then you can always try a dip in the Sound! Delightful stay, and if you get a discounted rate, this is a good value hotel for a romantic break or a get-together of friends or colleagues. Being built in 1908, this place is quite antideluvian by American standards, and i shows here and there, but it's a very human place, friendly, and affords welcoming!

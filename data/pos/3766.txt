What a wonderful experience! This was my first time staying Seattle and could not have asked for more. The Edgewater is a must for anyone wanting to stay within walking distance of the best sights while experiencing clean, comfortable accommodations and impeccable service. The staff were helpful, courteous, and eager to make my stay as worry-free as possible. Six Seven was fabulous - I highly recommend their breakfast and enjoying a cocktail later in the afternoon in the bar area. I can't comment on their dinner menu as I ate out each night. My room was great, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was gorgeous - impeccably clean with brand new appliances, stunning shower, and stone floor. There are trains that run by the hotel but they did not disturb me one bit. I didn't have to use them, but the hotel does provide earplugs in the room. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I am definitely staying there again the next time I'm in Seattle.

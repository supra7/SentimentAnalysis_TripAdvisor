I was in Seattle with my family for a couple of days and stayed 3 nights at the Renaissance in a double beds bedroom. The bed are too small and very bouncy ... it was not the best sleep we had ! But the location is great and the concierges are super nice and efficient. We had to book tickets to Vancouver, to find a restaurant, to have our rental car repaired and the concierges (Lucy, fred and Beth) helped us A LOT, always with a big smile and a lot of energy ! Will I coe back ? Certainly : you feel in a great hotel when you find such a great service !

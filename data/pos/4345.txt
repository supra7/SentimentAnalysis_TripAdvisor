My wife and I stayed here for our lay over before a cruise out of Seattle. It was a little more than hotels outside the downtown area but well worth every penny. We flew in and took the light rail to downtown (only $2.50 per person) and we were two blocks from the Westin. Checked in a little early and was told our room wasnt readyso the guy behind the counter (wish I remembered his name) asked if we would like two queens instead??? He pushed us up to the 33rd floor and with a view of the SoundBeautiful room is all I can say. The hotel has every amenity you could need. Stores and restaurants surrounding the hotel. Pikes Place is right down the street Absolutely loved the place and I will stay again.

We were in room 4236, had a nice view of downtown. We could see a little bit of the lake, not too much though. Still, the views of the mountains and city were unbeatable. The location was great, right near everything. The walk to Pike's Place Market was short, and there were so many restaurants nearby. We also saw a movie theatre just a stone's throw away, but who wants to go to a movie theatre on vacation? The room was smaller, but well appointed. The bath was standard hotel bath, with nice countertops though. The room itself was very clean. the linens were crisp, not wrinkled at all. The best part about this hotel was the concierge service. It's got to be tough to deal with newcomers all day, every day, but Judy and Ted (I think that was his name) both did an excellent job. They were courteous, friendly, and very willing to help. Overall, an amazing stay to make it an amazing trip!

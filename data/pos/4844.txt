We booked this hotel after reading several reviews as it seemed like the best deal when we compared the rates to the downtown hotels. Most of the reviews stated that the staff was very helpful and friendly. We found this to be the case in a very special way. We were to attend the Mariners game on Saturday night and were running late as we were coming in from Eugene. We were unable to stop at the hotel before the game. We came out from the game and our rental's window had been broken and everything we owned was stolen. We called Jeff at the hotel to tell him we would be late and to be sure and hold the room. We finally arrived around 2 AM as the police never came to the scene. Jeff helped us to get the basic necessities and was on the lookout for the police who finally arrived around 3. The rest of the staff was very helpful the remaining days of our stay, but we can never thank Jeff enough for his support that evening. The room was very nice and clean. The University Inn is a very good deal that I would recommend to our friends. Watch out where you park in Seattle. The night we returned our rental two gentlemen in a Lincoln suffered the same fate.

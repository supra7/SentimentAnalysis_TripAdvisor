Stayed there on a weekend when it was impossible to find a room in Seattle. It was a bit high priced, $160 after taxes, but it wasn't that bad at all. Doing my research I found that this building used to be an apartment building turned hotel/inn. The rooms are very apartment like and was very surprised at the size of the room! (Room 811). There was construction around the inn, but none going on during our stay on a Saturday night. The air conditioning faired well, and the very old TV served us well in the morning. The elevator is not as rickety as described. The hill is a bit steep, but if you're younger it's do-able. Very close to Pike Market and close to Seattle Center, the Space Needle is a short Monorail ride away. I quite enjoyed my stay at the Virgina Mason Inn!!

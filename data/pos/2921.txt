This lovely hotel provided a welcomed respite after a cross-country flight. Check-in was pleasant and made effortless by a knowledgeable staff. The room and all public areas were beautiful and exceptionally clean. Food service and preparation were outstanding. Just as important as the property itself is its location which is in close proximity to all the downtown shopping, only 3 blocks to Pike Street Market and a short cab ride to the ports. Great place for a week-end, a week or simply a night before a cruise.

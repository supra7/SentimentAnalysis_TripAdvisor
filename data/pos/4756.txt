I really enjoyed stayng at the Travelodge. I as a little nervious about visiting a big city such as Seattle, but Sandi was very helpful. She helped me find the best and safest ways to get around the city, going to downtown and the University. My rooms was very confortable and clean. Thanks to everyone, they made my stay a lot less stressful.

The Sorrento Hotel is definitely at the top of my list. Charming boutique hotel with turn of the century charm but up to date amenities. At the top of a hill and a 15-20 minute walk from Capitol Hill or downtown, the hotel was generous with the Towne Car. The service was excellent, the young staff knowledgeable about restaurants, and all apparently emotionally invested in the hotel. Travelocity failed to let the hotel know our son was with us, but we were quickly upgraded to a suite. Thank you Sorrento for a great first time in Seattle.

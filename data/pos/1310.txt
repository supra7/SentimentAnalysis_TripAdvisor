We recently had a business retreat at the Crowne Plaza. We really enjoyed ourselves. The service, food, and views from the suites were excellent. We were also very close to all the landmarks and good places to visit, which is nice. Since it was a business retreat, I can't really comment on the value for the price because everything was paid for, but I can say that the next time that I am staying in Seattle on business or leisure, I would definitely choose the Crowne Plaza.

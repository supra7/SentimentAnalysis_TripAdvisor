We always stay at the Mayflower Park when not staying with relatives. The location is fantastic...short walk to Pike Street Market, Seattle Center, and shopping is literally across the street. Terrific restaurant serving 3 meals a day in hotel..quiet and great breakfasts. Was recently offering more of a tapas menu, but all was delicious. Some rooms can be small, but others are plenty roomy. Wonderful bar with best margarita I've ever had. Lunches are also served in the bar.

Very clean, Valet service outstanding (they offered us a ride in their towncar one evening when taxi's were in short supply and we weren't going far). Lunch at Champagne was great. Staff very accommodating. Breakfast room service on time, but missing some items which were quickly delivered. Just wish we could have had outside seating for our room. If you opt for a waterfront room, get one below the 6th floor - the meat cooking smell is pervasive 24/7, with the windows closed.

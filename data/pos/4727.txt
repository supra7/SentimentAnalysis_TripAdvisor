It's a good budget option. There's an flat 8 min. stroll to the Monorail station, and an easy walk to Denny Street for food options. The bed was comfortable with nice linen. Even though the decor is getting dated, the room was still very clean. I would love to see this place get a makeover, especially double-glazing put on the allyway windows ( there was a large generator in the building across the ally, that made a whooshing sound all night). However the best thing of all was the service I received, when there was a noise issue with my room ( I am a very light sleeper). I was moved to a quieter room, with no fuss or attitude. Thank you Rayna, you were terrific. I truly appreiciated your help.

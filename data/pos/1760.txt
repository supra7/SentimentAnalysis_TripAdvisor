We got an excellent rate that included parking and breakfast. Our room was almost a suite. Yes, the bathroom was small, but compared to all the other pluses, who cares. A block or two from Macys and Nordstroms, and a 7 or 8 minutes walk to Pike's Pier. Staff very friendly. For a shopping and sightseeing trip, the Mayflower was great.

The Hotel Andra is wonderfully situated in the center of Seattle, with Pike's Market, Seattle Center and the Space Needle, museums, cultural activities, and upscale shopping all within walking distance. The accommodations, amenities and service are excellent, and the hotel is immaculate. The personnel, from housekeepers to those at the front desk, are extremely helpful and friendly. Excellent restaurants nearby, but a bonus is the Lola restaurant, just off the lobby, one of the best in town, with interesting menu selections from morning to night. Check it out!

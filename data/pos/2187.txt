This was our second time staying here, So I already knew the location was great and a good value. This time with our booking we had the hosted wine reception with our package, and it was amazing! The host Roberto was so welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable about the city. He even ran across the street and got a newspaper for us!!!!!! He went above and beyond, and the wine was great. Yes the rooms are a bit smaller but the bed was comfortable! The location is great, you can walk to everything! and there's some great restaurants nearby. When we checked out, the Valet literally ran to go get our car! We will definitely be staying here again.

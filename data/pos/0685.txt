My wife and I FINALLY had a chance to stay at the Inn at the Market. We have stayed at several hotels in Seattle over the past 9 years and the Inn, by far, is the best. Best location, best service (and this is quite an achievement considering all the fine smaller hotels in Seattle), friendliest staff, beautiful, and quiet rooms, and dining that is superb. We booked a water view room and were upgraded to a deluxe water view room. It was fantastic. We dined at Cafe Campagne and it reminded us of many small, but excellent, restarurants that we have enjoyed in Paris. The food was excellent and our server, Courtney, was a gem. We will definitely return.

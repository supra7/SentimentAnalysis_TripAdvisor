Excellent customer service! The concierge was especially helpful when we needed outstanding dinner reservations for our anniversary - with very little advance notice, he was able to get us a very nice table at a great restaurant - THANK YOU! The front desk, town car driver, and room service were also outstanding! The room was very cozy and comfortable. The view from the 4th floor was less-than-desirable, but we could have paid more, and gotten a better view. When I booked, I saw two rooms with the exact same description, at different prices, so I booked the cheaper one, thinking that I was taking advantage of some special sale. I should have made a phone call to the hotel to clarify the difference, since it wasn't apparent from the website. In hindsight, it seems obvious, but at the time, I just wanted to get the great rate. Regardless, the room itself was fantastic, and we didn't spend much time looking out the windows anyway!

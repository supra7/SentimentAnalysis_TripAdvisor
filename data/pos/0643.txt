This is a gem of a hotel in a great location. I have been wanting to stay at the Inn for years, having seen it walking to Pike Place Market. When I needed to travel to Seattle for business, I finally had the opportunity to book a stay there and my wait was generously rewarded. The hotel staff are excellent and made me feel like their only guest. All my needs were met with a generous spirit and my stay was everything I hoped it would be. Can't wait to return!

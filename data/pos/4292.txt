This was the first time I stayed with the family at the Westin. This hotel chain is known for their "Heavenly" beds and great service. I had experienced it as a business traveler, and was very happy with it. My wife and I are very picky about the beds. The beds at the Westin were really good the first two to three nights. They are very comfortable and they "hug" you... and that is the problem after the third night... You really don't move from one or two positions through the nigth, so it ends up hurting the shoulders or the lower back. Anyway.... The service was impecable. Every time we had a request, they delivered within fifteen minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity of the request. We have a two year-old and we asked for a crib, which also had a very comfortable mattress, so we did not hear from him.... And while not well known, they have kids kits for them to do activities, books, etc. They also have a pool that the kids loved, and more importantly, the security is very good. Some teenagers, already intoxicated, came to the pool with more booze, and security quickly removed them. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience, and since it was close to the monorail, we went to the space needle many times!

We stayed overnight at the Executive Hotel Pacific while en route to Canada, because of the hotels proximity to the Amtrak station and its reasonable nightly rate. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded from a Business Queen to a Business King upon early check-in. The room, while small was nicely appointed. We found the staff to be friendly and very helpful. The only drawback was the size of the bathroom. The toilet, in particular, because of its location in the bathroom, was difficult to access. Overall it was an enjoyable stay for the right price in downtown Seattle.

When I need to stay in downtown Seattle, I only stay in one of two places, the Mayflower and the Red Lion (5th Ave). This location is the best---Westlake Center is in the same block (and Westlake Center is really "ground zero" for downtown Seatte). The light rail stop is very close (and that is the best and cheapest way downtown from the airport). But the best thing about the Mayflower is the staff. Five stars isn't high enough for them. When you ask the staff how long they have worked there it's usually decades not years. It's hard to find someone who has been there less than 5 years---in many other hotels it's hard to find someone who has been there there 5 years. It's not like working in a hotel is a glanorous job, so the owners and management must be doing something right and it shows. They are loyal to the hotel and guests. If you're looking for a place to stay in downtown Seattle, quit looking and book here.

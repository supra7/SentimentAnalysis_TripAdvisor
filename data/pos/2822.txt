The room was extremely comfortable and the air incredible. They must be using a great air conditioning system. The best bedding too. The only negative was a breakfast at the restaurant - I walked out after trying a really bad coffee (in Seattle!) with non-fat milk, as they did not have a regular milk or cream.

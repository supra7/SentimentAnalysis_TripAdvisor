We stayed at The Westin on our first visit to Seattle in August of 2011 and couldn't have been happier with our stay. They immediately upgraded my room for free and we had an awesome view of the Space Needle out of our window. It is also a great location and very easy to walk to many destinations (which is good since the transit system is very disappointing). The building may be a little old, but the important things to my wife and I (cleanliness and service) were top notch. Will stay here again on any future visits.

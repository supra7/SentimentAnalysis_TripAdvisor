My husband and I stayed at The Westin Seattle for five days in April. We were in town for a convention with a group of fifteen. Eleven of us managed to book rooms in the Towers, and we all had a great experience. The rooms were beautiful... albeit we had an awesome view of Elliot Bay from the 31st floor. Housekeeping was prompt and maticulate. My only complaints were; 1. The room layout prevented access to the chest of drawers, as upon opening the drawers, the bed was in the way and niether piece of furniture wanted to move, and 2. I would suggest not eating in the hotel. There is much better food to be found elsewhere at more reasonable prices.

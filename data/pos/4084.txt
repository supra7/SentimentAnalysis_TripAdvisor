My husband and I have stayed at the Sorrento Hotel a number of times and have enjoyed excellent service on each visit. The rooms are comfortable and elegantly decorated, with careful attention to detail. My husband grew up in Seattle and he always chooses to stay at the Sorrento when he's on his own. On our last visit, we had the option to upgrade to a suite, which was beautifully appointed with flat-screen TVs in both the bedroom and the sitting room -- a great benefit when not everyone wants to watch football! The hotel's circular driveway makes it easy to come and go by car, with efficient valet parking services. If you are looking for gracious accommodations, you won't be disappointed by your stay at the Sorrento.

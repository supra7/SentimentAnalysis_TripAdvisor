We were very pleased with the Crowne Plaza for a girls getaway shopping weekend. It was perfectly located within walking distance from Pike Market, downtown shopping and to our car rental. The hotel has a restaurant we had breakfast and dinner there. Service and food were great. Valet service was nice - a little pricey but understandable for downtown hotels - our car rental was the same price as to store our car! Our room was clean and spacious and we were happy it had a little fridge to store our water. I forgot my phone charger and I phoned the hotel and they had it and I told them I was from Canada - thinking it would be more of a hassle for them but they happily obliged. I received it today. We will definitely stay there again.

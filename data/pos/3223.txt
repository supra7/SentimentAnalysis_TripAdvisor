we really enjoyed our stay there in this hotel.The staff was very helpful and friendly, We had questions on transportations and the staff spent extra time to help us. The whole atmosphere was fantastic ! The hotel is very well managed. i had some prolem with my booking before, and the manager - David, explained to me very well in detail.... the customer service in this hotel is the best i had experienced in years. The room was clean. and it had everything in it, etc, a fridge, a microwave, a coffe maker machine. the hotel also provided newspaper in the morning, which was very thoughtful. it was of a great deal ! the only thing is that we felt the hotel can improved is tha the water in the shower is not strong enough. but other than that, it is great. I will definately recommend this hotel to other travellers.

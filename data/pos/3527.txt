The Andra was a very nice, almost eclectic hotel. The room - a suite - was nice, but not huge. The bathroom seemed slightly antiquated, but it was clean which counts more than simply being modern. Location was within walking distance of Pikes Market and the waterfront. The only issue we had in July 2009 was construction directly below our window. A new building was being built next door and every morning at 0700, the banging begin. The staff, however, was incredibly friendly.

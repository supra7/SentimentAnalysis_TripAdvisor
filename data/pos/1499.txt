The MarQueen is in a building that is about 80 years old that has been lovingly restored. What that means is that it's kind of like going to a hotel as it was back in about the 20s. The building was NOT just gutted and a new hotel build inside the exterior walls of a very old building. The result if fun but its probably not for everyone. If you want everything to look ultra-modern, the MarQueen is not for you. If you're in for some luxury from yesteryear, it's a grand place to stay. One fact to its "restored" basis is that although it is three stories, there is no elevator. So, the busmen really earn their tips helping people with bags. Another is that all the fixtures in the bathroom look old. (It's not original equipment but new equipment made to look like something from the 20s.) Some folks may not like that. There is a kitchenette in every room. However, I doubt that many people use it extensively. It's in a fun neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and things and people to see. The "room service" for the MarQueen comes from one of the restaurants for breakfast, another for lunch, and yet another for dinner. That includes a late-night bar scene. We'd stay here again when given the opportunity.

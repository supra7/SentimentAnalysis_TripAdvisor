Can't imagine a better location in Seattle right above the market and waterfront. Hotel was clean and classy and has an incredible furnished rooftop deck with an outstanding view of the bay. Only suggestion: Reception staff responded to all questions but were a little aloof and could have been more friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend, it even appears in the Sleepless in Seattle movie.

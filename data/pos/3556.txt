So, I grew up in Seattle and moved away for a few years and now I am back. I always have and always will recommend Andra to friends and family when they visit as the Andra is the hippest hotel in town with the best rooms. I most recently stayed here in March for my birthday/St. Patrick's day. We booked a one-bedroom corner suite at a screaming deal for spring in Seattle (369 a night, yes a suite for under 400 in Spring in Seattle). I LOVE THESE HOTEL ROOMS. Ample space, wonderful decor, comfy chenille blankie, two (TWO!) flat-panel televisions. I have done similar suites at the Westin and the Fairmont, which for the price I paid there and the price of the Andra the Andra wins hands-down. Even with the bathrooms, which again, I think are totally awesome. Love the original tile on the bathroom floor, love the ample lighting in the bathroom (esp the nightlight!). And let's talk about the Front Desk. Anyone who compliments my outfit immediately wins brownie points.

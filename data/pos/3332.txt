Our very positive experience with Hotel Andra began before our arrival in Seattle with the extremely helpful information provided by the concierge (Lorraine). We received wonderful restaurant recommendations and information about museum exhibits, theatre, and Pike Place Market. Upon arrival, we found our room to be comfortable and spotless. The bathroom was small, but sleekly designed and well-appointed. The location of this hotel simply can't be beat. In spite of a late season bout of wild weather (uh-huh, snow and wind in addition to rain!), we were still able to walk everywhere we wanted to go except the University of Washington. We took the bus to UW (since I wanted my daughter to experience Seattle public transportation) and once again, hotel staff were extremely helpful. Do not miss Serious Pies (which delivers to the hotel) or Lola (made to order donuts were incredible!). Will definitely return to this Hotel. An excellent experience and great value!

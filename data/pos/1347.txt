We were ill when we arrived in Seattle and what a relief to have such a comfortable hotel room to recover in! We decided to pay a few dollars extra and get the room just one down from a suite (not too much more on advance purchase). Situated on the 32nd floor was teriffic! And an enourmous continental breakast selection was also included in the price. The location was perfect, right in downtown Seattle and the staff most helpful. We'd definitely stay here again.

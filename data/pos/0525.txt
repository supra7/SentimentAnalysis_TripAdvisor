My husband stayed here for three nights, I was here for two, and we both walked away thinking it was the right choice. Our room on the 3rd floor had a VERY small (walk out, but couldn't turn around) balcony that overlooked the Space Needle, which was beautiful at night. The hotel also has their hotel offices on the 3rd floor (right outside of our room) which seemed a little odd but it didn't disturb us at all. The king-sized bed had four pillows plus an accent pillow, and there was a comfy chair in the corner as well as a desk and chair. As others have mentioned the location is great, within walking distance to all major attractions. The front desk staff were helpful but we did notify them - twice - that our coffee pot was not operational yet no one ever came to replace/repair it (perhaps they were thinking who would really want to drink coffee in a hotel room in Seattle?!;). The grocery store across the street was very nice, but pretty expensive. Would highly recommend Assaggio's Restaurant just outside of the hotel. Nice hotel, would recommend it.

Our first trip to Seattle and we could not have chosen a better place to stay. Upon arrival, the Porters checked our luggage in a secure vault because we were so early. The front desk staff went out of their way to make us comfortable until our room was ready. I have stayed at some of the finest hotels in the U.S., but when we walked into our room I knew that this was the best. The hotel upgraded our room at no extra charge due to this being our 25th anniversary. I had read some of the reviews on this hotel before making reservations and had some doubts in my mind, I was wrong. This is an old hotel that is on the Register of Historical Hotel. It has been completely refurbished and is spotless. Without doubt the best mattress and pillows that I have ever slept on. Did I mention the Plush Robes that they provide and the newspaper each morning. Free high speed internet service. The food in the hotel restaurant was great. The bar was equally great. Also, the hotel is connected to a Super Nice Mall. This mall had about 20 places to get a nice meal or snack at very reasonable prices. The location of the hotel is one of its best features. It is only a 10 minute walk to Pike's Market. The mall has a terminal for the monorail that will carry you to the space needle, local amusement park & museums. We will return to Seattle in the future and we will stay at this great hotel again.

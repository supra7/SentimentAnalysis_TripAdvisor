This is a great hotel in a great location. We could walk to Pike's Market, the Space Needle, the Monorail, the Waterfront, shopping, bars and restaurants in no time flat. The hotel does not have some of the amenities as other luxury hotels (in-house spa, pool), but it has a lot of character in the style of the old luxury hotels, like the Drake in Chicago. Unlike some of the other reviews for this hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (maybe the Management responded to the negative feedback). My only complaints were: the street noise during weekday commute hours (windows need better insulation) and both of our room keys kept demagnetizing. Otherwise, the Suite was very spacious and comfortable. In fact, I have never slept in a more comfortable and cozy bed. Bathroom is small, but cute and Art Deco-like. The decor in general is very new and Ikea inspired. Valet parking was quick, efficient and friendly (always asked if we needed directions). I highly recommend Lola's (located in the lobby) for breakfast and a nightcap. There was absolutely NO onion smell. I definitely would stay here again.

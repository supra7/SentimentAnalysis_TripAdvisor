Just got back from a quick trip to celebrate our anniversary and it could not have been better staying at the Inn at the Market and exploring Pike Place! The hotel is in the best spot to enjoy the market and the rooftop deck was fantastic! We had a city view room that that was very nice and was very quiet. Could barely hear the people were staying in the adjoining rooms and street noise was not a problem for us on the 4th floor. They even had a nice business center where I could print our boarding passes. The bed was very comfortable and the room was just very cozy overall. The entire staff is very friendly, helpful, and welcoming. We had breakfast at one of the Inn's restaurant's and the crab eggs benedict was superb! Our favorite place to go at Pike Place was La Panier Bakery just down the street. We bought croissants all three days we were there! The biggest problem you will have is deciding where to eat! The monorail is five short blocks away so you can easily go to the Space Needle and the EMP museum. The waterfront is also a short walk away. It was a fantastic trip for my wife and I.

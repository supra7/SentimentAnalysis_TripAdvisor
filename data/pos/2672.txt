My girlfriend and I traveled to the Sheraton back in February 2010. I planned on proposing and I wasn't sure when, during the weekend, I'd do it. I wrote to the Sheraton before-hand, and they were very helpful in selecting a romantic room with a great view for us. It's two years later and I've been married for nearly 8 months! The rooms are super clean, modern and comfortable. The workout room is awesome with a great view (northwest I think) of the city's suburbs. I love this hotel and will definitely be back once we move back to the states!

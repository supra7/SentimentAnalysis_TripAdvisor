When booking this hotel online we were pretty skeptical. The images of the hotel were not the best and the description was pretty vague. The price was right for our budget at the time so we took a chance. Very glad we did, this hotel was charming and historical. Outside: From the outside the hotel looks worn, something you would expect from a 100 year old building. Parking is hard to come by anywhere down town in Seattle, so the Moore is no exception. Plan on paying for parking; use the parkade across the street. It gets locked up at night, and since crime is a big issue in down town Seattle it will just give you that little extra piece of mind that your car is locked away. Parking will cost you $20.00 per day in the parkade. Lobby: Once you step inside, you are greeted with a marbled reception like area. Friendly staff to check you in promptly and help with any questions or concerns. The building has a very outdated elevator, something that is par for the course considering the age of the building. The hallways (corridors) are extremely wide. Something you just do not see, it was refreshing. Rooms: There are two types of rooms available in this hotel. There are the ones who have stood the test of time and those who have been decorated to meet todays style. We were lucky enough to be told up front and requested a new room. Here you get the privilege of having your own personal bathroom. Thats right folks, not all rooms have their own bathroom. Some floors have communal bathrooms so be sure to ask for an updated room. The room we stayed in was on the 7th floor. It was spacious, clean, funky paint job, and looked over the harbor. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was a great, inexpensive way to be in the heart of down town and not in one of those stuffy hotels. The Moore is very close to the Pikes Market, about a 5 minute walk at the most. Shopping centers, movie theatres and numerous restaurants all within a 5 minute walk as well.

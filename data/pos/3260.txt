Okay, so if you want to be walking distance from Downtown then this hotel is great. The rooms are larger than I expected and the service from the hotel was really good. I did find the bed / pillows quite uncomfortable but i'm a little fussy about sleep. The city streets and traffic were no bother from the 5th floor, and being at the top there is no noise from above. The value of this hotel is the strongest point, at $75 or so a night it is very worth it, and I would have no problems staying here again. I can see why they are rated above their weight!

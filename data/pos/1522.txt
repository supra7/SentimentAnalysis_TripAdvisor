We are a family of 5 and stayed in a large room with a small kitchen It was quiet and good value If you are looking for somewhere away from downtown but well located this is a good choice The Needle and monorail are less than 10 minutes away on foot and you can be in downtown in under 20 minutes. There are some interesting shops and a great supermarket (can't remember the name but is is just across the road from Easy Street Records) as well as good restaurants nearby including Ten Mercer which is attached to the hotel A short but fairly strenuous walk up hill (we took the easier option of a two minute cab ride and walk back downhill) takes you to a number of other good value eating places The staff are very helpful and friendly.

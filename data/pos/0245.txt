This was my second stay in a Kimpton property, the 1st being in Washington DC. I knew they were Eurochic and had a different attitude in doing business. This was confirmed by our stay at the Monaco in Seattle. 1st sign up for the Kimpton In-touch program (free), it gives you free wi-fi and gives you special rates and allows you to set preferences. Second if you are on Twitter/Facebook follow Kimpton, they often have fun contests or secret words to make travel more fun and gets you great deals. This visit was no exception, when my kids said the secret word at check in they said that if I had not chosen a suite already I would have been upgraded, as it were the comped my parking for my stay which was over a $100 value!!!! The front desk staff were efficient and friendly, made a great dinner recommendation for a local brew pub. The room Monaco Suite, had a pull-out with TV in living room and a King bed with additional TV in the bed area (seperated by a curtain) - it would have been great to have a refrigerator, I suppose you could ask to have the mini bar emptied.... With the in-touch I was given a Raid the Mini Bar coupon which was good for $10 during my stay. Also I had opted for breakfast for $1 and used that the second day (it was excellent!). Most impressive was that after I returned and they sent the questionaire about my stay, they got back to me regarding my suggestions (thought they needed more electrical access for plug-ins - they said they ordered power strips) -- It seems like the NW Regional director reads all of the reviews and takes an interest in what you say.......... Impressive, not a form letter, but I felt like they listened and reacted. The staff were accomodating, the treasure chest for kids wonderful and our fish Ziggy was a welcome site after two weeks on the road. Overall I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Monaco, our Suite was $160 per night and a value in a big city. I look forward to staying in another Kimpton property soon.

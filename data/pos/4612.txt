I have just returned from a 1 night stay in The Westin and have to say it is the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in (and I've stayed in many). The room was very clean and had all the amenities required for a comfortable stay. I was also lucky enough to be on the 30th floor so I had a fantastic view of the city. The hotel was well located for visiting the Space Needle, Space Center, Pike Place Market and the Waterfront and the Concierge was very helpful with all my queries regarding local restaurants and even supplied me with some discount vouchers. I would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone who should ask.

My husband, 2 teens and myself stayed here New Year's Eve for 2 nights. We received a good rate through Expedia on a Deluxe Cityside room. The room was clean, bathroom was nice and decor is 'lodgey'. We were out most of New Year's Eve doing things downtown. When came back to our room and went to bed around 2am new years day. At about 320 am we awoke to some very strange noises. Needless to say a very active couple were going at it LOUDLY. Remember the walls are paper thin so if you are going for intimacy purposes look elsewhere. Anyway, it became apparent that these noises weren't going to end anytime soon so I called the front desk, they called security and that was the end of that. The next morning we were exhausted. Luckily my kids were so exhausted that they had no idea what went on the night before. I called the front desk and thanked them for handling the situation and asked if the neighbors were checking out that day. She said yes and I said OK but could we please change rooms and have a fresh start? She was apologetic and put us in a waterside room as a courtesy. We accepted and we had a much quieter night. Valet parking is $30/nt. However, we checked out at noon and went on a Pike Place food tasting tour. They held our bags and car for us until 5 as a courtesy.

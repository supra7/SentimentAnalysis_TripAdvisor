I traveled to Seattle in July and stayed in University Inn for 7 nights. Liked it a lot. The first two nights, noises from next door's shower in the early morning bothered me, so I requested to change room. The front desk staff was very helpful and gave me another room on the 4th floor. That completely solved the problem! I love the free shuttle-bus service the most. Since I was traveling alone and didn't want to rent a car, the shuttle bus took me basically to all local attractions, including Space Needle, downtown Seattle and the zoo. Sometimes the driver would chat with guests and provided good information. It runs every hour and really a great way to see the city. The complimentary breakfast, though, can use some improvement. There's no hot foods, unless you make your own waffle (very easy) or heat the bread in a microwave. But all in all my experiences in the hotel was very positive.

We stayed at the Ace Hotel on Presidents Day weekend. I requested Room 107 because I heard that it's the best room there (the one on their website). This room is situated at the corner of Wall & First (you have great views of both streets..yes, windows on two walls) and right above the Cyclops Bar. The room gets kinda loud at night but if you can stand it, it's well worth it!! The Ace Hotel is right in the heart of Belltown so you don't have to go far to find the Seattle nightlife. I thought that the "shared bathrooms" deal was going to be a problem but everything worked out great. I never had a problem finding an open bathroom (total of 5 shared bathrooms). For parking, you can pay $17 (in & out priv) to park in a lot that's about 2 blocks away (not bad) or try to find parking on the street (good luck). And of you choose to go out at night time, the front doors are locked at midnight but your room key can open it. I don't recommend the Ace Hotel for anyone looking to get pampered with a lot of amenities and service. Bottom line, the Ace Hotel enhanced the Seattle Experience for my girlfriend and I & I'd stay there again.. wouldn't have it any other way!!

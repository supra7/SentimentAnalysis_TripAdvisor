My husband and I met our good friends here for an overnight before boarding our cruise ship to Alaska. We found our room to be spacious, clean, and full of amenities. The downtown location was so convenient to Pike's Market and shopping, and the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely return to this hotel whenever we visit Seattle!

Read conflicting comments but my visit very enjoyable. They accomodated my need for an easy access room and the staff very helpful to all requests made of them. Will recommend to friends and I will visit this establishment again. Added bonus for Seattle free parking and complimentary breakfast. Hotel has free Internet. For Seattle city traveling GPS may not work.

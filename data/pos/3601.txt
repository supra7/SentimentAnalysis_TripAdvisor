Just blocks from Pike's market, the Space Needle, downtown shopping and surrounded by great restuarants, its hard to ask for anything more. The room was large with a bar and desk -- bed was heavenly -- decor was very fun, modern and relaxing -- restuarant Lola downstairs was tasty and trendy -- staff was always welcoming and knowledgeable. Would definately stay again!

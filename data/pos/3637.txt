We stayed at the Hotel Andra on Saturday night before leaving on an Alaska cruise. Our suite was large and well appointed...hubby loved the flat screen tv. Knowing that when we came back from our cruise the following weekend, we were going to spend most of the day in Seattle before our late night flight back to FL, we asked if they had day only rooms available for the following weekend so we would have a place to shower and leave our luggage while we explored Seattle further. They gave us a studio which we checked into at 730am and left at 7pm. The staff at the Hotel Andra is wonderful, very friendly and accommodating. The location near Pike Place and the Space Needle is perfect for exploring on foot.

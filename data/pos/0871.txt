My husband and I stayed at the Inn at the Market just recently. It is in the perfect location, right across from the Pike Place Market and tons of restaurants. The staff are all very friendly and anxious to help in any way they can. Our room on the 7th floor had a fabulous view overlooking the market and the water. I loved the roof balcony where you could take a bottle of wine, snacks, etc. and even room service, from what I saw. The room was spotless, the bed comfortable (although we are not fans of the temper pedic mattress as it is a bit warm for us). We had room service breakfast several times and it was delivered promptly by one of the cheerful staff. They provide nightly turndown with chocolates and their valet service is very prompt. We had a slight issue with the A/C, which the General Manager, David Watkins, immediately addressed, so from my our perspective, we would stay there again in a heartbeat.

This hotel is right where all the action is. The price is really cheap for the room. The hotel itself is pretty cool, looks old, but kept up. The room itself is nice! My only complaint is the service at the front desk. We wanted to check in early, because my bf had the stomach flu. The lady behind the counter told us we couldn't because the rooms weren't clean and they hadn't had check out yet...really?!? You don't have ONE clean room that we can have?! My bf was practially getting sick in the lobby and they showed no compassion. And to make it worse, they gave a woman with a baby a room right away, and they did the same to another family. But when we went up and asked a different person we got a room right away. Obvioisly that lady was on a power trip! That lady needs to work on her tact! That being our only complaint I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

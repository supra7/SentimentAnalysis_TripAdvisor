Typically we wouldn't stay someplace like this since it would be too pricey. But we got a godd deal on this and absolutely loved the what the Sheraton had to offer! Service was the kind you expect at a business hotel, but the decor is very swanky. The rooms are large and though ours only looked out on other skyscraper hotels, we loved the location! It's minutes from the waterfront and Pike's Place Market. Plus, surprisingly, their valet parking service was a few dollars cheaper than any of the public parking available around the city. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

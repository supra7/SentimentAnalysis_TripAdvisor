Even though the hotel is dated, it is VERY clean. Everything in my room worked properly. I would strongly recommend this if you want to be close to downtown, especially Pike Place Market (only 2 blocks away!) and are on a budget. There is free wifi so ask the front desk and they will give you some networks and passwords that are usually picked up within the hotel. I have nothing bad to say about Moore Hotel and would definitely stay here again.

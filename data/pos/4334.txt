My family and I spent 3 nights at the Seattle Westin prior to a Carnival Alaskan Cruise. The Seattle Westin is a nice hotel with a great downtown location. With rolling luggage you can easily walk from the nearby underground Westlake Light Rail Station to the hotel. (The Light Rail is the bargin way to get from the SEA TAC airport to downtown Seattle.) There are ample dining opportunities within easy walking distance of the hotel, including a McDonalds. It is a 1 block walk to the monorail station that will take you to the Space Needle. The hotel has an indoor pool which was nicer than I expected. Some rooms have a water view of Puget Sound. Our room had a view of the Space Needle. Not bad. It's an easy 3 or 4 block walk to Pike Place Market. Nordstroms and Macys are 1 block away. When we go back to Seattle (we had a great time) we will, more than likely, return to the Westin. One closing comment. I have heard parking at the hotel is expensive.That did not apply to us.

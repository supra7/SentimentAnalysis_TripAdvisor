Nice place to stay My wife and I choose to stay here after a flight from the east coast. We flew in a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel but it would be MUCH easier just to exit the airport, turn right and start walking toward the other hotels you can see in the area. You will quickly see the Radisson. It is easily within walking distance from the airport. Our room rate for a single king was $109. I made my reservations online thru Expedia. Our check-in was quick and easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and clean. The Sleep Number bed was comfortable. We used the Towne Car service for the 25 minute ride to the Space Needle ($40). A very nice service in a Lincoln Towne Car. The price of a taxi is roughly $38 without tip. We were very pleased with the Radisson and would stay there again.

Stayed here just under a week in July 2008 and was a little wary considering some of the reviews but really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is a little tatty in places, and if you're looking for a high end hotel then this is not for you, but for the price what you get is amazing! Rooms are large and although the decor isnt great the place was clean and secure. We had a kitchenette in our room complete with cooking utenstils, a small table, fridge etc. a walk in closet (!!!) and ensuite bathroom. Bathroom was quite small, but served its purpose well. Toiletries were supplied, it was kept clean with towels etc and we had no problems with hot water or pressure during our stay. The hotel is lovely to look at from the outside, and has a little garden where you can take your breakfast in the am. Breakfast is nothing fancy and DIY (7.30 - 10) but again, great for what you pay. They had toast, juices, tea, coffee, and muffins for you to help yourself to. Great location, near to space needle, safe and buses and restaurants nearby. Market across street if you're cooking, otherwise pubs, diners, a thai place, an indian and some nice bars all within a few blocks as well as shops and services. Free shuttle is helpful, but timed and not always going where you want, but we managed to use it a few times but you do need to book ahead. Staff at the hotel were brilliant - really friendly and helpful. No lift/elevator though if you struggle walking.

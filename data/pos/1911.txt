If you are planning a weekend trip to Seattle, Mayflower Hotel is the place to stay. The location of this historic hotel can't be better. You will be within 5 to 10 walking minutes to everything you should see in Seattle. Places like, Seattle's famous Fresh Market with the most amazing fresh seafood, produce, beautiful flowers and fantastic restaurants; the Underground, Space Needle, Seattle's Waterfront views and you won't even need to exit to the street to take a ride on a Monorail because it is connected with the hotel building. Also this hotel has a complimentary valet parking which is a huge plus considering that all other hotels in the Downtown area charge $25-$30 per night. The rooms are clean and comfortable, a very nice staff. The hotel has a restaurant and a martini bar on the first floor for those who would like to relax after a long day of sightseeing. During your stay in Seattle I would recommend to take one of the Argosy Lock Cruises- its really fun and memorable. Here is the link to their website so you can book your tickets in advance. www.argosycruises.com If this is your first time in Seattle, you are going to fall in love with this city! Enjoy it and have a safe trip.

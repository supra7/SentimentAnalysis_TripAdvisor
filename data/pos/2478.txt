I spent one night at the Renaissance Seattle in August 2009 while traveling on business. I arrived very late on a cross-country flight, and it was a welcome relief to be greeted warmly by the friendly front desk staff when I finally arrived. Check-in took no more than five minutes and I had no problem finding the elevators and getting up to my room. When I requested a late check-out, the front desk staff was very gracious and was able to accommodate me. My room was large and clean. In addition to a very comfortable bed, it also had an armchair and ottoman and a large desk/workspace. The bathroom was not the biggest, but it was clean and had good counter space. I had a partial view of the waterfront, although it was mostly obscured by other buildings. High-speed internet worked well but was not free. I ordered room service for breakfast. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and polite. My food arrived in 15 minutes, exactly when I was told it would, and was prepared to order. The fitness center was clean but small. There was a decent selection of free weights and enough treadmills for everyone who wanted to use them. My only complaint was that there were only two ellipitical machines and both were in use for over half an hour. The waterfront is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, but be forewarned that the walk entails some pretty steep hills. I did the walk pretty early in the morning (about 7 a.m.) and the neighborhood seemed very safe at that time. Over all, this hotel fit my needs perfectly. It was clean, safe, friendly, and efficient.

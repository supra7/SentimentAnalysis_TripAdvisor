This was a decent stay. Rooms were clean, and general expectations met for a Renaissance Hotel stay. Rooms were okay, I stayed in 2 different rooms due to a multi-location week long trip where we used this hotel for two different stays. First room seemed more outdated (10th floor), second room was very nice, and on a corner of the 6th floor. Basic amenities. I give the food a B. Location was good a few blocks up the hill from Pike Place Market.

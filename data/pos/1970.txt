Have stayed here before. They charge 74 dollars vs over 150 at every other hotel downtown. Steps to Pike Place Market. Not far from transit options. Large ceilings and rooms that open. I had Room 700 facing Macys which was very quiet. Rooms clean as a whistle. Fans in room since A-C rarely needed in Seattle. Neighborhood sketch at night. Nearvy Cafe d'Arte has great coffee drinks. Walk down one block to First Avenue for a selection of great Belltown Restaurants. If you are a frugal traveller, you will like the Moore. Otherwise pay the 200+ plus per night and stay elsewhere.

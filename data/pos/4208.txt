The Westin is one of the choice hotels for Princess Cruiselines. We flew into Seattle a day early to enjoy the sites, in advance of our cruise-of-a-lifetime to Alaska. Hotel staff was overall pleasant and engaging, the room neat, and bed comfortable. In the mood to start our vacation off right with a relaxing massage, we got a great referral (and discount coupon!) to a local spa from the concierge desk. The spa was even close enough to walk to for a good stretch of the legs. There is a pharmacy and fast-food restaurant close by for last minute purchases and a quick bite. The monorail from the Space Needle stops on the next block, where some good shopping was found at the Westlake Center. Would stay again.

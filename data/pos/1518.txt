We loved staying in this hotel. It's close to restaurants, a market, buses, monorail for downtown travel, and the Seattle Center. The rooms are big. Though old the place was immaculate. The staff was super--very helpful and always cheerful. we had a great view of the Space Needle all lit up for the holidays. We'll stay there again.

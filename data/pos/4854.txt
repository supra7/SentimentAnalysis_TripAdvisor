This is a really pleasant hotel in the University District. Our room was comfortable, fresh, clean and quiet. The buffet breakfast was good and there were complimentary snacks available at other times. On checking in I was told to go and help myself to what was available. Staff are relaxed, helpful and friendly. There is a complimentary shuttle available to various locations. Metro buses run frequently and it is a quick and cheap trip to downtown. The U District has plenty to offer in the way of bars, restaurants etc. This was my first stay at the University Inn but I will always make it my first choice whenever I stay in Seattle. I filled in a comment card at the end of my stay and was pleasantly surprised to receive a letter of thanks for so doing. Highly recommended.

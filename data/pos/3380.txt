We've stayed at the Andra several times. We usually book a suite - for 2 adults / one chilld. The rooms are spacious, modern and clean with all the amenities youd expect - Comfortable bed and trendy dcor. The lobby area / lounge is busy in the evening. Cool atmosphere for pre-dinner drinks. The staff is friendly and professional. The restaurant  Lola  is good and always busy for breakfast. Good location - A short walk to Pike place Market, Macys, Nordstrom , Niketown and many great restaurants. Windows could use better soundproofing, you can hear traffic noise even on the 8th floor.

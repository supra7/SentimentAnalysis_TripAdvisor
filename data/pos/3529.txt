My husband and I Seattle residents and we stayed at Hotel Andra to celebrate our anniversary. From a local perspective, it's a great way to take in the character of the city. Location - Andra is conveniently located close to the heart of downtown shopping, and not too far to walk to the Pike Place Market and art museum. There is construction as others have noted, but it's not loud. The best part is being literally within striking distance of some of the city's best restaurants - especially those owned by celeb chef Tom Douglas. Dine at Lola, Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery (casual cafe), or Serious Pie if you're looking for great food. I recommend Lola for dinner - great Mediterranean/Morrocan fare (adjoins the lobby), and Dahlia Lounge for brunch. Room/Decor - Very tastefully decorated and modern. Our bathroom in the standard room was small (particularly the shower/tub), but the main living area was very spacious and the bed quite comfortable. There is a little vanity/seating area for getting ready, nice bathrobes and decent bath products. General Hotel/Service - Everything was very clean, the lobby and lounge very attractive. Staff were efficient, friendly and professional. Think the W, but with local flair and less pricey. The next time we splurge like this, I'd like to stay at the Andra again (and perhaps get a room with an upgraded bathroom).

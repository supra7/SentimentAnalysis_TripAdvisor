Great hotel location. on the waterfront. fireplaces in every room. front desk staff very helpful, happy in their work, and will go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. if you go on a weekend, keep in mind that street parking is free from 6pm saturday and all day sunday, The hotel has a shuttle service every hour, first come first served, that will take you to various restaurants, venues, etc. and pick you up, last trip being at 10pm. The lounge has great entertainment, and reasonable small plates. Very generous martinis!

I booked a weekend at the Inn at the Market based on a friends recommendation. Their Counter Staff were the best and most personable I have met at any Hotel world-wide. I left my "liquids bag" at TSA and asked about replacements at the desk. I received mini-Shaving cream, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Deodorant, and Razor. Yippeee! The Hotel overlooks Pike Place Market. (From my Water View room, I could see Puget Sound, the Pike Place Fish Market and the fish being thrown by Pike Place Fish. On the other hand, "City View" rooms have only a view of a few downtown Seattle buildings.) The beds were comfy. There was even an umbrella in the closet if needed. The Hotel is easy to find. From the Airport via Light Rail the Station it is five blocks away straight down Pine St. at the intersection with 1st Ave. Valet Parking is available if you drive. There is plenty to do, see, and eat, within walking distance. This is an excellent Hotel without being pretentious from the Doorman right down to the Maids.

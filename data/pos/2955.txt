I would highly recommend the Sheraton Seattle, particularly for a trip focused on downtown. It's a 2-minute walk to the Link light rail (easy to get to/from the airport), it's about 10 minutes to Pike Place Market and it's easy to catch a free shuttle bus from here around downtown and to some surrounding areas. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the rooms are nice. Based on prior reviews, I did ask for a room in the Union Street Tower (the new tower) and was happy with my room. It was spacious and had a small seating area. Bathroom was fine and having a little desk was helpful. Only complaint: the bed is only sort of comfortable, and the pillows are not great. Also, the repeated complaint that this hotel nickel and dimes you for things is true (charges for toll-free calls, charge for internet access in the room, expensive valet charge.) I got my reservation on Hotwire for around $200 total (plus taxes) for two nights, so it was a good bargain and, therefore, worth the sleep disappointment. But, overall, I had a great stay and it was a perfect starting point for exploring downtown and nearby neighborhoods.

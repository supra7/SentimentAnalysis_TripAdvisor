A small, basic but well-run business hotel. The standard room is just big enough for one person. But the room is clean and pleasant, the bed was great --pillows too- and the large flat showerhead feels like a gentle rain. Nice large-screen TV, AC/heat worked great. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Locale was very convenient for my purposes --close to the conference I was attending (but MANY dollars cheaper) and in a safe area so I walked back and forth daily. Also an easy walk to the Pike Place market and the historic district. A good and much lass expensive option for a business traveler. But be forewarned -- no restaurant in the hotel --however, a coffee store on the main level offers breakfast sandwiches as well as Seattle's Best Coffee (think that was the name of it.)

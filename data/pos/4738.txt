Having read some of the previous reviews of this Travelodge my wife and I approached it with some reservations. Our room had recently been refurbished and had the largest and most comfortable bed we had ever slept in, in hotels or at home! The reception staff were helpful and polite, and we didn't have to ask for the $10 parking permit. The complimentary breakfast was just fine. For all but Americans (who don't seem to like walking) the motel's position suited us perfectly. We walked into downtown in about 15 minutes (at no great pace), with another 5 - 10 minutes to Pike Place Market (depending on how many shop windows we looked in on the way). It was possible to walk to the waterfront of Lake Union in 10 minutes. There was a lot of building work in the vicinity of the motel, but this didn't give us a problem - any noise stopped at night. We would love to go back to Seattle, which we enjoyed very much, and would go staight back to this Travelodge.

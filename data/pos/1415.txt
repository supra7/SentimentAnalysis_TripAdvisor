I was reading reviews of Queen Ann because I will be back in Seattle for my second visit. Last time, about 6 yrs ago, I found this hotel to be just as it is being described now. That means I'll be going back for another stay. Thanks to all those who take the time to contribute to these forums and make travel easier for the rest of us.

We stayed at this hotel on the first night of our Seattle & Vancouver trip and was pleasantly surprised by it. The place is a European style hotel (in furnishings and size), but it was quite confortable and clean. It was also a good value overall compared to other hotels of this caliber--just be sure to check their website for special packages. Ours included the room, valet parking (which is normally a crazy $30/night--normal for downtown, though), and a $20 gas card for each night. The front desk person and manager didn't have my change to this certain package from just a room and were inflexible about giving it to me at first. That was pretty disappointing, but we got a call a couple of hours later stating that they would give us it afterall. The location was superb--VERY close to delicious Dahlia Lounge(for dinner) and Lola (for breakfast--have the Greek scramble). It is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and it sounded like an attached monorail ride to the Seattle Center.

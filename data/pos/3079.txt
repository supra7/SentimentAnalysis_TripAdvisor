We spent 2 nights at the Sheraton in Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Great downtown location that makes it extremely accessible to all the local sights and sounds. Pike Place Mkt was 5 blocks away and the MonoRail was 2 blocks away. Plenty of dining options located in and around the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff -- very easy check-in and check-out.

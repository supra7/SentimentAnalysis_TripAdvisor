Loved everything about this hotel. The room was amazing, with a different layout than a usual hotel room. The bed was comfy, there was Starbucks coffee in the room, great workout and swimming pool area. We got our room on priceline which made it an amazing bargain. Hotel was within walking distance to everything we did in Seattle. Best of all, it was so quiet in the room. We were not bothered by any noise from hallway or next door.

We were first-timers to Seattle so didn't know where to stay. Bid on Priceline took us to the Renaissance at $123/night. We couldn't have been happier. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Room was perfect and clean with great 7 pillow bed. Be sure to go to the 28th floor for happy hour. The view is amazing and staff, Rick and Maria, are terrific. DO NOT rent a car as parking is limited and expensive. You can walk everywhere. Downtown bus service is free. Walk a couple blocks to the Columbia Center/B of A building and go to the 73rd observation floor and for $3/pp see the best views in Seattle (vs $22 at Space Needle). Walk to Pike Place Market, take bus to Museum of Flight and to the Locks, take the ferry to Bainbridge and eat the best clam chowder at Ivar's for a perfect Seattle experience.

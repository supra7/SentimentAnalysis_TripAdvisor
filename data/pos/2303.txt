This hotel is soooooo beautiful, classy and perfect! Location: 5 stars, I would give it 10 stars if I could! I am actually from a suburb of Bellevue but stayed here with my boyfriend to go to Bumbershoot. There are bus stops everywhere within the one-block circumference of this hotel. Or maybe that's just Seattle's awesome public transportation system. Anyway, the service was also spectacular. The front-desk lady knew EVERYTHING about Seattle and how to get around. Free wireless Internet is also a huge bonus! The room was a little small, but there were only two of us staying there and we like to be close. But for those of you who need space, you may want to go for one of those hotel chain suites. The SBC in the lobby was also super convenient and perfect for breakfast. Oh! And everything is really oldschool, including a very nice doorman who greets everyone by name! Adorable!

W stayed at the Westin for 1 night before our Alaska cruise. We got 2 rooms for the two of us. they upgraded us to a higher floor with a beautiful view of the Space Needle. We really enjoyed the view because the weather was perfect. In the morning we had coffee downstairs. I do not recommend the starbucks at all. It was so bitter I returned it for a tea. My son drank his coffee and ended up with a stomach from the acid in the coffee. When we returned from the cruise I realize that I forgot my cell phone charger and some underwear in the room. They could'nt find the underwear but they said they would ship the charger. They did not give me a price when I asked. I looked at my credit card statement and realized I was charged $80.00 to ship the small charger that weighed about 6 oz to a city across the border that was 20 mins away by plane. This is overpriced for sure. I contacted the Westin by phone and Email. I never got a call back but I did get a email 4 days later stating they were passing it on to someone else. Very poor after service. I would stay here again if the price was cheaper. The lobby was dull and not very pretty. The room itself was comfy. I prefer the Sheraton 5th Ave for it's beautiful lobby that smelled good. Their rooms were just as comfortable. Just don't forgot anything in you room if you stay here and don't drink the coffee.

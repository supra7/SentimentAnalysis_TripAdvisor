This was my first time going to Seattle and I didn't really know how things were situated downtown. However, after going there and staying in two different hotels just a few blocks from each other, I can say that the Moore is the best deal. It's literally 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. The rooms are bare and old, yes, but very clean. The cleaning staff even makes towel animals like they do on cruise ships - a small but thoughtful gesture for a minimally staffed hotel. My only "complaint" is that the bathroom is VERY small, which wasn't a problem for me but if you're claustrophobic I would not stay here. Things I didn't know before staying there: the hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby though it's not advertised so you should ask the receptionist. In addition, it is a historic hotel and is next to The Moore Theater. Both of which were featured in a little walking food tour we did, so be sure to check out the theater, I hear it's beautiful on the inside! Bottom line: If you don't care too much about hotel amenities and are just traveling to explore the city, then the Moore provides a perfect place to sleep and have easy access to downtown Seattle. Parking is definitely an issue though, so if you are traveling with a car I'd look into another hotel that offers parking.

We hadn't planned on staying at this hotel during our visit to Seattle in April 2006, but it proved to be a great experience. The accomodations were clean and adequate, the staff was efficient and friendly and the price was budget oriented. Due to the location of the Travelodge, we parked our car and walked to restaurants and attractions. The free ride service was several blocks away but once we became familiar with how to navigate around Seattle via the buses we were on our way. We met interantional travelers and had a great time seeing the city up close and personal. There were some noisy neighbors who had children and/or were partying but that did not spoil our stay. After spending two weeks traveling through Wahington, the Travelodge provided us with one of the "best beds" we experienced during our vacation. Keep up the great work.

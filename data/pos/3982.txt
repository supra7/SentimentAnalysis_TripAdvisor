This hotel has the best location of any hotel in Seattle. It is literally on a dock along the city's waterfront harbor. The views are simply spectacular. But you pay dearly for location. The decor is a little odd and the interior halls are badly in need of renovation. They have spent money to upgrade the rooms which are interesting, but they've not spent anything to upgrade the interior halls, etc. The hotel was built probably in the 50s or 60s and in some spots it looks like it. But the rooms are nice, albeit a little inconsistent. The waterfront balcony rooms have fireplaces and balconies where you can walk outside and enjoy the spectacular views. They are in a kind of rustic Northwoods look. The bathrooms are simply to die for. Nouveau chic style with marble counters, cut stone floors, big fluffy bathrobes, an interesting table top sink bowl, a walk in shower with thick doorless glass and the best showerhead I've ever used. The kind with a BIG oversized head that's practically like being under a waterfall. But the motifs of the bathroom and the room are in total contrast. The mix is not very appealing stylistically, but they are comfotable. The management doesn't get high marks from me because of the sign that says they want to save water so they will only change sheets every three days and towels only if you put them on the floor. But then the toilet and shower are not low flow and there's no sink drain stopper, so you have the leave the water running for ten minutes while getting ready. So much for water saving...it's clear they only want to save money not water. But they don't return the savings. While this is a very nice hotel in a great location, it is terribly overpriced. I was on a business trip that was prebooked, but when I saw the rate I about died. Waaaaay too expensive. If they would do an interior renovation to clean up the hallways and bring down rates, this would be a spectacular hotel.

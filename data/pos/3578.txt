Hello, my wife and I stayed at the Hotel Andra for three nights in March. We found the hotel to be clean, quiet, and comfortable. The Lola restaurant was decent, with good service. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a luxury hotel, it seemed somewhat basic, though comfortable. We didn't require much from the hotel staff, so we didn't have much interaction with them; they didn't really go out of their way to see how we were doing. The valet parking was a bit expensive ($35/night) and one night the valet left our car lights on, requiring a jump start the next morning. Otherwise, not a bad experience.

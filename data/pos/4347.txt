Booked room on Hotwire for the second time in two years. Read some reviews that inferred that this may lower the level of service or quality of room we'd get. Not true at all. The hotel was busy with the start of cruise ship season yet the check in was quick and attentive ensuring that we got the best room available at the time. I believe her name was Jen. She even sent up a non-alcoholic bottle of wine and a card for our anniversary. Although the elevators seem a bit wild, we didn't have to wait any longer than normal. Any issue was parking as their lot was full upon our arrival. Easy solution, just do a loop around the building and pull into the "westin parking lot". It is actually not part of the hotel but uses the name - go figure. It was $22 to park for 24 hours with in/out. The actual Westin parking is around $40.

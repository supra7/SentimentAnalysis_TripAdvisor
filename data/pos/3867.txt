I've stayed here multiple times and find it to be one of the most enjoyable places ever. The remodeled bathrooms are gorgeous, the rooms are very comfy and welcoming, and the customer service is excellent! I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you're looking for something out of the ordinary.

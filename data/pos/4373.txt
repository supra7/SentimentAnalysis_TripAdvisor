My husband and I stayed here for a date night out away from the kids. Only $ 86 on Hotwire. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews about poor service and less than perfect housekeeping. We were very happy with what we got for the price. You can't find a better location for shopping and dining. Easy walk to Pike Place and the waterfront. The service was great, easy check- in and a late check- out. The room did smell musty and it was dusty. The hotel needs updating, but the bed was comfy and the hotel was quiet. We needed extra TP and it was delivered within 5 minutes of our call. I wouldn't pay rack rates to stay, but was thrilled for $86!

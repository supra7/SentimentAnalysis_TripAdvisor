This Sheraton is in a perfect place in Seattle. We either walked or took taxi everwhere we wanted to go. The staff really made us feel welcome. We did have one problem. We did the quick check out because we had an early flight. After we got home I received the final bill & a small ( less than $5.00 ) had been charged to the room for something missing from the guest snack basket. I had the credit card company remove the charge as we ( the wife & I ) did not use anything out of the basket. This also happened to another couple that was staying there at the same time we were.

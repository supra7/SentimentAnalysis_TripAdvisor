The Westin Seattle has a great central location that is a 10 minute or less walk to all the things we had planned including Pike Place, the Monorail (90 second ride to the Space Needle), the flagship Nordstrom store, and lots of great restaurants (we went to Serious Pie, Palace Kitchen, The Crumpet Shop, Le Panier, and various Pike Place spots on our Savor Seattle tours). The room is what you would expect from a Westin and at the price I paid (under $90), it was perfect!

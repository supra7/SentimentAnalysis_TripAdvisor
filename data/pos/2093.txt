We stayed in June for 3 nights. It is definitely a no thrills place but the room we had on the fourth floor was massive, with a new carpet, comfy bed, clean sheets, walk in warbrobe and a sink. The toilet and shower room were across the coridoor. They could have done with a refurb but shower pressure was great and they were clean. It is really close to Pike Place and pretty much every attraction is in walking distance (depending on how far you fancy walking). The decor is alittle on the dull side but nothing to really bother about. Staff were really helpfull and friendly. Location is fairly safe (we didn't have any problems) but Seatlle does have its fair share of crazies but they are pretty harmless. The bar next door is one you would not normally go into if you were in your home town but we popped in for a cheeky cider or five and ended up chatting to most of the locals who were really cool, even if a little rough around the edges!

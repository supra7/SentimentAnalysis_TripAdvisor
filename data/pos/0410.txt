We spent two nights here and I can't say enough about what an enjoyable experience it was. The room was a small suite, and was extremely nice. The furnishings and amenities were first class. The staff of the hotel couldn't have been any nicer. The location is perfect. I would strongly recommend travelers to Seattle stay at this hotel

The hotel was nice, comfy beds, updated interior, beautiful view, but... water pressure was very weak and I also was surprised that we had to pay for wireless - 9 dollars a day? It's ridiculous! It's free even when you stay at a simple Motel 6 somewhere along a highway. Otherewise this hotel is pretty nice and very close to everything - market, stores and sightseeing. Loved Seattle!

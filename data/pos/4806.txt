We had 2 nights here.It was easy from the airport,we got the Light Rail which was $2.50 each 1 way to Westlake then hotel shuttle picks you up with prior arrangement from Pacific Plaza which is app 100 yards away.Contact hotel to book shuttle.The shuttle goes on the hour from the hotel to downtown & returns on the half hour with prior arrangement.The staff are very friendly.Theres continental breakfast which you help yourself to,there was waffles,toast,muffins,english muffins,hard bolied eggs,juice,coffee,cereals.Theres also fee wifi in the rooms and a computer with free internet downstairs.The rooms very comfortable and clean.We had a lovely stay with no problems at all.It's slightly out of town but don't let this put you off.Excellent value for money

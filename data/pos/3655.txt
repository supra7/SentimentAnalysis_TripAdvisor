Me and my boyfriend just spent four days at this lovely small hotel. It's very quiet and relaxing - the rooms are practically soundproof. The beds a little hard for my taste, but I slept well enough. Our room wasn't very big as it was next to the lift (no noise though!), but that was more than compensated by the big - and I mean BIG - balcony. Small but good selection for breakfast. It wasn't very central, but then I'm used to walking a lot anyway... The metro is just about five minutes walk away - and there are buses passing close by too.

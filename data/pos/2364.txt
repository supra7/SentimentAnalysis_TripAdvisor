From the moment we walked in, we were rather impressed with the service. We had high floor and quiet room. The room met our expectations for a usual 4 to 5 star hotel. But I would rate this hotel at most 4 star aiming (but not there yet) to be a 5 star. You can tell there isn't enough thought put into the room amenities e.g. no disposable room slippers, and no kettle! The bar fridge was empty too. Internet cost extra so was a bummer unless you go to the lobby. Hotel was updated but not everything e.g. lifts are still quite old, light switches in the room is also the old type. Sofa in the room also did not look like the new funky type. Parking at hotel is expensive but you can do free street parking at night but do remember to remove it or pay for it from 8 am - they are rather punctual and strict about it. Rather inconvenient in you need to go to the corner store (convenience store) for anything at night because the closest one is like 5 blocks away. Hotel would suit more the business type but if you're on vacation and can get a good deal, would highly recommend.

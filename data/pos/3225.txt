We stayed at the Sixth Ave. Inn this week for 4 nights, we found the hotel to be a very nice place. We had a problem with a horrible odor coming out of our air conditioner our third night there and we were moved to another room. It was something that could have happened anywhere, but the employees at the front desk were wonderful and very helpful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and all the employees went above and beyond.

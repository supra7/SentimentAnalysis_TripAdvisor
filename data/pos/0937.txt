This is hands-down the best location in Seattle. You are right in the heart of Pike's Place Market. We ate almost all of our meals in the market and nothing beats making a great picnic, grabbing a bottle of wine, and eating on hotel's rooftop deck. The deck overlooks the water and the entrance to the market and this alone makes the price of the room worth it. The staff were very nice--even leaving us a sumptuous dessert in the room for our anniversary. In my opinion, this is the only place to stay in Seattle!

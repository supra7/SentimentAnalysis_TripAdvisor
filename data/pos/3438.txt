Our third time personally staying at the hotel, but we have also put many family and friends in the Andra and not a single one was not happy. First and foremost, the staff is what makes the place (you know, like excellent bread makes the sandwich!). I've seen the lobby packed with check-out visitors nervous about making their cruise ship departures or whatever destination, and the front desk and entry staff just stay poised and deliver calming service. Second, while the hotel can handle your business/event needs (especially in the multi-level/multi-nook main room), I especially love the fact that the vibe is NOT business, but personal. Even some smaller hotels don't pull this off as well. The lobby sitting areas and the great transition to the Lola Lounge/Restaurant make you feel like you are already "out at a cool place." Third, the rooms are decorated in a very subdued, yet crisp, color palette that is just plain comforting. The beds are great and the towels (Frette) are just awesome and don't have that overwashed and bleached feeling. I could go on, but I'll leave some things to surprise you. If you need/want to go visit Seattle; do yourself a favor and stay here. Oh, but lastly, the rates (even for suites) are reasonalbe, especially compared to other hotels in downtown seattle.

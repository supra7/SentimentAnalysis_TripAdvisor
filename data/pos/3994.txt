This hotel is very unique in that it is built on a pier and you have a great view of the ocean on the waterside of the hotel. We stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with the hotel. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. We ate breakfast there 2 days and we order room service and the food was excellent, even though a little pricey. The room was decorated in a cute lodge motiff and it was comfortable. The bed and linens were excellent. The hotel has a shuttle that will take you anywhere in the dowtown area which was great. We parked our car and didn't move it for 3 days. There is alot to see and do in the downtown area and we either walked or took the shuttle. I would stay at this hotel again and I would reccommend it for anyone that wants to stay in the downtown Seatle area .

This hotel has charm galore and the location is great. Its across the street from a large Macy's Dept Store and a 5-10 minute walk to the Pike Place Public Market and a quirky restaurant called The Pink Door. Conveniently there is a large drug chain store across the street in the opposite direction. There's a lot of shopping in the area. The hotel staff is very helpful and pleasant. The hotel upgraded me to a junior suite which had a full bath & a 3/4 bath, 2 large closets, a living area and a separate bedroom with 2 queen beds. There were french doors between the living and bedroom areas and a flat screen TV in each area. The view looked out on the Space Needle & the lights of the city. The lobby is relaxed in an almost European style. This hotel is sort of old school, in a good way. The Mayflower Park was perfect for a woman travelling alone because it has human scale and a genteel quality. By the way, breakfast in Andaluca, their casual restaurant, was delicious and they put plenty on the plate!!

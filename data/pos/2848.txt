We got checked in with no problems at 10am after getting off the cruise ship. I reserved this hotel using priceline so the price was good. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I had to buy a new suitcase and they told me about the Ross only three blocks away. They brought all our luggage up to the room for us which was very helpful. It was within walking distance to Pike Market and to Monorail. Internet is $12 per day. Since I knew that before I bid, I had factored that into the price so it wouldn't come as a shock. Personally, I think they should have free internet as most hotels do these days. I would stay here again.

Requested new tower and upgrade (being Starwood Preferred member) - got neither - maybe call the day before? Anyway room was fine EXCEPT - ice maker on my floor didn't work my entire visit (I complained twice) - coffee pot in my room didn't work - they took it away but didn't bring a new one or hand towels until I reminded them a second time. also the malfunctioning coffee pot spilt over onto below the sink and they did not clean that. YOu have to go to the lobby for free internet. Business center was full at midnight when I went to print my boarding pass - I had to BEG at the desk to have them print it. Lots of construction still going on. But I do still love Seattle!

After struggling to find a hotel with rooms free at a very busy time of year we eventually found the Hotel Seattle. It is in a great location and half the price of most other hotels in the area. The room was clean although the decor was slightly old-fashioned. Staff were friendly and helpful trying to help out with information about the local area at various times of the day and night. If you just want somewhere to sleep and as a base to explore Seattle this hotel is perfect. If you want somehwere a bit more stylish that will charge you at least twice the price then Seattle has plenty of choice!!!

The Sheraton downtown Seattle hotel was great in every way. We were there for our 50th anniversary and it was perfect. We had a reservation for the Club Floor and it was well worth the value. The breakfast every morning in the Club Lounge was excellent and the service outstanding. Also, our room was very large we had a view of Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. The hotel's location was perfect for sightseeing. We walked to practically everything. Definitely would stay at this hotel again!!

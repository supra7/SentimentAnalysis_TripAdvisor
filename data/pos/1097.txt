The furnishings were a little worn and the bathroom small, but you have to expect that with a budget motel. The important things are that they provided parking on the premises, the room (and more importantly, the bedding) was clean, the bathroom was clean and all the fixtures in there worked properly, and the guy working the front desk was friendly and helpful. The air conditioner worked well too. Nothing fancy, but a decent deal for such a great location in downtown Seattle.

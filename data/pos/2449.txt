I scored a great rate, with breakfast for two, and parking included (through travelocity) for this hotel during a short (2 night) stay in Seattle. The hotel location is perfect. It is within walking distance to just about everything we wanted to see/do while in Seattle. It does sit on the top of a very steep hill, so walking back up after a long day of sight-seeing is a bit of a trek. I would recommend grabbing a cab for the return trip (less than $5 from most places). The room was nice. Two comfortable double beds with multiple pillows, a desk, chair, refridgerator, and decent sized closet. The bathroom is niclely updated with pleanty of counter space and nice toiletries. We had a room with access to the concierge lounge, which provided free snacks, drinks, and continental breakfast items each day. Our room faced the highway, but I did not hear any noise (on the 27th floor). The parking was convienient. The garage is very small, with tight access around corners and into spots. I can't complain since the price was included in the room rate. We ate a full breakfast twice at Maxwells. The buffet was very good, with a selection of hot and cold items. On Sunday morning there was even someone doing made-to-order omlets. There is paid internet access in the rooms, but all common areas have free wi-fi. The first floor lounge has comfortable chairs and a fireplace and was a great place to do some quick internet surfing without paying.

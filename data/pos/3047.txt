stayed at this hotel, feb 2009 on an spg cash and points stay. Was impressed by the size of this hotel. Valet parking was fine, check in was a little slow as there was only one check-in agent manning the desk during our check-in. But total wait time could not have been more than 5 mins. Had access to the club floor and lounge which is great value for the extra money. Continental bfast was more that i expected and very healthy. One suggestion for management if they read this is for the 2nd floor free weight workout area. I suggest they install mirrors on the wall behind the free weight rack. These mirrors are pretty standard in gyms and i am surprised that the are not installed in a workout room of this caliber. all in all a trouble free stay and i would return because of the excellent location.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 7-14-10 to 7-16-10 (Prior to our 25th Anniversary 7-day cruise to Alaska). First, let us say that this hotel went over and beyond the call of duty (way beyond our expectations. To the FRONT DESK STAFF at check-in: We forgot their names but their professionalism and kindness were just so...well...just oustanding. To the Conceige, SAM: He really earned his $$$ with us, he was so helpful. To the Bell person ALLEN: Allen remember us the couple from Indiana (near Chicago), we thought you were the the greatest...thank-you. Last and certainly not least, this individual and company arranged our vacation/cruise (Travels By Charlotte), you know who you are. You will always have our services. TBC and CPH, thank-you for the King Room upgrade, and the BIG chocolate covered strawberries with the HUGE bottle champaign. "BIG, BIG THANK-YOU TO TBC AND CPH!!!

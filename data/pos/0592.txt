Stayed the weekend of January 28th at the Warwick Hotel.Booked the day before and was told all I could get was a smoking King size on the city side.I told them that my preference would be a king size non-smoking on the Space Needle side away from the elevators as I had read here.When we arrived we discovered that our room was as requested.We were greeted by the concierge who was very helpful.The room was average size and the bed was comfortable.The wife loved the tub and the marble tiles in the bathroom.The room was very clean.We had a package that they advertised on their website which was $150 per night tax included , parking, and breakfast in the restaurant (which was very good).All hotels in Seattle charge anywhere from 15-25 dollars a night for parking.The location is great we walked to the Pike Place Market ,the Harbour front,the convention centre area at night for dinner.There were lots of people walking about and we had no safety concerns.Ralph's grocery market /Deli is next door and open till 2AM for food or snacks.

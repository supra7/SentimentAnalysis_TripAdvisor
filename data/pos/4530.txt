We stayed here after our Alaska cruise in May 2009. WONDERFUL STAY withe STAFF WHO ARE VERY ACCOMODATING, HELPFUL & FRIENDLY ESPECIALLY THE CONCIERGE WHO IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE & PROFESIONAL!!! I especially like the Asian looking concierge who name I had forgotten BUT I want to say that he is INDEED A VERY VALUEBLE EMPLOYEE to the Westin Seattle as tourist like us appreciate such HELPFULNESS and He Always WEAR A SMILE NO MATTER WHAT!!! Room NICE, COMFORTABLE, SPACIOUS!!! The claim chowder in the cafe is really YUMMY!!! I am not a big fan of clam chowder as I am very selective of the taste of clam chowder BUT this cafe offers the BEST EVER SEATTLE CLAM CHOWDER and I am still raving about their clam chowder every time I order clam chowder while eating out and always compared the one I am eating to the one that this place offered, Thus far, none had beat this place yet Hotel convenience to downtown area, nearby the train to Seattle Center and buses around corner to get to every where and airport transfer available though we use cab service at the front of the hotel since we are a family of 3 and prefer not to hull luggage from hotel to bus and bus to airport if using the Greyhound airport transfer and the price from Seattle Down for any cab service to airport is FIXED PRICE though the cab driver still use meter but we paid him the fixed rate. In fact, meter is cheaper BUT our taxi driver indicate to us that most people would pay the fixed rate plus more. OVERALL, WESTIN SEATTLE WOULD BE MY DESTINATION HOTEL IN SEATTLE THE NEXT TIME I HEAD TOWARD THERE WITH MY FAMILY. In fact, I already told my friends and family to choose this hotel if they ever stay in Seattle.

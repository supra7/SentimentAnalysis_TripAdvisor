Very nice stay. We got a fair price and stayed in a lux suite, which was perfect for family relaxation. Our grown sons stayed in a separate room but we used the suite for watching a movie together and it was very comfortable. Love the decor. Clean. The lamb kebabs are awesome. My only suggestions: move the TV so guests sitting on the couch can see it as well; please use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of dry creamer, and it would be nice if it had a soaking tub...but that would involve a renovation. We will s tay here again.

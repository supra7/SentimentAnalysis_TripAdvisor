We stayed here one night on our way back home at the end of a vacation. This is a great hotel that is well managed, very clean and staffed by very friendly people. They also have a free shuttle to to downtown and most major attractions in Seattle. It is also an easy bike ride to downtown. You would be pleased to stay here on business or with family on vacation. You will save money over a downtown location without sacrificing quality and comfort.

My Husband and I stayed at the Sorrento after being on a cruise, and it really ended our holiday on a high. From the moment we arrived, you were made to feel really special. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. The Hotel has real charm and everything about the place was tasteful. The bedrooms were wonderfrul, and in the evenings they have a beautiful fireside room where they play jazz, and it was a lovely place to unwind and relax after a busy day. We have travelled all over the world, and the one thing that is lacking in most of the hotels nowadays is the complete indifference most of the staff have, well you won't find that in the Sorrento, it is run by people who really care that your stay is enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is ever in Seattle. I just wish that other hotels could be run in this manner. The location is ideal and they have a courtesy car that will take you into the City whenever you like. The Concierge and other members of staff really went out of their way to be helpful, even recommending places to visit that would'nt be too crowded, as unfortunately we arrived on the weekend of a public holiday.

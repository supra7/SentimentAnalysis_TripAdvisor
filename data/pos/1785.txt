My husband and I went to Seattle for his Birthday as well as a last getaway before Baby was born. This was a wonderful hotel. Staff was amazingly helpful in every situation. They also helped us plan our trip to Victoria, B.C. with such ease. Hotel is in perfect location, with in walking distance to everything and surrounded by wonderful places to dine!! Would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to EVERYONE!!

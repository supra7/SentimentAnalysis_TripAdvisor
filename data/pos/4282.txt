I liked this hotel a lot. It was pretty fancy and welcoming. Everything was great. The only few negative things I have is that the pool closed at 11, when we got into our hotel room the bottle of wine was leaking and we got charged even though we didn't do it and parking and wi-fi are an extra (not to mention) expensive cost. Other than that it was great! Very comfy beds, and great view!

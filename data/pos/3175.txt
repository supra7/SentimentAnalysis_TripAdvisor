The hotel was under renovation when I visited, so I had to use a side door, but when my cab arrived there were doormen on the sidewalk to direct me to the right place. It's apparent Sheraton has taken steps to minimize inconvenience during the construction. The construction wasn't a problem when I got to my room though. It was on a high floor as I requested and was located well away from the construction. I only wish the Club Lounge was open all day like those at Ritz-Carlton. I tend to sleep late and always miss out on the continental breakfast! The 35th floor pool and jacuzzi had excellent views. The jacuzzi didn't work, but it was nice to sit in anyway. I think they overcholorinate the pool though. It was nice to have changing rooms at the hotel pool; I don't like to wander through a grand hotel in my swimsuit on my way to/from the pool! Pike's Place Cafe used to have such wonderful regional cuisine; they've since replaced the menu there and for room service with the new Sheraton standard. I like to experience regional cuisine when I travel, but I must admit, the carrot cake on Sheraton's menu is to die for! Guest service at this property is intuitive. When I asked the front desk for the location of the nearest cellular telephone store so I could buy a new charger for my cell phone, the clerk produced a box of them from housekeeping. Apparently a lot of guests leave cell phone chargers in their rooms and he allowed me to pick out the one that matched from the box!

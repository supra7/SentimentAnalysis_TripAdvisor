It was our first stay here and with the special rate promotion that was being held in conjunction with the Flower & Garden show, we decided to give it a try. We had a corner room with a king and it was more spacious than the other rooms. The beds were super comfy and the pillow selections were a nice touch along with the nightly turn down service. Although we were very close to the elevator, it was very quiet. A pleasant surprise was the "Happy Wine Hour" in the lobby. The 1st evening was hosted by a rep. from the winery who poured very small samples but had a wine story to tell when asked. The following 2 evenings were hosted by Lane, from the front desk, and were a lot of fun along with other guests that we met there. The morning coffee service was appreciated especially having real cups to drink from and being able to snuggle up to the lobby fireplace to read the many free newspapers. The location was great as we walked everywhere including the Key Arena (a good hike) and the Convention Centre. We did not try the restaurant but heard others say it was good. Staff are very attentive and welcoming you back each time you return. A very enjoyable stay!

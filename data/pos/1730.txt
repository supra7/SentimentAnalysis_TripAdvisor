Visting from Vancouver for a weekend get-away we chose the 'our friends from the north' package which included complimentary valet parking. We walked everywhere, including to the Mariners game (30 minutes). Close to everything. Great location, beautiful old hotel that has been totally updated, gorgeous room, and great staff. We'll definitely be back! The Mayflower is our new favorite!

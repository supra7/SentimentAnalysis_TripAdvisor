Basically a nice place to stay Love the double shower heads The beds are hard but the pillows were nice ;-) I'd say they are slightly overpriced. I've stayed in much nicer places for the price. But overall it is the perfect location and it's clean and the rooms are spacious. No major complaints. be prepared to pay $25+ for parking!

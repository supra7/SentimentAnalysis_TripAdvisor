We stayed at the MarQueen hotel for approx. 6 days. It was very clean and also in a great location. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and arranged a few restaurant reservations and a day trip for us to BC. The room had a huge kitchen with sitting area and a separate mini-living room area. The hotel is within a short walk to the space needle and in an area that has a lot of good restaurants, shopping, etc. There is also a restaurant, spa and coffee shop in the same building. I would love to stay there again if we get back to Seattle in the future.

We live in Hawaii and picked this hotel because it was close to the Amtrak station. As soon as we walked in, we were greated by a very friendly front desk staff. The room was very plesant and we were very pleased. They also have a wonderful restaurant there. We would definately stay there again. Dalyce Nishibayashi

Besides the fact that the locationm is ideal and within walking distance to so many major attractions, the hotel staff is superb. From the bellmen to the front desk to the housekeeping, etc.. everyone is most professional, friendly and knowledgable! It feels like coming back home each time we are here. We plan to bring our adult children this Fall to enjoy Seattle based out of this wonderful boutique hotel!

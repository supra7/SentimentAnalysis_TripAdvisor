We had a lovely time at the Inn at the Market. We were upgraded to a full water view room and found a delicious treat and card waiting for us (it was our 25th wedding anniversary). Everyone was very kind and helpful. And the location was amazing! We especially enjoyed the rooftop patio. In the morning, we went to Pike's Place Market and bought everything for a wonderful breakfast (fresh squeezed orange juice, smoked salmon, chocolate croissants, strawberries, etc...) and ate it on the deck, enjoying the amazing view. Very romantic. Would highly recommend Inn at the Market and hope to return. Thank you for making our stay so special!

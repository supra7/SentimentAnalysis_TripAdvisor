the first time we stayed here it was just for 1 night and it was a super cheap rate. but after that, we discovered what a great location it is, and that it is clean and the service is great. we've now stayed here 4 times over the past 2 years, and the most recent stay was during christmas last month. i got a great rate off the facebook page, and we stayed for 2 nights with another couple. the rooms are spacious and simple, but clean. the beds aren't as plush and fancy as other hotels, but the sheets and blankets and pillows are clean and smell nice. you get what you pay for... and at the sixth avenue inn, you definitely get your money's worth.

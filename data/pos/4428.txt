Hotel has lovely rooms, which are large and have nice furnishings. Rooms were quiet. The concierge provided some decent recommendations, but the restaurant choices were very safe and "usual". I'm not sure I would have found anything new or trendy through the concierge. I was a bit surprised by the fact that the coffee shop in the hotel closes in the early afternoon, as many guests were still wanting to buy water and snacks. The staff at the coffee shop tried to shoo a patron with a service dog (a very clearly marked service dog) out of the coffee shop for having a dog on the premises.

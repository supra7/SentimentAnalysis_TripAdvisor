Pros: The nice reception area with comfortable furniture and an amazing view. The room design makes you want to stay there. Great bed with lots of pillows. The sitting area with the fireplace could not be more relaxing. Best toiletries ever and a very comfortable bathrobe. Rooms with bears are the best! Cons: City view rooms are pretty much parking lot view and those in the ground and the first floor have people passing next to your window all the time. This makes you feel you're in a cheap motel. Walls are very very thin and you can hear other rooms conversations, tv, and what not. I was not very thrilled wifi was not complementary The restaurant's menu could have more variety.

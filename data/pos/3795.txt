I travelled to Seatle to attend a conference and stayed at teh Edgewater. It is really a lovely property and my room was comfortable and nicely appointed. The restaurant was terrific and the Sunday brunch was excellent. I would love to go back and stay at this property for a romantic getaway, and recommend this hotel highly.

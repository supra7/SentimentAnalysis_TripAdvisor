I love the Mayflower. Even though I don't get any kind of frequent traveler points, I love staying here. The staff is so nice - with manners and a level of service and pride that is hard to find, even in some nicer hotels where I have stayed. The location is great if you want to take the Light Link rail into downtown from the airport (which is a great inexpensive option over taking a cab as long as you don't mind a lot of walking). The hotel is about a block from the Westlake Station. Some of the rooms are a little on the small side, and yes the hotel is old. But I see a welcome attention to cleanliness and I've never smelled a musty smell as some have described. I also love that they have kept the original bathtubs in the bathrooms. They bathrooms are also small and are probably a tight fit for larger people, but I love the deep tubs where you can actually take a nice soak. Also, they have nice bath amenities that are dispensed from larger bottles mounted in the shower and next to the sink. So if you really want to add to your collection of tiny bath supplies, you will be out of luck - but I like the economy of this choice. The comfy robes in each room are a bonus. I would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than the Mayflower!

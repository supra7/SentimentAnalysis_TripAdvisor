Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for a conference. Check in/out was a breeze and the staff service throughout the stay was excellent. Clean, quiet rooms. The downside to this hotel is the restaurant, which serves typically overpriced hotel meals. There are a lot of restaurants nearby with better food for less $. If you need a quick fix and something cheap, there's a Subway sandwich shop just outside the front door of the hotel. Sure beats the cost of room service!

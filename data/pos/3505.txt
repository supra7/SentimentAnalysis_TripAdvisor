My wife and I had a wonderful time, the staff were helpful and the rooms were nicely appointed, comfortible and clean. Especially for an older hotel. We also enjoyed the atomosphere in the lobby and the ajoining bar (make sure you try breakfast at Lola's ... wow). The hotel is located in a great spot to venture out and see the rest of Seattle from too.

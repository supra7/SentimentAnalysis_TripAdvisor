Recently I stayed at the inn at Virginia Mason in Seattle. I usually stay at the Inn at the Market near the Public Market, but this time I had business at Virginia Mason Medical center, so I chose to stay close by. While the Inn at Virginia Mason is an old hotel, it is kept very clean and tidy, and the personal service offered by the front desk staff was great. It is well-located with several good restaurants near and a restaurant in the hotel as well. This hotel is ideal for patients at Virginia Mason Medical Center, as there is an elevator that connects (via sky-bridge walkway) the hotel with the medical center. There is storage for guest's baggage and I heard from more than one guest that hotel staff delivered their bags to their hospital rooms for them. Yes, this hotel is a bit dated, but it's clean and the price is right for a Seattle hotel in a good location. Tip: is you call the toll free number to make a reservation they give you an additional $10 per night off the the internet reservations price. I ate at Konpai, a Japanese restaurant near the hotel, and it was fabulous and very affordable.

We had a Deluxe View Corner King in the tower. Beautiful room. Very clean, very modern. Love the light in the bath/shower. Amazing city views looking north and west. Wonderful location, as all the shopping/restaurants/theaters are seemingly only a block from hotel. Would stay there again in a heartbeat!

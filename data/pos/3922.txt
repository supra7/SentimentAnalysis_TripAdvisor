I will paint another picture of the Edgewater as it seems many of the reviewers sound like arrogant, bitter and petty people who don't travel often. I stayed for a few nights with my gf on the 4th floor. We had a king sized bed with a waterfront view. The room itself was spacious, clean and well appointed with a huge flatscreen, working fireplace and a spa inspired bathroom. The style of the rooms (and hotel for that matter) was a rustic wilderness meets the modern world, warm and inviting. Everything worked just as it should have. The shower did have half a panel...but it made no difference to us. I suppose if you are showering like a maniac I can see it being a problem. The sink does fill up quickly... if you are turning the faucet on unreasonably to the max. We had no problem operating the shower, sink or anything else in the room. They have a business room that is complimentary. I found all of the bellman and front desk agents to be helpful and accommodating. Karen was a sweetheart. Pike Place is in walking distance, a 15 min. walk (we're from NY so walking wasn't a problem). There was an excellent restaurant called Anthony's just down the street. I will be staying at The Edgewater again.

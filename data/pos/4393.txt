The Westin Seattle was in a nice shopping location and offered comforable rooms. The area was fantastic! Lots of shopping and bars/resturants. It is even walking distance to Pike's Place. The hotel had a nice work out center and spa area. One tip - take the light rail to the hotel from the airport. We researched this online and saved a lot of $$ over taking a cab.

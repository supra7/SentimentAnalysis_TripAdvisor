Spent a week there, quite reasonable (Priceline), had a third floor "city view" with balcony (read: parking lot with a view of the Space Needle), great and helpful staff, very clean, great beds, newly remodeled modern bathrooms with rain shower, nice balcony. And the location can't be beat. Restaurant overpriced but upscale and great Elliott Bay view. Railroad noise on parking lot side not a problem, glass doors are soundproof, and you can run the A/C fan all night which covers up all sounds. They provide free ear plugs but we didn't need them. Remarkably quiet--couldn't hear a sound from adjoining rooms. Next time we might spring for a water view but then we'd just want to sit in the room and enjoy the view rather than see Seattle! If you do coffee shops and picnic, you don't have to spend a lot of money. Nice gym with treadmills and weights, two free computers for free internet use, in-room Wi-Fi is a $10 daily fee. We'd do it again, maybe for 4 days. I'd recommend this hotel for those who want the full Seattle experience.

Last year went to hotel with my husband, this year took grandchildren with us. My grandson left his stuffed animal that he had purchased at the zoo, called the hotel. They checked the room, and sent me the animal priority mail. Left Seattle, Saturday, package arrived in New York on Wednesday. The hotel is very safe,24 hour desk service. The kids were able to go down to use the computer while we stayed in the room.Convenient location. We go to visit my daughter in Seattle, cannot stay with her as she has a small studio apt. Room was spacious and clean.Also had a refigerator and coffee pot in room. Also have used the restaurant, waiters very friendly and food excellent. We will book again for next year's visit to my daughter..Staff was courteous and helpful. They also arranged a town car for us to get to the airport. Driver was waiting for us when we got down to the lobby.

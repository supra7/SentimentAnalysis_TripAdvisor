We just returned from a three week trip to the Pacific Northwest. We spent no more than 3 days in any hotel. All the hotels were booked from a discount supplier and all were rated 3,4,or 5 stars, with most being 4 or 5. This hotel exceeded even the 5 star hotels. It is perfectly located within walking distance of most attractions? If not, the public transportation is just across the street. There is a huge shopping mall right across the street. The restaurant in the hotel was great and reasonably priced. The rooms were very large - surprising in a downtown hotel. If there had been a bathrobe in the closet, I would have sworn it was a 5 star.

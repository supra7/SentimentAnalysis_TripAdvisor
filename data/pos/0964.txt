Had a work christmas party/event in Seattle and wanted to stay the night in the city so we chose Inn at the Market after hearing great things about it. We are very happy we did. What a nice hotel! The checkin process was easy and they even had warm freshly baked cookies at the desk to eat. The room was pretty nice with everything we needed. The bathroom was a nice size. We had a city view room due to all the water view rooms being taken already. The only odd thing about the room was that the bed wasn't facing the tv. But certainly no biggie there. Both the room and lobby were very clean. Location is nice despite the many homeless people you tend to see outside the hotel. Not a bad place to stay at all. I'd recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle.

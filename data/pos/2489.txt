We stayed 4 nights at the Renaissance as we wanted a hotel within a short walk of Downtown Seattle and most of the tourist attractions seeing as we didn't plan to rent a car. We got an excellent deal through Expedia, which really reduced the cost of the hotel. I can't fault the hotel at all. The public areas were nicely decorated, the bar on the top floor had an excellent view and a good happy hour, the fitness suite had top-notch equipment and was usually deserted, and our room was a good size and very nicely decorated. Staff were all extremely helpful too.

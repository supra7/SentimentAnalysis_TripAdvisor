Very nice stay over Christmas weekend. Enjoyed this hotel's wonderful central downtown location -- nice walks toSeattle waterfront, aquarium, Pike Place market, Pioneer Square, etc. Friendly and helpful staff. Hosted wine reception a nice touch, also good coffee, tea, and splendid not-too-sweet hot chocolate. We read the New York Times Sunday paper on a rainy morning downstairs. Will gladly return next time. Directly across street corner from public library. Quick rapid transit train from airport stops close to hotel at University Street station.

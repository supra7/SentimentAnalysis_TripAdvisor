'tis a grand old place with none of the quirks and problems you often find in older hotels. It's is modern in all of the important ways - baths, climate control, elevators, WiFi - all very nice and well maintained. Terrific staff, especially the valets. The bar is noted for their martinis and for good reason - best I've had. Location adjacent to a mall is convenient and the monorail is just upstairs.

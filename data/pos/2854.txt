We stayed at this hotel to attend a large ball in the ballroom. We found the place nice, clean, comfortable. During our stay, there was an Anime convention next door but other than the lobby, we heard no one at night. Good: Bed is comfortable, place is clean, people are nice. View was wonderful. Restaurant breakfast was delish. Next to all the major shopping, restaurants and WA Convention Center Bad: No on-site parking and the place they sent us was two blocks away and $30 extra by the time we checked out the next day; no vending on any floor, only in room and the prices were very high ($3.50 for a can of soda); no free breakfast and the pancakes at the Daily Grill were $11 for a plate you can get at Denny's for $4; Wireless internet was $10.95 per day in room.

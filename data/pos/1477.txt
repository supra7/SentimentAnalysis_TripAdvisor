We stayed overnight and had a very good experience. This historic property was at one time a college, lodgings for factory employees and apartments. The hotel was immaculate, with a grand lobby staircase. Each "room" is really a small apartment, and I felt like Ricky and Lucy lived next door. Again, the room was spotless and the sofabed was already made up for our teenage son. All the staff was very helpful and friendly, and even printed up a map to the ferry for my husband. The area is hip with lots of great restaurants and nightlife. Would stay again in a heartbeat!

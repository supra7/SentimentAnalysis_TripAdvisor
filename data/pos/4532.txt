We stayed 3 times in 2 weeks in the Westin Seattle as we went for a cruise to Alaska. Each time our stay was impeccable. We stayed each time in the North Tower with always great views. The beds are really comfy and the bathroom is fine. The hotel is very well located. Waiting time at the elevator (even weekends) were normal except one evening as a seminar on the first floor just finished and even then it wasn't that bad. After reading all the reports we were a bit scared but it is really difficult to find something negative. If I had to, I would say that there is no breakfast room big enough that fits the size of the hotel. But there are many places around the hotel that are offering great breakfasts (go to Lola, one block away) with plenty of space and character. If you want a more personalised and unique hotel go to the Edgewater Hotel but it's location is not that great. We really enjoyed Seattle!! Great city, laid-back, friendly and such good food!! We would definitely stay again in the Westin.

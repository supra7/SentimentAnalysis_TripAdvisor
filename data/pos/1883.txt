Don't book online, call them direct. I booked online and unbeknownst to me I got a single queen room, but needed 2 beds. Jeffery and the manager helped us out by giving us a great 2 queen room with TWO bathrooms. We were on the 12th floor and it had a fantastic view. Bathrooms were clean and the room was perfect. It was a very quiet room, slept great. We had a cosmo in Olivers to celebrate the film "Sex and the City" premiere and had lunch in the restaurant. The risotto was the best I've ever had. Perfect location, Macy's is across the street, Nordies 2 blocks away. We walked everywhere and shopped our selves silly. Pikes Place Market is a few blocks away and is a full of shops, places to eat, the original Starbucks, FIsh and Flowers. Artists of all sorts have set up shop there as well. We flew in to SEATAC, bussed for 12 bucks to the Westin, then walked to Mayflower park with our rolling suitcases. not a problem. Seattle airport is very big, ask for help when navigating it. I want to go back cause I loved Seattle and want to see more of it, will stay in the Mayflower Park again. Everyone who worked there was wonderful and nice. Bellmen were great and helped us out with suggestions and directions.

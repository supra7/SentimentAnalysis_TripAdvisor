This hotel is a few blocks outside of downtown but is a great place to stay. The service was friendly and efficient, the rooms are nicely decorated, clean, and very comfortable, and the bar and lobby are stunning. We spent time downtown and in Capitol Hill and both were an easy walk. We did not eat in the hotel but Sugar, the cafe across the street, has the best pastries I've ever had.

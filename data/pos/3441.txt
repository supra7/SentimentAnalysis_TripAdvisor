We knew the reviews were good, but we were so surprised to find such value at a downtown hotel in Seattle. The Andra is well located, in walking distance of Pike Place, the art museum and the central library as well as shopping and restaurants. And our room, the smallest in the house, was lovely, comfortable and immaculate. The options for room service go way beyond those of other hotels, drawing from nearby establishments, and the fitness center is well equipped. The bathroom was lovely, as was the lobby. But best of all was the hospitality of the staff. We would definitely stay here again. Truly, the only negative is expensive parking. Make sure you get a rate that includes parking, or factor it into your overall costs. Highly recommended!

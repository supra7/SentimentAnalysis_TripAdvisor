We stayed three nights at the Inn on a recent trip to Seattle. The locations was perfect. We could walk to everywhere we wanted to go (even the car rental place when we were leaving). I worried about the market noise, but even though we were right on Pine St., it was quiet at night and morning until about 9 AM. There are several breakfast/bakeries to get breakfast at and great coffee in the market - so easy to get to fast. We opted for a city view room (at a lot less cost) because the Inn has a fabulous deck overlooking the sound for its customers. Since we were never in the room except to sleep, why pay for a view. From our bay window, we looked right out at the Market sign, but all is quiet once it closes. One night after dinner elsewhere, we just wanted a dessert wine with the chocolates we had bought to eat on the deck. The bartender at the hotel restaurant, Campagne, walked us across the courtyard, then handed us the drinks (in compliance with liquor laws) so we could take them to the deck upstairs. I wish we could have tried both hotel restaurants but we were there only for seafood and they are French. Just a great and convenient place to stay in Seattle - go to the market before the crowds and have a waterfront deck for lounging.

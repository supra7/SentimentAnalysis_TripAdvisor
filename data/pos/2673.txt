This hotel is amazing for many reasons!!! location location location ...it is walking distance to most of the attractions like , Pikes Market, Worldclass shopping, a brisk walk to the Space Needle, Pioneer Square...the Light Rail is a block over, though not the quickest way to travel it will eventually get you to your destination. Took it from the airport to downtown and back and for a mere $4.75. The hotel is beautiful and upscale. The rooms clean and large and with amazing views. The people are very friendly and very professional. Incredible customer service. Would stay there again

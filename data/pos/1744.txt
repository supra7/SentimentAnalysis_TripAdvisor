Wonderful hotel. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Rooms are very nice and beds have high quality linens. They have no problems with you leaving your car parked in the garage until 5 pm on the day of check out if you are wanting to explore downtown Seattle. Great location! Right next to Westlake Center and a block or two away from Pacific Place shopping center. It is also within walking distance of the Pikes Place Market. Make sure you check out thier special promotions, as there are often good deals. I got a package which included parking and two passes to the Pacific Science Center with entry into the special exhibit at the time (which was a Star Wars exhibit) at a very good price. I would definitely recommed this hotel. It is not the cheapest, but is very high quality, so you get what you pay for.

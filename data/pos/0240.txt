When I travel I enjoy staying at the Kimpton properties. I prefer the boutique style properties as opposed to the standard cutout business variety. My first stay at the Monaco in Seattle and I was not disappointed. Good location for me, great room, shower, flat screen and room service. The attached Sazerac bar and restaurant is a nice place to relax, especially during happy hour. Good appetizers and great wood fired pizzas.

I booked this hotel from reviews previously read on TripAdvisor. I was thoroughly impressed with the standard of room which was assigned to me. I had a room on the second floor and was very elegant and stylish. Even though the room faced Olive Street, and i thought it would be noisy, as soon as i closed the curtains the sound cut down 90% and after sunset there was hardly any traffic. The bed was lovely and had ample blankets and pillows. Came with a little bar fridge for cold drinks. The ensuite bathroom was a good size and ample room for movement. The room safe was also a nice feature and gave me peace of mind. The staff were very very courteous and lovely, and one of the attendants out from was particularly friendly and gave me lots of good tips about the city and places to run, and also had a few laughs. Fantastic also that it was so close to the main shopping hub! 1 street away and could also get to one of the malls (with some shopping and food) through an access corridor. All in all, i feel that it was very good value for the price i paid and would recommend The Mayflower to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle and be close to the shopping district, and also the bay, without having to pay for the exorbitant prices that some other places were charging. The Mayflower has it all. Will be back there in the future for sure! Thanks again for a lovely stay in Seattle.

Seattle is an amazing city and the Mayflower Park was perfect for exploring the city. The location is great and close to Pike Market. All the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly. The hotel is not the trendiest or modern but was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was great as were the bloody marys!

My husband and I stayed here over the Canadian long weekend in August with two other couples. We got a discounted rate online and found the hotel to be good value for what we paid. The location is fantastic, at the corner of 6th and Pike. So, you just need to walk 6 blocks down and you're at Pike Place Market. Also, the hotel is next to the convention centre, which we did not use, but I imagine would be very handy for business travel. Also, there is lot of great shopping very close by. The Cheesecake Factory is across the street - a definite must if you like cheesecake at all! We also ate at the Pink Door and the Crab Pot, and would definitely recommend both.

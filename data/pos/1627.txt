My husband and I live 65 miles from Seattle, so when we have an appointment there, we always spend a couple of nights or so, and make it a little vacation. We tried out several hotels and the Mayflower Park is by far our favorite. The staff is very courteous, friendly and go out of their way to be of service. Love the valet parking and the Andaluca Restaurant downstairs, where the food is absolutely delicious. The rooms at the Mayflower are spacious, clean and quiet. One huge bonus is the location. Very close walking distance to Pike Place Market, Nordstrom, Macy's, Barnes & Noble and a wealth of other shops, banks.and restaurants. Oliver's Lounge is right downstairs in the hotel as well, and you can read the great reviews for it on this site.

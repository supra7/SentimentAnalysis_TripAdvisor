Although I work in Seattle and rarely spend money there, I really enjoyed our stay at Monaco Seattle. It all started with knowing our Kimpton rewards gave us a voucher for the in-room mini-bar. Once at the room we were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful fragrance and the fantastic decor. The room (solo King bed) was well laid out and kept very clean. I would, and have, recommended this hotel to many people already and look forward to the next time I spend a night in Seattle. The location was great and I was able to find a better alternative (cost-wise) to the valet parking provided by Monaco.

The rooms are clean, the location is perfect (close to pike place and shops, but still easy to drive to Alki Beach, etc), and the service was impeccable. A really nice value added option was the 50 cents for either drinks or breakfast (we picked breakfast) that you can opt into at check in. They served us hot croissants, juices, teas, fresh fruit, etc. Also, we traveled with our little dog and they were so nice - they left her dog treats and a water bowl in the room and offered to doggy-sit her (first hour free, nominal fee thereafter). I would go back in a heartbeat!!!!

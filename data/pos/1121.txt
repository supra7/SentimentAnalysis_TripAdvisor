Loved this place. Nothing I didn't need, but everything I did. Everything is spotlessly clean and comfortable; the folks at the front desk are young and very helpful; the included breakfast was delicious (granola, yogurt, hard-core coffee, etc). Only downside is that the area (1st and Wall) can be a little sketchy late at night; during the day and evening, it's fine. If you're looking for a cushy place with a lounge and and bar, this isn't it. Additional note - it's on a main bus line, taxis run by frequently, and it's walking distance to Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.

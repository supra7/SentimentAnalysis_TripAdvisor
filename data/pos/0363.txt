A quality hotel chocked full of staff that make you feel at home. We experienced exceptional service from the front desk staff, the concierge and the door men, however the maid service needs some work. We found that our maid failed to tuck in our sheets at the foot of the bed and on one instance soiled sheets were used. The staff quickley resolved the soiled sheets issue. My guess this relates to one employee and is not a reflection on the rest of the staff. We received excellent advice from the concierge regarding resturants in the area, the happy hour wine tasting was a nice touch and the staff went out of their way to make you feel at home. Great location if you like to be close to good food and shopping, we took in a play at the 5th street theather as well. Pikes Market, Pioneer Square and access to the mono rail is within short walking distance.

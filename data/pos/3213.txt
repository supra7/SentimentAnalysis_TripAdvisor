Booked this hotel quite last minute under AAE Hostels so took me a little while to figure that they were one and the same thing. Staff very friendly. Rooms very spacious and tidy. Excellent free facilites that many other hotels in this price bracket (certainly in Europe) may charge for/ need to request specifically e.g. Free WiFi, printing, iron/board in room, filter coffe, 2 PCs for use in reception - were the ones I used. Bar/ Restaurant seemed ok, only stopped ther for a beer and watch a bit of sport one time, but seemed nice enough. Good location, short walk to Westlake Station ($2.75 to airport), downtown, Space needle, Capitol Hill all within 20mins. Very good, would stay again

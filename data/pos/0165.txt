My family stayed here mid-June. I cannot think of a better place to stay- location is ideal. Several blocks to the waterfront, several blocks to the monorail, Pikes, shopping. A short cab to Safeco. Very attentive to my entire family. Also looked like a good place to stay for the business traveler too.

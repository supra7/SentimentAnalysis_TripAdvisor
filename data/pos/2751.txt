The Sheraton has a good location in downtown in Seattle and is a beautiful hotel. We stayed using Priceline and got a great price - I don't know if I'd pay full price. It was clean and comfortable and staff were great. Parking is expensive but aren't all downtown Seattle hotels? The valet took a while at times but we found that if you called from your room before you left the timing was perfect. If you are looking for somewhere that is close to shopping and restaurants I recommend it but try to get a deal!

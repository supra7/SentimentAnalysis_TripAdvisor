This one was a strange one for me, as I lived in Seattle and was returning on business for the first time after moving away 3 months earlier. I had heard people mention the hotel several times and have been to Tulio, the restaurant attached, but never stayed. The front desk was friendly, and efficient. Since I am a Kimpton rewards member, my WiFi access was complementary and they gave me a $10 mini bar credit. Perfect for that snack and bottle of water after arriving. Although I didn't get a chance to take advantage, they have a wine social hour each night and coffee in the mornings. I did have breakfast at Tulio. Breakfast was fast and much better than the average hotel breakfast. All in all, I had a nice stay, the staff was great and would stay again. My only nit is that it is $34 a night to park at the hotel. Be forewarned.

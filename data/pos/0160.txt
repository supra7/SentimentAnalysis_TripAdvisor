This hotel was immaculate and the service from the front desk was superior. Every single question was answered with patience, courtesy and enthusiasm. The room was beautiful, the bed the most comfortable hotel bed we've ever slept in, the water pressure excellent and there was plenty of surface area in the bathroom to hold our travel supplies for the week. The best part was the location of the hotel: we could walk or take the bus to any place in town easily and conveniently. We will stay there the next time we're in Seattle.

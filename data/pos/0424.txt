Stayed with my family the weekend of March 1-4 while I attended a trade show. I was suprised to find that the microwave I had requested was already in the room when we arrived. The bellman was quick to offer a hand with our luggage. The valet's were always on standby when needed to have your car brought up. We were in a newly renovated room with a view of the Space Needle. It is located on 4th ave which made it very easy to go back from Century Link and Safeco as it is on the same street as the exit from the two stadiums.. Macy's and a gourmet grocery store is nearby. Room service was delivered within 15 minutes in the morning, and within 20 minutes in the evening The beds were comfortable. The pool was out of order when we stayed, but the we were told that we can use one of the nearby hotel's pools by showing our room key. Will definelty consider the Warwick if returning to Seattle for business or for a sporting event at Safeco or Century Link

We stayed at the CP two days prior to our Alaskan cruise and really enjoyed our stay. We had a two room suite (LR/Bedroom) and both rooms had wonderful views of the Space Needle and the downtown area. There was a continental breakfast on one of the top floors for Priority Club members and we were very pleased with the selection. Again, we had a beautiful city and mountain view - it was the perfect place to sit back drink your coffee and enjoy the snow covered mountains. After our cruise, our flight wasn't until 10:30 p.m. that night so we asked the CP folks if we could run our luggage back to the hotel for the day so we could roam around the city until time to head to the airport. NO PROBLEM! They were very accomodating. We loved Seattle and will be booking another stay at the Crowne Plaza in the near future.

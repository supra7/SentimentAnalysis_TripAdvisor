Excellent location for my daughter, her friend, and me. The two (16 and 17) were able to walk to Pike's, the Aquarium, SAM, etc., with no worry for safety. I appreciated the free round-trip shuttle to downtown. Hotel staff were really helpful with maps of area and area dining, directions, and advice. They let me know before I arrived that on-street parking is free from Saturday night at 6:00 until Monday at 8:00, which saved us the parking garage fee. A comfortable and convenient budget choice.

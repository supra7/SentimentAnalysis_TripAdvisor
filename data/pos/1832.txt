We stayed for two nights in August while enroute to a family reunion. This is our 3rd or 4th stay at the Mayflower, and it is a splurge we always enjoy. We buy the valet parking package, as we don't use our car while there and need to park for a couple of days. The hotel has an inviting and pretty lobby, and the staff are consistently helpful and friendly. The rooms are small -- hey, it's an old hotel! -- but they are well appointed and very clean. We requested a move due to street noise and were immediately accomodated. We usually don't eat here as there are more interesting places nearby. But this is a great place to relax and sleep, and sometimes the packages are good deals. The location is very good as well, close to the museums and waterfront. This is our chosen place in Seattle.

Very nice hotel, we had booked a double double Queen room and to our surprise we also had 2 bathrooms. we were on the 12th floor so had views of space needle . the hotel is only a 5-10 min walk to the markets. you are also able to walk to the shopping centre next door via an inside walkway . There is also the monorail station to the space needle and the underground transit stop in the shopping complex so getting around is no problem. The Martini bar was very nice and and relaxing and the staff were very knowlegable on the martini menu. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast but is was very nice and i thought the prices were reasonable. There are 2 computers next to the Check in desk that you can use and also print from (free of charge). all the staff were friendly and helpful.

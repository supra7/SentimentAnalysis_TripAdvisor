My stay at the Sheraton Seattle couldn't have been better. I stayed on the 27th floor of the "old" tower. I was tempted at check-in to ask for the "new" tower as TripAdvisor posts recommended. At the last moment though, I thought I would rough it. Truth be told - the "old" - I hate that descriptive - the "classic" tower was very nice. I got a great view of downtown in a room that was very comfortable and quiet. I liked how large the space was. Big bathroom, big bedroom, big dresser, ample closet space, etc. The room temperature stayed nice and I never touched the thermostat. The staff at the Sheraton were great too. At check-in, a tall, beautiful woman, zoomed me through the process - did not change her high level of service when she realized I was a hotwire customer and offered me upgrades without prompting. I was in the door of the hotel and into my room in 5-7 minutes. On my last day at the hotel - I hit the restaurant for a breakfast buffet. The sausage and potatoes with eggs were fantastic. They had an ample supply of fresh fruit and healthy alternatives - that I appreciated but avoided. I was overly hungry from eating sushi the night before - and feeling less than full. I highly recommend the Sheraton Seattle. What a great visit. When and if I go back - it'll be the Sheraton for sure. Other cool thing - the Grayline Boeing tour loads at none other than the Sheraton. Very Convenient.

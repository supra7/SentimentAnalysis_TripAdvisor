Got a great deal on Priceline and was not too sure what to expect after a few poor reviews on here...gee those people must have been picky, as the place is hard to fault. The rooms are all large with great heavenly beds...our view at night was of the Space Needle in it's full glory. Checkin and checkout could not have been smoother, orr quicker and all done with a friendly smile. The valey parking is expensive, but we knew that before we arrived and who can be bothered looking around for alternatives, when you can just hand your keys over at the front door...the valet was also very quick. Having read a previous review about the long wait for lifts, we had to laugh as no lift wait ever exceded 30 seconds, and we timed every one of them! The location is great, although if you haven't been to Seattle before yo umay be a little disappointed, as it is quite a drab city. Just near to the Westin is a great restaurant called Farestart, which provides 16 week training courses to the homeless and unemployed. On Thursday nights they have a different expert chef from the one of the top restaurants in Seattle come and plan out the menu...it was a great meal and a fantastic night...highly recommend it if you are communitty minded and love good foor...3 courses for only $25.

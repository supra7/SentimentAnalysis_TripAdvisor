I've stayed at the Renaissance for business at least thirty times over the past two years and have had overwhelmingly good experiences. The location is within easy walking distance of downtown Seattle, including Pike's Place Market, the shopping district around Nordstrom's and tons of restaurants. The staff members are friendly and begin to recognize me quickly. The rooms are clean and the beds are really comfortable. The hotel is generally pretty quiet but I recommend asking for a room facing away from the highway because it can be a bit noisy on the lower levels. My only complaint is around parking. The streets around the hotel are all one way and the hotel parking garage is underground with a really narrow winding drive where you drive in the left hand lane. It can be a bit frustrating to get to the parking ramp and then a little harrowing driving up or down it as drivers from the opposite direction tend to drift into your lane while turning corners.

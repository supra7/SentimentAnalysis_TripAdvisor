My husband and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at the Edgewater. Everything was perfect, we stayed at the Edgewater 40 years ago! The Edgewater offers a great restaurant as well as conveniently located near many other restaurants, Pike Place Market, and the waterfront for entertainment and long walks! We would definately stay again!

Had a great couple of days in Seattle. Was a break from the work week. Caught the train down from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, Washington. What a great way to relax and enjoy the trip. Fantastic views and easy travel. Arrived in Seattle, and after a minimal taxi fare to our hotel started the trip. As we arrived and everyday after, the staff at this hotel were exceptional. Any questions we had about Seattle and the surrounding area were easily answered. The staff was very friendly , courteous and went out of their way to make sure our stay there was enjoyed. Accomodations were also tops. The restaurant / Bar made dinner and a cocktail and experience as you viewed from the 28th floor a gorgeous city. Can't wait to make a weekend Seahawks/Mariners game now. Pike place was a 15-20 minute walk down the hill and not at all difficult. In fact we walked everywhere and had little or no difficulty with anything. If you get tired the cab fare up to the hotel from the market was again, minor.The walk up the hill could be a bit difficult for elderly patrons, but we learned after the first day to weave up the hill. This introduced us to even more shops and stores and we became more aware of the area. All in all a great trip and a great hotel.

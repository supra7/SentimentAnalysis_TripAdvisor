My friends and I just returned from a trip to Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel and it was the most pleasant place I have ever stayed. We arrived and were upgraded to a double queen suites. That was wonderful because they had two baths in each suite. Our suites were very cozy and comfortable and clean . The hotel was all very beautiful and warm. We used the concierge, ate breakfast in the restaurant every morning and had drinks and some food in the lounge in the evening. Everyone there was so friendly and helpful in every way. The location is excellent for going to the waterfront, Pike's Market or going shopping. The tours we took picked us up at the hotel and brought us back there. If I ever return to Seattle I would definitely go back to the Mayflower Park Hotel.

Of all the hotels i stay in, in the USA this is one of the best!!!! The rooms have been refurbished and are lovly. Welcoming shades of yellow. Huge big beds with lots of pillows and a sumptious duvet. Dispite it's size the staff are welcoming,charming and very poite. The lobby busy but a good space to see friends or drink coffee and people watch.

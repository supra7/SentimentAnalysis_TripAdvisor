We have stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Salt Lake City a couple times. So when I found out we had to get a hotel in Seattle for a night I was pleased to see there was a Hotel Monaco downtown. We were not disappointed. We were greeted by friendly staff and the room was clean and spacious. The hotel is located within walking distance of many downtown Seattle sights. We are looking forward to trying out Kimpton properties in other cities.

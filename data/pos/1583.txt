This was our first time at the Mayflower and we will be making it a midwinter break tradition from now on. From the $5.00 parking special, to the 5% rate special, and a new guest, room upgrade, it just kept getting better. The location is terrific for sightseeing and shopping. We didn't need a car in spite of the rainy weather. The front desk accommodated us for both early check in and late check out. Our room service was good and very prompt. Overall the service was excellent. This small quiet gem is not to be missed.

I visited this hotel as part of a mini tour of the upper Pacific Northwest and found it very centrally located. It is near a lot of bars, restaurants, and within walking distance of Pike Place Market. It is clean and in a safe area of downtown. Thy gym and pool are also first rate, but got crowded in the early morning. My only complaint was they lost my donkey thong when I sent it down to have dry cleaned :(

If you're looking for a five star, luxury hotel, this is not the place to go. This is a heritage building and as such, is going to have its quirks. However, we knew exactly what the hotel was like... it was our second time staying. Yes, it's rustic and quaint. The water pipes can creak a little, the style is quite old (remember: heritage building). The tv isn't a flat screen lcd type. None of this really mattered to us. We stayed because the last time we'd been there, the staff was helpful and friendly, we were able to cook our own meals, and it was central to the places we wanted to go. It was the same this time, but the staff were actually extra helpful when a booking error (from a hotel booking website) had come up. They solved the problem and made sure we got the type of room we wanted. They were very friendly, personable and were able to answer any questions we had. I've seen some negative reviews on this site and I have to say this: if you're looking for an ultra modern hotel, maybe a four or five star, don't come to the inn and then complain because it didn't meet your expectation. If you're looking for a nice, simple place that's near a lot of popular locations, want to deal with friendly, helpful staff members, and want to travel on a budget, I can't think of anyplace in the area that's better suited to your needs.

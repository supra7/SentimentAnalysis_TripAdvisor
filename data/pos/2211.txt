I spent two nights at the Executive Pacific in July . The staff was friendly and helpful, the room clean and perfectly comfortable -- not large (particularly the bathroom sink), but adequate for myself and a friend who didn't spend a lot of time there anyway. The location was great -- right across from the library and close to everything we wanted to see -- Pike Place, Pioneer Square, Elliott Bay, the Sculpture Garden, etc. I highly recommend it for anyone who isn't looking for high end luxury -- just a well-located, comfortable, inexpensive place (with a tad of European charm) to stay in Seattle.

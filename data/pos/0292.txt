The lobby is absolutely beautiful. Room was great and military rate is a huge bonus. Construction on the street was loud and obnoxious, complained but there weren't any rooms to move to. Staff was sympathetic but it really was out of their control. We complained a second time and they upgraded us to the Mediterranean Suite, the nicest in the house. The room had a huge jacuzzi bath that we really enjoyed. The beds were comfortable and there really wasn't anything to complain about with either room.

We stayed Memorial Weekend, so it was very busy. We had great service from the moment we arrived. Valet parking, yes it expensive, but you are staying at a 4 star downtown. All staff were very polite and helpful. We had room service twice, very fast. Breakfast was very good, late night ok. We had drinks & food at Coldwater Bar, nice. Lobby bar is great. The room seemed to have been updated in the last couple of years since we were last there. No complaints. Great bed. It is nice to have a pool, since there is only 2-3 downtown. Great location, close to Market, shopping, restaurants. You must go to Assaggio for dinner, awesome! Overall we had a great time. Especially since we got the room bidding O/L for $121.00 per night.

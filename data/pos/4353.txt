The hotel is in a good downtown location, a few blocks from upscale shopping opportunities and a few blocks from the waterfront shops and restaurants. Property is due for a facelift, my guess is that the last one was ten years ago or so. Hotel is quiet on the room floors but the door latches are loud. It is almost impossible to open and close the doors quietly. You may wait for one of the four elevators as there are 40 floors to cover. Fitness room was crowded and a little too small for this size property. Large meeting room chairs were the typical stackable type, not very comfortable. Staff was pleasant, helpful and efficient.

I got the Hotwire rate and despite emailing reservations (always worth a shot0 could not score a waterfront room, but still had a decent view. Better than I expected for about 100 CDN, really cool and unique lobby, good rooms, convenient free shuttle that will take you anywhere for free (anywhere DT). The BEATLES stayed here in the late 60's and fished from the hotel windows, it's REALLY on the WATERS EDGE!

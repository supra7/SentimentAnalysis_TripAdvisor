Domus Ester is a small hotel in the center of Old Rome. We paid 60EUR a night for a double ensuite. The staff, especially Monica and Fakir were very helpful. If you call ask if the larger rooms are available. The rate included an typical Italian breakfast delivered to your room at your designated time. We would definitely stay there again.

We ended up being in Seattle at the last minute and The Vintage Park was available. I have stayed at other Kimpton hotels in the past and this was no exception. Great staff, clean comfortable rooms in a very good location in downtown. The room we had was small but we didn't spend much time here anyway. I like the fact that they are pet friendly and that there are benefits by being a member of their loyalty program which provides free items and services that would normally be expensive at other hotels in the same price range.

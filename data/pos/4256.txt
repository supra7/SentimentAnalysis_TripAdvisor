Popped down to Seattle for a quick shopping excursion. First off...the location is a good one for visiting downtown Seattle. There was quick access to the sights and shopping. The room was clean, comfortable, and well laid out. The beds are very comfortable and the view lovely. There were only a couple of minor problems, but nothing major. Firstly....we had two rooms and neither had any information about the pool and exercise room. There was general information about these services for the Westin chain, but nothing specific to this hotel. Also, the room did not come with either a cork screw or wine glasses. it took two phone calls to get these brought to the room...once they got there, they were obviously dirty-- big lipstick marks. We decided to just use the water glasses instead of making a third call. Lastly, it was $43 to valet park the car overnight ($41 to self park). When we headed for check out we phoned for the car to be ready...it took awhile to check out as there were only a couple of staff at the desk and when we got to the car entrance our car wasn't there -- the valet had never received the message that the car was required and we had to wait even longer to go.

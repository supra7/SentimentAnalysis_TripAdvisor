I love kimpton hotels! I will stay in them every chance I get because they are dog friendly! That being said, I booked this property and expected to have a very similar experience to the other Kimpton hotels I've stayed at. I did for the most part. The staff was wonderful the property very clean and centrally located (six blocks from the market). It was easy to get to. The rooms were spacious (double queen) and clean. My only complaint is there was no coffee in the room. Not even a little four cup coffee maker.. I mean this is Seattle, home to Starbucks and other coffee brands? Coffee goes hand and hand with a stay in a hotel. In Seattle I would expect the micro brews of coffees to be sampled in the room, like Portland does with beer. Of course I didn't look until 0'dark thirty.. Other than that it was a great stay and a great property. Me and my dogs just relocated to the Pacific Northwest and it was nice to have a place to stay and be treated like family!

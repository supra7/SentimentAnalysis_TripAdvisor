The Sorrento served as our Seattle home base for the weekend. We were within walking distance to downtown, given some wonderful restaurant suggestions from the concierge, and enjoyed live music each night in the hotel's lounge. They offer a car service to anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel, so they picked us up from dinner one night too. The beds were comfortable, rooms spacious, and bathrobes soft. Can't say enough about how accommodating the staff was, and how personalized our experience was; we were greeted by name when we returned to the hotel throughout the weekend, and it was very welcoming. Also, the lemon drops were a perfect refresher and sweet treat at the reception desk! We will definitely return to the Sorrento when we're in Seattle again.

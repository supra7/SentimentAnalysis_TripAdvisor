The price was fair based on the central location; walking distance from Pike's Market Place and the water, and practically everything else. : ) The room was quite small for the price, however, and it had a musty smell. The service was outstanding, however. After I'd been in my room for about 30 minutes, the front desk called to ask if the room was satisfactory; there are always doormen waiting to get the door for you, and everyone is very friendly. I would stay here again. While the rooms could use a little updating, they are clean and everything I needed was at my fingertips.

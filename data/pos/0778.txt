We live here about an hour outside Seattle. We occasionally stay downtown for an evening event instead of driving home late. We were in town to go to the symphony and the next morning my husband had a meeting. We were first in need of assistance when my husband needed a seam in his suit pants mended. I stopped by the front desk on our way out asking for a needle and thread. They sent up the most little amazing sewing kit to the room. The next morning my husband got up and at 7 am there was NO hot water for a shower. I called down to the front desk and they said they were just aware of the problem and were working on it. He didn't have time to wait, so had to take a very cool quick shower. He mentioned it to the front desk on his way out and they said they would adjust the bill but not any more. When I checked out ( after getting a hot shower at 9) they had taken our room charge from $255 down to $99. I was surprised and delighted and appologized again for the inconvenience. They couldn't solve the problem in time for his shower, but they made up for it the way a first rate hotel should. We will definitely be coming back.

If you ever plan on using the Westin as your base for New Year's, listen up. We went to "New Years at the Needle" in 2006. Tickets to the observation deck, for the New years bash(don't go), and stayed at the Westin. First off, don't plan on getting any service whatsoever, as the staff is just completly overwhelmed on new years eve. The rooms are great,don't get me wrong,nice mini-bar, beds, view, everything 4 star, but on this evening plan on 15 minute elevator waits, no service at the bar, wait, wait,wait. Wait to check in, wait for valet, wait for everything. Cabs were quick and easy to get. Just a head's up if you plan on this Hotel for a New Year's base of operations. Also,take a couple or two with you, as you are going to need conversation while you wait. Great Hotel otherwise, I want to go there on an average night.

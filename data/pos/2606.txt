Nothing fancy, and you may have to ask for a bigger room (they have adequate to "nicer" rooms) but for the location and great breakfast this was a great deal. We never had trouble getting a place to park, the room was always clean, coffee was always available in the lobby, and the breakfast was great. We ran the A/C to drown the traffic noise but even that was alright cause I liked the "white noise". The staff was always very nice and friendly. I had read a few poor reviews but took the chance anyway. I'm glad there is moderately priced, clean, adequate places like this to stay at, in a great central location when you want to vacation but are on a tight budget. This hotel completely met and exceeded our expectations. Keep going on the updating though!!!

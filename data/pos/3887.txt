We stayed here the night before our cruise to Alaska. The location could not have been better, right next door to the pier where our ship docked, and easy walking distance to Pike Place market, Space Needle and Sculpture Park. The room was fine, comfortable and clean. The service was generally as you would expect in a five star hotel - the check in clerk took perkiness to a whole new level, it was like a piece of performance art. We were amazed. Breakfast was great, the American breakfast option at $9 very good value. If I was in Seattle other than for a cruise I might look at other options, but for this particular occasion the Edgewater was terrific.

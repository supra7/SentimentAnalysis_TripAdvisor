My wife and I planned to spend four nights at Hotel Andra, but on the fourth day I ended up spending the night at Harborview Medical Center. The staff at Hotel Andra went out of their way to extend our stay in the same room which had been previously booked. Hotel Andra is very well run with a very friendly and efficient staff. We will definitively return. Lola Restaurant in the Hotel is also superb. The restaurant served my wife late at night when she returned from Harborview.

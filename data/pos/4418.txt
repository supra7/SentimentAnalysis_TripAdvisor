We stayed at the Westin Seattle and were able to get a great price ($95) through Priceline. The location was ideal - walking distance to Pike Place Parket and literally across the street from the train that takes you to the train station. The rooms were spacious and clean. Their lobby is huge and they offer free wi-fi in the lobby spaces, which was convenient. My only complaint was the high rate for parking (about $40 a night), however there is a parking lot literally right across the hotel for much cheaper rates. I would definitely stay here again!

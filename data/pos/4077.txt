Pros: everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, from the valet to the concierge. The rooms were clean, bed was very comfortable with wonderful, soft sheets. Nice toiletries. The lounge downstairs is beautiful, with a fireplace and comfy chairs. Breakfast was delicious (especially the smoked salmon eggs benedict). The hotel provides a car service, which is really nice, and the concierge booked us dinner reservations when we asked for a recommendation-it turned out to be exactly what we wanted. Cons: the hotel is a bit of a walk from downtown, 15 minutes downhill, 30 uphill, but if you're relatively in shape it's not a problem!

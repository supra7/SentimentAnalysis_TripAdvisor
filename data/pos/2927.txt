We stayed at the Sheraton after our Alaska cruise. We arrived around 8:30 am expecting to store our luggage until rooms were ready but they were able to check us right in! We stayed in the newly renovated tower and the rooms were beautiful, clean and very spacious. The location is convenient to everything - we walked to Pikes Market and to the monorail for a ride out the Space Needle. I loved everything about this hotel! The help was very friendly and courteous. When my teenagers didn't answer their wake up call security arrived at their room to make sure they were OK. I was glad we stayed here and I will definately stay here again. I almost forgot the best part - the beds were heavenly! After being in a cramped cruise cabin for a week, this hotel was just what we needed to enjoy our extra day in Seattle

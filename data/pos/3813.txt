Went for a long weekend getaway and always enjoy Seattle. When we arrived we found out that we only had a kingsize bed, so asked for 2 beds as requested on reservations, and one was found. We were on the cityview side which was nice, had a view of the space needle outside our window. The only problem for me as I am a light sleeper was the train, it was pretty quiet considering it's close proximity to the hotel, however it felt stuffy in the room so opened up window a bit and then you could hear it...2-3 times at night. May have done better at sleep if the bed was just a wee bit softer... friend said it was just right for her... the restaurant food was excellent and the view from there was fantastic. Most definitely would go again.. just with the water view!! Service was great!

We loved the hotel. It is so different - really cool. Right from the beginning the reception desk was very good and gave us a lot of information, the rest of the staff was also superb. The interior is amazing. We requested a cute gold fish to our room. We did not have to feed it or anything but it is really cool. The complimentary wine in the evening was also very good. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to really enjoy all the amenities of this cool, extraordinary hotel.

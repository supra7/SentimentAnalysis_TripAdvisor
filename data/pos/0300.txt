Love the Monaco Hotel, a Kempton property, in downtown Seattle. The staff is very attentive, especially the front desk and valet. They really treat guests well. The rooms are spacious, the beds incredibly comfortable, easy walking distance to tons of shopping, fabulous restaurants, museum, library and Pike's Market. The restaurant in the hotel, Zazeracs is very good - room service comes from there too. The concierge are very helpful as is the valet staff - any request is quickly accommodated. Won the Monaco on Priceline - but would pay standard rate, it's that good.

This hotel is literally steps from Pike Street Market. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. A nice touch was offering a place, and supplies, to gift wrap presents you may have bought. A very nice rooftop deck offers beautiful waterfront views. A bit chilly, since we were there in December; would like to check it out again in the summer.

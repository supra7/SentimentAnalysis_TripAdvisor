We loved the location of the Andra-it was central to everything in Seattle and in what appeared to be the safest part of town. The rooms were well appointed with a modern but homey dcor, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Our room had a beautiful view of Space Needle. In spite of the fact that I loved returning to the soothing atmosphere of the lobby and room every day, Im not sure if I would spend the money to stay there again. There were too many down sides for us. The A/C was VERY loud, waking me up with almost every click on/off. The room was TINY- maybe 9x9, and full of furniture (a bar, a desk and two end tables), with no place to unpack clothes other than a closet. It was tough to negotiate having two suitcases in such a small space. The BIG turn off came when I attempted to arrange a taxi to take me to airport. I was told (by two different front desk workers, at two different times) that they could arrange a Town Car for me for only $40. I refused explaining that a taxi is cheaper and they actually disagreed, although the $32 fare is clearly visible on all taxi doors. I have the money to spend but dont appreciate being ripped off. Since it was our first trip to Seattle, I am happy we stayed there but now that we know the lay of the land, we will probably stay elsewhere when we return.

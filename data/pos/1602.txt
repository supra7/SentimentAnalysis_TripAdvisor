My girlfriend and I are from the area, but we wanted to do something special for NYE, and after a little searching around, I came across the Mayflower Park's New Year's special. It was a good deal for a one night stay, and late check out on New Years Day was WONDERFUL. The room was definitely on the small side, if we had been staying more than one night it might've been a problem, but for one night it was fine. The valet staff were super friendly. The only real complaint I had was the price of the room service. I've stayed in PLENTY of hotels with pricey room service, but $5 for one glass of orange juice at breakfast? Seriously? I love Andaluca's food, but that's just absurd. I didn't want to spoil a romantic breakfast in bed starting off the new year, so I paid it anyway, but come on. I was also a little disheartened to learn that although the website advertises views of the space needle, a condo building has gone up in recent years that blocks the view from all but two rooms, which put a dent in some of our romantic weekend plans - we wanted to watch the fireworks from seattle center at midnight! I specifically requested a room with a view when I made our reservation but didn't learn about this until check-in.

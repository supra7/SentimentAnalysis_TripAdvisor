My partner and I spent 4 nights here at the start of a 3 week road trip. We booked through Expedia and got a fairly good rate, although the room was small compared to the other rooms. The hotel is very central, right next to the public library and a few blocks from the shopping district. The beds were very comfy and the blackout curtains were excellent. The bathroom was small but the shower was excellent and the towels nice and soft. The staff were very friendly and there are complimentary hot drinks in the morning/wine in the afternoon.

We came up to Seattle for a show at The Funhouse, and this hotel was perfect. It is two blocks away from the venue (and the space needle) and by far the cheapest hotel in the area. There's plenty of free parking, cable, a pool, free wifi (though a little spotty) and all the employees were helpful. The rooms are on the smaller side, but not too crowded for four people. It was clean, and we all felt safe. I would definitly stay here again.

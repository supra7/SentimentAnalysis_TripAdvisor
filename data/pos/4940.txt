We had a room at the back of the hotel, very quiet. Well appointed older boutique hotel. Each night they have a different Vineyard present their wine samples at no cost. Nice way to spend an hour meeting other couples from all over..Overall I enjoyed my first time at this hotel. Make sure you try the in-house restaurant if you like Italian food. Parking is a concern being downtown. Cost to park is $34.00 per day. A few blocks down hill to Pikes Market and shopping.

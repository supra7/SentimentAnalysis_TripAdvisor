Colleagues arranged a stay for us at this pleasant hotel, close to the University of Washington. The room was large and comfortable. We had a number of contacts with hotel staff; each one was courteous and efficient. The continental breakfast was better than most, actually having protein (hard boiled eggs and yogurt) as well as coffee, tea, cereal, bagels, pastries and juice. There were only two negatives: (1) The hotel has no restaurant. HOWEVER, 100 feet down the block is the Portage bay Cafe, one of the great Seattle restaurants for breakfast and lunch. We found dinner options in the neighborhood. (2) The decor could use some spiffing up.

Like others we stayed at the Edgewater Hotel in June 2011. Our first room smelt really badly of cigarette smoke .... we were moved very quickly when we pointed this out. The rooms are lovely though a little tired and the hotel a bit dark.... huge space occupying TVs etc. The bathroom was fab but for someone who would have loved to soaked tired feet after a days sightseeing ... missing a bath ! the first morning the handle came off our room door ... we brought it down to reception and got sorted immediately !! Very noisy A/C unit Very good bar .... and a great friendly shuttle downtown... reasonably central location .... noone told us about the hills !! All in all a friendly hotel

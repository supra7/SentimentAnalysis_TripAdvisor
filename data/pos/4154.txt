I travel frequently between Portland and Seattle and regularly spend the night in Seattle. I used to book the best hotel I could find on hotwire or priceline by playing "hotel roulette".Seattle is blessed with a bountiful supply of top flight hotels and I have stayed at some of it's best ie.W,Alexis,Four Seasons. However,my favorite Seattle hotel to date is the Sorrento. I'm not sure if it is the classic design of yesteryear or the subperb hospitality but I find myself directly inquiring their availability prior to participating in "hotel roulette". I even stayed the weekend during a college football game and was provided a complimentary limo ride to and from QWEST field. The driver even took us from bar to bar after the game! In anyevent I highly reccomend the Sorrento Hotel in Seattle.

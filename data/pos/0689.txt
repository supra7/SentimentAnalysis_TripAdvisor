We stayed at the IATM twice on our recent holiday to the USA, on arrival & on our last night. We arrived at the hotel much earlier than check in time but this wasn't an issue, although our room wasn't quite ready, the receptionist took our mobile number & promised to call us as soon as the room became available, the concierge took care of our luggage and that left us free to stretch our legs, explore and grab a coffee after enduring a 10 hour flight to Seattle. We were in our city view room within the hour & were not disappointed, clean, bright, spacious & wonderful comfy king size bed. After a couple of hours rest, we popped out & bought a bottle of wine and sat enjoying the uninterrupted views of Elliott Bay from the terrace (this is such a bonus). At the end of the evening we returned to our room and housekeeping had replaced the towels, turned down our bed and left us a couple of chocolates, this was a lovely gesture. When we returned to the hotel for our last night we had chosen a room with water view, given that the terrace is available to enjoy the water view, we felt this was an over indulgence, as the room itself (apart from the view) offered nothing more than the city view room, just we payed an extra $76 dollars for the priviledge. All the staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them, if we returned to Seattle we'd certainly consider staying here again.

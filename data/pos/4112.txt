The experience my husband and I had was FABULOUS from the time we pulled up at Valet to the Time we checked out. The Sorrento has theBEST Staff ,The Hunt Club Restaurant had Five Star Food and Service, The Suite was Exquisite, we stayed in the Music room, Great dcor ,AND the Most Comfortable Mattress. The only thing we did not have in the bedroom was a flat screen TV and believe me we did not miss it

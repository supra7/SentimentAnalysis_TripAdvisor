My partner and I stayed from December 31st until January 2nd. Best downtown Seattle hotel ever! the staff were consistently and genuinely friendly, the room was lovely. Room service was prompt and efficient, and the restaurant! Tulio had a fabulous menu as well as great food. I would go back in a heartbeat! Although the bed was comfortable, it was noisy and squeaky for two, and we needed an extra blanket. Otherwise a perfect stay!

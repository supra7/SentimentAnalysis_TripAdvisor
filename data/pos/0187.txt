I try many different hotels wherever I travel but I do often return to ones that I really like. The Hotel Monaco, Seattle is one I return to. It has an eccelctic flavour with layers of pattern and colour often not seen in hotels who are always trying to appeal to everyone. The service is always excellent and the lobby is set up so that there are many intimate, people-watching spots to sit.

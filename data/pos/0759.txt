We just wrapped up a 14 day vacation along the West Coast. We stayed in a number of hotels - among them even a Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, CA. However, the Inn at the Market exceeded our expectations and the service we received will have me talking for a long time to come. A few weeks prior to our trip, I contacted the manager at the hotel to learn more about the hotel, rates, amenities and its location. I was provided with all the information requested and offered a nice room at a fair rate and was told that I wont be disappointed. This turned out to be sooo true! When we arrived, the bellman took our bags and suitcases and told us "not to worry",..all bags would be wisked to our room . We checked in and were given a map of Seattle, our room keys by the friendly reception staff. This felt so right! Our room was awesome. It was on the 5th floor ..same level at the our door roof patio with the most fabulous view of Elliott Bay. Our beds were terrific, the bathroom huge and decorating a table by the window was a plate of mini cupcakes which welcomed us and made us feel at home. The hotel is located 100 meters from Pikes Market Place, the first Starbucks Coffee Shop and an awesome breakfast restaurant - Bacco's. They offer a number of excellent and refreshing juices for breakfast along with a great french toast! Love it! As we were sitting on the patio, I was compelled to "check in" to this Hotel via Facebook and was told I should goto the front desk to pick up my complimentary gift. To my surprise, we picked up a FREE bottle of red wine. Pinch Me! When we left, the bellman loaded our bags and asked if we needed directions to our next destination! Its the little details that count so much! Thanks Inn at the Market for an awesome stay!! So many hotels,..including the Ritz could learn so much from you! A must stay for anyone!

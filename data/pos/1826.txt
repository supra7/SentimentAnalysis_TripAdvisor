We stayed in downtown Seattle in August of this year. My husband had work in the city and my college age daughter and myself decided to go with on this trip. We wanted a smaller hotel that was close to Pike's Market and close to shopping as we would be without a car and not sure of public transportation there. The location of this hotel was perfect. It was in the middle of the shopping district and we could walk to anything we wanted to do. Pike's market was only 4 blocks away. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were immaculate and nicely decorated. The biggest plus was that there were two bathrooms in the room with two double beds. So, my daugher had her own bathroom which all of us thought was great. The price was reasonable for a downtown hotel. It was a smaller hotel that you did not feel like one of the masses in. It had a great restaurant in the hotel also. When we are in Seattle again, this will always be my choice of places to stay downtown Seattle. I found out about the hotel through the forums on trip advisor for Seattle.

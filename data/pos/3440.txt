Nice large room, nicely furnished with very comfy bed. Bathroom nIce, with proper walk in shower, but no bath (fine by me). Nice big walk in wardrobe, which was great for hiding away all the cases to leave a clutter free room. Great central location means all the main sites are in walking distance, so all in all a great place to stay. Really is excellent value for money. One minor thing, no free Internet in the room just in the bar. One final thing, we rarely eat in hotel restaurants as they generally aren't up to much. But the Andra's bar and restaurant were both packed with locals, so on the third night we were there we tried it. Highly recommended!! Food and atmosphere were great!! Would stay here again if we go back to Seattle and didn't want to splash out on Hotel 1000!

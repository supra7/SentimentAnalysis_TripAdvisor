Stayed here for 4 nights. We were pleasantly surprised the room we booked, which had 2 queen beds, also had two full baths, and a living room. Had a corner room on the fifth floor and it was very quiet. Hotel is conveniently attached to the Westlake Center. You can ride the monorail ($2 one-way) to the Seattle Center from the Westlake Center and there is a station to catch the metro transit (bus tunnel - ride free from 6 a.m. - 7 p.m.). Only a 10 minute walk to Pike's Market, 15 minute walk to Seattle Aquarium and Miner's Landing. Metro transit stops conveniently located all around. Would definitely stay here again.

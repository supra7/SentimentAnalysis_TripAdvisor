I had been to the ACE hotel in NYC (not to stay, to eat & drink) and liked the style and vibe there. After looking at the Seattle web-site, I decided to book an overnight from Victoria, B.C. on a sea plane.Turned out upon arrival I had booked the wrong night, but they still had a room availible. Lucky it wasn't summer! Its a two story walk-up so there are no high floors or views, but when I travel, I just want a safe & clean place to sleep, shower and store my belongings. The ACE in Seattle fulfilled my requirements. I was also fortunate to check in/out with Ed. He was very polite, professional, and personable. He gladly answered all my questions and gave me some tips and suggestions for places to go and see. The hotel is located in the "Belltown" neighbourhood and there are loads of bars & restaurants within walking distance. I walked from Lake Union (float plane terminal) to the hotel then from there to PIKES PLACE Mrkt, the waterfront wharf district, through downtown, Pioneer Square, the football stadium, and then all the way back across d-town to the Spcae Needle in one afternoon/evening. At night I walked to a cool bar that Ed recomended. Its a secret Seattle location that only a local would know. From there the bartender sent me to the SPUR Restaurant where I had to try and not order everything off the menu. After 5 courses, incl. dessert, I walked it off. The area is safe but you need to keep your wits about you. There seemed to be alot of vagrants around so I just keeped on moving. I would definitley recomend the ACE Seattle to friends in my age range (20's to late 30's), but it's not for eveyone. As one of the reviews stated, the ACE Seattle is a cool adult hostel. But a really cool,hip, claen, and safe adult hostel!

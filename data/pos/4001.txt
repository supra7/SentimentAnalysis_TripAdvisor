I've stayed here a dozen times. Very cozy with a fireplace in each room. Some rooms are small, ask for the mini-suite which is very roomy. I love the decor, and the atmosphere at this hotel. Only complaint is that they do not have any loyalty program so there are not any special perks for frequent stays.

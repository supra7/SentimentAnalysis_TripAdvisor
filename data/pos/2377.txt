The rooms are OK here (clean, but very standard), but what stands out is the service and demeanor of the staff. Of all the similar-type hotels I've stayed in, the level of accomodation and friendliness is outstanding at this Rennaissance- akin to that of a boutique hotel. We even had handwritten thank you notes from the room cleaning staff for our tips! Breakfast is very good and in a pleasant, sun-filled space with exceptional, upbeat servers. An example of this hotel's level of service is that I left a few things in the room when I checked out; when I realized almost a week later that I'd done this, I called them and they located my things (for which they had no responsiblity, of course), then sent them to me back in Boston (thank you, Patricia!). Very cool.

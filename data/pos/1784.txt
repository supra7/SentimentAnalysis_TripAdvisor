My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Queen 9/13-9/15/10, following a cruise. All of the staff was very helpful. The room was comfortable, clean and a little smaller than many motel rooms but worked out well. The room has a safe. The bath is rather small. Very convenient as many have noted. We stopped by Oliver's the first night to get something to eat as we did not want to go out (Andaluca's was closed). My wife and I ordered a turkey club sandwich and a fruit plate. Look out, it was enough food for four and was extremely value priced for Seattle. Our last morning we had breakfast at Andaluca's. Look out, there was a lot of food for the price! The only negative was that the two computer stations were right next to the front desk and on a shelf in the open rather than in a business room or secluded area. The computer screens were very small. Having said that, you can print right to the desk clerk's printer and have your copies immediately handed to you.

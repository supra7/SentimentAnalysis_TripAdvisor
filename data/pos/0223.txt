My partner and I took advantage of a great promotion and got a $289 room for $89 per night. The price was the only thing that was reduced though! The service and thoughtfulness of the staff was way above par. The queen room was on the smaller side, but lovely and clean. The high ceiling (12'?) gave a wonderful feeling of airiness to the room, however. The attention to detail in the decor is wonderful. The robes were thick zebra print terry, perfect for curling up against the down pillows. Another great note was the height and power of the shower. We are both over 6' tall and the shower head was at least 4" above us, plus showered down with a good amount of force. A+++

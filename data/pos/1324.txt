The hotel has a great location surrounded by park, restaurants and shopping center. The hotel clerk was very friendly at the front desk. She even lets us do a late check out with my husband's crown membership even though we booked via priceline with a much lower price. We also got a room at one of the club member only floors, and the view is fantastic. We can see the puget sound and space needle. Of course the view will be much better if the weather is not so groomy, but again it's Seattle, one can't expect too much from this rainy city. :)

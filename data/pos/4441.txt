I booked this hotel thru priceline.com and what a deal it was. I got a great hotel, in a great location for a steal or a deal. I paid a little more than some priceliners but I was taken care of by Michael, their front office manager very professionally. We parked in the garage across the street from them that is connected with a skybridge ($22/24 hours). Check in was a breeze and the hotel lobby was great with plenty of plush chairs and couches. Our room was one of the best - overlooking the Sound and just beautiful. I have stayed at other Starwood Hotels that are nicer but for the price you can't beat it. I have seen other reviews saying the elevators are slow and the wait is too long however I did not experience that at all. A little wait maybe but nothing like standing around for 5 minutes. I highly recommend this hotel.

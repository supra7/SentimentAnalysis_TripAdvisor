Early arrival (7:30am) after a six hour plane ride. Greeted getting out of the cab and even before I reached the front desk the receptionist had a smile on her face. I greetly like they really expected me and said my room was available!! WOW. I had a great corner unit and got excited! Business travelers don't normally get such a deal. Room was clean, bed and pillows comfortable and didn't once have to adjust the thermostat!! Remained at a cool 68 for my entire week's stay. Attended a training class the entire week held at the hotel. Loved that it was kiddie corner to the public library. The only dislike was the steep hill--but that was nothing in comparison to staying at the hotel. Staff was friendly. Dining in room service -- 15 minutes flat! I'd stay here again!!

An architectural gem, full of history and character, with friendly staff and close to great eateries and the centre of town. We had a large room which was a very comfortable for our family of five. The Toulouse Petit restaurant across the street is a great place to eat and so convenient. After dropping our things off we got free parking by driving a few hundred yards up the hill behind the hotel and parking on a side street. You don't need the car anyway because the hotel in close to the centre of town and walking or bus are the best options to see the sites. We'd highly recommend the Marqueen.

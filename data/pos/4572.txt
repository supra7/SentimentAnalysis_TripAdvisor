I've never had a problem with Westin hotels and this one was no different. Got a great deal for $89. I like the round towers which gives the room a cool layout. There was a great view of the city. Room service was expensive but good. Westin beds are always the best. I felt very comfortable in this hotel. The bellman was very helpful and told me about the Airporter bus which saved me a lot instead of taking a cab to the airport.

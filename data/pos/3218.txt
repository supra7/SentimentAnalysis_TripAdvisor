I am a frequent guest at the 6th Avenue Inn. It is a good value for money and very covneniently located downtown with easy access to most of the business and tourist sites. The hotel, while older is one of the cleanist properties around. The janitorial and housekeeping staffs are always working on keeping the place clean and will respond quickly to requests. The front desk team while sometimes overworked and understaffed are extremely friendly and helpful with all requests. This hotel makes up for its age with its staffs hard work, attention to detail, and customer service attitude. The restaurant also serves some of the best breakfasts in Seattle. As a frequent quest I was surprised and delighted to see the welcome back note and snacks when I checked in. This type of touch will keep me coming back.

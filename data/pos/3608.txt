I've stayed at the Andra in the past, and will always choose this hotel in Seattle. They have large suites that are only slightly more expensive than a standard room - it's well worth it. The suite is quite large, the decor is very smart. Very comfortable beds, nice furniture. I think my only complaint might be that there's not a lot of lighting in the bedroom part of the room. But lots of windows that open fully, so you can easily lighten up the room and get some fresh air if you want. Very convenient, Macy's across the street, very close to the shopping district and a few blocks away from Pike's market.

This was my second year staying at The Hotel Monaco Seattle for business. I liked it so much last year that I extended my business stay two extra nights this year for some R&R. It is so conveniently located...accross from the Public Library, just blocks from Pike Place Market and there is a full size grocery store a couple of blocks away as well as a Walgreens. We ordered room service and ate in the restaurant downstairs and both were excellent. The staff was very professional and eager to please. I will definitely stay here again.

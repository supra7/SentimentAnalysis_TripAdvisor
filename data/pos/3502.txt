Clean, spacious, well decorated - funky and modern - just the perfect place for a girl's weekend. Great location and then there is the staff. Stephanie Ellis was my first contact pre-trip via email, she answered my many questions, made recommendations, got us great reservations at Salty's (a trip highlight). I never got the opportunity to meet her in person, but was very impressed with her service and friendliness. We met Sean - the epitome of customer service! He was helpful, kind, funny and genuine. What a great person! He never missed the chance to say hello, ask about our day, make a great restaurant recommend or grab a map to help us find our way. (Must be because he is a Montana man!) A third "wow" experience was with a waitress in Lola's. She was so friendly - a huge smile and exuded enthusiasm and kindness. She found out it was my birthday and set us up with a free appetizer at Etta's and coconut bites from the bakery (they were delicious!) She topped it off with a "Mom" washable tattoo for fun. (Her name was Colleen) I travel a lot for my job and have never been in a city as hospitable as Seattle - and Hotel Andra set the mark!

We are in a recently renovated 8th floor Mediterranean King Room. It is Big and Beautiful. Very chic! The two person jetted tub is DEEP :0 Lots of cool details throughout the room. No view At ALL tho. We walked in with no reservations and asked to book a Mediterranean King Room. The front desk clerk said they were booked. I told him I had just seen four room categories available on line within the hour. He then said he had found one room available, but couldn't offer AAA or Gov't rate. The rate from the front desk was $45 higher than what I'd just seen on line (with AAA ($186) and also included a $20 dining credit in their outstanding restaurant, Sazerac), so I stepped into the lobby made the reservation and waited for it to show up on their system (that made time for a quick drink anyway.... :) The front desk staff were very pleasant throughout the process and offered to store our bags while we got things arranged. Check out our photos of Room 801. We love Kimpton Hotels and will be enjoying their complimentary wine hour in the gorgeous lobby shortly.

The hotel is remodeled and excellent for business travelers. The club lounge is one of the nicest (you must be a member or pay for a club room). There is an excellent complimentary breakfast and happy hour. Both have much more than the standard fare. There is an omelet bar and all the fixins' for a great bagel to go - lox tomatoes etc. At night, there are very good apps and wine etc for a lower cost than the bar. The hotel is centrally located and there are many excellent restaurants within walking distance. it's near live venues, movie theater and shopping too. Overall very nice.

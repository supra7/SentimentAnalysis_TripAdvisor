Very nice hotel, close to everything. Best price we could get was $149 plus taxes. That seems a little high for a hotel in the suburbs. But everyone warned us not to get the cheaper hotels ($86) that were only about 10 miles away, because of the "neighborhood", so we heeded their advice. The reason our review title is "Overpriced" is because the $149 didn't include a complimentary breakfast. They wanted $10.00 for a buffet. However, right across the street was a huge IKEA store which had a little cafe inside and they had a simple breakfast, egg, bacon and toast, for only .99 cents !! So where do you think everyone went? Smart marketing for IKEA. There were people from all around the neighborhood lined up for that.

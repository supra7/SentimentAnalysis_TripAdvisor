Stayed here for short business trip. Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Excellent downtown location, close to everything. I did not eat in the hotel or bar, so cannot comment on the food. My room was very comfortable and quiet; bathroom is somewhat dated, but fine. I would definitely stay here again. The only negative was that I don't think there was a business center. PCs/internet available in lobby and front desk cheerfully accommodates printing needs, but you have to stand to use the computer, which makes doing actual work a bit uncomfortable. Wireless available, so your own laptop probably the best bet.

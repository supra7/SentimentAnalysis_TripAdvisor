This hotel is absolutely fabulous! I was really impressed by everything the hotel had to offer, especially the anemities that I haven't been able to find in other hotels. Each morning, there's a fully stocked continental breakfast, and every afternoon there are treats for hotel guests (cookies, bars, etc.). I felt very safe at the hotel at all times (even when I was picked up at 4 am for an early flight), and the hotel staff and management were always helpful and very friendly. I was visiting the University of Washington, and the hotel was very close to both the school and a big restaurant district, making it very easy to find meals.

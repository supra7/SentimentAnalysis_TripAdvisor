We needed a one night stay in Seattle and all the hotel in downtown were over our budget so we booked the MarQueen Hotel that is supposed to be less conveniently located. It turned out that this location is still quiet convenient. It's away from the downtown noise but with access to all downtown points of interest by bus. We walked to the Space Needle and the Ride the Duck city tour is right next to it. We had a roomy and clean suite of 2 queen beds the comes with a seperate kitchen and a den. Great for a longer stay. Employees of the hotel are very friendly and helpful.

My husband and I have spent about 6 weekends in Seattle over the past 2 years. We have stayed at the Red Lion, the Fairmont and the Hilton and this is the one which definitely suits us best. What we appreciate about the Hilton is that the service is always good from the lobby to the top floor. The rooms are small and a bit old fashioned but clean and very comfortable. Above all, we enjoy a lot the top floor beautiful view. The first time we were there, we were no gold members yet and we could only enjoy the view when having our breakfast. Now we are upgraded whenever is possible and we can enjoy it in the evening too, while having a snack and drinking a gin tonic! Last weekend, we forgot our iPhone charger in our room. We called the reception on Monday and they sent it back to us immediately. We received it by Fedex this morning! Just a pity that their croissants and "pains au chocolat" were too dry in the morning.

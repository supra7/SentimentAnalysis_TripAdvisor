This is the PERFECT hotel: sweet quiet clean and charming, uber-hip but gentle and just down-to-the-bone nice (and located close to everything). I can't recall the last time I was this happy in a hotel. My room was really inexpensive because the bathrooms were down the hall, but the bathrooms were hospital clean and bright and large and the soaps and shampoos were really nice--and the little sink in my room (European style) was all I needed. I liked being there so much! Great desk staff, excellent spa downstairs, nice breakfast...I'll never stay anywhere else in Seattle: Ace is the place!

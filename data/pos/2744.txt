We travel to Seattle a couple times a year and we like to stay downtown. Our last trip we decided to stay at the Sheraton. I was prepared for a well worn convention type hotel but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the sparkling lobby and the generally upbeat atmosphere here. The rooms were really nicely decorated in bright finishes. Location is perfect for exploring the downtown and Pike Place Market. We booked a tour of local wineries here (see my review) the Sheraton has a huge driveway for easy check in and pickups. The convention center is right next door if your meeting happens to be there. Lots of great restaurants within a couple blocks here.

I made a reservation at Hotel Andra after reading reviews on line. I was looking for a centrally located, quiet, comfortable hotel, near the light rail, for a long weekend visit with friends, and Andra fit the bill perfectly. My room was spacious, with more shelf and drawer space than most rooms, and nice touches like a coat hook by the door, a nite light in the bathroom, and ear plugs in the bedside drawer. I asked for a quiet room and got one, with a potential problem--connecting doors to the next room. Luckily, my neighbors were quiet, but if they hadn't been the doors wouldn't have helped much. The in-room coffee was awful (a Starbucks packet). Finally, the hotel charges extra for an internet connection, which is inexcusable these days...rather like charging for TV use.

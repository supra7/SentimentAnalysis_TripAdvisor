We looked at a range of hotels in Seattle but settled for the Sorrento and are very pleased we did. From the moment of check in, the service was fantastic with John in particular worth a mention for a level of service of you would normally only get in Asia. The location is the only thing you sacrifice in this property but the rooms size (significant), free wifi and courtesy cars at your disposal a major plus compared to the peer group. We used the courtesy car 3 times and each times the driver was willing to give a little guided tour and insight. The only small negative is that the towels are over leaned and the odour of bleach on them needs getting used to but it is rare to say that the only downside was overcleaning!! We would definitely come again.

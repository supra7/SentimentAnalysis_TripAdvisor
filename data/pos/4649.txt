The rooms are nice and big and very updated. Only problem was the 2 queens are actually 2 doubles - so not as comfortable. The lobby always seemed very crowded - I guess the people like to hang out at the bar in the lobby. I did not try it so no comments. Location is great - very close to freeway, malls, restaurants in downtown. Make sure you get a good rate with hotwire - or it might work out expensive.

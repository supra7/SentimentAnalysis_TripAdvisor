My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Inn at The Market. We loved it! We checked into the hotel immediately after climbing 9000ft of Mt. Rainier, so we really appreciated just how comfortable the hotel was. The staff was always happy to answer questions, and helped us with directions to restaurants a number of times. The room was a partial water view room, and was quite spacious - queen bed, table and chair by window, sofa and table, desk and chair. The bathroom was very nice. One thing that truly impressed me was that I had to request extra towels only on the first night. After that, we had extra towels every day. Also, the hotel supplied us with everything we needed for an in-room picnic: plates, silverware, napkins, wine glasses, corkscrew. I highly recommend foraging in the market for provisions and eating either in your room or on the 5th floor deck. All in all, our stay was extremely relaxed and comfortable. The location is wonderful, near lots of good restaurants. Go to Serious Pie and Wild Ginger.

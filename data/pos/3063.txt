Lovely room. We were disappointed when we checked in and I asked where the pool is located to be told the pool is closed for remodeling until September or October. I had called the Starwood reservations line directly in July and asked which of the Starwood hotels in Seattle had the best pool, picked the Sheraton based on their advice, told my daughter that she could go swimming, only to find it was closed. They did tell us we could go down and use the pool at the Westin but that just seemed like a mission since we only had one full day in Seattle at the tail end of this trip. Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel. We were supposed to be on the club floor, but had been moved to the union tower as we arrived after midnight I wasnt in the mood to make a fuss. We still got club room amenities - the breakfast was great and the staff were super. We were told that the union tower rooms were newer and nicer and we did have a lovely room with two very comfy beds, a flat screen tv and a nice bathroom. There was a nice big desk area and two comfortable chairs in a seating area. The decor is quite masculine - sort of comfortable modern look I suppose but it all worked and felt really comfortable. The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating, and these neat microsoft tables that are like huge touch screens with local maps etc. They were pretty cool. The location is great, we walked down to Pike market, walked over and caught the monorail to the Space Needle. We went up the space needle which my daughter loved! There are lots of great shops around the hotel. I would stay here again - particularly once the pool reopens ;)! It was a comfortable, spotlessly clean, well located hotel, great value for the price we paid (an online special summer rate).

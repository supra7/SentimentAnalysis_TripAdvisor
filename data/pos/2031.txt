A beautiful hotel in the center of the action in Seattle. A great deal but not a cookie cutter Ramada Inn or Sharaton. An artsy experience that's isn't prefabricated. One night while staying there, Corinne Bailey Rae performed at the adjoining Moore Theater and Clint Eastwood's wife was staying at the Moore. Walking distance to parks, harbor, shopping, etc. Go to Cafe d"Art on the corner where the drip coffee and lattes are like butter!

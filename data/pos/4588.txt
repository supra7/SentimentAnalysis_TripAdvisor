My husband, son and I were stuck in Seattle during the Christmas madness when Sea-Tac shut down. We had originally planned to have a lovely 3-day stay in Chicago at the Chicago Hilton and shopping on the mag mile but ended up stranded in Seattle. I immediately called the Westin and asked if they had any specials. They told us about the Holiday Shopper's Package which was $200/night but included a $100 dollar shopping card for Pacific Place mall and a 40% discount card to all of their eateries. Because I'm a Starwood Preferred Member they gave us a room on the 41st floor which overlooked the entire city and Puget Sound. It was lovely!! The room was clean and spacious. We had gracious service from all of the staff and had a lovely time shopping and seeing the sights.

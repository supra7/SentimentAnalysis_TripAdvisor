Checked in at 9:30PM on Valentines day. Our flight arrived 2 hours late, so our check in was 2 hours later than planned. Fast and friendly checkin. Decided to eat at the hotel's restaurant, due to hte late hour and inclemment weahter. Fabulous meal at 10 PM very reasonable priced (quite a surprise for a hotel restaurant) and intersting fare. The room was nice, great tub, super comfortable bed, and quiet. I would definielty stay here again, when overnighting in Seattle.

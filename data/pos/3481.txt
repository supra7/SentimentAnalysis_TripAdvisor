Hotel has great ambience and friendly people. I loved my room, had views of the space needle and was large enough for my purposes. I did hear the next room's bathroom flushing everytime but other than that it was a great room. Business center was easy to use. I ate from Lola's room service menu and the service was good but the food was less desirable but I was credited for it. Everyone was super friendly and accomodating but I had to ask for the sewing kit and wine opener couple of times before it was sent to my room.

I can ditto almost everything I read in current reviews here. The service was great- what we expect from a Westin. The heavenly beds were exactly that- heavenly. Our view was even more heavenly! I had read in a previous review to make sure to see sunset from the room and wow- it is great. We booked a deluxe room and were offered an upgrade to deluxe waterview via email prior to arrival for only $10.00 more per night. We said yes! The first room they send us to was not a great waterview- only partial. When we asked to be moved higher- they said no problem and we had a view of the Space Needle, the bay and Olympia mountains. I will try to add a photo- I've never done that before. Go to this Westin for the view (get a waterview!), location, service and beds but do realize that it is not the larger, plush rooms with big bathrooms that you usually associate with the Westin hotels.

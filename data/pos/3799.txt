I was in Seattle for business and had the pleasure of staying at the Edgewater Hotel. While the hotel is a little old or should I say "historic", the rooms are nicely appointed with comfortable beds and fireplaces. I had the pleasure of having a room with a water view - which was spectacular. The hotel lobby and rooms have a "rustic" Pacific Northwest decor which was fun and each room comes with it's own teddy bear on the bed and rubber ducky in the bathroom. The bathroom was great with a claw footed soaking tub and a separate shower with a rain shower head. The room also came with thick terry robes for wrapping yourself in after a good soak. The toiletries are luxurious but be careful not to take them - they are full sized bottles and taking them will add a hefty charge to your bill ($25 each) however they clearly warn you so there are no misunderstandings and the items are available for sale in the gift shop if you want to purchase them. One of the nights I was with a group of business associates and we were having some appetizers and drinks in the lobby seating area enjoying the wonderful water views before dinner. We had wanted to have dinner in the hotel restaurant, but we did not have reservations and they were unable to accommodate our party of 4 until about 9:30p that night. We were trying to decide where to go when our server offered to set us up for dinner where we were sitting. There are small seating areas clustered around coffee tables in the lobby so we had dinner and a bottle of wine sitting in front of the fire place at a coffee table. The minor inconvenience of sitting at a coffee table was easily overlooked as the food was quite good and the server's hospitality was memorable and appreciated. Actually all of the staff I encountered were customer oriented and friendly and both check-in and check-out were fast and efficient. I would recommend this hotel and would love to stay again the next time I am in Seattle.

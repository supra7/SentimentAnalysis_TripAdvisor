What an awesome hotel...Comfortable beds, very clean, and fun artwork and decor. We loved it here. It's located in a cool part of town with lots of Gallerys and good Restaurants. The price was great too! Thanks for such a nice stay. We are coming back soon. And please open more hotels like this in different cities. Your concept is great!

We stayed at the Edgewater for our first annual Christmas weekend in Seattle. It was magical. The room was warm and cozy, the bathroom was beautiful and the shuttle service was incredibly convenient for getting to Westlake and the shopping area downtown. The front desk staff (and everyone we ran into in a hallway) were friendly and welcoming each time we passed through. Our shuttle driver, Kevin, was friendly, helpful and knowledgable about great places to have breakfast. We had a waterfront room and enjoyed watching the Christmas ships, the ferries and other boats pass by. My daughter loved the bear ottoman....I have a great picture of her sitting on the bear in front of the fireplace.

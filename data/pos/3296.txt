I was not sure just what to expect from this hotel. I had read great reviews and not so great reviews. I was not disappointed. The hotel was very clean throughout. Appeared to be new carpet, paint, etc. The hotel staff was excellent, the on site restaurant and lounge were very nice and the breakfast fantastic. Free WiFi that was excellent (wireless starting next week). Within walking distance of everything I wanted to see. I had no issue with street noise but I could see where this could be a problem as sound does seem to carry through the windows very easily. The hotel is only 5 stories so you are not very high above noise if it is there. Like I said it was not an issue for me. If you are on a budget or just want to save your money for the great food in the city I would highly recommend this hotel. All the old reviews I read regarding a worn out facility were no longer valid from my experience.

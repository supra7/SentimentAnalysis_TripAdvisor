We chose this hotel for our Seattle stay because of trip advisor and it's reviews. YOU WERE ALL SO RIGHT!!!!!! We loved it. The decor was so charming with a little dinette and small sitting area as part of the room. I was so enchanted that I bought a $5 bouquet of tulips to put on a table in the sitting area. Staff was super helpful with attraction directions and public transportation. We were on the third floor and did not mind the lack of an elevator. We overindulged in the fantastic Seattle Cuisine and stair climbing was a good way to exercise off some of the calories. Overall great place to stay on a visit to Seattle!!

Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Not cheap but worth spending that bit extra. Better than the 'chain' hotels, big room and bathroom, very comfortable bed. We booked a room with a view of the bay which was great. Windows open to let in fresh air. Staff were very frindly and helpful. Happily booked tours and cabs for us. The Steelhead restaurand across the road on Pine St is excellent.

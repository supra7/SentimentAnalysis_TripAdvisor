For girls weekend in downtown Seattle, we chose the Sheraton! The rooms are a nice size, nice views and the best bed, pillows and comforters. We are looking forward to going back the any Sheraton! The parking is expensive, that was the only thumbs down I have to share. What do you expect being downtown, but wow! $42 valet

This was a fabulous hotel, with great service, amenities, and location. We had a water view room and the view was indeed spectacular. We took full advantage of the roof deck, despite cold weather while we were there and loved eating breakfast while watching the ferries come in and the vendors set up shop at Pike Place. The staff was knowledge, friendly and helpful. Our only complaint was that we would have preferred a king sized bed, and when I mentioned that on their feedback survey, I got an answer back right away noting that they are in the process of upgrading to king sized beds. That should be completed by August. With that small change, I would enthusiastically recommend this great hotel to anyone travelling to Seattle!

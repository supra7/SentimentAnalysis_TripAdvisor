I have just returned home from another great stay at the Andra. Travelling as a single woman on business, I like that the Andra is in a great, safe location where you can easily walk to shopping, restaurants, and the business district. The staff were welcoming at check-in and acknowledged me when I returned at the end of my work day. The room was very comfortable and showed attention to detail. I would not hesitate to stay again.

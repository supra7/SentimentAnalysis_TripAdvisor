I have stayed at The Moore Hotel in 1996, 2001, 2006, and now again just recently in 2011. I'm happy to say it is still great. Excellent, central location for a very reasonable price. The service at the front desk has always been courteous, helpful, and friendly. The rooms and the entire interior, though basic, are very charming and clean. There's a clawfoot tub in the room, but the plumbing is completely modern, and is as good or better as other upscale hotels I have reserved. I have to think hard to find something negative to say. The shower curtain in my room was a bit musty, but opening the window quickly and completely eradicated the scent. As many have said, there's no air conditioning, but I can only imagine this being an issue on maybe 5 nights a year, during an unusual heat wave. And the street noise (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) is audible. But unless you are really sensitive about any of those 3 things, I'd highly recommend The Moore...I think you will find it will actually be a fondly memorable aspect of a visit to Seattle, a city with many attractions and things to be fond of.

I stayed here for less than 12 hours (late check-in and early flight) with my boyfriend. We both really liked it. I had stayed at the Ace in Portland and been to the one in NYC. This is worlds apart, there's no hip bar or coffee place or really much of a lobby. The rooms were just right, nothing unnecessary, comfy beds, friendly staff. The neighborhood had some bums loitering around, but it wasn't super sketchy. I would stay here again.

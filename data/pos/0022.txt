Very nice stay, exactly as we expected from reading previous reviews, and from Hilton Garden Inn brand name. We appreciated the quiet atmosphere, which apparently isn't an accident (all guests are asked upon check-in to sign an agreement to observe quiet hours or risk being kicked out). Comfy bedding. Cookies on arrival, free internet access worked easily. There wasn't any outdoor storage rack for our bikes, but the front desk staff said it was fine to bring them in the room. The only negative was that, unlike Hampton Inn, the breakfast buffet isn't free, it's over $10 per person. Great Location: We took advantage of the location to visit the Ikea less than a mile away and the Bengies Drive In theatre, a few miles away, and the Northern Central Railroad bike trail, about 20 miles away. There are also tons of restaurants in the immediate area.

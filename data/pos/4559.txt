The location of the hotel is excellent - walking distance to pretty much everything and right next to the monorail and free trams in case you don't want to walk. We booked via Hotwire and got the room for under $100 so it was great value too. I asked for a high room and got great city views - recommended. It is a circular building, so the rooms are a odd layout which makes it a bit different from most boxy hotel room. the lobby area whilst busy is very comfortable and offers free wifi to guests. My only complaints are that the room had a musty 'stale airconditioning' smell when you first went in, and that the plush bedding was a bit too warm for the room temperature. Otherwise highly recommended.

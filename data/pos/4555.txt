We got a standard king room for $70 on priceline. Plus taxes it came out to be $85/night, which is an amazing steal in the middle of the city during the summer. Great location near restaurants, shopping, 10 minute walk to Pike Place market. We learned from other reviewers to park at the Westin Building parking next door for $18/day (instead of $36 at the hotel). There's a sky bridge directly into the mezannine of the hotel- extremely convienent. Other reviewers commented on the snobbery toward priceline customers, but we didn't experience that. Our room was beautiful, on the 21st floor, just like the photos on the Westin website and other reviewer photos. The swimming pool is in the North tower, but so are all the conferences and catered events, so the North tower elevevators are much busier than the South tower. So stay in the south tower if you can! A great place, I would definitely stay there again.

Let me start by saying we booked using Priceline, which I have never tried before. We got an incredible rate for the Hotel Monaco. I was very skepticle, as I had never heard of this hotel before and we used to live just an hour north of Seattle. I jumped on this website and found much relief. Now onto the review. We arrived late Friday night and were very impressed with our first impression. A beautiful hotel just a few blocks from downtown shopping. The first thing I noticed was a Starbucks right next door, as well as Seattles Best Coffee across the street. A good start! The staff was very freindly and although valet parking was $40 a night, these guys went through hoops to make you feel special. Since paying much less then rack, we were ok with paying top dollar parking rates. We brought our daughter, 12, and her freind, 13 on this trip. They had delivered (upon prior request) goldfish in bowls for them to enjoy over the weekend. Nice touch! The rooms are very cozy and beds equally comfortable. Kids loved the flatscreen TV. The next morning we had coffee in room, as well as more from the lobby area. We really enjoyed this service. We walked to Pike Place Sat. am and had breakfast at "The Crumpet Shop". Well liked by all. When we went to retrieve our car, the valet opened the door and called my husband by name...nice touch!. I noticed that they have "kid packs" available for children. When we went out Saturday night, I asked id they would deliver them to our room. The kids were so excited to get this surprise. Also, the hotel has a wine reception between 5-6pm, which was really nice. I really was expecting less then perfect service having booked on priceline, but I must say, we were blown away by this place. Already planning our next trip back and will definatly stay here again without hesitation. This was one of our best hotel stays ever. Thanks Hotel Monaco!

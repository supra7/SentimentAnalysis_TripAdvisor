We have stayed in this hotel for the past 3-4 years while attending the Northwest Flower & Garden Show. Rooms are large and comfortable with coffee and tea provided. Since our visit last year, hotel has gone "green" with soap, lotion, shampoo & conditioner dispensers and use of fluorescent light bulbs throughout. Sheets and towels are not changed every night (Save the Planet program). We understand they are under new management, and we commend them for being concerned about the environment. Appearance and condition are much improved under new management. Staff has always been friendly and helpful when needed. We always ask for an upper floor since the floors tend to squeak. When the person above you comes in at 2 or 3 in the morning, it can disturb your sleep depending on how much they move around.

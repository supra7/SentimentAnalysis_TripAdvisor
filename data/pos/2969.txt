The best thing to say about the Sheraton is that it is in a fantastic location. That being said, I think they aren't getting quite all of the value out of it. The hotel looks...used. It is pretty nice, but looks like it takes a lot of use. Everything about the hotel is like that... I will say that the pool has a fantastic view of Mt. Rainier, so check that out. Also, the sheets weren't soft or plush, they were so stiff they made noise when I laid down, which is nice to know they were clean, but uncomfortable at first.

More important than the beautifully appointed room, the hotel staff exceeded my expectatations for courtesy and concern. I spent 10 days at the Sorrento to be near my son at the hospital. Not only was a Town Car provided to transport me but the Concierge staff eased my stay with their kindness and concern. My room was spotless and offered every comfort. The hotel was a haven at a time of stress.

This was our second visit to the georgous Hotel Monaco and we are looking forward to our third! Perfect location for S.A.M., shopping and Pike Place Market. Ten out of ten for WOW factor - just walking through the lobby makes you feel special. Eclectic decor - part art deco, part circus - mainly WOW. Luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms. First class service. Best part is the wine tasting from 5-6pm every night which makes for lots of socialising and intermingling between the guests - makes you feel very welcome and indulged. Morning coffee and tea in the same lounge starts the day off nicely. It's the sort of place you would expect to see Hercule Pirot relaxing in a chair, thinking.

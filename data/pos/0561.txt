This is the second time that we have stayed in The Warwick Hotel and we really enjoyed the Hotel again. We had asked for a quiet room on a high floor and this is what we were given with the added bonus of a great view of The Space Needle. The room was spacious and very clean, the bathroom was good and the bed was extremely comfortable. We also liked the fact that it was possible to open the door onto the mini balcony - real air! The staff were all very friendly and helpful and were able to answer all our questions about buses, ferries, sights etc. We would have liked the Hotel to have a stock of bus and ferry timetables but this is a minor point. The Hotel is extremely well situated for getting around Seattle. It is walking distance from Pike Place Market, The Space Needle and The Museums of Music and Science Fiction. There are bus routes conveniently nearby which will take you to most destinations including the Airport for a mere $1.25! It is also walking distance from some good restaurants. An added bonus is the fantastic Deli/Supermarket opposite the Hotel. They do great breakfasts as well as snacks, wine etc - check it out! We would definitely stay in The Warwick Hotel again if we are in Seattle.

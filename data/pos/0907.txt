We took a 4 day trip to Seattle for a wedding, but also wanted to see the sights. The Inn at the Market is in a great location for most of the major Seattle attractions. Its steps to Pike Place Market, a walk to the Westlake Center (Space Needle and airport Monorail stop), a short walk to waterfront, quick cab or longer walk to Pioneer Square and Safeco Park. The staff there are really great, extremely courteous and efficient. The rooms are nice and spacious. The hotel has a great spacious roof deck with amazing views and was a perfect spot for wine and cheese at sunset. On site are a french restaurant and cafe. We had breakfast and happy hour at the cafe, both were great. We would definitely return to the Inn at the Market.

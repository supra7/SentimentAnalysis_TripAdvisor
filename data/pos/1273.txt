I enjoyed this hotel which I visited for an unusually long 6 night stay in association with a meeting. Yes it was somewhat dated but the room was fine with a good view from 27 Floor. Clean spacious and everything worked. Situation wise, it was a 40$ cab fare from the airport (although the light rail is only two blocks away) and an easy walk from the harbour front, Pike Street market and Space Needle. Parking would have been an issue as it is limited and very expensive. Ate breakfast buffet once and it was substantial with good coffee and only 10$ for a priority club member. Similarly, lunches and bar meals reasonable as was alcohol within the nightly happy hour. Gym was small but reasonably well equipped with modern equipment. No pool though. Man gripes ? The lifts were not really up to the task with a lot of waiting at peak times and also many large groups of tourists often cluttering the lobby. Internet would have been expensive but was free in meeting room and there are many local branches of Starbucks/ other sites with free WiFi you can use.

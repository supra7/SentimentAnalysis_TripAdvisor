I stayed here with 3 other adults in one room for a family wedding. The rooms were spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The there was a TV, fridge, desk, chair, two double beds with soft mattresses. Even with four people inside, the room was so big, we could've stuck another person in on the floor! The front desk staff was nice, and able to answer all our questions.The morning manager even knew how to process a Qantas airlines frequent flyer card for points. (This is a very rare request in North America, no one has heard of Qantas here). There is a gas station down the street next to a McDonalds (if you don't want the hotel's $10.99 breakfast), as well as several malls/plazas in the area with restaurants. It is right next to the highway, and free parking was a god send because you have to drive to get anywhere in Baltimore or Washington DC. The free apples, coffee/tea, computers/printer, and internet were much appreciated. My only complaint is the free cookies at the front desk. I, like everyone else, love free cookies. These were labelled as "beware of traces of nuts" but they were pure peanut butter cookies. I don't know if all Hilton Garden Inns do this, but beware if you have allergies. Otherwise, this hotel gets mega thumbs up!

I needed to stay in Seattle for as little money as possible. I planned on a hostel, but they were full so they referred me to Moore Hotel. I paid around $60 a night, which is about half of what you would pay for any other hotel downtown. Although the building is old, it was clean and very safe. The desk is attended 24 hours a day, and the doorway between the lobby and the stairs/hallway is locked at night. The room, though Spartan, was comfortable. I appreciated the small touches, such as the towels folded into animals. I chose a European Style room, which means there is a sink in the room but the toilet and shower are down the hall. The hall bathrooms were kept very clean. I never had to wait to use them, so the arrangement wasn't as inconvenient as I thought it would be. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about restaurants, shopping, and must-see attractions in Seattle. Location was ideal. Everything I wanted to see was in walking distance. For example, it is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. However, down the block from the hotel was a drug rehab-salvation-army-type shelter place, where support groups met. So, if you are intimidated by people that do not look wealthy or middle class, may sometimes be dirty or wear odd clothing, walking past this place may be a bit intimidating for you. I was a little intimidated (I'm from a rich suburb), but I never felt as if I was in danger. This is important, as I am a woman who was traveling alone. Overall, I had a great experience at Moore Hotel. The next time I go to Seattle, I will book a room there without hesitation.

We stayed at the Monaco late last December. When I called to make the reservation I casually mentioned to the central booking agent that it was our anniversary. Honestly, I didn't do this to curry favor. When we arrived the receptionist mentioned our anniversary and gave us a room upgrade. It was unexpected and delightful as well. It was a room with a sitting area, plush and spacious. That evening a bottle of champagne and chocolates showed up in our room! Beyond that, every employee that we met, without exception, seemed genuinely interested in making our stay better. They also had a wine tasting social that was extremely well done with healthy pours. Stem to stern our stay was wonderful.

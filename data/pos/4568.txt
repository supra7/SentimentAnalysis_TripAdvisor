After having stayed in the Edgewater and several other Seattle hotels, this hotel beats them all. I wrote a review with some pictures about this hotel a year ago as well. I had a few minor problems with my stay then, but this time not one bit. I stayed here again this weekend and the hotel is still superb. The entire staff was friendly, the hotel was very clean, and they upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 34th floor overlooking the city. Thank you Westin Seattle! I appreciate this hotel upgrading people to higher floors when they are not sold out! That's what I call good service. The rooms at this hotel are decently large with a very nice TV and superb views of the entire city. The hotel's pool was out of commission but they made up for it by offering free access to either the Sheraton's pool or the Warwick. They also were willing to pay the taxi fare to get to the pool! Wow. Nothing to complain about as this trip was 100% perfect thanks to the Westin Seattle staff!

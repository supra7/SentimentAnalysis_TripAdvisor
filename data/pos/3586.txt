My husband and I loved this hotel. We stayed 2 nights this past weekend. The room was very comfortable. We liked it that the windows open to the street noise below if you want to hear the sounds of the city. We like that. The location can't be beat. The bed was the highlight of beds in hotel rooms. I want to buy the sheets and 2 pillows from the website. They know they have something going on at this hotel. My compliments to the owner/Pres of the company. A stay at this hotel will make for a great Seattle experience. We loved drinking down in the lobby on Friday afternoon. It is quite a scene. Plus, you have options galore with the Tom Douglas restaurants all around you... plus the Dahlia Bakery for breakfast 10 steps in front of the hotel. I can't say enough great things about this hotel.

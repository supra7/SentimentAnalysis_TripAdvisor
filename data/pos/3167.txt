We just returned from a three night stay at the Seattle Sheaton and we couldn't have been happier. Thanks to previous postings, I booked our room through Priceline at an incredible $95/night. The parking was expensive at $28/night, but we felt that the cheap room made up for it. I did not have to wait in line at check-in and they gave us a room on the 30th floor with spectacular views of the city. The room was spotless and quiet. My kids loved the pool and it was very clean and never crowded. As a tourist, the location can't be beat. The main doors are on Pike Street and you are only a five block walk to the Pike Street Market. The monorail is two blocks away, and the shopping district is all around you. The construction is still going on in the lobby, but I never heard it or was inpacted by it.

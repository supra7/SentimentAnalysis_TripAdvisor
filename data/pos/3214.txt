The room was basic and the bathroom was small but both were very clean and seemed to be recently redecorated. My husband and I liked the free internet and the newspaper at our door each morning. We paid the senior price of $80.00 a night and were happy to have the extra money to spend on nearby restaurants downtown and in Belltown, each of which were a 3 to 5 minute walk from the hotel. Also the Pike Place Market is about a 7 minute walk away. The staff at the hotel was helpful especially finding us transportation from the airport when we arrived in Seattle after midnight. They had arranged transportation before we left on our trip and when it fell through called me to tell me about a shuttle that we could take instead, making sure that we knew where to go in the airport to find this shuttle.

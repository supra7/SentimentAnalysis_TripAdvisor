We stayed at the Marqueen on a pre-cruise special. There were 6 of us. The hotel is in a great area, lots of great eating places nearby and the Space Needle/Seattle Centre just blocks away. The hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff were excellent in helping with check-in, storing bags, providing tour info, etc. Only downfalls were no elevator (we travelled with elderly and a person with walking difficulties, so the trek up 3 flights of stairs was challenging). The continental breakfast could have provided a bit more (maybe juice and more fruit options). Overall, the stay was great.

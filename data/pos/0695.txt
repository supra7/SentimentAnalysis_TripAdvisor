Incredibly pleasant boutique hotel w. a relaxing, casual vibe. 70 rms & compact design promotes easy in & out and all about... no crowds, lines, waits, long corridors or elevator rides... even on a booked weekend, hassle-free! Cut above feature... Outstanding location (Pike Market seems central to everything) and unique, local fare practically outside the door... had fresh crumpets w. honey-butter, ricotta & walnuts every morning! Also, there's "award-winning" clam chowder (serves a 4 chowder sampler... great oyster chowder & seafood bisque) and a "world famous" fresh macaroni & cheese shop... heaven! The other exemplary feature... staff is outstanding... 5 star service. Standard rooms are small-ish, but our 5th flr "city view" actually had views of both city & ocean... nice! My personal draw... faux balcony windows open completely and the 5th flr also has a large, rooftop, lounging deck w. beautiful views. Non-smoking hotel... but smoking ok on rooftop or hotel's front door courtyard. Contemporary decor could use a slight freshen and it's not cheap... crowd skews older. Depending on your budget & taste, highly recommend!

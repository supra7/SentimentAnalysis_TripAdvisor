We stayed for one night after we requested a 4 star on Hotwire, the hotel was perfect for us and we would stay again. Front desk personnel were great, there were two couples in line waiting to check-in and the Express check-in person helped us so we wouldn't have to wait. Also let us change our room to a great view of Puget Sound.

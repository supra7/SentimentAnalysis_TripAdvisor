Had an extended weekend getaway to Seattle this past weekend. Stayed at Edgewater due to location and price. Slightly nervous due to varying reviews of this hotel. Long story short, we had a great time as we went with reasonable expectations. Staff: Friendly staff and easy to work with. Rooms: Small rooms, but recently remodeled and nice decor. We upgraded and got a waterview room. Absolutely worth it as the other side faces frequent trains and subsequently very loud. The fireplace was great and definitely used after a cold/dreary day of sightseeing. Location: Nice location. 10 minute walk to Pike Place market. Safe to walk around the hotel. Restaurant: Excellent decor and view. Food was excellent. Sunday brunch was an excellent value. Would definitely go again.

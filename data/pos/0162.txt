My colleague and I stayed in two separate rooms at the Monaco, and even though we both reserved Monaco Queen rooms, hers--on the 3rd floor--was cramped and got a fair amount of street noise, while mine--on the 10th floor, a VIP floor--was very spacious and peaceful, with a nice view. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, with excellent amenities. Front desk, bell, and housekeeping staff were all courteous and helpful, although the person checking me in forgot to tell me about hotel amenities like the evening wine reception and Kimpton InTouch amenities like free wi-fi. We had breakfast each morning at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac, because our room rates included continental breakfast. The food was quite good but service was slow most mornings. The hotel is reasonably close to both the Convention Center, where our conference was held, and Pike Place Market, where we liked to go in our spare time. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. The rooms were not remarkable, but the gracious service was definitely above the norm.

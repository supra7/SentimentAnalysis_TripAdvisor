I stayed at the Andra on a business trips in May, June and Aug; it's my favourite place to stay in Seattle. The location downtown is perfect for business but its really that staff that make me come back. Every time Ive stayed there I really feel they are going out of their way to help and welcome me. The last time I checked in there I had just entered my room when I heard footsteps running towards my door. I opened it to find an out-of-breath member of staff who was running because he hoped to place a complimentary bottle of water and some sweets in my room before I reached it. I was very touched. The restaurant Lola is a great place to dine and have breakfast. I highly recommend their pancakes and their granola . When I have ordered breakfast into my room the staff have been very cheery  just what I wanted first thing in the morning. The rooms themselves are well-appointed, with plenty of space and great beds (twice this year I have stepped off a 9 hour flight and slept straight through the night in those lovely beds!). The theme of the hotel is loosely Scandinavian which, for the large part works well. The only thing I would change is the digital frames in the lifts and lobby that show picturesque images of Scandinavia  a bit tacky and whats wrong with Washington I say! But otherwise, the Scandinavian design is well executed  especially in the lobby. The bathrooms arent huge but theres enough room and they are well designed. Ive certainly seen worse in Seattle. Overall I love the Andra. Well-located, well-designed and well-appointed with above average service. Next time I'm in Seattle I'll be back.

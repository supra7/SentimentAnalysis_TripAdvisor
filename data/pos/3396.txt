A centrally located well kept updated hotel in one of Seattle's older buildings. We were interested in the hotel because of the Northern Neighbour rate, which I couldn't book on the website, instead I phoned and they said the rate doesn't exist. We went with the parking package rate which seemed like a good deal, except when we arrived the room that went with the package was teeny, overlooking the lower rooftop and alley. We upgraded (by spending another $30 per night) to a suite on the 10th floor (top floor) overlooking Seattle streets which was lovely and worth it for a two night stay. Enjoyed the food at Lola's which was conveniently located off the lobby (one of the Tom Douglas Seattle restaurants) Also really enjoyed Dahlia, located across the street (again one of the Tom Douglas Seattle restaurants). The hotel is a block away from the shopping and othe downtown sites.

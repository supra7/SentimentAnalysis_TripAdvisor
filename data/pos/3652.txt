We were returning from a cruise and had a day in Rome to see what we could... we wanted a place away from the mobs at Trevi Fountain, the Vatican, and the Colosseum. So, I booked this charming htel which is a residential area with a school. The rooms were nice and modern. A few tips: The key needs to be turned chip-side up to open the door. Then, insert the key in the slot on thewall next to the door once you are inside. You cannot turn on lights until then. The phones had no buttons for the front desk and "0" did not work either. The staff was helpful. They ordered a taxi for us the night before and sure enough, a Mercedes was waiting at exactly 8 after we finished breakfast. The breakfast area is nice and the hotel is very clean. The decor is nice and they even allowed 12 noon check-in for us., The staff was nice and helpful to us. The Metro was only a 5-7 minute walk. If you are wanting to go to the center of Rome, then take the Metro train from the Bologna station and go in the direction of Laurentina. Five stops into the ride is the Coloseo stop. The Coloseum is actually right outside the train station as you exit there. You can walk to the Trevi Fountain, the Palantine, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon ...all from there. There is a GREAT ice cream place just to the left of the Pantheon exit on the corner called NICE ICE. The chocolate ice cream is awesome and NON-DAIRY. No milk. All chocolate. It was awesome. This place has won an international competition fr ice cream. The breakfast starts at 7 am in the hotel. It is a good one. There is a breakfast room and a rooftop open seating area. Go up and take advantage of the rooftop if you can. The lift is small so dont expect more than three people at a time.

My husband and I were a bit worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but we were happy with our stay. Yes, the room was very small, but the furnishings were more original and better quality than I expected, especially considering the low price. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We stayed with our dog, a large greyhound, and a number of features made the place convenient: good potty spot across the street, a living room type area just above the lobby. We were able to take turns popping into the Seattle's Best coffee shop next to the lobby to get our coffee/breakfast sandwiches and relax in the living area with hotel-provided newspapers, breakfast, and a relaxed doggy on the floor. There wasn't enough room in our hotel room to spread out like this, and without the nice living room area, we would have had to take the dog out to car so that we could go eat. The self-park is very convenient for people want to keep their dog in the car while they go out to eat, etc. Some places only offer valet parking, which can be inconvenient if you are using your car as a dog kennel. It's nice, safe, clean, friendly, and cheap. I like the Monaco Hotel across the street, but at a hundred dollars less a night, the Executive Hotel is a better deal. Oh, one odd thing: the counter/shelf was about 1/4 inch too low... the toilet seat hit it when in the lifted position. Inconvenient for a man to have to hold it up the whole time. Bring a piece of tape... haha. No other problems with the bathroom though. We stayed on the 4th of July, by the way.

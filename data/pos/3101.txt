The newly renovated Seattle Sheraton is in an excellant downtown location and highly recommended for those travelling without a car who want to be close to what downtown Seattle has to offer. It is within easy walking distance to great shopping, nightlife, the monorail to Seattle Centre, theatres, galleries, Pike Place Market and many many restaurant options. Being Seattle there is also at least one coffee shop per block. Our room was a decent size, clean and our check in was easy despite the hotel being very busy over Easter/Spring Break weekend. The bathroomwas not quite as nice as many Sheraton's we have stayed in before, perhaps we were not in a newly renovated room, i.e.older tub and tile and they did not have robes as advertised, but these are petty concerns really. Overall it was a great stay for a resonable $160 CAN per night. They have free wi-fi in the lobby and user pay wi-fi in your room for $9.99 Parking is paid additionally as well. Overall because of the great location we were able to quickly fit in many auxillary activities such as Pike Place and Music Experience while travelling to Seattle for an pre-planned event. I would stay here again just for this reason. We had a great meal at Boom Noodle - 12th and Pike! Check it out.

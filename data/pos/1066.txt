Our 4 night stay at the Inn at the Market was great. We loved the location and after walking all over downtown concluded that we liked this location better than the other hotels. Just outside the hotel there were so many dining options ranging from inexpensive to very nice places. The hotel rooms were nice. We stayed in 410 which was billed as a "city view" room but it had a partial water and mountain view (see photos) which was bonus. The room was quiet and we never heard our neighbors during our stay. We booked directly through the hotel and they were having a March special so our room was at a decent rate. Housekeeping service was good. We kept trying to use the complimentary town car but it was only free one of the five times we asked for it. But, the one time was great since it was rainy and we didn't feel like the long walk to the Seattle Center. The front desk was very helpful in when we had questions and they even looked up movie times when we called when we were out and about the town. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again over other downtown hotels based on the proximity to dining places and the sites of the city. We did not have a car and didn't feel like we needed one while staying here to see the sites of the downtown area.

We were very pleased with the Hotel Andra, which is downtown in the Belltown area. We had a spacious, well-decorated room. The hotel staff was pleasant and extremely helpful. Hotel is half dozen blocks from Pike Place market, Seattle Art Museum. Hotel offered free business center services(computer with internet access and printer). The attached restuarant, Lola, served breakfast (and lunch and dinner, which we did not try), and seems to be open late. Hotel is not very large; its has an intimate feel.

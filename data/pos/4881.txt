My wife and I stayed here for two nights, just being tourists and enjoying downtown Seattle. From the time we checked in to the time we left, we felt well cared for. We signed up for their loyalty program to get the free wi-fi, and reserved through their website. We immediately got an email offer for a reduced fee room upgrade, depending on availability. We ended up with a great room for just a little more money, well worth it! Room service was very good, and quick! Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant was truly pleasant and helpful, like they were really glad we were there. We will certainly stay here again.

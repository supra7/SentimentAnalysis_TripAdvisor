Travelled here from Vancouver for an overnight stay. the hotel is situated right next to Pine Street which is right at te junction with Pike Street and it's fantastic market. The hotel is a boutique style with an open courtyard to the front. On entering you are met with nice fire and seating area. The staff are young an very attentive and knowledgable. Something that seems to be consistant with Seattle but here they were over and above. We were met with cookies that had just come out of the oven which was a nice touch. The room was fantastic, very nice furniture, well stocked coffee/mini bar area and great media. Big 42 inch flat screen with good movie selection and alarm / speaker with iPhone connectivitivy. Free wi fi as well. We asked for recommendations for dinner and were given three options. We tried an Italian called The Red Door - amazing. the hotel is a short walk (10 mins) to the old town which I would also recommend for its cool independent shops. A great city, a great hotel.

We were taking a cruise, and eliminated the stress and hustle of getting to the cruise terminal by staying at the edgewater! We simply walked next door, literally! No kidding, you can walk from the hotel to the terminal! The hotel has a look and feel of an "inn" or lodge which added to the pleasure of our trip. Service was great and the restaurant was also good. We walked to the monorail, the market, coffee shops, restaurants, and had amazing views of Seattle!

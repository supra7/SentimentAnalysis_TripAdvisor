We stayed here Sat, Feb 6, 2010, and made a wonderful choice. The Mayflower is on the national register of historic hotels. It was had a delightful, helpful staff who gave me the impression that they truely enjoy working at this hotel. The hotel is located a block from Nordstron's flagship store and across the street from Macy's. The icing on the cake is the fact that it's 2 1/2 blocks from Nordstrom's Rack! We enjoyed the hotel's morning breakfast and their restaurant-made sausage. We told the waiter how GREAT it was and he offered to give us the recipe. The place was clean and we both felt safe in this area of downtown Seattle. We'll be back. Thank you manager Paul Ishii and staff--this is a grand place

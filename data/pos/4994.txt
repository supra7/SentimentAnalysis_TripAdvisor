The hotel upgraded me from an inexpensive queen size room to a premier king with a corner view. Roomy, clean, and a terrific bed. The wine tasting at 5 was great - you got to see the other people in the hotel and share a taste of several wines. The location is right by the stores and Pike Place Market.

Stayed in the Warwick right before Christmas and couldn't be happier. The location and value was excellent. The hotel is located a few blocks away from public transportation, so getting there from the airport was a breeze! The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. They also have a nice lounge downstairs that is comfy and a fun little bar with a happy hour. Everyone was so nice, opening the doors for us as we entered and exited the hotel. Our view was great! We looked out over the city with the Space Needle in the distance. I would def stay here again if I travel back to Seattle.

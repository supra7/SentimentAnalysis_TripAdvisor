The hotel has a great European feel. Bed was great! The hotel bar and restaurant (breakfast) were very nice as well! Some will feel the bathrooms are a bit small, but I found them to be just fine. Staff was very helpful. The only issue I had can be siad of all the hotels in downtown Seatlle - it can feel a bit unsafe on some streets if you come home late. The Andre was a great stay!

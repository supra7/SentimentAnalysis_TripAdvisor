We stayed in a water front room with a balcony on the 3rd floor. The view was wonderful! We absolutely loved sitting outside in the evenings!! The boats were beautiful to watch, the sound of the seagulls flying all around was so perfect, and the cruise ships that arrived two mornings, were amazing to see so close! You can not get this anywhere else! The room was small BUT very clean and comfortable! The staff was wonderful as well! We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant and looking out on the bay. It was a great way to start our day! This hotel was an important part of our relaxation and overall excellent vacation experience! We would highly recommend it for couples and will stay here again if we venture back to Seattle in the future.

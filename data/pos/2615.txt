We were easily able to check in with a cash deposit ($100) instead of a credit card and for $20 above the lowest rate we were offered we were booked into a jacuzzi suite. Their check in time is 3pm, earlier than most Seattle hotels. The in room jetted tubs at Quality Inn are far superior to the single person bath tubs with weak jets found in most hotels. It's basically like a small hot tub and it isn't in the bathroom, it's across from the bed. Ours had chocolates and roses on it when we walked in, but a man immediately showed up and took them as they were apparently not intended for our room. The continental breakfast is pretty decent, with the waffles you make yourself and various hot food options. The pool is large, very heavily chlorinated and insanely popular with small children. You also have to walk through it occasionally to get to the lobby, which is odd. They let us check out at 3pm and returned our entire deposit... they even held our luggage for a few hours with no issues. Overall, excellent value and by far the best jacuzzi tubs in the city. They also have this huge suite that takes up a whole floor, is pretty reasonably priced and great for parties. The neighborhood is not one where you want to walk around too much, but it's okay once you're a few blocks away.

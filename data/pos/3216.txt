This hotel is only three blocks from where the Seattle natives hide their varios froms of public transport - the light rail, the Monorail and the underground buses. The previous time we visited Seattle, we walked miles because we didn't know that many of the buses run in tunnels under the city and we wondered why we couldn't find one to take us to the underground tour nor to Pike Place Markets. We walked miles then and rode in comfort this time - thanks to the free map handed to us on check-in. Yes, there is some traffic noise (even on the fifth floor) but that's a small price to pay for the location.

We had a comfortable mini-suite, including a full kitchen, for much less than we would expect to pay for a location within walking distance of the Seattle Center. Two nice grocery stores were within a block. The staff was extremely helpful, assisting us in arranging a day trip to Mt. Rainier and a city tour. The breakfast (included) was not the best--stale pastries in a crowded room--and the on-premises parking was pricey ($20 a day). But these are small complaints for a really charming place.

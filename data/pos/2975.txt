We checked in for a long weekend in Seattle and were immediately upgraded to a delux king, which was a nice surprise. The room was large and very comfortable with all of the ammenities. The bed was amazing! Slept great both nights, which I don't always do in a hotel. The staff was very helpful and the food in the Lobby Lounge was surprisingly good. In fact the cheeseburger I had was exceptional! Granted, food and drinks are spendy but this is a downtown hotel so to be expected. The location is great for anyone wanting to see all the sights in Seattle. Close to the Pike Place Market, shopping and great dining. Parking is really pricey.. in fact $38 a day. Other than that, however, a really nice experience!

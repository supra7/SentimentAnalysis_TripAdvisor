We are a group of five women traveling together. The hotel staff was very helpful, and helped us with anything we asked. They stored luggage before and after our stay.The restaurant within the hotel was excellent! We enjoyed the Wine from 5-6 each afternoon. The rooms are attractive, and the beds are wonderful! We would recommend it to anyone. Jesse Peterson, the Concierge, was wonderful.

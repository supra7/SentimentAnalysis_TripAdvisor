Upon arriving with my adult daughter we were offered a double queen room with 2 bathrooms! At no extra charge, how could we resist! This hotel was beautiful, clean, great location, nice staff and we had a wonderful view of the Space Needle. Being our first time in Seattle all these amenities added up to a wonderful mother/daughter trip away. We went to see a program at Cornish where a friend of ours was performing. Cornish, shopping at Pikes Market, restaurants, transportation were all within walking distance for a 60 and 26 yr. old. The staff at Oliver's were so nice the afternoon we stopped in for a glass of wine and a bite to eat. It was a very charming bar with views of people walking on the streets of Seattle. I will always seek out the Mayflower when I return to Seattle.

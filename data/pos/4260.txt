We chose this hotel as we could use our SPG points and it looked as though the location would meet our needs- it did! It was just as any other Westin with the Heavenly Beds- but they are still worth a mention as they deliver. The check in wasn't that friendly, they didn't acknolwedge my husband or even make general enquiries as to how our flight/journey was, all that said it was efficient and we were given a great room. The concierge desk had a variety of people over the 4 nights we stayed there- only one was really good in going the extra mile with recommendations. The bar/lounge service on the whole was ok but it really was dependant on who served you, the food though was perfect for snacking and the clam chowder was to die for - full of clams with some potato (rather than the other way around) and always piping hot. Calamris fritte was great as was the steak. The location was the best of all, we walked all over down town - everything was close enough. We were smitten with Seattle and will definitely go back if we are traveling that wasy again

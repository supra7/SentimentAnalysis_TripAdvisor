Stayed at this hotel before and after a cruise. The room booked by the travel agent was basic but on our return we booked extra days directly with the hotel and were given a fantastic room with a view of the Space Needle at a good budget price. Would definitely stay there again. Staff were very helpful. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Free tea and coffee 24 hours a day. Great location.

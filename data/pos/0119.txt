My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel from Aug. 27 through Aug. 31, 2011. We asked for a room that did not accomodate pets, and were given a spacious accomodation on the 11th floor. We were able to take the express elevator. The restaurant was great-we had booked a room with a continental breakfast (croissant, juice and coffee) but were able to get cereal, french toast, eggs etc. for an additional fee. The exercise room and Internet were free of charge. I asked for cups of hot water in the evening and they brought it up to our room within 15 minutes. The front desk staff was very helpful. Four newspapers were available in the lobby for free: The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The New York Times, and a Seattle newspaper. The location was great. It was close to the waterfront, Pike's Market and shopping. We were able to walk to a nearby hotel to get the bus to Mt. Ranier.

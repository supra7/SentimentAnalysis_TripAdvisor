This hotel has the most amazing bed and bedding I've ever experienced, it's just perfection! It's a nice thing that they have a product by product guide in the room regarding the bedding, I think I want to buy the entire collection. Was in town for work while on a three-month national-wide tour and this was my favorite hotel of them all. Again, the bedding was divine but the service and food also contributed to my great stay. My traveling group had many special needs and all were accommodated precisely and with a smile. We also took advantage of their complimentary car service which was so easy to use and driver extremely knowledgable about the city. This hotel is a real treat, highly recommend!

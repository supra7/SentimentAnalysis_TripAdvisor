My fiance and I stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. He wasn't sure that I had found a "deal" and teased me all the way from Portland that I had found a dump. I have used trip advisor for work though, and most the reviews were good, so I went with it. We are young, and even if it was a total flop, it would have been a good experience. When we got to the hotel, the clerk, was quite the expert on the local night life, and gave us a map that he marked with all the local bars and walking distance. We had a great night on the town, and were able to leave our car next door since we had checked in around 7pm the night before ($15.00 for a full 24 hours!)this allowed us to venture out to Pikes Market, and walk down to Pioneer Square after check out. The area is not Posh by anymeans, and neither is the hotel, but it is a bargain, with some unexpected charm, such as marble stairs, red wood doors, clawfoot bath tubs, and thin, but decoratively folded towels. But if poor lighting can be seen as romantic "mood lighting" and you like a clean tub to bathe in with a bottle of wine and enjoy a lively night life without having to seem pretentious to fit in, then this is the place. For a poor young couple trying to pay for a wedding, and a newer car, this is the kind of place we can afford to go to every few months!

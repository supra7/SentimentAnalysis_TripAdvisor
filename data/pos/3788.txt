We've stayed there twice through different promotions. The first time we were upgraded to a water view, the second time they called it a city view but was of the parking lot, however even with that, the rooms are nice, and on the weekends they have a great band that plays and it's a great bar scene, even for us older people, we had tea and great dessert at the bar and watched all the action, having breakfast at the restaurant was also very nice, highly recommend this place, a bit pricey if you are paying full price, look for the deals.

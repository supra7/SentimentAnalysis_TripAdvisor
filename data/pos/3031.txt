I have stayed at this hotel probably about ten times and even though its not the trendiest, not the fanciest, they deliver a consistant good product. I cannot recall a bad stay in this hotel. This trip we did opt for the parlor room (the living room area of a suite), which was very large, with the caveat of having a sofa bed. This came with free high speed internet, lounge access, and free local calls. It definitely helped having the perks, however I'm not sure I'd do it again when travelling with the significant other. (The ladies find the sofa bed a little uncomfortable, I'm fine with it.) All-in-all, another great stay at a great hotel.

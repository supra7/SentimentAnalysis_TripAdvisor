The room was comfortable enough with 2 full beds on the 15th floor and had a nice view. We were offered a room on a higher floor with one queen (which wouldn't work) or a king with a hide-a-bed. We chose the full beds which were small but we are little people. The mattresses were soft and comfortable. The room was small but worked for our needs. Be careful with littler kids as there is a minibar with snacks and drinks within their reach. There is no fridge or microwave in the room. Just call the desk and they will send up one free of charge. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. The free wi-fi is painfully slow. It may just have been because it was a particularly busy weekend, but dial-up would have been faster. They charge for wi-fi in your room which may have been faster but we weren't willing to pay to find out. The card keys are easily demagnetized. I had to have them reset everyday we were there. Don't use the parking garage that they offer for $39/night. There is a parking garage that is in the 2000 block of 5th Ave that offers parking at $22/night. It is connected via a sky bridge to the hotel. The hotel is centrally located to most everything in downtown. The staff was accomodating. Overall, it was a good stay.

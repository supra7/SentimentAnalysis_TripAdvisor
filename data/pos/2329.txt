Walking distance to the airport Me and my wife spent one night at Sea-Tac Radisson at the beginning of June 2005. There was a shuttle to the airport, but it take as much time to get there by foot, just exit the airport and go right. After couple minutes you will see the hotel. We had a front side room. From time to time you could hear planes at the tarmac, but it was more quiet after 10 PM. Room was clean and nice. Free internet connection, breakfast was not free. I will recommend this hotel as a good one. AAA rate was acceptable.

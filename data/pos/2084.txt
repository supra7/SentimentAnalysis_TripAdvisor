As a single young woman traveling alone, I was a little wary as to what the hotel/surrounding area would be like. But the Moore Hotel felt safe and in a great location for the price I paid. The only time I really felt scared is when I arrived at 3am due to a delayed flight. and had to walk a couple blocks to the motel from the bus stop. (I know, not the best situation for any area of any big city) No one gave me problems, but just be aware that it might not feel completely safe walking in the area alone late at night. The motel is just a short walk from the Pike Place Market and bus routes to other places. I even walked to the Space Needle from the hotel, but it is was quite a long walk. I was most impressed with the housekeeping staff! They deep cleaned my room between the nights of my stay. They also have origami washclothes/towels every day. I chose to share a bathroom ("European style") to keep things cheaper. The bathrooms were clean, but other hotel guests frequently had left their towels laying around and a hair or two in the tub. That didn't bother me, but it may bother some people. If you showered first in the morning, you'd have a completely clean shared bathroom.

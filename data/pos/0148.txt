We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 4 nights while exploring downtown Seattle and the tourist attractions before taking a cruise. We love the fun, quirky extras that Kimptons provide...My daughters really got a kick out of our goldfish, Dave. :-) The staff were all very helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere was lovely. The location, in the financial district, may not have been ideal for a family vacation, but everything we wanted to do was within walking distance or easily accessible by public transportation. The in-hotel restaurant caters more to an adult, hip crowd, rather than being family-friendly, but there are plenty of choices in downtown Seattle, and not enough time to enjoy them all! Wi-fi is available for free for Kimpton In Touch members- free to join, and a daily newspaper and coupon for the mini-bar were included, too. Kimpton seems to really make an effort to cater to all types of travelers- business, family, singles....the effort is appreciated and we'll stay with them again.

This hotel was much better than expected. After seeing bad reviews i was quite surprised. The staff was very helpful. The food in the morning was better than expected. The neighborhood is a typical for a city this size. It is about a three block walk to the space needle. Never had a problem getting a parking spot, stayed for a week. The only problem was that the room was not very big.

A great hotel for a tiny price! Rooms were large and comfortable (a little cold but with a heater that could be switched on). The free breakfast was v. good with lots of choice. The hotel is outside downtown but only two blocks from the monorail that will take you to Westlake Centre in 3 mins (and it's great fun to ride!!!). Sound travels strangely in the hotel - I was in an end room and had noise from the room below through the wall. The person staying in the room next door to me had no noise. Would go back as such good value.

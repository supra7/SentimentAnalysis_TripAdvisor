Wonderful hotel. We checked in on a Thursday night, I reserved a waterfront room. They immediately upgraded us to the Beatles Suite, which was unbelievable. Amazing room literally over the water (water runs underneath your room). Great view of the cruise ships coming in and out of port. The hotel has an Alaskan cabin feel to it. My wife and I both loved it and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Seattle.

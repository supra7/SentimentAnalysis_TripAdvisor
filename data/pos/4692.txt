Great location, great view from every room. I can say it because I was first on the south tower and then on the north one. It is noisy, but a good pair of ear plugs can help. From my room on the south tower I could see 3 wonderful sunsets with a nice view of the Space Needle. The reception manager apologised with me for my moving sending me a box of Godiva chocolate and two small bottles of Grand Marnier and Baileys. The room was clean, large and comfortable. Nice bed, nice table and couch, nice tv set. The double shower was ok. The swimming pool is small, but nice. The Jacuzzi is hot, but relaxing.

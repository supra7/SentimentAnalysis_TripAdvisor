If you are looking for a great place to stay in Seattle -- this is the place. It has everything you want in location, friendliness, warmth, cleaniness and helpful personnel. If you can't get a room with a harbor view that's o.k. The 5th floor deck provides a perfect spot to watch beautiful sunsets and all the harbor action. NIce lounge chairs are available for napping or reading. The famous Pike's Place Market is literally two minutes walk and the original Starbucks is only one block a way. Good restautrants are everywhere. We went to Elliots for seafood -- it was excellent.

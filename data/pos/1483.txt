The Marqueen is a lovely hotel in a great area of Seattle. Room 111 is huge, with a little sitting room and a roomy kitchen. Was a bit concerned as there is not an elevator in the hotel but it seems to only have two floors and ours was on the 1st so there was no problem. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Being Seattle, there is a great indy coffee shop connected to the hotel, which is a a real bonus!

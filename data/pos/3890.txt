To celebrate our 20th Anniversary on May 5th, we decided to change up our regular warm beach vacation spots and try the cooler area of the Northwest, specifically Seattle. For a warm weather person such as myself it was much to cold and rainy at that time of year for me. My husband found it refreshing. The Edgewater Hotel was recommended by a close friend as a historical and unique hotel because it is literally on the water, a hotel built on a barge on the water. We got a bay view room, which was very quaint, rustic tree branch furniture, red & green plaids and a really cute little fireplace that came on with the flip of a switch. The room was not large but adequate. What I call cozy. At night the view was great with all the lights, during daylight hours you get to see the shipping yard and the boats coming in empty and going out loaded. For us very interesting. My concern with the room was our balcony. Being on the water it is exposed to elements that eat way at the metal and wood. Our balcony was not safe. The handrail came away from the structure, many of the floor boards were rotted and spongy when stepped on. We would not lean against the railing for fear falling through. We did mention it to the front desk and got a smile. We chose to walk or ride the bus. We ate crabcakes at Elliotts, which were great. We walked up and down restaurant row repeatedly and had wonderful seafood at each place. Pike's Market was fun, but so crowded. We did the eating tour and it was worth the time and money. Rode the bus to the end of it's circut and got to see good views of the city from the hilltop as well as neighborhoods and different shops. We did the train station and went to the Space Needle, way overpriced for a ride to the top. It was a different and interesting trip. Not one I would want to do again, but am good with trying it out.

Have stayed at the Andra a few times now and can't say enough positive about this hotel. The staff is helpful & attentive, the location is fabulous (Belltown between downtown, Capitol Hill & Queen Anne), close to wonderful places to eat (Lola, Serious Pie, Wild Ginger, Top Pot Doughnuts) & a number if tourist sites (Pike's Market, Pioneer Square, etc.)

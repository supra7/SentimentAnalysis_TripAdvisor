After staying here several years ago, I was pleased to see the interior had received a good refurbishment. The lobby is very small so can feel rather chaotic, but the reception staff friendly, free newspapers and coffee in the lobby. The pool was out of action, but only because the areas was being repainted. Close to the Seattle Center and the monorail, or a reasonable walk into downtown. Breakfast was good compared to other Travelodges, including waffle machines. No bath in our room (shower only), but everything worked, was clean and a good bed. Also with in-room coffee and a fridge. Parking costs extra, but then Seattle isn't very car friendly. Not a cheap stay, but good value compared to other motels at this time of year.

I stayed at the Westin Seattle for 3 nights in early September 2008. The hotel is very nice, which has been my experience with Westin hotels elsewhere. I stayed on the 10th floor of the South Tower. At that level there is really no view other than buildings. The higher floors probably had better views, or as I discovered when I reserved the room, you can pay extra for a room with a better view. No complaints about the room, the "heavenly bed" is everything it is billed to be. I was a bit disappointed that there was no robe provided in my room. I had always had one before when staying at a Westin. The location is great. It is right downtown, about a block from the monorail, a block from the trolley and about 6 blocks from the Pikes Place market. I ordered room service one night, which was extremely overpriced. In that area there are many restaurant and I should have planned ahead and ordered take out from somewhere else. I did not use the pool or hot tub although I went and looked at them. They seemed small for the size of the hotel, but very nice and clean. The workout room was also small. The service was very good, with the exception of a somewhat rude front desk manager when I checked in. You should also be aware that this entire hotel is non-smoking. Smokers have to take it outside. Overall, I would stay there again if I ever was to visit Seattle again.

All in all, a fantastic stay in Seattle, minutes from both the touristy markets, and in the other direction, where the locals hang. My husband and I had never been to Seattle and after reading reviews on TripAdvisor, we settled on the Moore Hotel, and we are so very glad we did. We arrived at 10 am, well before check-in, but the front desk was able to hold our luggage in a secure, locked room, until our room was ready. Our hotel room was great, room 731. We had what the front desk described as a "Malkovich door", from "Being John Malkovich", a small-ish 3/4-sized regular door. The room was immaculate and had a decent view, but the floor to almost ceiling windows were fantastic. The location was great, right next to the Moore Theater, where Aziz Ansari was performing that night (we had already seen him perform in Minneapolis), and only blocks away from the Pike Place Markets. The front desk staff was very friendly and gave some good recommendations for lunch, and was very courteous. The hotel was connected to the Starlite Lounge, a very cool rat-pack era low-key dive bar that had really cheap strong drinks! We also happened to see Aziz Ansari after he was done performing at the bar, which did add to the whole experience.

From the minute we arrived, we felt pampered and appreciated. the valet was very nice and the desk clerk was too. The view from the lobby was gorgeous but the room was even better. We splurged for a waterview king room - we were traveling with our 12 year old daughter so we had to have a rollaway. We were concerned that the room would be cramped with the extra bed but it wasn't! Each room comes with a stuffed bear and a rubber duck - our duck was a boy but the front desk clerk changed him out for a girl duck. Our daughter was treated well even though the hotel seemed more for adults. We returned the favor by buying both the bear and duck (I'm sure that is their plan!) We had plenty of room and a really cool view of the water and the Seahawks stadium. We were right down the hall from the Beatles Suite. We kept our windows open when we were in the room and enjoyed the view and sounds of the Bay. We missed seeing the cruise ships by just a few hours. The walk along the Bay and to the Market was very nice. It was a little far to walk to the conference center - the hotel encourages the use of their shuttle service on their website and at the front desk. The shuttle driver would then recommend a taxi every time I asked him.

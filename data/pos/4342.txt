We live in Seattle and chose the Westin for a "staycation" anniversary weekend. It had been a few years since we spent the night and with new condos built up around the Westin, it is definitely worth the splurge for the highest floors to ensure unobstructed views of the water. There was a convention that weekend and a very large amount of cruise ship passengers but we didn't feel as if that compromised our stay. Our room was quiet and private, the front desk staff graciously provided us with a very late check-out time, and surprised us with Champagne and Strawberries. The pool was nice but wouldn't go into the foamy hot tub filled with kids. The central location of the Westin and amazing views (splurge for the highest floors!) makes it one of the best hotels in Seattle.

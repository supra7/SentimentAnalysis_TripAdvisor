We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room. Although the view wasn't fancy the rooms were clean, modern and the staff were friendly. There was a restaurant downstairs that was nice enough if you didn't feel like going out. With the price we paid I expected a dingy room with staff that didn't care and not the best cleaning -- this really exceeded my expectations. The location was great (just across the road from the Westin) and it was close enough to both the space needle and the shops downtown. The markets were a little walk, nothing difficult though and even in the rain it wasn't a problem. They had a nice little room downstairs where you could use the internet and printer. The combination of clenliness, friendly staff and great location made this a stand out bargain for me. I would def stay here again.... unless I won the lotto and decided to upgrade!

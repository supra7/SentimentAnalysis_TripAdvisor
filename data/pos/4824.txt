We discovered this gem 3 years ago when visiting my husband's family in Seattle and now stay here twice a year. It's nostalgia for him since he's a UofW graduate. The staff is so friendly and helpful, rooms are very nice with the most comfortable beds and lots of pillows. We love having the fridge, microwave and coffee pot in the room and having a window that opens is a real bonus. Breakfast area could be larger and our last visit we had to wait a long time for the staff to bring out more waffle batter. Also, we try to be "green" and follow their suggestion of hanging our towels on the rack to be reused..and they still replace them every day, which is a real waste. We'll be back in November!

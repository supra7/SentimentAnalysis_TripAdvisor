This is not some tricked out fancy hotel with a thousand pillows on the bed and a spa tub. It is however a comfortable, simple, even plain hotel with a charming small restaurant on the first floor. The rooms are average size. There is a TV. There is no air conditioning, but I got a fan and managed to keep the room very comfortable. This is probably the only real drawback in the summer. There was plenty of room in bathroom, but it lacked counter space. But, the dressing area next to it had a shelf. My room had an OK view out toward the sound. I loved waking up to the sound of seagulls. The location is terrific. It is just a couple of blocks to the heart of downtown Seattle. I could easily walk to everything. There are 3-4 restaurants/bakeries in the adjacent block. I found FREE parking every night during my stay. The hotel has FREE Internet.

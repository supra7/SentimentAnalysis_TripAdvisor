There's not much more I can add to the other reviews, other than to say that our stay was equally satisfying. I used to live in Seattle so I didn't need travel help from the staff, but they were always pleasant over the phone and in person. I love the location because I could walk to Pike Place each morning and watch them set up the market. It's also great to be able to walk to Bell Town restaurants and the Space Needle. The room was funky and the hotel is a bit cavernous. We had a claw foot tub with a shower - the hot water was so weak that I never added cold when I took a shower - but it was just warm enough to be comfortable. We were serenaded awake each morning by seagulls - something that would not be as much of a problem if we'd had the window closed. But overall, it's a good place to stay and I would definitely stay at the Moore again.

This hotel offers the best location in the city. A short walk to Pike's market, across the street form the monorail and the best view of the space needle with your bed facing floor to celing glass windows framing the famous needle!!! Our conceirge was the best. His recommendations for restaurants were superb right down to the dishes he ate in them the week before.

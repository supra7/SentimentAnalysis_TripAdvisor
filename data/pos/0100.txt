I stayed two nights at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle. My room was spacious, very nicely appointed, everything was working perfectly, and it was incredibly comfortable for working in-room or just sitting and reading. The hotel itself is lovely and they have coffee in the morning and wine in the afternoons, so there's always a feeling that you're welcome and they're happy to see you. Had room service both days, and they accepted small modifications I requested to the standard menu without batting an eye. Desk service and concierge service was great and very helpful. This is a great hotel for the business traveler - makes it easy to work and to relax. I'll definitely stay here again.

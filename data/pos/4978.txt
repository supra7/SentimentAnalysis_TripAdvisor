The hotel was a nice quaint hotel. Free wine tasting in lobby was nice touch but very crowded and little space to linger about. Room was very small and bed was on the hard side. We bid through priceline so maybe the smallest rooms go to priceline customers first. I would say that for the money it was a good deal for Downtown Seattle.

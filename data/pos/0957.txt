This hotel is a gem. I experienced top notch service from all employees from the front desk, bell hop, and valet. The hotel is quiet, clean, comfortable and very well kept. I'm not sure how old the hotel is, but everything seems relatively new. When I checked in, many hours late due to multiple flight delays, I was happily surprised with an unrequested room upgrade. The room was very spacious and mine had a small kitchenette area with sink and refrigerator. The bathroom has excellent toiletries and is clean and bright. Free in room internet. Also, free computer room if you need to print out your boarding pass or if you don't have a computer to use the internet. Wonderful bed. One of the firm, but squishy mattresses that form to your body. Located right across the street from Pike Place Market and many retail shops, restaurants, coffee shops all in the blocks surrounding the hotel. Overall, this is a hotel that understands the little things count and strives to provide superior customer service. I strongly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again myself!

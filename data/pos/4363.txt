I have stayed at this property numerous times and would say that they have a pretty good record of providing a solid service experience. Since I stay here often, I get upgrades when available as a Platinum Starwood Guest. I have had some standard rooms here where I have not liked the size but for the most part, the furniture, beds, and bathrooms are above average in style and comfort. There are no other frills though or anything that stands out so a good property for business travel. It wouldn't be my first choice for a luxury hotel or for personal vacation/travel.

We stayed there on a 3-day-city-trip to Seattle. Generally speaking, the motel itself exceeded my expectations. For a motel in this price class it was exceptionally clean, comfortable and well-equipped. Furthermore, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful in a way I rarely have seen before. Great experience! The guys at the front des can supply you with the best local information. The motel is comfortably close to downtown, which is great for sightseeing. However, this makes it also a bit noisy. They also have a wifi-hotspot, but beware: the signal strength at the 5th floor is horrible. In that case you should go to the lobby or the free business center. The only VERY negative thing: it seemed to be kind of a party motel. We experienced an extremely high noise level during the nights until 5 am every night. Partying room neighbors, drunk people in and outside the hotel. I slept maybe 2 hours each night!

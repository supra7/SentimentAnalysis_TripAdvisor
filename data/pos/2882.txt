Stayed at this hotel in August. Our stay here was very nice. We were upgraded to a very nice room on one of the top floors. We had an ocean view room. We normally stay at the westin when we travel to seattle but decided to stay here and check it out. It turned out to be better than the Westin. The only downside is that the pool was in the other tower and we had to go through the lobby in our swim clothes to get to the other tower. There may be a better way to get to the pool but we couldnt find it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.

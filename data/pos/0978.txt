This was a nicely decorated and well kept inn! The room was comfortable, especially the bed. We really loved the rooftop terrace. It was a great place to relax as we overlooked the market and the bay! The location of the inn was it's best feature! Right at Pikes Market! (Although we thought that the market wasn't as nice as we expected!) We didn't venture out after dark, though, as there seemed to be lots of sketchy characters around!! During the day we enjoyed walking everywhere, from the market to the downtown shopping areas! We enjoyed all the choices of food alongside the market...especially Beechers cheese store's macaroni and cheese!!!!!! Try It!!!! It's WONDERFUL!! In all it was a great place to stay!

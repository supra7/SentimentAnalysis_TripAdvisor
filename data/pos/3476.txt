We selected this hotel for the reviews and location near Pike Place. To our surprise, everything about Hotel Andra exceeded our expectations. The hotel staff from bell services to afternoon tea service was extremely personable, helpful, attentive, professional and friendly. The interior of both the lobby and hotel room looked fantastic for an older building remodeled to currently styles. Both the bed and the sofa bed were comfortable. Our only complaint was how our room was located at the end of the hallway near the room service elevator. We did hear a lot of hotel service foot traffic just outside our door. Would definitely stay again as there is more shopping and eating to do in Seattle.

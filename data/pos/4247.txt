Its obvious this hotel was luxurious many years ago and although nothing is worn it does look a bit dated, but almost in a retro way. It is however very clean, very spacious, and very comforting. Gosh that bed is nice. The giant duvet, fluffy pillows and soft mattress, wow. The check in lobby is very nice, there is a lot of activity going on and staff are very friendly. The location is great too, walk to Pike Market and the best shopping is right at the door step. We didnt have a very good view. These two 40 storey towers which I assume would have views out to the sea and beyond. So it is probably worth paying the upgrade to get the view. The harbour is very pretty.

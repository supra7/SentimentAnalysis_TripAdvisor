This hotel is no looker. It is a beautiful old historic hotel with a european style and feel. The staff were helpful, and nice. the location to everything, was perfect. we ended up coming back and staying one more night before flying out the following evening, got a suite and it is roomie, with three rooms,one bath with some toilet issues, and not enough plugs to charge computer, phone, and camera. we would use this hotel again, because of the location alone, and the cost for it. a great deal.

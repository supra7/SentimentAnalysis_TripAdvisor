My friend and I stayed at Hotel Andra for one night while visting Seattle for the first time and felt right at home. Front Desk staff were down to earth while showing their professional side as well...actually treated me as a person and not another "check in". Erin and Samantha were rad. We were upgraded into a suite on the 5th floor that had a seperate sleeping room as well as a well apointed bathroom. The bath products were refreshing. One of the best parts of the trip was eating breakfast at their restaurant Lola. The menu was diverse and staff as friendly as the hotel's. Try the Eggs Benedict it will change your lfie. The only downside is that wireless internet is a $10 fee, but, really it's not that big of a deal. Overall I will be recommending this hotel to friends and be back soon.

We visited Seattle for a week in July and stayed at this wonderful hotel overlooking Pike's Market. Our spaciouis room was on the top floor with a partial water view that was stunning. The roof top garden is the place to relax above the bustle of the city. I highly reccomend this property. The city is very noisy at night, so close your windows and turn on the fan and you will sleep well! Be sure and get over to Hurricane Ridge, and kayak on Lake Union. Ladies, Nordstrom's basement store is a 5 min walk from the hotel!

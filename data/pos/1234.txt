We were on the 33rd floor of this beautiful hotel from where we had a great view. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were pleasant and very helpful. The buffet breakfast was great value however the downside was that your dirty cutlery was left on your table for re-use. Fresh cutlery was given only on demand. It was an easy walk from the hotel to the centre of Seattle and local attractions. Transfers can be arranged from the hotel.

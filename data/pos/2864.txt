Great hotel. Everything we expected and the location was perfect. Lots of shops nearby and well within walking distance to Pike Market. Would defintely stay there again. Found the bell staff and front desk staff to be very helpful. Also very close to the Westlake train station which goes to the airport for $2.50.

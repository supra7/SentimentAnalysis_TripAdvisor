I needed to be close to UW and found this place to be very clean, gracious front desk, and most importantly to me, quiet. The parking is convenient and you are within walking distance to Trader Joes. The clientele seemed older, as evidenced by people hanging around the pool and lobby. I would go back here if I had to. They only little thing I would change is adding a sheer drape as you only have the blackout shades.

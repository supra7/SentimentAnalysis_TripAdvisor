Were were going to Towson Md for a church service, so we opted to stay outside of the city in White Marsh. We were so impressed with the Hilton Garden Inn. The lobby is beautiful. The check in was easy and the personnel were very friendly. The room was gorgeous! Plenty of room with comfy beds, fresh linens, wonderful decor. It was very comfortable. We did not hear a sound while we were there, and this was on a weekend at that. The pool was small, but we did not swim anyway. I enjoyed the excercise room and I could have went to the Bally fitness center that was just behind the hotel if I wanted to, but I was ok with the equipment the hotel provided. Also, for ten dollars you can eat in their restaurant, which I recommend. The food is made to order; pancakes, omelettes, bacon, sausage, biscuits, fresh fruit, even fruit filled pancakes. My teenagers loved it. We will stay here everytime we return to Baltimore.

Location. Location. Quiant hotel in a VERY nice location right on the water. Water side rooms are really the best reason to come here. Staff was friendly enough. Elevators speedy and prompt. The reception area was great and comfy with large windows looking out to the water. Room was kinda tacky- but I'm not a "lodge" style person. Old mini bar and dated chairs. TV unit wouldn't stay open for the evening news. Bathroom was beautiful stone work and chrome. Beds were comfy. Weird - our window on the 2nd floor opened. More weird - no screen. This was not a child friendly area. Paper thin walls - we were up at 1 am, 2 am and 3 am when neighbors came back to their rooms. Views out City side - Train Tracks with on going train traffic all day - and ALL night!

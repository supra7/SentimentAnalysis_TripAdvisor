Booked Sheraton for one night through hotwire as I extended my stay in Seattle and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights. Really nice hotel. For the price I paid I wasn't expecting a nice room, but the one I was allocated on the 12th floor I was very pleased with. Very comfortable bed, lovely furnishings, really large wardrobe, nice ammenties. Location is great...there is a cheesecake factory right near the hotel, and although I didn't get time to drink there - the lobby bar looked really inviting. I'd definitely stay here again.

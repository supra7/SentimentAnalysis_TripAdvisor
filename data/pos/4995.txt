Stayed one night, for the Picasso exhibit. Location couldn't be better. Service was friendly and efficient. Brought along our border collie, and she thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. They provided ceramic dog bowls (we forgot ours) and there was a big jar of high-quality dog treats at the entrance. We were able to leave the dog at the hotel when we went to the exhibit and out for dinner. It was nice to not feel like second-class citizens when travelling with a dog. The bed was ultra comfy and the room was spacious. We really enjoyed the (free) wine reception in the lobby, afternoon hot chocolate and morning coffee. Will definitely stay again when in Seattle. Unfortunately didnt get to try the restaurant but it is highly recommended by others who have stayed at the hotel. Couldnt be better for a weekend get-away.

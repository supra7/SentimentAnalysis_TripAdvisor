We recently stayed at the Mayflower for five days. It is wonderfully situated for somebody coming from the airport. The Sound Transit comes extremely close to their front door. It could hardly get any easier and efficient. The doorman are not only courteous but informative and friendly. The lobby is beautiful without being pretentious. We were aware that their rooms might be considered small so we requested the mini suite. The mini suite is economically priced and is very comfortable. It not only had a comfortable sized bathroom but also a separate vanity and wet bar area, a decent sized closet, a desk area, a comfortable sized living area with a nice sized television and a seperate bedroom with pocket doors. The bathroom is stocked with permanent full sized toiletries. The bed was wonderful to sleep in-not too hard and not too soft. There is also another television in the bedroom as well. At check in we were provided a coupon to their restaurant- use it! Our view of the city was wonderful!

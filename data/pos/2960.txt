I loved my stay at the Sheraton. The rooms are spacious and well updated. The bed is really comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. I traveled to Seattle on business and had a wonderful trip. The gym was one of the best around and has a fantastic view of the city. Great hotel and loceation.

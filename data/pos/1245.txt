I normally stay at Intercontinentals but sadly none in Seattle. So, I had an overnight at this hotel and was very pleased! Much better than the average CP's I have stayed at in the states. Location is good, sea-tac is convenient and area around the hotel is nice (but more hilly than I was expecting for some reason) Hotel is beautiful. The staff were friendly and a couple of people in particular seemed to go out of their way to help out. I am PC Platinum and was upgraded and it was very nice. Got in just in time for evening snacks and cocktails on the Club floor. My room was comfortable with a stunning view. Overall much better than I was expecting!

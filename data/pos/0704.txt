We were spending 1 night in Seattle before heading to Portland and chose this hotel for it's awesome location, to make the most of our short time in the city. This was our anniversary trip and the staff did everything to make our night memorable. The location really can't be beat, and we loved enjoying the sun & views from their outdoor terrace. Based on our travel experience, we found this hotel to be a great value for the location, luxurious accommodation & top notch staff! We would definitely stay here again on our next visit.

What a great Hotel. Staff was great. Doorman really fun and helpful. Reminiscent of the old classic hotels. The room had two double beds and two baths. Our room looked out at the Space Needle and had a window you could really open to hear the urban sounds of the city. Nice bar/restaurant in hotel but was not serving food after nine pm on weekdays but found out a PF Changs is only two storefronts away and open late. Will return again.

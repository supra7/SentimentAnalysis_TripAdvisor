The word charming when associated with a hotel often is a code word used to excuse a variety of ills. Not the case here! The property is historic and charming, as well as luxurious - without sacrifices. Everything was perfect! The location is ideal, the staff is great, the rooms are well-appointed, and there is a nice bar and a fantastic restaurant within the property that the locals regularly visit (hotel guests are captive audiences for an on-site bar or restaurant  if the locals go, that tells me something). Oh, and the in-room wireless is fast and free (my pet peeve is when a hotel gouges guests with high internet access fees)  great in-room coffee, too!

Got this hotel on hot-wire for Aug. 3-8. Stayed In two double beds with husband and two kids, ages 7-9. The location was perfect! Walking distance to Pike Place Market. $5 cab ride to Space Needle. The hotel itself is very clean and renovated. In the heart of shopping district. Family friendly restaurants close early (10 pm), very safe to walk to Cheesecake factory, Johnny Rockets, across the street. Would go back again.

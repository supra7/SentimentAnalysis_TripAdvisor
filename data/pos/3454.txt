Room: Suite Staying: Spouse w/ 3 year old Hotel Andra was a perfect stay for our downtown holiday shopping trip. It is two blocks away from Westlake Center and Macy's. The suite was great. The excellent view, room decor, furniture and amenities met our expectations. The service exceeded expectations, and are the reason we will definitely stay at the hotel again in the future. The evening room service was great: Upon our return from a night out, the room was serviced with adjusted lighting, soft music playing and the bed readied. Nice touch. It is refreshing to stay at a lifestyle hotel that is unique in character while retaining superior room decor, amenities and service. The complimentary NY Times was appreciated. I would have liked free wi-fi access in the suite. There is free wi-fi in the lobby, but the tethered internet connection was $10/night. No thanks.

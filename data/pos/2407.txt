We bid on priceline for 115 and this is what we got. I cannot say enough about our Seattle trip, we had a great time and the Ren. Hotel was no exception. There was only one down side to this hotel and that is a 36 dollar parking fee per night. However, thanks to tripadvisor, I was anticipating the cost and budgeted accordingly. The hotel istelf is beautiful. We stayed on the 20th floor and had a great view of the city. The very friendly man who checked us in was very kind to give us a free upgrade at check-in when he learned it was our 10th anniversary trip. We did not expect this, and did not tell him that to get anything. It honestly came up causually in small talk and he quickly found us a lovely corner room suite. The room was clean and comfortable, appointed nicely and updated with a sleek modern feel. The bed was high quaility matress (a little on the firm side) but comfortable. The linens were good too. The pool and excersize rooms were great with wonderful views of the city. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We fell in love with Seattle and the hotel really helped! This hotel is located within walking distance of Pike Place and 5th ave. A short drive or long walk to the Space Needle. Easy access to Hwy 5.

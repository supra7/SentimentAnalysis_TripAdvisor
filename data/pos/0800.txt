We stayed at the Inn for two nights in May 2011. We had booked a double room with water view and were pleased to be upgraded to a deluxe double with a huge patio shared with only one other room. The room and patio overlook the market and waterfront and it was wonderful just to sit and watch the ferries and people going by. The room was big and well appointed with a small kitchenette area. Our only slight disappointment was that there is no bar in the hotel so while there is a lovely 5th floor patio for all guests overlooking the waterfront, there is no bar to order a drink. You either bring your own or use the mini-bar. Apparently, this will be rectified once the restaurant, Campagne, is renovated, but it would make sense if they were to put a bar in the 5th floor where the seating is. Perhaps for the future. Otherwise, a brilliant stay!

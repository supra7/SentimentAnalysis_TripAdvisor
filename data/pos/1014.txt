This was my first stay at The Inn at the Market. The Inn seems to feel a bit more cozy then the big Hotel chains. I was pleasantly surprised by little touches that show this Inn cares if you return. We where there near Christmas they had Apple cider and cookies to welcome visitors. The proximity to the Market is awesome. Usually when I visit Seattle I can't bother to go down to the market because the traffic deters me. But to wake up and walk across the street was fabulous! Thanks to David Watkins he really takes pride in making sure visitors enjoy there stay.

My husband and I stayed at this property for a wedding for a friend. The hotel is wonderful! And is a GREAT location-very close to many attractions downtown Seattle. All were in walking distance. The staff was VERY friendly, and always spoke to us when we were coming and going. The free Starbucks coffee and nightly wine receptions were wonderful. When we asked about transportation back to the airport, they secured a town care for us that was less expensive than a taxi. The only negative I would have to say is that the housekeeping staff woke us up early everyday! The walls are really thin in the rooms. i could hear what my neighbors were saying. The beds were uncomfortable, and the rooms were slightly dated. The DM emailed me after my survey, and ssaid they are going to renovate soon. I would definitely stay here again in future trips to the area. I'm going to Chicago soon, and will definitely look at the Kimpton properties in the area! Overall it was a really nice place!

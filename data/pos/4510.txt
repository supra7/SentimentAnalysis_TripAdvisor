PROS: Convenient to public transportation Close to downtown sights Clean Courteous staff Classy atmosphere & crowd Starbucks coffee in room Nice bed CONS: Thin walls Non-HD TV programming, limited channels Functional but old, dingy showerhead Couldn't accommodate request for Space Needle view room ; ) A classy atmosphere greeted me as I walked into the lobby of the Westin Seattle. After a lifetime of staying at Best Westerns and Holiday Inns, this was a welcome change. I had asked to check in early and they gave me a room at 12:30pm. However, I was disappointed when I was told they couldn't give me a room with a view of the Space Needle. I think it's because I booked the room through Expedia. I was on the 36th floor by the elevators and the ice machine. One thing I really noticed was that the walls were very thin. I could hear people talking in the corridor, or doors closing. I remember being awakened by voices outside my room. I was also given a room with two queen beds. Although it's no biggie, I would've preferred just one king bed. I really liked the furnishings, though. The Starbucks coffee pods were a nice touch, too. The bed was really plush, although a bit too soft for me. But the pillows were heavenly! The room was clean, and I was glad to find out everything looked immaculate. No stains or tears on the carpet, no smokey odor. Everything looked tasteful. I didn't watch much TV because the reception was poor - not true HD, and the channels were limited. The Westin Seattle is perfect for a solo traveler like me who will be getting around town by foot or public transportation. From the airport, I boarded the light rail to the downtown station in Westlake Center Mall and walked less than ten minutes to the hotel. The monorail station is also close by if you're heading out to Seattle Center. Pike Place Market is a leisurely walk down the hill, about 4-5 blocks. I felt safe walking on my own. The luggage service staff was really courteous, too.

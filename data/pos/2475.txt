Came here for a conference, but wifey came with for leisure. This was our first time in that far west, much less Seattle, so we didn't know what to expect. We arrived and the hotel was nice!!! Check-in is was pleasant and smooth...and we even received wine and fruit in our room. (had the family/friends starwood elite treatment) Our room was on the 15th floor or something, it was for the preferred guests. And they know how to treat preferred guests!!! The preferred guest lounge was top shelf with free food and a free happy hour on certain days. I even met the manager of guest services at the happy hour reception who was very nice and hospitable. (forgot her name, but she was Black) My wife and I were so impressed with the preferred guest treatment, we felt like a king and queen. It was unfortunate though, that EVERY customer doesn't that same type of treatment. (people on the first 8 floors---the non-preferred "regular" guests) The stratification made us kinda sad, to see that certain guests were treated better than others. It was nice, but we wished everyone could have experienced what we did. We also ate in the restaurant lounge at the top of the hotel. (can't remember the name) But it was super top shelf with an AMAZING VIEW!!! Quite serene...Seattle has a great skyline. Although kinda small, the fitness center was modern and nice. The pool was nice too and had a chic feel to it. We even received free breakfast coupons, and the breakfast was superb. The service was a little shaky though, as they may have been understaffed. Great food though. Great location downtown; close enough to walk everywhere, but not too far from everything downtown. Overall this hotel really impressed us and gave us a really good percpetion and experience of Seattle. Everyone was so nice and professional. Please stay here!

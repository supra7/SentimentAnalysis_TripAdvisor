I was here for business (even though I work in this city) and stayed for three nights. The room was well appointed - King bed, 31 inch flat screen TV, desk, chair with ottoman, fridge, safe, and iron. My only complaints about the room (besides the wall hole that was patched but not painted) was the TV is analog (very grainy on certain stations) and the towels and bedding were somewhat scratchy. The bed itself was comfortable and the pillows were great. I didn't have to use wireless connectivity but they do charge $12.95 a day to use it. The restaurant on the second floor (Maxwell's) was very good. There is a bar on the 28th floor. The staff at the hotel are very quick to answer any questions and the hotel is pretty centrally located. It seemed a little overpriced but it's downtown to that is to be expected. Overall, I would recommend (I wouldn't tell anyone not to go there).

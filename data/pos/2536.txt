Christine, the concierge, gave us a wonderful welcome to Seattle, and we enjoyed an excellent buffet before heading out on a day of adventure in Seattle. The traffic is unbelievable (bad), and we were unable to find a plan for doing anything to improve it. Just brace yourself for it taking 2+ hours to go 5 miles.

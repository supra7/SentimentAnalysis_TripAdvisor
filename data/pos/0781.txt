We were delighted with our choice. Following Trip Adviser reviews paid off once again. The hotel is ideally located directly across from the market in the middle of a busy and interesting area. In spite of this, it's quiet and a haven of peace, particularly on a warm afternoon when a couple of hours sitting comfortably on the roof terrace is a great break from the hustle and bustle down below. Our 5th floor, water view rooms were spacious and clean. The beds were remarkably comfortable and the huge bathroom functional and well appointed. We weren't too fussed about the clingy shower curtain but this is a small niggle in proportion to everything else. Free wifi internet, complimentary daily newspapers and efficient reception/bellhops/housekeeping staff all contribute to making this a great place to stay. We'd recommend The Inn on the Market without question!

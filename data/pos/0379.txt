This hotel is a Kimpton, so the design is whimsical and the vibe is fun. The staff is young and casual, and I can see how this can be a problem when the hotel is busy, but during my stay they were friendly and helpful. My group reserved two rooms, and they gave us connecting rooms without a fuss. It was not a busy week. The rooms are a decent size, not huge but pretty average for a city hotel. The beds are nice and the bathrooms are clean and bright, though the pocket doors are less than ideal for a busy bathroom. The room design is bright and cheery, and there's a flat panel TV. The location can get a little noisy, but I was fine on the 5th floor. The location is convenient and walkable to attractions such as the new central library, SAM (the art museum), Benaroya Concert Hall, and Pike Place Market. Parking is steep at $29/night. The evening wine receptions were very popular.

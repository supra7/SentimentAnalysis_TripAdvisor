If you need a hotel with a kitchen and want something with a little elegance and history, then the MarQueen is for you. The staff was wonderful and sent us in the right direction for wonderful seafood (Anthony's) and made sure everything was just so. The location is great for walking almost everywhere (you might want a taxi to Chinatown, which in my opinion was not worth the trip if you've been to NY and San Fran.)

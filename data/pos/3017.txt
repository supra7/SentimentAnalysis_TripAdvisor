I have now stayed at this place several times and all I can say is that if you are used to staying in Sheratons, you will not be disappointed. This is on the nicer end of their spectrum and is comfortable and quite nice. The best feature is the location, which is right in downtown and near the Convention Center. Not my first choice in Seattle (I prefer the Westin a few blocks away) but a nice choice nonetheless.

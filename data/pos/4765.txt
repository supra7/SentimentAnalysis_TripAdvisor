Domus Ester is in the heart of historical Rome.When you arrive and see the facade you're shocked cause it really needs a makeover but then observing certain near buildings are all like that.When we went up a couple of stairways,it was another story.We were greeted by Ovidio,a very nice and helpful person and speaks quite good english.We checked in at 1.30 an the room was really clean,brillaint white linen and towels.The room was quite big,a desk,a television showing italian and english channels.Then there is a small refrigerator which was a God send cause Rome was so warm and we used to keep some things to find cool on our return.The room was fully airconditioned with no views.The bathroom was not big but a good size.The towels were changed everyday and being there for 8 days they even changed the linen.The breakfast was in the room from 7.30-10.00.and book any time you like.The breakfast was basic.A crossant,a big piece of bread,jam,nutella butter,orange juice and choose either tea or coffee.The staff are all very friendly and willing to help.There was Mary and the nice guy who does the night shifts cause the reception is always open.Hotel is in a very safe area and very good position for visiting Rome on foot.It's near Palazzo Farnese,Campo di Fiori and Piazza Navona.Despar supermarket just around the corner.Very quiet area,no tram sounds and no siren sounds cause in Rome very common!

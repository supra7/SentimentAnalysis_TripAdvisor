I actually stayed at the Ace 2 new years eve's ago, and live in Seattle. I've popped in on occasion to make sure they're still the same, as I always route friends and people visiting Seattle to the Ace. It's downtown, on a busy street (1st ave) and rooms on the interior have no view. But the rooms are funky modern, and if you get a room with 'shared bath', then they give you bath robes and it's just fun! You have to be OK with shared baths and a little noise (ask for a room facing the side street or back of the hotel). Otherwise, you are in the best neighborhood of seattle- accessible to seattle center, tons of great bars and restaurants (for casual try belltown pizza and cyclops- they'll surprise you with great food and very stiff drinks!, for a nicer meal out try Zoe, and for breakfast you MUST walk across the street to Macrina bakery for a morning glory or rocket muffin- all food places are within 5 blocks of the Ace Hotel), fish market/pike place, the waterfront, downtown shopping, etc. You are also only a couple blocks from the 'free ride zone' on the buses to get you anywhere you want to go downtown. If you want standard, this is not your place. If you want to experience seattle, and are willing to roll with the punches and want a little more adventure, Ace Hotel will fit you perfectly. And you cant beat the price for downtown seattle!!

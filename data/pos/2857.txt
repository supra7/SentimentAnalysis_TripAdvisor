The hotel is just next to the Washington State Convention center and is perfectly located. The rooms were reasonably comfortable and clean. The only disappointment is that even though they charged us for any packages they received on our behalf they neither delivered it to our room nor notified us that the package has arrived. We had to check with the concierge and collect the package from him after we tracked the package online.

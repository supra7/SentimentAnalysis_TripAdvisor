We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and enjoyed our time there. The staff were helpful and the rooms were clean. Breakfast was good, including make-your-own waffles and tea, coffee etc was available all day. There is a snack time in the afternoon provided free. The shuttle van was very useful but be aware you need to book it and it runs into Seattle on the hour, with pick-up back to the hotel half-past the hour until 9.30. A good hotel at a good price and we would stay there again.

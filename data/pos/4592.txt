I just have to say it - the Westin Seattle looks like two giant corn cobs jutting up into the Seattle skyline!!!! Not the prettiest place from the outside! However, the interior - from the reception area to the hallways to the rooms - is typically pleasant like most Westin properties. I stay at Starwood properties more than any other chain and this one is your typical, cookie cutter Westin (aside from the exterior!). In general, the place is well-maintained and the staff relatively professional. The rooms are a little on the small side, but for a downtown hotel in a major city, they are a good size. The Westin bed is amazing!!! Love them! One negative about the room was the smell - it was musty, almost like it used to be a smoking room and had not been properly aired out since it went non-smoking. I was not alone in this observation (I was in town for a major conference and had many colleagues/peers staying at the Westin). Great location - right in downtown, near some great restaurants (go to Dahlia!!!) but not exactly right in the middle of the madness, like the Grand Hyatt or Sheraton. Decent reception staff - accommodating, if not slightly bored-acting, which is odd considering the amount of time the keep you on hold when calling from your room; the housekeeping staff were very nice. All-in-all, a good stay here. For $200/night (which seems to be harder and harder to come by nowadays...), this property is fine.

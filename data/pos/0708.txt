The wife and I just got back from a trip to Washington. We began our journey in Seattle. We stayed at the Inn at Market. We absolutely loved this place. outside our room was the Public Market neon sign and a beautiful view of Puget Sound. The staff were so pleasant and helpful. The bed was very comfortable. The room was well laid out and gave you a at home kind of feel. This is where we will stay if and when we get back to Seattle.

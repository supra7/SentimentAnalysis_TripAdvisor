Booked on priceline. My polite requests for a king bed and an upper floor in the new tower were met. Room was new and very clean. This is a big hotel with a huge lobby and always lots of people around. Bed was good, but the family staying next door was commonly in the hall yelling and this was very easy to hear in our room. Location is perfect. We parked in the parkade across the street, as suggested by someone, which cost $17 for a Friday evening to Sunday morning stay. However, we were told that the rate at this parkade was changing and would be more in line with regular Seattle rates (e.g., $30+ per day).

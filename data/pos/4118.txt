We held our company meeting at The Sorrento. Their Sales and Catering Managers were pleasant, attentive and very helpful when I made the arrangements. The service - during our meetings, for meals and in the bar/restaurant was terrific. This hotel is modeled after a hotel in Sorrento, Italy - from the beautiful dark wooden paneling in the lobby, bar and restaurant to the furniture and fixtures in the room, they strive to take you to Italy, while staying in downtown Seattle. If you want modern, edgy or a cookie-cutter hotel, then go to a Marriott. But if you want cozy, comfortable and unique, then The Sorrento is your place. Rooms are unique but they are all well-appointed - GREAT beds, upscale amenities and robe and my favorite... a french press coffeemaker in each room complete with delicious coffee so that you can make yourself a cup of fresh coffee anytime you want!. While their wine list isn't the longest, the selections are quite good and reasonably priced. We had a delicious meal in the hotel restaurant one evening and took advantage of a very short taxi ride to a local restaurant in downtown Seattle the next evening. (There are numerous excellent restaurants within walking distance.) If we have our company meeting in Seattle again, we'll be back at The Sorrento.

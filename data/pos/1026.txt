Recently we celebrated our 38th wedding anniversary at Inn At The Market. We stayed two nights on our first visit and then returned for one night the following week after visiting British Columbia. Both stays at IATM were delightful and exceeded our expectations in every way. Our accommodations were beautiful and the location of the Inn is excellent for exploring the city. The terrace on the fifth floor is perfect for relaxing during the day or evening. From the moment we booked our reservations we could not have asked for a more professional, friendly, or helpful staff. Everyone on the IATM team went out of their way to insure that our time with them was indeed special. We are especially grateful to Mr. Watkins and Ms. Cervantes for their kindness and thoughtfulness. Our sincere thanks to all for helping make our 38th anniversary celebration a most memorable occasion. The IATM will always be our choice in Seattle!

This hotel is in a great loaction and in walking distance to everything. Even walked from Safeco to the Hotel...took a little while but it was a nice walk to see the city. The rooms are clean and quite roomy. Freindly staff and great views of the city. Starbucks minutes away and a grocery store across the street. Only thing id have to complain about is the price of parking...27 dollars for the night. But I would stay there again over any other hotel and would recommend it to others.

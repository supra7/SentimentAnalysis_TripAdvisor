My wife and I arrived at the Hotel Monaco about 2 hours before check-in and we were immediately greeted by the front desk clerk (Hayden) who checked us in early and with a smile. The rooms were very clean and being a pet friendly hotel did not smell at all of pets which was a nice surprise. The location of the hotel is perfect, we took the light link rail from the airport and were dropped off at University Street one block from the hotel. Very central to Pike's Place Market, the Aquarium, Symphony, shopping, eateries you name it. We walked everywhere and always found our way back to the Hotel Monaco where we were always greeted by the doorman. One thing stood out the most and made us a believer in Kimpton hotels and that is the service. After our first day of exploring we came back to a room that wasn't made up, we called down and asked if they could make up the room, as we walked down the hall a housekeeper was on her way to our room - excellent! We would run into after that and she was always in a good mood. Thanks Hotel Monaco for a memorable stay! The wine happy hour didn't hurt either.

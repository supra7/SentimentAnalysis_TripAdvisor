Booked this hotel through Victoria Clipper.com! Absolutely gorgeous room! Waterside room! Cruise ships only 10 feet away from room window! Fireplace was wonderful! Bathroom is nice, shower is a little different, as its an overhead shower, but we loved the room! Beds were cozy and so comfortable! Pike Place is 10 minute walk, loved it! Would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone! Courteous service, clean rooms, quiet, and a wonderful lobby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

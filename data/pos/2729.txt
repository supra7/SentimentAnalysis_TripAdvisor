I stay at this hotel whenever I can. I come to Seattle for work about 5-10 times a year and am always so bummed when it's sold out for a conference. It's like coming home. It's usually cheaper or the same price as the Westin Seattle, but it's so much better! It was completely redone a few years ago and you can tell. The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are very nice, and the work-out center is top-notch - it's on the top floor and overlooks the whole city. There is also an indoor pool and hot-tub up there as well. The people are so friendly who work the front desk and there is a restaurant and a small cafe to pick up lattes and bagels in the morning. it's also in a great location walkable to Nordstrom and the shopping mall as well as tons of great restaurants.

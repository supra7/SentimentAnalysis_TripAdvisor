We stayed here from August 30th to the 1st of September prior to our Alaska cruise on the Mercury. After reading previous reviews, we were all pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The rooms were great, we had a view of the city, my Mother's view was of the city and the Space Needle. Everyone loved the beds and the rooms. Only ate breakfast in the hotel, and that was very good. The location made it ideal to walk to Pikes market, do some last minute shopping and also back down to the Pier to see the ship come in on Friday morning. Walked out to dinner as well to the Assaggio Ristorante, which was recommended by the concierge, it was excellent. (Just a hint, instead of a Taxi from the airport we took a Limo for the 4 of us for $ 35.00. They are parked at the same spot as the Taxi's, the lines are shorter and it was a great way to begin our vacation.)

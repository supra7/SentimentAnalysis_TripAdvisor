Stayed one night on long drive home after attending a conference in DC. Last minute reservation made by my staff, in a place the name of which I dimly remembered seeing on the Interstate in many years of driving south from New England. Arrived late in evening but what a pleasant surprise, especially after having driven for miles through some areas that made us a little nervous (due to my errant GPS). It was a very nice looking Hilton Gardens (which I've stayed at many times before) but was definitely "nicer" than any so far. Staff was excellent, the check-in smooth. We were very tired after working hard for two days actually running a conference in DC, so it was a pleasant surprise to find ourselves in a very large room with desk, large bath, and very, very comfortable beds. Internet was fast and free, and the room came with two comfortable "living room" chairs. Enjoyed a good breakfast with made-to-order omelets by a perky chef and a very pleasant and helpful waitress. In the day we could see how nice the area was and we spent some time in a well stocked bookstore in the shopping malls there. Easy access to I-95 we now discovered. (my GPS definitely needs remedial lessons). This is about 10 minutes outside Baltimore and so lots to do. We visited Fort McHenry for the first time, but that's another story.

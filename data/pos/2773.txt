Stayed here for one night with my wife for about half the normal rate thanks to name your own price on price line. Location is unbeatable. Blocks from Pike Place and all theshopping one could ever want. Rooms, bathrooms, and hotel are very nice. We were very pleased with the hotel for the rate that we paid, though at full price I probably would not have been quite as pleased. Parking is pretty expensive. We paid $43 for the night, almost half the rate of the room.

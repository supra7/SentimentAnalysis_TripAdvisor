I had stayed at the hotel a few years ago when I was in Seattle for a conference at the nearby conference center. This past weekend my wife and daughter stayed there after a long day of driving and attendance at the memorial for a family member. We were up early and away to get in some time at Pike Place Market nearby before getting back in the car. When we arrived home, my daughter thought she had left a Very Important action figure behind in the room. I sent off a quick email and received a prompt response and follow-up. Luckily we discovered Ironman concealed in some laundry at home. I was impressed by the swift personal response. I ill definitely stay here again on business or personal time when in Seattle in future.

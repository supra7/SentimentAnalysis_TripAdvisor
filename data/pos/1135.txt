My boyfriend and I made a trip up to Seattle from Portland to check out the Deck the Halls Concert. I wanted to stay somewhere that wasn't a typical hotel, which is what I got with the Ace. I first wanted to book at this hotel because of the one in Portland, which I heard was stylish, unique, and the place to stay for twentysomethings. Second, upon seeing the website and learning that you shared a bathroom with the other guests if you have a standard room, I was in (because hey, I wanted a different hotel experience). Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night. At the same time, what can I expect when the hotel is located in a prime location and right alongside the main street? All in all, if you like a different hotel experience that somewhat resembles a dorm, then give the Ace a shot.

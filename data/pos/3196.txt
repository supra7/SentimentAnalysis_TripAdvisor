Stayed in Seattle from July 21-23. The Sheraton is at a great location. Shopping and restaurants everywhere. Rooms were ok. Definitely an older hotel, but well kept. Even though Sheraton said it was renovated in 2002, looks like just the bathroom counter and floor was updated. Tub and tile walls look older. Only 1 or 2 elevators were working. All and all, a nice hotel.

We stayed in Hotel Monaco in Seattle after getting off of the Alaska cruise in early June. I had done extensive research on the downtown Seattle hotels before the trip. We wanted one that's near the attractions we could walk to, nice and clean rooms, friendly service, with a good price. I had several choices and decided on Hotel Monaco based on the reviews I read on this web site. It seemed to get consistent positive reviews. Well, we were not disappointed! In fact, we were very happy about our choice!! We had requested an early check-in since we disembarked in the morning. The rooms weren't ready yet, but the front desk girls who were very friendly and plesant told us she will call my cell phone when the rooms are ready. They happily stored away our luggages so we could go explore the town. They also showed us on the map how to get to certain places. A friend traveling with us was a librarian and the Seattle Central library was on her list of must-see. Image the plesant surprise when she found out the library was just across the street from the hotel! A couple of hours later, they called us to let us know our rooms were ready. I can't say enough about the front desk girls' plesant and courteous attitude - it just made us feel very welcome. The rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. And they were spacious!! This was important as we had tons of luggage from our week-long cruise. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I liked the little gift shop that's at the end of the hotel. The next morning, we were plesantly surprised by the complementary Starbucks coffee, ice coffee, and banana cakes. Those cakes were so good!! They went perfect well with the coffee. Hmm... Wish I had some of them now... Overall, we were very pleased with our stay in Hotel Monaco. I could tell the hotel was making every effort to make sure the guests were welcome and comfortable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in downtown Seattle.

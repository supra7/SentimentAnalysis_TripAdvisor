A colleague and I stayed at the Hilton Seattle for 7 nights while attending a conference down the street at the Sheraton. I hestitated to choose the Hilton after reading the reviews on this site, but our experience was so good that it has prompted me to write a review for the first time. The staff could not have been more helpful, starting with the warm greeting at the reception desk. We were both upgraded to executive floors, and found the rooms to be clean, ample and comfortable. The full complimentary breakfast was one of the best I have found in any U.S. hotel: a full buffet, with the option to order an omelet as well, and the serving staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. I would certainly stay at the Hilton again.

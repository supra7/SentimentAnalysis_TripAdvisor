I recently spent three days at the Sorrento in Seattle and all I can say is WOW. Amazing staff, great vibe with a beautiful lounge and fireplace, and fantastic rooms. As someone who travels a ton, I would highly, highly recommend the Sorrento to anyone visiting Seattle. This is one of my favorite places I've stayed in quite some time, and any time I come to Seattle in the future this is the ONLY place I will stay! Why can't every hotel be like this one?

We live on the Kitsap Peninsula across from Seattle and stay there often. Having driven by this hotel for 30 years, we decided it was time to stay here. It is absolutely gorgeous!! I had booked a King room and they upgraded us to a suite, it was very nice and comfortable. The beds and Italian linens (Filidoro) were to die for!! The only problem was that the room was cold and we could not find any evidence of heat. This is a very old hotel, so it was really not surprising to us and we were only staying one night, so we didn't worry about it. We dined in the extravagant lounge with a fabulous circular couch & piano player. It was romantic! Had a great breakfast in the Hunt Club restaurant in the morning (cold again, my husband offered to go to the room and get my coat, I almost took him up on it) I would like to point out that I generally run hot and enjoy places to be cool, but this was just a bit too much. The only other negative is that it is not located downtown Seattle, but just across the freeway, so you can't walk to everything. We knew that, so it was no problem, but if someone was coming to Seattle on vacation and planned on walking to all the sights, it would be a problem. Anyway, beautiful hotel and restaurant!!

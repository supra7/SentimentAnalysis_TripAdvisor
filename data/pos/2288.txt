This is a fine place to stay in downtown Seattle. The room and bathroom were quite small but very functional. Things were a bit worn but still clean. Its an older building so the tub drained a little slow but the there were enough towels and it had a window that opened to let in fresh air. The bed was comfortable and the staff were friendly enough. Little touches like fresh apples in the lobby and wireless Internet for guests was appreciated. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel room you might find it a bit cramped but if you're looking for a clean and safe place to sleep when you are out exploring the city, it is great. It is not a fancy hotel but then you are not paying those prices either.

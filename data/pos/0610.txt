We were coming to the end of our trip and it was nice to be welcomed by the lovely staff at the Inn. The hotel was in a great spot for pike markets and was a close walk to the centre of town with all the shopping. All the staff were fantastic. We didnt realise that most tourist activities didnt run in winter however Katie went out of her way to help us try and find a tour to the boeing factory for my partner who really wanted to go there. We were fortunate to be able to change our rooms after the first night to a water view room and the view was stunning. It was so nice to watch the sun set over the water. Huge Bathroom which was very clean. The one small down side was the area of the hotel and not with the hotel itself which I have marked down the location below. As tourists we walked everywhere, returning home from town at night was a little bit daunting sometimes as there were quite a few people that hang around pike and pine street in groups. Sometimes I didnt feel 100% safe and had to catch cabs however everything is super closed so cabs were ver cheap.

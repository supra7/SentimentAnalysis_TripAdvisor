Moore hotel was good for the money. Room was big, bathroom was spacious with cute towel-animals. Walk-in-closet was nice suprise. wifi didn't really work anywhere else except next to the base station and at the lobby. Rooms are quiet, clean, spacious and beds are comfy and location works. And thats what you pay for when coming to Moore. Those needing extra might not be happy..

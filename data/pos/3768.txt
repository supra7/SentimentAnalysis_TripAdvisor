After reading some of the comments for this hotel I was a little concerned. More so with the train noise as our room faced directly to the tracks. The room was very sound proof. There was some train noise but not enough to effect your sleep. The room was very clean and loved the decor. We took there limo service to the airport and upon checking thru security at the airport we realized my wife left here wallet in the limo. We called the hotel and the driver did find it and they where so good as to send the driver back out to the airport with it. This is service above and beyond. Would highly recommend the Edgewater.

The beginning of a six-night trip to the Northwest began at the MarQueen Hotel in Seattle (600 Queen Ann Avenue North, Seattle 98109  1.800.614.1750). I picked this hotel because it was close to a restaurant across the street that I wanted to try -Toulouse Petit Kitchen & Lounge - and it had great ratings on the Trip Advisor. The price was excellent. The night before departure I googled the street view of the hotel and was filled with apprehension. It looked like a run-down neighborhood, no tall buildings and generally pretty iffy. But, it was too late to cancel and it was just for one night On arrival I discovered that I was totally wrong in my first internet impressions! The hotel was an apartment house converted into hotel suites. With three floors (no elevator) and a grand double stairway, it felt like an intimate European hotel. The staff was very gracious and gave us a room on the third floor overlooking the street. Our room was actually a suite with a bedroom, a sitting room with sofa and chair, an entry hall, full kitchen and several closets. The bathroom was large and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable. The floors were hardwood with rugs and tile in the kitchen and bath. It was comfortable, clean, cozy and inviting. We unpacked and asked the front desk clerk about the restaurant across the street and got information about the history of the building and the neighborhood. I recommend this hotel highly. Its not Mariott or Hyatt or Doubletree, its different and fun and interesting which is the whole idea in travel and having new experiences. And our dinner at Toulouse Petite was amazing!!!

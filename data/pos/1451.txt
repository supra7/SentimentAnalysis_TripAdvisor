My wife and I stayed here for a few days last summer while we were on vacation. It's located about seven blocks (up some very steep hills) from the water front. It's perhaps about 3/4 of a mile from downtown and located in a quiet neighborhood. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to downtown and its price. When you walk in the lobby is nice, staff are friendly. It turned out a number of rooms were available and the woman at the front desk talked us through which room we'd like based on the view. The room was really large. There was even a "changing area" adjacent to the bathroom. The room had a fantastic view of downtown Seattle and the waterfront. The Hotel is attached to a hospital that bears the same name. Many of the people staying there were clearly there for medical reasons. It's for that reason why I would slightly hesitate to recommend the hotel to leisure travelers. Having said that, it's really nice inside, and you'd never know it was attached to a hospital if you didn't see the signs directing you to where the hospital is.

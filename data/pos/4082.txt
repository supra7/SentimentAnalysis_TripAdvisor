The service was great right from the moment we pulled up in the car with the valet service to the front desk. Our room was not ready so Trevor at the front desk gave us ideas for things to do in downtown Seattle. He circled places on a map they provide for you. We were upgraded to a nicer room on the top floor where we had our own balcony on the roof.The room was big with about 4 windows to let lots of light in. There were no black out blinds just sheer curtains so the light came in the room early in the morning. That was the only down side. As mentioned before by other people we liked how the carpet was changed in the elevator every day to reflect the day of the week. We also ate at the restaurant which was very good service and food. Although we were there at 7:00 pm and they were already out of prime rib.We would definetly stay there again on our next visit to Seattle.

We flew into Seatlle a day ahead of our scheduled Alaskan Cruise and were booked at the Westin by Princess Cruise Lines. Check in was courteous and quick. Our room was very clean and comfortable with a nice view on the 10th floor. We were with two other couples and the hotel put us all together on the same floor, rooms together. The beds are wonderful. My only complalint would be that there are no soda vending machines on the floors. We had breakfast the next morning at the hotel. Very good breakfast but our server could have been a bit more courteous. He acted very agravated when we asked for anything after the initial serving. One of the women found a long black hair under her pancake and asked for another plate of food. he bought another plate but acted very rude and offered no compensation. The bar is great and the barkeepers are also great. Very courteous. Overall, I would stay here again. It is very convenient for walkling to the waterfront.

The location to most of the downtown touristy spots was great. Easy walk to Pike Place. The hotel was decorated very nicely and the room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom amenities were top notch and the robes were a nice touch. The concierge (not Art) was not helpful when we inquired about local Seattle restaurants and the next day, when he still had not responded to us, he saw us in the lobby and quickly walked the other way to avoid us. The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The goldfish pet for the weekend was fun to have, and we had a goldfish couple. The hotel did send up a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne our first day which was unexpected and very thoughtful. Huge drawback was the noise from 4th street. We were on the 10th floor and the sound of the street, especially the buses, was incredible. The windows don't open so it would be smart of them to just invest in some double-paned windows. Walk just two blocks to McCormicks Bar and Grille (of McCormicks & Schmicks) and they have an amazing happy hour with $1.95 appetizers (after 10 pm). It's and incredible deal for high-end steak house food.

The Inn at Market is in a prime location, my husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon! We sat at our table and delighted in watching the city life outside our window as well as a spectacular view of the ocean!! We walked to the Public market and had breakfast with the best view in town and not to mention fantastic eggs with smoked salmon!!! You can walk to so many places yet feel cocooned in the great little secluded nook the hotel sits in. Wonderful service, yummy chocolates left every night, even brought us up a dictionary for one of our scrabble games, talk about service!! Wonderful stay.

I travel to Seattle regularly; I'm familiar with the downtown hotels. At $85.00 is a great deal! Thier rack rate varies crazy from $141 to $400+ for a standard room??? Property is large and recently updated. Public areas are classic/modern and spotless; but not very interesting... Vales, bellman and front desk were allways professional and welcoming. Rooms are larger than the norm with simple wooden furniture and a blan, beige color pallet. Again not very interesting, boring... Everything worked in the room. Bathroom was roomy with good lighting and lots of hot water. Maid service could of been better. Carpet vacuuming or wiping down the tub/bathroom floor was never done and it really needed it... Amazing Core Fitness center and pool on top floor and it's free to use! Room service was expensive, not tasty and late being delivered. Sundry/gift shop is the most expensive I've ever seen! Person staffing it was creepy and not helpful... I would totally recommend the Sheraton as a good, solid business class hotel. Families and vacationers would find it boring; they'er better options...

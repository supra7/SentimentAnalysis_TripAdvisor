This place is fantastic, yes it's pricey but you are within walking distance of everything you need for your stay. Fine food, the aquarium, shopping, the public market, the Grey Line Bus Tours, the trolley, the city buses, the underground, the monorail and the ferry system. Between 8 am and 7 pm the buses are free if you stay withing the downtown area. Pioneer Square is 9 blocks away. Our room was HUGE (get got the room with two double beds) we had a sink, microwave and refrigerator. Ask for a room above the third floor, we were on the 6th floor and had a spectacular view of Elliot Bay, on the Stewart side of the hotel. The roof top terrace is to die for, we spent about half of our trip just watching the busy habor activities. The staff was fantastic, we will definitely stay there again. We loved this hotel and Seattle. Make sure you ask about the Pike Street Hill Climb and using the elevators in the parking garages to get down to the wharf area easily, this is a must for people with strollers, wheelchairs, the elderly etc.

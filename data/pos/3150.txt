I stayed in this hotel as part of a tour that included 6 other hotel down to the coast of California. I enjoyed this hotel the most. It has a great location for tourists. It is close to the market place and many other attractions. I found the front desk staff very accommodating (thanks, Christopher) and the rest of the hotel staff very friendly. I loved the beds--very comfortable. Breakfast was included as part of our tour and I enjoyed it very much. Everything that I would want was included in the buffet and the fruit was very fresh. (hi to Morgan--wait staff). The hotel was also very bright and clean looking with fresh flowers in the lobby area. If you go to Seattle, try to make a short side trip out to the Boeing Aircraft factory. All of us loved this tour. We found that the people in Seattle, as well as in Portland, were always very willing to help out tourists with directions and suggestions.

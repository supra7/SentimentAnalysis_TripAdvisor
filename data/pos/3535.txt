My partner and I stayed at your hotel this past November and we had an amazing time from the minute we arrived to the time we checked out. Your service stellar, great location, lovely room, comfey bed, nice decor The food at Lola amazing... best eggs Benedict we have ever eaten and the Chick Pea fries melt in your mouth. We have recommend your establishment to many since our stay and hope to return sometime in the future

What a great hotel! Rooms have a retro/homely feel to them. Really friendly staff, great location. I have stayed in some great hotels in America and this is up there with its all round performance. Good location, good friendly staff and safe (Seattle can seem a bit unsafe at times depedning where you go). Lola the greek restaurant beside it has some gorgeous food as does Palace Kitchen (Tom Douglas food!!)

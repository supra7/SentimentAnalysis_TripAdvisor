We spent 8 nights at the Andra as we were in Seattle for a conference and a break. We asked for a suite on the quiet side of the hotel which we got along with the requested non-allergenic bedding. The service was generally very good although occasionally the front desk could get busy. The suite was well appointed but there would be little privacy if you had a member of your party using the sofa bed. There is a small office center where you can use 2 PCs with internet connection and printers. No charge for this. You can walk easily to all the downtown attractions as well as Pike Market.

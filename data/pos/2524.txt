We had 2 nights at theRennaisance and were totally happy.The jail comment in a previous review is very strange and totally unwarrented. What jail? A very nice and safe area. The room was very nice with the bed being one of the best ever. I was a little nervous about the hotel being at the top of the hill but it wasn't as bad as expected. It is so near great restaurants and shopping. The walk down to water is easy. The walk back up is tough but we took cabs if we were down by the water. The hotel staff were very friendly and always said hello in elevators and around the hotel. The concierge staff helped us greatly and were very nice. Of course it is not a 4/5 star hotel but we had a 5 star experience overall and would return anytime.

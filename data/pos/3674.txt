I moved to the Seattle area end of 2011, staying for a couple of months w/a friend 80 Miles away, round trip. Thus there were evenings when I did not feel like driving back, so asked for a room at the last minute. Since I spend an average of 2-3 times a week at the Inn, the Staff went ABOVE AND BEYOND, to accomodate me, giving me a Water front room, newly re-modeled, w/fireplace, balcony, Large Flat screen TV, and an absolutely beautiful, modern and Very Cool bathroom! I love this place, the staff is superlative, Management is MOST accomodating. The views are aweson from the bar, lounge, dining room, and Water front rooms. Some City side have views of theSpace needle. While there is the trains across the way, they Never bothered me, (I love trains) and on the Water side you do NOT hear them. Hotel provides each room w/ear plugs for sensitive sleepers. Location is super convenient, w/free shuttle to DT Shopping areas, etc., Parking IS espensive, however, that is pretty much the story for most of downtown Seattle. I would Deffinitely reccomend this fine Hotel to anyone. (Food is great too)!

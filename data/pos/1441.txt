We stayed here for 2 nights. When we arrived, there were hairs on the bathroom floor, which we complained about; they were cleaned up. There were also toenail clippings by the night table on one side of the bed; they might have been hard to reach with a vacuum since they were close to the night table, but should have been taken care of. The first morning, the maid walked in without knocking at 7:45 am. She then closed the door and left without even apologizing. We complained to the front desk, and they were responsive, but said that the maids have been specifically told not to do that, so they were frustrated with the maid. When I complained, I noticed a list of other complaints already made that day--and it was only 8:30 am. We also received a wake up call, which we had not requested. (I noticed on the list that someone else, who HAD requested one, had NOT received it.) While the location of this hotel is very convenient, I would not recommend it based on the above. Also, if you have difficulty walking up hills, this is not the place for you, since it stands at the top of a very steep hill (and you do not need to go up this hill to see Seattle attractions).

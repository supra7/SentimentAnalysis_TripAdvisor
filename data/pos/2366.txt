My experience at the hotel I would describe as average and not a 4 star rating that priceline might suggest, thus I was slightly disappointed. Overall the hotel property is okay and for being in downtown Seattle the price I paid on priceline was a bargain $115/night. The inhouse workout room and nice treadmills and a full set of dumbells, however the other workout machines needed repair, gym was small. Pool had stong smell of chlorinates. *Internet should have been free, for $13/night, it was s-l-o-w. *Parking was tight and expensive $30night for self park (however compared to parking elsewhere this is probably standard fee. *access to I-5 was convenient *Maxwells restuarant had nice breakfast buffet, 3 newspapers to pick from and a very friendly staff. *Overall staff was very helpful, friendly and actually seemed to enjoy their work. Rooms were clean and diligent housekeeping service. *tv picture in room was not HD, small channel selection In my opinion this is a value property if you can get it through priceline, however add $43/night to compare with another facility ( if you get free internet and parking).

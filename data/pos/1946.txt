My husband and I have stayed here twice, one night each time - first to attend a music concert at Nordstrom's Benaroya Hall and second for a soccer game at (formerly QWEST Field but now called) CenturyLink Stadium. We knew that it was going to be extremely basic accommodation so we weren't disappointed. Being as central as it was it was a quick walk to the Public Market or to shops such as Macy's. The rooms are spotless and adequate for a no-frills stay. Given that all buses in the downtown core are FREE 24/7 there is the option of taking a bus to/from any downtown destination.Because the weather was so nice we walked to the soccer game and back. It is quite a distance so one would want comfortable walking shoes to do so. I was surprised to see how the area around the Public Market seemed to roll up the carpets by 9pm, hardly anything open to go for an after-game beverage/dessert.

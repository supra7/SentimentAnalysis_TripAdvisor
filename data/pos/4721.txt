We stayed at the Travelodge for one night before leaving on our cruise. Every staff member we met was very friendly. The front desk staff gave us a map and gave us easy to follow directions to the local points of interest. The location is great. The breakfast was very good. The hallway carpet needed a deep cleaning and was very hot but the room was clean and cool. We used the transfer service, Seattle Shuttle, that was recommended by the Hotel. They were outstanding, The wait time was very short, they were reasonably priced and the drivers were very friendly and helpful.

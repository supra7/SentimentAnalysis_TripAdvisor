I recommend the 6th Ave Inn. The room was clean, reasonable size, and comfortable. The staff at the desk were fantastic! We called ahead and asked we could check our luggage and park our car prior to our check in time. They said it would not a problem. We arrived at 11am were allowed check into our room well ahead of the stated check in time. The folks at the desk gave us a map an recommendation for things to do. We had a nice time and want to thank the Sixth Avenue Inn. You can walk to all the things to do downtown.

We booked our room as part of a package with Clipper Vacations. When we first checked in for our two night mini-honeymoon, we were given a spotless, tasteful but very small room looking into a dark courtyard. As it was our honeymoon, my husband went back down to the front desk to ask if they had anything a bit higher up. The front desk manager immediately apologized and told us they would try to find us something. We went for lunch, and when we returned we were given the key to one of the 11th floor suites. It was beautiful, with a gorgeous king-size canopy bed, fireplace and two-person soaker tub. They also sent up a congratulatory bottle of wine. Everything about our stay was fantastic, and the location was perfect for walking around the city. The nightly wine reception in the lobby is a lovely touch, although we missed it both nights as we were out seeing the sights. We'll definitely be back!

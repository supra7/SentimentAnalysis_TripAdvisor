Helpful and friendly staff. Nice and comfortable room ( I stayed alone in a king size bed room ). Love the fact they are a green hotel!!! Excellent location. Free Wifi that actually works pretty good, coffee maker inside the room. I got an early check in which was amazing, after a long trip from Taipei. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting Seattle.

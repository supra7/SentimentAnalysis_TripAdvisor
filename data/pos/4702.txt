In the heart of Seattle downtown. Walking distance to just about all of the major attractions. Rooms were newly redecorated, and offered a nice view of the bay from the 38th floor. The room had a slight odor to it, almost like it used to be a smoking room or something. That would be the only negative I could possibly give this place. Overall, a very nice place to stay.

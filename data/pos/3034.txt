Stayed here recently while attending a meeting at the Convention Center, which it is very conveniently near. Room was not spectacular, but more space than many big-city hotels, and VERY comfortable bed (wimpy pillows, though). I did get a laugh out of the card in the room inviting guests to forgo ALL housekeeping services for a daily $5 gift certificate. Hardly seems like a fair trade! Location is also close to Pike's Market, waterfront, and lots of downtown attractions.

We stayed there for one night only and we enjoyed it. Large "appartement type" room. Close to Space needle and downtowb easily accesible by bus. The only thing is that we seem to have got an "handicaped" room but it was no problen for us. Staff was friendly and have a free continental breakfast. Would recommend staying there

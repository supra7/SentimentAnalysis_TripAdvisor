If you are like me, you are searching the internet for the best hotel value - search no more. My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary in Seattle and of course wanted it to be as special as possible. From reservation to check-out, we have nothing but great feedback. Upon arrival, we were greeted outside as we arrived by taxi by the door person who graciously loaded our luggage onto a bell cart and assured us our luggage will be sent to our room once we check in - and it was. The front desk agents were attentive to our needs and answered our questions as we thought of them and check in was flawless - we stayed in a corner Lux suite on the 10th floor. Upon entering our room, I have a habit of checking the entire room to make sure it is cleaned and everything works. I have to say, I was extremely impressed by the overall cleanliness and attention to detail, so kudos to the guest room attendants who keep this room clean. Not an ounce of dust to be found, amenities set up to perfection. Furthermore, as we ventured out into the city each day, our room was 'reset' just as though we were arriving for the first time and let's not forget about the daily turndown service! Throughout our stay as we entered and exited the hotel, the staff always smiled at us and genuinely looked like they wanted to be there and that speaks volumes. This hotel goes beyond just a room and a place to sleep. For us, it enhanced our week-long stay in Seattle and we are already talking about booking our next stay at Hotel Andra.

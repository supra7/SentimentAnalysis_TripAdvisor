I stayed here, for 6 days in October 2004, while at a convention. I brought my wife and toddler son. The location is incredibly convenient in downtown Seattle, close to the Convention Center, Pike's Marketplace and several restaurants. The front desk staff was less than cordial but provided us with the room we wanted in a reasonable amount of time. The room we received had a good view (we could see a little of Puget Sound) and was clean and comfortable. The facilities were well maintained and the pool was an added plus. Service (room service, bell staff, maid service, concierge) was friendly and excellent. On-site restaurants were over-priced, with unimpressive food and spotty service. The hotel was a little pricey, despite convention-associated discounts, but reasonable considering the overall consistent quality. Notably, on checking out there was a mistake on the bill (a mini-bar charge of < $10) which was disputed and removed promptly, but without any type of apology for the mistake. Overall, the front desk again left me with a bad taste in my mouth that marred an otherwise decent stay. In sum, a great hotel with consistently excellent service which is family-friendly. It's a little pricey, considering the mediocre restaurant offerings, but a reasonable value. They probably need to monitor their front desk staff more carefully, who offer both the first impression and the last impression to customers.

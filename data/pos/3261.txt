We stayed at this hotel for the NFL Wildcard weekend with the New Orleans Saints playing the Seahawks. The hotel was warm and charming. We had king size bed, very comfortable. The wall heater kept the room warm. Seattle is going green so the bathrooms had liquid soap, shampoo dispensers. The room had recycle cans. The restaurant was lovely. Nice warm fireplace, 3 flat screen TVs to watch football. If you arrive on Friday you have to order the large bowl of clam chowder. It was the best, even better than the clam chowder at the Crab Pot. The hotel was walking distance to the Space Needle, Pikes Market and shopping. Parking was $15 daily. Would stay here again.

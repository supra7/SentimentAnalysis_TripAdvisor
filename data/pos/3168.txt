We were actually pleasantly surprised by our stay at the Sheraton in Seattle. We booked it through Priceline, where we "named our own price" - and we figured that we wouldn't get the best room or hotel - we were wrong. The room that we got was on one of the very top floors, beautiful views, extremely comfortable bedding and brand new decor in the room. We were also able to use their business center and use their internet access for free. The only down fall that I would have to mention is the cost for parking. The hotel is going through a bit of a transition, as they are building a new tower, but that had absolutely no effect upon our stay. We were able to walk everywhere downtown and felt that it was great for the money that we spent. I would reccomend this property to friends and I would return again.

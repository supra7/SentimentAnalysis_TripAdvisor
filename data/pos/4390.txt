I purchased this hotel on priceline for $100 and it was definitely a bargain at this price. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are small but nice. The beds are very comfy as well. We were kept awake by some water pump in the walls but the maintenance people finally figured it out and stopped it. We parked in the lot across the street, much cheaper than hotel parking. We left in am so did not get to experience the area, although looked great.

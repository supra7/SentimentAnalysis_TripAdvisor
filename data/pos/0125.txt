We couldn't say enough about our stay at this hotel. Our kids loved it! The goldfish in the room was a big hit, as were the free milk and cookies, free toy chest, and free movie! They got a kick out of the animal print bathrobes. While not being a "kid hotel", they make kids feel very special. From an adult perspective, the lobby is beautiful, the rooms are nicely done and clean, the staff is great, the complimentary wine hour is a nice touch, the attached restaurant was great, and the location is awesome. Bravo--Kimpton has figured it out!

We stayed here over the July long weekend, and weren't expecting much to be totally honest. The price we paid was the cheapest we found in Seattle considering it was the July 4th long weekend. I was thoroughly satisfied with the room, as it was big, and the King size bed was extremely comfy. I would have to say that the best surprise was the complementary breakfast which offered a variety of different breakfast food options that even a person such as myself with a gluten allergy could eat. Also the staff were very helpful in providing us "tourists" with useful information which made our stay very enjoyable. Thank you for you great service, I would definitely consider going back the next time i stay in Seattle!

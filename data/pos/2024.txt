We stayed at this hotel for one night with our two young kids and would come back again. The hotel is in a beautiful old theater building but has been renovated to keep some of the old charm but with beautiful, funky retro-modern accents. The staff is super-casual and laid back but still very professional and helpful, and gave lots of great suggestions for non-touristy places to eat and local places that would accommodate our daughter's allergies. The rooms were small but very clean and comfortable. With only a few blocks walk to the Market it didn't matter that we had to park our car a couple of blocks away after unloading - we had everything we needed in walking distance. A great find!!

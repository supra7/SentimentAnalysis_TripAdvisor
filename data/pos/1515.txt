What a treasure of a hotel. My husband and I flew to Seattle for a romantic get-away and loved the MarQueen. It's beautiful and historic, we had a kitchen and a sitting room. It was so quiet, I never heard someone walking or talking in the hallway or the TV of an ajoining room. The hotel staff were great. They were friendly and we had some laughs with them. When we decided to use public transportation to get around they spent time with us with maps and told us which bus to take and always checked with us at the end of the day to see how we made out. If you're looking for something trendy or funky this is not the place for you but if you want a quaint, cozy and clean room with excellent customer service I hightly recommend this hotel.

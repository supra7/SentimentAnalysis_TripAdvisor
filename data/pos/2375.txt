My wife and I spent 4 nights in the Renaissance recently and enjoyed it greatly. The staff was very professional and helpful. The concierge desk is outstanding (especially Lucy). Our room was exactly as requested, spacious, and very nicely appointed. Be sure and try out the bar and dining on the 28th floor, especially during happy hour pricing.

Nice hotel with friendly staff. Clean modern rooms, comfy beds, free starbucks coffee in the room and a pair of bathrobes to lounge and watch recently released movies on the large flatscreen. LoLa restaurant next to the lobby serves a great eggs benedict. Serious pie (100 yards away) has an excellent octopus salad in addition to their famous pizza. Dahlia restaurant across from the hotel has copper river salmon (when in season) + their bakery next door makes a mean coconut cream pie. All restaurants appear to embrace the farm to table concept. Forget the rental car (parking fee is ridiculous) and take the light rail from sea-tac airport to Westlake shopping mall. Its about a 30min ride and a ten minute walk to the hotel. Hotel is close to all but far enough from the crowds. 15 min walk to pioneer square or the seattle needle. Most bars/clubs are about a 10 min walk. We came up for the Mariners game and the U2 concert. The stadiums are walkable but you may want to use a taxi or the light rail from the westlake mall if you are too pooped. Tip: the hotel entices you with lots of treats in the room. Skip it and walk one block to Ralphs market and stock up with drinks and snacks instead.

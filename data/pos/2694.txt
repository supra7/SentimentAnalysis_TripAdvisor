I was in this hotel for the MLA 2012 meeting (Modern Lang. Assoc.). Excellently run modern and large facility with helpful staff and free use, for conference members (present in large numbers), of the internet (at six computers). I don't know if this internet use extends to guests in other circumstances. My room was equipped with serviceable hook-up for laptop. Proximity to the city's main conference center cannot be equaled. Food-on-the-run was easy to come by in the lobby-reception areas, and a $5 discount on it per day was offered in exchange for dispensing with needless, un-"green" room service. Hotel appears to be utterly central to the city, and can hardly be bettered for ease of use. Even the iron and ironing board were tops.

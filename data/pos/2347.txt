The hotel was in a great location - we walked everywhere. Yes, there are some hills when walking up from the market area, but the views are worth it. The Check in staff was very helpful and kind - the woman at the concierge was amazing (i wish i go her name) she knew what was going on at most of the clubs/live music places. At R view bar, we have the very talented mixologist, Stella creating use wonderful cocktails and gave us recommendations for other interesting places to check out. The room itself, had everything we needed, comfy bed, fridge, tv...all very clean and quiet. Everything we needed for a great weekend away.

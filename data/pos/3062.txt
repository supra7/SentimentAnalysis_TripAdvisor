Got this superb hotel for $90 on priceline. I was very impressed by the usual 4star nature of Sheraton - the comfortable bedding, contemporary bathroom fittings and amenities etc. A super extra at this site is the free internet access - 5 computer terminals in the lobby. Note the Union Tower is new. The pool and jacuzzi are currently under renovation (this is clearly stated on the website). The concierge wasn't that friendly but they provided a shopping discount coupon for Macy's and they have a binder of restaurant menus. The location is excellent - steps to shopping, Pike Place Market, Cheesecake Factory, restaurants etc. I would stay here again and recommend it. However, parking is $38 as they have valet (separate company) only, but it's available til 6pm the next day. If you decide to check out and have them put your bags into the car, make sure they have the right key to your car!! They almost made a mistake with us.

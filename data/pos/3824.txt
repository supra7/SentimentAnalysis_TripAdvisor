As a frequent business traveler, I value service in a hotel a top priority. The staff at the Edgewater really make this hotel stand out & above most any other I've stayed at. From the time you're warmly greeted and checked in quickly, the staff does their best to make you feel "at home" and cared for. The wait staff in the bar and restaurant go out of their way to serve you well, and the food & beverages are excellent. If you have any transportation needs, Rick at the front door will arrange anything you want. The hotel isn't new, but it's still very nice and tastefully decorated. The rooms I've stayed in since have been very spacious and nicely furnished. Everything is always clean - another important item for me. All in all I highly recommend the Edgewater when in Seatlle, and intend to bring my wife here for a long weekend getaway.

My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento Hotel for our honeymoon and it was an wonderful experience. The entire staff, from the concierge to housekeeping, was considerate and very accommodating. The rooms were tastefully decorated, with an understated elegance, and the beds were absolutely wonderful to sleep in! The town car service was very convenient, although we found that we were able to walk to just about any place in town, including the downtown area, Broadway street, and the Space Needle (if you like longer walks). The hotel is just a few blocks away from amazing restaurants on Broadway Street, be sure to check them out as well! All in all, it was a fantastic choice and I would recommend staying there to anyone.

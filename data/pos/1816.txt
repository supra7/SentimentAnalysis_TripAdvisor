I spent three nights at the Mayflower Park this week.. I'm somewhat surprised by the previous review shown below, as I had a very nice greeting at reception (even though I was arriving from the countryside in GoreTex and walking shoes due to the stormy weather, Iand found staff in both the hotel staff gracious and helpful). My room was booked at special rate on a 24-hour "special" so I certainly received no special treatment because of the room rate! My single room was somewhat small, but well-appointed. The bathroom is finished in sleek white tile and and is small, but I certainly did not find it unusually so, especially for an historic boutique-type hotel, where I have different expectations than when staying at a Sheraton or even a Ramada Inn. I don't know how this compares to other rooms in the hotel. Though I was given a room right adjacent to the elevator on the 10th floor, I could not .hear the elevator and noticed no noise. I also can't tolerate being next to an ice machine room, but it isn't located on the 10th, so can't comment. The previous poster complained that they didn't put a priate note for her husband on the pillow prior to their arrival, as she requested--As far as putting notes on pillows--this wouldn't occur to me to ask . Who would be doing this for the customer, and how would they know for certain which room would be assigned until the customer arrives? Asking a bit much, IMHO. The hotel's Andaluca Restaurant is a delight, with Mediterranean cuisine using local Northwest produce, seafood, etc. I highly recommend their prix fixe Mediterranean Tour menu, with several choices among three courses of samplers of of many kinds, at $18 at lunch, $30, dinner, pp. It also has an excellent staff, pleasant and efficient, but unobtrusive. All in all, I'd still recommend the Mayflower Park over others in its category for its convenient location and ambiance.

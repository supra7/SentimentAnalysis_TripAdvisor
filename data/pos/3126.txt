I spent 4 nights here on business in July. I stayed in the new tower and the room was outstanding. The bed was very comfortable. Conference facilities were excellent. The downtown location is terrific for walking. Only problem was that the fitness facilities are very limited. They opened at 5:30 am and there was already a lineup for the machines. 4 treadmills, a couple of ellipticals and some resistance machines - not enough for the size of the hotel.

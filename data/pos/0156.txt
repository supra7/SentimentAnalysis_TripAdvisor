The hotel is conveniently located near the heart of Seattles shopping district. The staff were extremely helpful, with one of the staff at the concierge desk Googling the weather the night before a tour I had booked. The room was extremely comfortable and spacious, and their restaurant was great. Room service food was average, but the staff member who delivered it was very friendly. The hotel also hosted the convention I was there for. The staff handled it amazingly and were very friendly throughout the whole process, even though it must have been pretty stressful to coordinate. The food was also amazing  I am in love with the apple pastries they served for breakfast and wish I could have taken some home. I was travelling on my own but couldnt help noticing their kid- and pet-friendly policies. Pets are allowed, and their names are written on a blackboard. Kids can also get a goldfish to keep as a pet while theyre there. The hotel puts a very strong emphasis on friendly, personalised service, and it comes through in everything they do. It is very rare in my experience to find a hotel that has luxury facilities but is down-to-earth in the way they treat their guests. I have been told that the entire hotel chain (Kimpton Hotels) aims to be like this, so I will definitely be checking out other hotels from that chain the next time I go to the US.

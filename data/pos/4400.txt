My husband and I stayed here in August to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded when we checked in, although I'm not sure what the difference was. The room itself was small but attractive and very clean. Befitting the "green," lifestyle, there was a Lot of signage about not wasting resources. The funniest was the one in the shower that said something along the lines of, "This double shower head is amazing, but using it will waste a ton of our precious resources." Now, I consider myself an environmentalist, but this was a little over the top for me. The bed was divine, and we loved the city view. The location was great for seeing the sights the next day. The lobby had lots of cruise ship passengers at all hours of the day, but the service was quick and friendly. I will say we got an excellent rate for our room through a deal site. Given the size of the rooms, I would have been less than thrilled if we had paid anywhere near the rack rate. Bottom line: Great location, great view-just make sure you get a great rate, and you'll have a lovely stay.

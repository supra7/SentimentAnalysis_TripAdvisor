Stayed at Sheraton Seattle for two nights. Perfect location! One block from the link station and light rail. Walk distance to Pike's market, shops and all attractions in downtown. This is a big hotel and it's connected to a conference center. Rooms are basic... not impressive but it's enough for travelers. I did not like the bed at all: it's too firm. Only 4 pillows and pillows are soft not support to neck. But overall, it's a nice stay.

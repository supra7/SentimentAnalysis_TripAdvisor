Stayed here one night prior to a cruise. Took light rail from airport and walked a few blocks to hotel. It is a bit uphill from Univ. stop. Room was very clean and had a mini-fridge which was nice and cold. We went to the Subway about 3 blocks away for dinner. The fitness area was good sized but the next morning it was packed. The pool is tiny but has a great view of the city facing west. Outside of the fitness area to the right was a room/area that was open that had a view facing north. I had heard some people mention the traffic noise - if the a/c is running, you can't hear it, but in the middle of the night when the a/c was off, you certainly did plus the bird that was squaking from somewhere. The staff was friendly enough. The Vikings were staying at our hotel that night prior to the game on Saturday so there were some groupies outside but they were well confined to a certain area.

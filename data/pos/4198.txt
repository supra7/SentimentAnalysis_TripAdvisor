We always stay at the Westin when we are in Seattle. The hotel is convienently located and the mojitos downstairs are always good! Rooms are nice and spacious, beds are comfortable. It will be good when this hotel finishes undergoing a renovation. It also helps that we are southwest VISA holders and get 2 points per dollar on staying here. The last time we stayed, the spa was WAY over-chlornated. Easy walk to Pike's place, and to the monorail to the space needle. We valet parked our car and walked everywhere we wanted to go. The only negative was our room was located across from the elevators, next to the ice machine.

I wasn't expecting much from a large chain hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was pretty standard in size and furnishings, but comfortable with no problems at all. The shower was very nice with Aveda soaps and amenities. Room service was prompt and delivered with a good attitude. I thought it was a good value for the relatively low price I paid. It's a couple extra blocks away than other major hotels from tourist sites like Pike, space needle, and the waterfront, but it was convenient for my work near Pioneer Square. I recommend it for the common business traveler and tourist alike who are looking for a standard room with nice amenities.

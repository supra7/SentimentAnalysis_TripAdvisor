We enjoyed our stay at the Maayflower Park hotel. Service was very attentive and friendly. Location was great, close to everything that we wanted to see. The room was on the small side but comfortable. My only suggestion to make the room work better, each bedside should have a nightstand. Restaurant and bar on the premises were both very good. A close walk to Pikes Place market. Loved kolas for breakfast, a short walk from the hotel.

The terrific friendly staff made our stay a memorable birthday celebration for my wife. We have stayed at the Mayflower Park in the past and always find it welcoming and comfortable. The location in ther heart of downtown Seattle is convenient to shopping and the Pike Place Market, plus you can grab the monorail for a quick trip to the Seattle Center for opera and plays and other activities. It is also just steps away from the light rail. Of course dinner at Andaluca is sensational. We are already planning another visit!

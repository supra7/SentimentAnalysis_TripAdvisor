A friend and I spent 10 days in the Sixth Avenue Inn. We got a great rate through a discount web site and we were a short walk from the Convention Center and downtown Seattle. Our room was crowded with two beds and the bathroom had no room to put your toiletries, but the staff was very friendly and helpful and there were free cookies every night. The rooms were clean and had free wireless internet. I would gladly stay there again at the rates we had.

Centrally located downtown within walking distance of the Seattle Art Museum, convention center, theaters and great restaurants. It's a nicely refurbished old hotel with attractive furnishings. The bed and pillows were really comfy. The room was very quiet and, on the 10th floor, had a great view of the city. There was a nice flatscreen if you plan to watch television in Seattle. The staff was always upbeat, cheery, skilled and incredibly helpful. I had a great stay.

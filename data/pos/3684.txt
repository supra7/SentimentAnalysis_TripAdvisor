Such a great hotel...where to begin? How about first thing in the morning with the bed you will wake up in at the Edgewater. You will find that it is the perfect combination of comfy cozy and essential support. No complaints - just a great night sleep. Next, you might wander into the bathroom. Here you are going to be met with awesome design and attention to detail, not to mention one of the best showers ever. From the well equipped and well designed bathroom to the bed/living room that boasts a fireplace, every part of the guest room is full of Pacific Northwest style and flare. Downstairs in the lobby the ambiance continues with lots of fireplaces, comfy couches, stunning views and a friendly staff. If you venture down to 67 for breakfast you won't be disappointed. They make a perfectly pouched egg and present a beautiful plate of fresh fruit. Again, the view is amazing for watching the sun come up in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee. If you decide to let them valet park your car it will be worth it. All the men at the valet desk are super helpful and always very friendly. When you venture out from the hotel you won't have far to go to get to some major landmarks such as Pike's Place Market and some of the big shopping centers in the downtown area. Overall, staying at the Edgewater was a great experience and we will be back in the future. The prices were reasonable and well worth the stay. From the location to the staff to the guest rooms, every aspect of the Edgewater is top notch.

My husband I stayed for three nights in the Shearton Seattle during the American Cheese Society conference which we attended. The price of an executive room was negotiated for conference attendees and was a great value. It's worth paying a little more for access to the executive room where an impressive continental breakfast was served and tasty appetizers in the afternoon--careful, you do have to pay for wine. The room was an adequate size but if using the executive room, it's like having additional space. I understand the hotel was recently remodeled so the room and public areas were in excellent condition. Nicely, even though we arrived early, we were able to get into our room. Shearton is known for their comfortable beds for good reason--beds live up to their reputation. From a conference attendee point of view, the rooms and locations were very convenient and it appeared that the Shearton staff tended to details. The location was in downtown Seattle, within walking of shopping, Pikes Place Market, and some very good restaurants.

I stayed here with my girlfriend in September after the hotel was recommended by a friend. the staff were friendly, helpful and full of information when we checked in. We asked for a room with good wifi signal so they placed us on floor one which was really thoughtful of them. Although the rooms are a little out dated they are very very big, clean and comfortable, we had a walk in closet, and a great tv. We had a basin in the room and acces to a shared bathroom,however the bathroom was always vacant and regularly cleaned.The shower was powerful and perfect temperature.. The location was superb and within walking distance to all sight seeing spots, as well as close by to restaurants, bars, and shops. The bar next door nitelite is great for happy hour and a game of pool, $2 a beer. I would definitely stay here again, thank you for a great trip!

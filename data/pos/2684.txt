I spent 2 nights at the Sheraton Seattle and it was a wonderful experience. The front desk staff and everyone in the Club Lounge was great! I used the fitness center and it was huge! Very nice indoor pool as well. The location is ideal and convenient to Pike's Place, shopping, and tons of restaurants. I will definitely return to this hotel....kudos to Front Desk Agent Ryan (i hope I got her name right).... She was awesome!

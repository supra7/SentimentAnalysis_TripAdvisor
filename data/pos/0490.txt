Definitely make sure you book one of the newly remodelled executive rooms on the top floors as it eliminates any concerns about the condition of the rooms. It was excellent! However I would have to agree that the rooms are noisy and drafty. Not really anyones fault but the sound does indeed travel somehow upwards. for the price this was a great deal and we think a great location between belltown and downtown, all walking distance. housekeeping was very poor, which would be our only 'easy fix' negative comment

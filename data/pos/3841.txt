Being from the East Coast our trip to Seattle was a long one. From the first contact I had with the hotel when I made the reservations the staff was very friendly and helpful. We ulitized the town car service from the airport and while expensive it was convenient and our driver was helpful and full of tips and information. Upon arrival at 11:30 AM we fully expected to have to drop our luggage off an go about our day and were pleasantly surprised to find that there was a room ready for us to check in right away! Room key, city map and informational tips from the desk staff and we were on our way. The room was beautiful and comfortable. We opted not to have the room cleaned since we were only there two days and the staff was very gracious in offering coffee to replenish supplies. We were in Seattle for Deadliest Catch's Catch-Con and while they were rowdy in the lobby we didn't mind because that's what we were there for. The hotel cost was steep for us, but we were willing to pay it for the convenience of location. Our only disappointment (as it were) is that we didn't get to keep the adorable teddy bear or rubber duckie without having to shell out a bunch of money for them (the kids would have loved them). If we come back to Seattle we will definitely be staying at the Edgewater again and have already been reccommending it!

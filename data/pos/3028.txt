There's no better location in downtown Seattle. If you're there for a convention, the convention center is right next door. And if you're there for a visit you're within a quick walk of just about anything you could want. The room was nice and spacious, quiet and had tons of natural light. We got a very good price on Priceline, but they still put us in a nice room on a high floor. Our room was usually cleaned before noon. The internet connection was a little slow, but not debilitating. My only real complaint is about the valet service. It took forever to get our car. In fact, it took longer to get it if there wasn't anyone else around compared to when there were tons of people trying to drop off or pick up cars. I'm not sure if it's the system or what, but give yourself a few minutes to account for it if you need to get somewhere.

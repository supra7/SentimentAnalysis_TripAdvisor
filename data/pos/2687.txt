I've stayed here a number of times in the past few years. The location is awesome if you want to shop, drink, eat, watch a movie or attend an event at the Convention Center or the Paramount Theater. The rooms are comfortable and the service from the front desk and the valet parking is great. Internet access is now free (it used to be $12.95 a day!), but the valet parking is $42 (tax included) a day.

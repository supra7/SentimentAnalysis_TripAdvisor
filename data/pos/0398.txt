My husband and I and our 45 pound dog stayed at the Monaco from May 12th to the 20th, 2006. We got a fantastic last minute rate (staying with the family didn't exactly work out!) and we were overwhelmed by the level of service we received from all areas of the hotel. Every person we encountered, from the very busy front desk and valet personnel to the chamber maids doing turn down service greeted us and our dog warmly on every occasion. Our dog was treated like a queen instead of being shooed away and given the evil eye like what happens at most pet "friendly" hotels. The front desk and bell/valet staff dog sat for us on several occasions and our dog had her very own leopard print chaise lounge to rest on behind the front desk. She was walked and played with and felt so at home she was distressed when we packed up the car to go to our next destination. The room was very comfortable and though it was close to the elevator, we heard no noise from it or from people walking by. The bed was dreamy, the linens divine and the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate. Room service breakfast was on time every morning, very tasty, and the tray was always removed no more than ten minutes after we put it in the hall. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were disappointed in the food, but the service was perfect. The Monaco is on Spring and 4th, across from the fabulous modern Library, and there are loads of restaurants within walking distance or a short free bus ride. We were able to take the dog for walks to the federal courthouse two blocks away which has a huge grassy hill and another great view of the library. Overall, this was the best hotel stay I have had in a major city. The Monaco has a customer for life in me and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle - with or without a dog.

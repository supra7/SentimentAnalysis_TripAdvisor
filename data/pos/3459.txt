My fiance and I live in Seattle and we chose Hotel Andra to recommend to our out of town wedding guests. We thoroughly researched the options, but being Seattle natives we put Hotel Andra on our short list of the best hotels in the city due to its location, amenities, and service. The hotel is located in a great part of the city - walking distance to all the best tourist spots (Pike Place Market, downtown shopping, Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Seattle Art Museum, etc.). The hotel restaurant is one of Tom Douglas' and it has a great northwest menu. The rooms are beautiful, the prices are good, and you can avoid paying for parking at the hotel by doing a day rental from one of the multiple car rental sites located within a few blocks. All of our guests - from our 90 year old grandmother to our college-age cousin - loved the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel to recommend to your wedding guests, Kelsey Hunsinger is amazing to work with and will take great care of you. If you are looking for a hotel for yourself, definitely check out this hotel.

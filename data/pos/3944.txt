Beautiful location jutting out on the water. Great views on the side facing the water. We opted for a less-expensive "city view" (which really was a parking lot view, but we didn't mind.) The decor is superb! Lots of character- feel like you are in a modern log cabin. Rooms had fireplaces and comfy chairs. The bathroom was stunning- gorgeous shower- stone decor. We were here for a girls weekend but this hotel would be amazing for a romantic getaway. Only drawback is the location you have a steep walk up to Belltown so best to take a cab if you want to dine and explore behind the waterfront.

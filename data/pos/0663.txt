Friends suggested that we stay at this hotel over Thanksgiving. The room was very nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Most restaurants were closed so the htoel offered free coffee and a continental breakfast on Thanksgiving day. Valet parking is available at a much more reasonable price than other hotels in the area. All in all a great place to stay only steps from Pike Place Market.

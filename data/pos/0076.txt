We loved the unusual decor! We had a "whimsical" striped room which was very quiet on the 9th floor. Easy efficient check-in with a very pleasant staff. We enjoyed the wine reception in the lobby before dinner. Very comfortable bed and Starbucks coffee in the morning. The room was a nice size although the bathroom was on the small side. Seemed like an older hotel, but well-maintained with an "Alice in Wonderland" quality.

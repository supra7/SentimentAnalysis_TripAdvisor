I would highly recommend the Hotel Monaco. I traveled there for business and enjoyed the friendly staff and comfortable room. The shower was amazing - excellent water pressure. I loved walking into the room to find the hotel provided me with a pet - a goldfish named Kevin (requested by my co-worker)! In order to receive free wifi, you must be a Kimpton InTouch member. It's very easy to sign up on the internet. I also received a coupon for $10 worth of mini bar goods. Room service was quick and delicious. My friend traveled with me and was able to check out for me through the television and then stop by the desk to pick up my receipt. She felt her bed was not as comfortable as other hotels (but still quite nice); I had no problem with mine. I only had two complaints: my neighbor waking me up briefly at 4 a.m. and the too soft pillows. Neither would prevent me from staying again.

Was there for 5 days on vacation with a 2 year old and the staff was just Fantastic. Room was great, valet was super helpful and always made sure we knew where we were going. Bar and restaurant let us take drinks and utensils back to our room when we had to accommodate baby's schedule. The front desk gave our daughter a stuffed animal on check-in and put a goldfish in our room, which just made the stay for our 2 year old. Concierge managed to find someone to dry-clean my jacket for a wedding on a friday afternoon when I needed it by sat. afternoon and then handled everything for me. And the absolute highlight for us was seeing our toddler after her bath in her kid sized animal print robe! too cute. Traveling with toddlers can be a challenge and you often spend more time in the hotel than maybe your thought you would. We were always very comfortable at the Monaco and would absolutely stay there again. They are the new bar for us when vacationing at a hotel.

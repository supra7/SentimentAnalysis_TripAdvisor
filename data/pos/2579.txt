We stayed several days at the Seattle Hilton. I like to start with the good things. We had a nice, very clean room and ours had a decent view (see picture). We stayed on the executive/club level and having been in a lot of Hilton's, this one has one of the best club lounges in the business. The lounge is on the top floor and in the morning doubles as a breakfast restaurant. It's views are outstanding, the evening bar service is great and it also has free wifi for your laptop. All of the staff I encountered were great and helpful. Now the weak points. It's downtown location is great for conventioners but a bit of walking for the tourist crowd. Also if you drive in with you own car you have to park in their garage, no valet parking, and the garage is more expensive than most valet lots you'd run into. Also you either have to check in, and then ask for a bellman to come back to the garage with you, or haul all your own luggage in yourself. We had a fair amount so I went and got a bellman who was very courtous and helpful, but it did mean a fairly long time between arriving and being settled in the room. Still, considering everything including the staff I would choose this hotel on a return trip to Seattle. Unless someone else was paying, then I'd try the Four Seasons which is just a couple blocks away and looked great.

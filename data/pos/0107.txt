I came to Hotel Monaco on a solo trip, only for 2 nights, but had a wonderful experience! The hotel was located in a very easy-to-find location within walking distance of all the popular attractions I wanted to see. The hotel staff was very friendly & helpful and I LOVED my room. I can't wait to come back!

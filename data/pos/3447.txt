Everything was first rate from start to finish. Initially, what drew me to the hotel was the location and affordability. The service was outstanding, and the location of the hotel made it very easy to hit all the spots my family and I wanted to see. If I ever decide to travel back out to Seattle, the first thing I will do is book a room at this hotel.

Was a bit sketchy about reserving a room here when I viewed the reviews of the Ace here on the website - but I did it anyway. I am glad I did. When Iarrived, the very handsome, very approachable and did I say handsome (?) Doug checked me into the hotel. He recommended places to eat, how to get around and where to find parking. He then offered to send beer to my room with ice. Not necessary at all. And wow, he was very handsome... My room was 117 - one of the rooms on it's website. Yes, the mattress was firm (I believe it was actually a futon mattress) laid upon a block set above the floor. The room was clean, complete with Kama Sutra and condoms... Only downfall was the television was broken but when the staff was notified, a brand new one was installed in the room. The shared bathrooms were always clean, secure, and I felt comfortable using them at any hour of the night. The housekeeping staff, although not always easy to understand *primary language was Spanish, I believe* always had a smile on their faces and were cheery in the morning downstairs in the breakfast area. (A continental breakfast is included... just loved watching my fellow hotel mates wobble down the stairs hungover.) I will definitely stay here again when I come to Seattle... hope Doug is there. ;)

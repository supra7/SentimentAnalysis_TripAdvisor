I felt at home when I arrived, and the cordial staff was attentive from the moment I pulled up at the curb. I enjoyed the retro look of the hotel, and was impressed by the lobby which belied the fact that you were in a boutique hotel. Service was always prompt and courteous. The restaurant was excellent and I recommend the clams for a true taste experience. Their continental breakfast was one of the best I've had, with excellent fresh fruit and a perfect croissant. The room itself was spacious, nicely appointed and comfortable. Location was also excellent, being equidistant from Pioneer Square, Pike's Place and downtown. It's been my favorite of the boutique hotels I've stayed at.

Great hotel with wonderful service. We arrived and were given a huge room - we basically had a historic apartment for our stay, even though we booked our room as a flight package deal on Expedia. The hotel is an old apartment block from the early 20th century. They have decorated the rooms and the front hall to the era of the building. It is very charming and warm. The location was convenient, you could walk (if you don't mind walking) almost anywhere. There were also bus stops right at the hotel which brought you anywhere you wanted to go in the city. Breakfast was included but basic, but certainly got you going in the morning. Lively and fun restaurants and coffee shops right on the same block. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend the hotel.

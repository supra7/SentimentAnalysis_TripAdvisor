This was my first time at a Kimpton hotel, and I am now a fan. The location was perfect as I was only minutes away from Pike Public Market (must have breakfast @ Lowell's). The decor is certainly not generic. As you enter the room, you first notice the salmon pink stripe wallpaper. The blue headboard with blue vases on the wall, and even the desk chair has a blue back to match...equal fun decor. I also enjoyed the complimentary wine happy hour between 5 and 6 pm. It was a nice opportunity for me to test a WA cabernet. The complimentary coffee and tea in the morning is nice plus as well. I will be back when in Seattle. Nice place, nice location, nice people.

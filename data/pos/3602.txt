Surrounded by great places to eat. Good restaurant on the premises. There's a grocery store across the street with a wonderful choice of good food that has a cafe in it that's open until 2. A great bakery also directly across the street. Two blocks from Jazz Alley. Five blocks to Pike Place Market and the Downtown area. Easy access to the free Metro bus system. The Airporter stops on the same block. The staff is friendly, the concierge extremely helpful and the rooms very clean. and complete with all of the amenities. Huge walk-in closet. The only thing is that the bathroom is very small and the room could use more light. A great blend of an old and new. Definitely plan to return.

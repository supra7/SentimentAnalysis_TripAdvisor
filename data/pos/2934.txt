I do not have to write too much about the Sheraton Seattle because all that is pictured and described on its web site is absolutely accurate. It is an excellent hotel with congenial service in a terrific location. Additionally, I can say that it has one of the best fitness centers Ive ever encountered in a hotel, with plenty of single purpose weight machines, a stepping board and sufficient floor space, in addition to the usual cardio, etc.

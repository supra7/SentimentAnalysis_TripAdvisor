I do not really get what the complaints are about here. The staff was very nice. Rooms are clean and basic. We paid 100 a night on priceline and it was worth it, right near seattle center where you can also take the monorail to downtown. The showers had great water pressure. My only complaint would be the pillows. 2 flat pillows is not acceptable. They should either have 2 good ones or 4 pillows. We asked for 2 pillows and they were brought up to us. It was a minor thing, we would definitely stay again. We did not eat breakfast there so I cannot comment on that.

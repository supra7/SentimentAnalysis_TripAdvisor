Every time you make a reservation, you wonder if the hotel will wow you. I have to tell you that this hotel did more than that. It started as soon as we arrived from the bellhop to the front desk, but the most amazing part was opening the door to our room and realizing it was just more than we imagined. The warm and relaxing atmosphere that the room exuded was just perfect. The room and its bathroom was immaculate from the sheets to the toilet. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. Everything was perfect. When i come back to seattle, i am for sure going to stay here and i would recommend it to anyone staying in the Emerald City.

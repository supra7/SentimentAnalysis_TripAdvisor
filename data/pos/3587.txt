The hotel's car service failed to show up at the airport, as I had scheduled, so I was a little miffed when I arrived. All was well, though, once I took one look at this chic, sleek lobby and was warmly welcomed by the staff. My room was stylish and offered ample space for my friend and me, who were in town for a girls' weekend. The walk-in closet AND separate dressing area w/ mirror made it easy to share this room. The restaurant attached to the hotel is one of Seattle's best. In a three-day weekend, we ate at Lola three times. It was an easy walk to the Pike Place market, the ferry landing, the Rem Koolhaas library, great restaurants and the monorail. It's rare to find such a well-located, hip hotel that is priced right. Andra is a real gem.

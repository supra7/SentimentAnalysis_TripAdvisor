Nice hotel on the pier and walking distance to all the events downtown. The hotel has a shuttle to drop you off and pick you up every hour if you want to skip the walking shoes. The front desk people were very pleasant and helpful. I liked that we could go down to the lounge with a glass of wine and watch the sun set while playing a game of chess or backgammon. Room was nice; not the best view but clean. Our last night we went to the bar for dinner, food was good but very expensive and small portions. The only part of our stay I did not appreciate was on the morning of my departure the maid kept knocking on our door what seemed like every half hour to see if we had left. I had appreciated the fact that she/he did not do that during our stay because I tend to be a late starter thus was a little annoyed on the day of my departure for them to keep knocking. Front desk staff was great!! Thank you!

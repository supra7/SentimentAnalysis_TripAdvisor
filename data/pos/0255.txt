Stayed here by myself on a business trip and wished I was with someone. The rooms are clean, comfortable and funky, and my bathroom had a HUGE jacuzzi tub in it; like a swimming pool! The restaurant downstairs was nice and convenient and the food good, but nothing to get too excited about. Next time I'll bring a friend.

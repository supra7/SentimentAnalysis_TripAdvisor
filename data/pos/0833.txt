I had seen the Inn at the Market a few years ago, and vowed that if I ever returned to Seattle, I'd stay there. I'm so glad I did. The Inn is literally 20 feet from Pike's Market. As you pull up to the valet, someone comes up immediately to help you into the courtyard entrance of the hotel. The lobby is cozy and inviting with the fireplace lit. Checking in was a snap. Our room was facing the street, but with a corner view of the harbor. The king room was spacious and very comfortable. A nice couch and sitting area made the room feel less cramped. The bathroom was clean and classically designed. A refrigerator was nice to store water. There is free Wi-Fi, but no business center to print. However, the staff at the front desk is more than helpful in printing anything you may need if you can direct them to the website. There is a outdoor patio overlooking the harbor. Obviously, it is to be enjoyed when the weather allows, but it looks lovely. Valet parking is available, but a little pricey. The staff is very accomodating and nice. All the past positive reviews about the Inn are true. I would definitely stay there again.

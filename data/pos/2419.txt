It's not often I stay at a hotel and don't have some suggestion on how they can improve. The Renaissance Hotel in Seattle was seamless. Great staff, great food, enough lifts, well equipped room, comfortable beds. It'd be easy to take this for granted, but it's so often not delivered that when it is right, it deserves recognition. They took great care of our delegation - I'd definitely stay again.

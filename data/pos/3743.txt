I stayed at The Edgewater Hotel this weekend, and I had a great time. Every staff member I dealt with from the front desk to the bell men to the restaurant staff were wonderful. The location is great. It's a little far from downtown, but the free shuttle helps with that. And honestly, taxis to Seattle Center or downtown are ridiculously cheap. The rooms do need an overhaul. Particularly with the HVAC. It was so humid and hot in the room. I put the temperature on the thermostat down to 61 (from 73) and it did almost nothing, even with the fan going. I had to have the window open, but the noise from the street was quite loud, particularly at night with the trains. Honestly, I think the whole problem could be solved by installing a window AC unit so that the window could remain closed and the temperature could be better relegated. There've been some complaints on the board about how small the room was, and it was certainly snug, but it wasn't uncomfortably so. The bathroom was fabulous. That is my new dream shower. All in all, I was happy. Make sure when staying there that you eat in the restaurant at least once, just for the view. The food is pretty good, too.

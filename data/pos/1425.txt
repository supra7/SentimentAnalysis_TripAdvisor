We blocked rooms at this hotel for our out-of-town guests at our October 2006 wedding in Seattle. The price was unbeatable, and the hotel has a certain charm with its garden entranceway. Definitely a step above a Holiday Inn or the other generic cheapy hotels. The rooms are really simple, but very clean, with tiny kitchenettes (in some cases a 2 burner stove and a toaster). The staff is incredibly friendly. Also, the location is fantastic, Queen Anne is charming and cool, with easy access to Seattle Center and Downtown. I just can't get over the quality of this hotel for the price (our guest paid $79/night). One friend called it "dormlike" but my dorm room was not this clean or cute. Our guests on a budget all had a good experience there. I believe they do free coffee in the lobby and free wine some evenings. All in all it was a fantastic option for budget-concious wedding guests. We also blocked rooms at the fancier but still affordable Marqueen, the sister hotel to this one which is right up the block. I highly recommend this hotel for super affordable, clean, cute, basic lodging.

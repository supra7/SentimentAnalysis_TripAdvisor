We stayed here for a couple of nights before our cruise, using Starwood points to book a room with lounge access. The hotel is usually busy with conventions as other reviewers have noted, and it was no different when we stayed here. That made for the public areas to be quite busy, but it did not affect service at the concierge or reception desks. The room itself was functional, though the carpets are probably a good 10-15 years old and need replacing. Size was decent by big city standards. The bathroom was clean and decently furnished, but again the tub and hair dryer need are showing their age. The lounge served excellent hot and cold breakfast. The best thing was the location - a 7 minute walk to Pike Place Market, 5 minutes walk from where the famous Duck Tours start, and 3 minutes walk from the wonderfully designed public library with the zany architecture (which is a must-see 30 minute activity). Pier 66 was about 10 minutes away by taxi, and cost us $12. From Seatac airport, we were able to get a limo service for $40. There's a lot of casual dining restaurant chains nearby - PF Changs, Applebees, Chipotle etc. And of course, you wont go 100 yards with a Starbucks! Overall, it was pretty OK for a short city visit and we would come back again if we want to use Seattle as a base to get to other places nearby.

We only stayed one night, but was very impressed with the service. I love good service. Front desk was friendly and helpful, as were the door men. We had happy hour in the bar Food was innovative, good and quick. Told the wait would be 20 minutes, went up to our room, came back down and maitre'd spotted us and lead us to a nice couch. Finished in time to attend a show at Jazz Alley. Nice job Hotel Monaco.

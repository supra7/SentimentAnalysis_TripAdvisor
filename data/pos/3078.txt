Got a room via Priceline for the 2nd week in July 08. Im not sure what sort of room they would call it, but it was probably the standard accommodation for 2 people. It was small yet efficient. Perfect for a one-night stay, but probably better to opt for a bigger room if staying longer. Was placed on the 27th floor and the view was fabulous. The bathroom was tiny and the water pressure a bit weak but there was plenty of counter space. For the low priceline price, it was very acceptable. The location was ideal. Walking distance to several of the downtown attractions. Valet parking per night is $38 with taxes included but then downtown Seattle is expensive to park in anyway. Valet, check-in/out and bellhop service was efficient and professional. Free internet with printer in the business center. This was quite helpful for checking in & printing my boarding passes for my upcoming flight.

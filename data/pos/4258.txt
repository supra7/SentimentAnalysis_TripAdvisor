This is a beautiful hotel right in the heart of downtown seattle. short walk to Pikes place market and a lot of hotels and shopping. The room was beautiful, the bed was very comfortable, the view was amazing, excellent blackout curtians. Many other reviews complained that it was run down and crowded. Although a very busy hotel we found it in excellent condition. every room has an amazing view we had a city view and enjoyed it so much. only possible improvements would be the showerhead was leaking and lacked some water pressure, the check in process took a very long time and the hallways smelled a bit like machine oil. I would not hesitate for a moment to book this hotel again.

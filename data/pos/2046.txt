Stayed with my husband and two teenage daughters in March. We did face the bay and I was happy that we could open the windows. Downside very loud on the weekends with ppl coming out of the clubs with drunken yelling. I'm sure earplugs would work, but didn't notice any noise from other guests. I liked our rooms with their high ceilings. we had two rooms that were adjoined by a bathroom. Each room had its own closet and TV. The kids room had 2 twin beds and an extra sink and mirror. All this for about 130.00 per night. We also had a microwave and frig. Very clean room, heat with radiator. Desk staff was adequate, not overly nice but not rude either. We had fun here, a little dicey neighborhood at night but I walked along and felt safe, but I live in a big city so I'm used to panhandlers and street ppl, but if your from a small town or the country this might not be the place for you. Only bad thing I could see was there was no A/C so a hot night/day in the summer might be very uncomfortable but perfect fall through spring. Walked everyday to Pikes place also walked to space needle just a mile or so, very close to lots of shopping and restaurants.

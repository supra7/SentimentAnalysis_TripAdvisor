We booked this hotel of a spur of the moment trip and we very happy with the service and ammenities. Our daughter was very happy with the pool. The hotel was perfectly clean and the staff very friendly. We really liked the complimentary breakfast......nothing fancy, but lots of choices. The waffles were excellent. They will even pack you a complimentary breakfast to go if you need to eat on the run. The only minor negatives were that the rooms were on the small side and the plumbing was noisiy. Nevertheless, we were very happy and would stay here again.

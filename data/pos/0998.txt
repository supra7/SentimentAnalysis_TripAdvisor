I surprised my husband with a trip to Seattle for our 20th anniversary. I had read the reviews and was very impressed that GM David Watkins replies to numerous reviews. I contacted him via his email and he assisted me in making my reservations. The staff was friendly and helped us with whatever needs we had. When we arrived in our room, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake waiting. Our room had a full waterview of Elliott Bay. It was beautiful. Inn at the Market is in the heart of Pikes Market area. My husband and I both agreed that it was fabulous to walk out of the hotel courtyard and already be in the middle of everything. It is within walking distance of so many attractions. We personally did not like the temperpedic bed, but if we had to do it all over again, we would STILL stay here. Our stay was wonderful and will be forever remembered!

My husband and I traveled to Seattle this past weekend and was very impressed with the Sixth Ave Inn. This was our first time is this beautiful city and we did not know any one. We were celebrating his 40th birthday. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and thoughtful. Upon returning to our room, my husband was surprised with a birthday card and gift. Alex and James were amazing!!!!! They gave us recommendations on where to eat, a map with all the sites clearly marked, and very clear directions. Our room was very clean and comfortable. If ever we're in Seattle, we will definitely stay here again.

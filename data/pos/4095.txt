My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time for our delayed honeymoon. We stumbled upon the Sorrento through a booking site and we are extrememly glad we did! It was perfect in every way. It was close to the downtown area, but off the beaten path. It still holds all the grace and charm of an older hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms were spectacular. Upon check in, the hotel had a bottle of wine, some chocolate, candy and a hand written note! The Sorrento also has french press coffee featuring a local coffee, which was absolutely delicious. The beds were so comfy and we never heard a sound from other rooms either. We also ate at the Hunt Club and would highly recommend that as well. The Sorrento helped to make our stay in Seattle memorable and enjoyable. Thank you!!

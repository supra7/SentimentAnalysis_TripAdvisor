My husband and I love this hotel - it is walking distance to both the Market and Safeco Field. The wine social is more like a party in the lobby with games, a fortune teller, a piano player, and all the wine/beer you can drink in an hour. And the staff is always friendly and helpful. This hotel is also pet-friendly with a resident dog that greets you in the lobby. Great place to stay!

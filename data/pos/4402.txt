My husband and I took a short 4 day trip to explore a new city on the way west coast, coming from the east coast of NJ. We had stayed at the Westin (Bonadventure) in Los Angeles years back and had a great experience so we picked the Westin again. Their rooms are a good size with plush king bed and sitting area with desk and internet connections looking out their curved windows. We asked for a higher floor upon checkin and they were very happy to accommodate us. We opted for their "go green" program which they would offer $ 5/ per night you choose to forego housekeeping svcs. Being it was 2 adults and no kids, we didnt have a problem and just asked for more towels and shampoos. The vouchers were good for the gift shop and the coffee shop which we used for a quick breakfast. The lobby is beautifully decorated with glass art pieces and a comfortable lounge area. we didnt get to use pool or exercise room since we had the city to explore. The location is great too, for goodies, snacks, medicine, down the street is a store, like a CVS and close to the Westlake Center where the Link Light Rail can be used to take to the SeaPac airport for $ 2.50/pp one way compared to hotel shuttle is $ 15/pp or cab is about $ 40..very convenient. also across is the Pacific Center , there is AMC movies, restaurants, shops. We love the Westin and would definitely go back there again, even with family and kids.

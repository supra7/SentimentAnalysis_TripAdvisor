My daughter and I travelled to Seattle from Vancouver for a day of shopping and the ballet. We showed up at 11 am and asked for early check in which was granted to us promptly and respectfully. The room was comfortable and tastefully furnished and the location is within blocks from Nordstroms, Macy's, Anthropologie, etc. Upon arrival later that night, at about 11 pm, we were greeted and when we asked where we could find a cup of tea, the front desk manager said he would immediately take care of that. Within 10 minutes we had at our door 2 cups of complimentary hot mint tea. Excellent service which made us feel pampered and valued. The beds are very comfortable, the heating system actually works and is responsive, and the rooms are quiet. Our stay at Hotel Monaco was our second stay, and we will most definitely be returning.

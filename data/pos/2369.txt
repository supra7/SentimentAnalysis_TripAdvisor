This hotel is very conveniently located next to I-5 and the Seattle Public Library. Easy walk to both Old Town and Shopping District/Pike Place. The valet parking was reasonable and service timely. The room service staff was very friendly. The room service menu is limited, but we found enough to satisfy. Some of the food was not up to our expectations. Did really enjoy the french toast for breakfast. The restaurants we ate at were a good value.

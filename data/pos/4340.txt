I've stayed at the Westin Seattle several times over the years & I have always loved the amazing views you get from the circle design. The rooms are spacious, but they seem to be getting a little worn around the edges. I think the large volume of convention traffic takes it toll on the hotel. If you don't mind long wait times for the elevators or continuous convention & cruise ship traffic, you will find a very nice hotel with amazing water & city views.

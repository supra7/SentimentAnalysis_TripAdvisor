THis hotel was very nice. The room we had was facing the needle. The soft sheets and large king bed was great. We had connecting rooms with the kids and friends down the hallway. The connecting room was on a curve of the hotel so the doorway had its own lil nook. The bar downstairs was great to hang out. The hotel clerks weren't very good at directions and the concierge was closed. Great location for walking Pike's Market and the new tram was nearby to get you to the Needle if you wanted. Drivers beware: Parking is VERY expensive...running from 25-40 a night extra for your car to spend the night with you at any of the area hotels. We paid it and walked every where as it is very difficult to even find parking. Most things you will need are within a 7 block walk, but bring a small umbrella and a light jacket.

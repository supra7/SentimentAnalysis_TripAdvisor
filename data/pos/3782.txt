We stayed for one night on the way to Vancouver and wished we could have stayed another couple of nights in this lovely hotel. Rooms are beautifully furnished in a rustic style with large comfy bed and gas fire which automatically came on in the evening. There were two fireside armchairs and foot stool. Bathroom was goregous with rain shower, freestanding antique bath and lovely toiletries. The window is right over the water and it is possible to see seals at times (this happened during a previous stay). Staff were friendly and helpful. Only ate lunch which was very good. Dining room and bar have the same lovely view over the water. Hope to return one day for a longer stay.

My husband and I have been going to this hotel for the past 20 years. Wow it is a hidden gem. The rooms are spotless, the service is always excellent. The location could not be better. I am very fussy with cleanliness especially the bathroom area.. I have simply NO complaints about this hotel. The rates are great and we would not use any other hotel. We look forward to our stay everytime we visit Seattle.

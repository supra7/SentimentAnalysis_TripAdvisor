We travelled across to Seattle from Victoria on the Ferry and spent 5 x nights at The Travel Lodge Seattle by the Space Needle. They had completed renovations 6 months earlier and I've got to say....EXCELLENT JOB! Great Location, one block from the space needle and monorail into town. The rooms were just beautiful, My husband and I had a King Bedroom and the teenagers had a room with twin beds. The buffet breakfast was really nice and the staff were very helpful. We would definately recommend to friends and come and stay again. Those of you who were there in 2003, GO BACK, YOU'LL LOVE IT! Family from Taupo, New Zealand

We're from B.C. and go to Seattle at least once a year for a few nights and have stayed at various places and out daughter was there with friends, looked at Hotel Andra and suggested we might want to check it out. We did just that and we love this hotel! It is quaint and comfortable, with a touch of cool. We like to park and walk and this is perfectly located for that. The staff was very friendly, attentive and professional. We love that there are little corners on the second floor where you can sit and have a drink, read a book, or whatever. Lola's for breakfast was phenomenal, their bacon is awesome and granola with yogurt unreal. We plan to return next year to Hotel Andra with a group of friends that we B & B with as an urban getaway, and really look forward to that experience!

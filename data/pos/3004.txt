I wanted to find a downtown hotel in Seattle for our pre cruise stay, I researched and found out how expensive hotels in Seattle were. So I went to Priceline and received a stay for $95/nt for three nights. I was very pleased with this hotel. We were in the new tower and it was lovely. Right outside the hotel was the Grayline double decker tour bus that you can take to all the sights. We walked to Pike Place market one morning and had breakfast at Lowells, walked around the stalls, and visited the waterfront. The Sheraton was in a fantastic location. A Walgreens was just a few blocks away and we stopped for a few items we had forgot to pack. The Cheesecake Factory was right behind the hotel, and delicious. Shopping was all around you. I would definately stay here again when in Seattle. No complaints whatsoever!

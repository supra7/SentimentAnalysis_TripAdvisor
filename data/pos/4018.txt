The Sorrento feels a bit different to the hotels I've stayed in recently; more characterful. Whether that's because the room keys are actually shaped like keys, rather than swipe cards, or because the carpet in the lift changes every day to inform you what day of the week it is, or that the whole place is decorated like it's still the 19th century, I'm not sure, but it's a change. This can be both good and bad. Because the electrical supply to the room isn't controlled by putting a card in a slot, you have to go and turn lights on and off individually, and when I arrived the room was quite chilly because the heater wasn't on. But then why waste power unnecessarily heating a room when it's unoccupied? The lights aren't as bright as I'm accustommed to, but then you get free wifi, which is always a decent thing to have. Bathroom and shower are very good; bed also, although I was awed that there were so many pillows on it. There's an embarrassment of televisions: a huge flatscreen in the living room and another in the bedroom. Staff were all very friendly: the concierge was very helpful finding me a barber and you generally felt very at home. The area around the hotel felt a little bit scruffy to me, but as it's winter the streets are devoid of anyone, so there's nobody to encounter that might make you feel threatened. I suppose Seattle in January may not be the best time to walk around outside in the hope of encountering people. Facilities are good - there's a decent restaurant (Hunts) and the gym in the basement is spacious and has some good equipment. All in all, a most pleasant stay for the weekend.

Stayed for 2 nights for great rate ($72/night Priceline). Front Desk staff very friendly and accomodating as usual. Even with Priceline booking they listened to our request for waterview room with 2 beds and received a great room no questions asked. Wonderful hotel for our semi-annual family Mariners getaways. Yes, hotel is a bit dated but overall very nice and clean. Parking tip - use the Westin building one block over which is attached by overhead walkway - much cheaper at $18/night.

My husband and I spent two nights here for our recent trip to Seattle. I had read reviews online before booking and read mostly positive comments so I thought we'd try it. I booked two nights online and got a $10 itunes giftcard when I checked in! The hotel is in a great location for walking around downtown. It was very clean and the staff was nice and helpful. The room was very comfortable, too. The room and the bathroom were on the smaller side (okay, they were small) but it was fine for us. We wanted to stay downtown and were on a budget. I was happy with the room and the location. My only complaint would be the a/c. I called the front desk and was told that it may take some time to cool off since it hadn't been on long. I turned it on and the room would not cool off. It was on all night and only moved the air around a little without getting much cooler. The next day I saw that housekeeping had a fan and we asked if we could use it. That night we opened the window (I thought they didn't open the first night) and had the fan pulling in the cool air and we slept great. I think this is a great option if you want to be within walking distance of the market, Pioneer Square, shopping downtown, etc. There are several trendier hotels nearby but they are also going to be a lot more expensive. This is an older hotel but I think they've done a good job updating it and making it look nice and stay comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and would just make sure I asked for a fan when I checked in or when I made the reservation. Also we took the Light Rail from Seatac for only $5 for the both of us and it stopped within a few blocks from the hotel which was great!

First visit to Seattle...first stay at a Westin....we loved both!!!! Our room was on the 36th floor with a beautiful view of the Space Needle! We took the hop on-hop off Grayline tour recommended by the concierge and it was great for getting to all the different parts of the city we wanted to see. At night we went to a Mariners game at Safeco field which was lots of fun.

From the time we entered the parking area we felt that Sera, Celena, Chris and Cisco had known us for a lifetime. The Town car they offer for their guests certainly solves the Taxi issue and the Driver Chris was terrific for dining and sight seeing recommendations. Upon entering we had a cigar room odor problem and without question Adam changed our room and gave us aroom upgrade for our inconvenence. We would recommend this Hotel any day any time. Super cudos to their management and support staff for making our stay very enjoyable.

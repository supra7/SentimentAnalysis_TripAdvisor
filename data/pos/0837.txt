I visitied Seattle for a weekend before a week of business in Bellvue. It was my first time in the Pacific northwest, so I wanted to be as close as possible to the action in Seattle while staying somewhere comfortable so I could get over my jetlag. Inn on the Market certainly delivered both! Location: literally a hop, skip and jump from the Pike Place Market, and in easy walking reach of most attractions (Space Needle, Pioneer Square, Belltown, International District... the list goes on). Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. A great place for someone new to Seattle to get their bearings. Comfort: this is a really charming boutique hotel. It's got soul, plus all of the tick-boxes: enormous comfy bed, spacious bathroom, nice robes, warm cosy lobby with fire, great staff, excellent food in the restaurants (we had breakfast at Bacco both mornings - truly great coffee, I'm Australian so I know about these things). It's also got free wifi, which is so nice after being rorted by countless big hotels for use of their network, and a beautiful deck from which you can admire the Puget Sound. The only criticism I would make is that the air conditioning in the room was quite loud and would go on and off intermittently throughout the day and night. Not a problem for me as I wear earplugs anyway (conditioned by years of city living) but it has the potential to be an issue if you are a sensitive sleeper. All in all I would recommend Inn at the Market to anyone: couples, business travellers, families. It's great. Just book it.

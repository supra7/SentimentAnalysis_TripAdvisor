Our stay at the sheraton was satisfactory for our short stop in Seattle. We got a great deal on hotwire so can't complain about the price. Unfortunately, there was some small issues - - foyer noise the first and second night was beyond what we would ordinarily expect, the curtains don't close completely which lets the light stream in very early, the pillows are ordinary and the sheets felt over-starched to the point that i felt like i was sleeping under newspaper at times. However, the location is very central and that was top of our list for our stay. Nothing special but certainly more than adequate for our needs if we could get the same hotwire price again - approx $USD420 for 3 nights.

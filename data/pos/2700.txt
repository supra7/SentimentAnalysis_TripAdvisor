Sometimes, extremely large conference hotels can be soulless and impersonal. I found, though, that the staff here offered a warm welcome, making me feel as much at home as could be expected in such a swarming venue. The room was comfortable, and good views are available from the higher floors, either towards the mountains or towards the waterfront. Excellent choice of tea and coffee in the room, with the Earl Grey being particularly delicious. Check-in and check-out were accomplished with a minimum wait time. I found the fact that the restrooms on the first floor needed an access code for entry was a nuisance (as people can sometimes be in a hurry!), but I guess this is thought necessary for security.

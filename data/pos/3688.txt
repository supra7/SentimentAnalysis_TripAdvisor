We were staying at another local hotel who had recommended the Edgewater for excellent breakfasts so we came down. We enjoyed it so much we booked in for Waterfron Rooms for our return from Portland and when we saw the rooms it was perfect. The dinner on Friday night was so tasy for all of us and the band was good as was the whole atmosphere with the staff being great, telling us a lot about the history what to do in Seattle. We all felt this was the best and most enjoyable hotel stay in terms of food, room quality and enjoyment for a long time.

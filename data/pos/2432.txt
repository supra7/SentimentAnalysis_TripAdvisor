My wife and I took an overnight trip to Seattle to enjoy the holiday season and have a break from the kids while visiting grandma's house. The Renaissance Seattle Hotel made great trip, a outstanding trip! The room was 5-star quality; we slept on a comfy king size bed and woke up to a beautiful morning overlooking the city of Seattle from the 24th floor! The restuarant was a great choice for breakfast with a overly friendly staff and a great breakfast at very competitive prices! The whole hotel staff would go out of their way to serve us and ensure our stay was the best possible! I can't say enough good things about our stay and the great things about the hotel. We will definitely be back for a night's stay or even just to have a meal! Only negative comment: I-5 could cause a problems if you are a light sleeper... if so ask for the other side of the hotel. This didn't bother us, but we are heavy sleepers.

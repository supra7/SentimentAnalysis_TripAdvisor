The Westin, Seattle is located in the heart of the downtown area. Hotel is adjacent to the monorail line - which runs to the Seattle Center (Space Needle area) .Two twin circular towers - north and south, make up the room floors for this hotel. The circular design of the building gives some pleasant aesthetics to the rooms as the windows are gently curved and go from the floor to ceiling. While the building is not new, this design element gives an elegant look to the shape of the rooms and interior. Interior of the rooms are done in soft beige tones. Coordinating colors throughout the room and bath area. Dual shower heads and a Toto toilet add to the nice touches. Ice machines are on every floor. King size bed was very comfortable although the pillows were a bit flat. Flat screen TV and a cordless telephone was present in the room. Now the devil in the details - The pool is out of commission - they say until the end of May 2009. The front desk offered to reimburse taxi fare if we went down to the Sheraton to use the pool there. To some it may be 'Sleepless in Seattle' but the reality is its usually 'Raining in Seattle'. The Sheraton is too far especially if you're just looking to use the pool with kids. Valet parking is a staggering $38 a night and self park is $30 a night. Not even a block away you can find parking lots for $17 a night and they are run by a national parking company. Overall the Westin, Seattle is a solid 4 star hotel - Assuming the pool out of commission is a once in a blue moon oddity - i'll let it slide for now. If you book on a deal site like Priceline or Hotwire, this hotel can be had for an exceptional value.

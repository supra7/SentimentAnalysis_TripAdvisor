My wife and I took a couple of nights for a mini-vacation during our Christmas Holiday. WIth it's 1912 character, convenient access to the monorail and great restaurants in the neighborhood he Marqueen was a great choice for us. It reminded me of the first apartment I had in Victoria. The noise abatement windows did a great job of blocking out the street noise. The sunset views of Puget Sound were (of course) gorgeous. The breakfast bar was a waste of time, but Caffe Ladro on the first floor was quite nice. I would also wholeheartedly recommend Toulouse across the street.

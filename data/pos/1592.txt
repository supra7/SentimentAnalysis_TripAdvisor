My daughter and I bought a promotional package for 2 nights at this hotel that included breakfast and valet service. Our goal was to do a bit of shopping, rest, and go out for drinks and dinner. The location enabled us to do just that. Breakfast was great, as was the valet service. The hotel was quiet and elegant. Our room was fine but needed a bit of updating. The only disappointment was at Oliver's. We decided to go for a drink at Oliver's since it is so famous for martinis. Both the martini and the gin and tonic we ordered were very small and neither of us tasted any gin at all. My daughter had visited the lounge before and she said they loved the drinks here then. It was a relaxing and fun trip and we would return if a promotional package came along.

The hotel is in an excellent location for touring Seattle and the surrounding areas. Being on the waterfront is amazing. The entire staff of this hotel is excellent in the way it handles its customers. Everyone from the cleaning crew all the way up to management is superb except for the person who ran the gift shop who tended to be on break everytime i tried to purchase something from it. However, the Valet was rather expensive at $34 a night. There is no option other than valet. We had a family room suite. The room was nice but the beds were rather small for two people to share. Queen size beds would have been more appropriate. If you are a light sleeper, any room facing the city will have the constant train noises throughout the night due to the number of trains that pass on the tracks in front of the hotel. The bathroom was a slight problem for some of the shorter individuals in our group because of the shower. The shower was a dual type that had a traditional shower head with a flowing water shower head. There was a valve on the top that was very hard to reach and turn. The restaurant at the hotel is excellent. We ate there several times including breakfast, lunch and dinner and each time the food and the wait staff was excellent.

My wife and I stayed at the Inn at the market for two nights. First it is only 150 feet to the Pike Market,and close to most other site seeing, such the Seattle Aquarium, Undergroung tour and the monorail that takes you to the space needle. We had a city view which means your room may face 1st Ave. We heard some noise, but it wasn't that bad. If you need total silence ask for a water view or a city view on a high floor. The front desk was wonderful, let us check in early. We checked our bags and they called us as soon as the room was ready. We found the room to be clean, and the bathroom was huge. Overall for the price,location and service, I believe the Inn at the Market is the best deal you are going to find.

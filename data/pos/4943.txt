Our favorite hotel in Seattle has been the VIntage Park, over the years we have stayed there several time and had outstanding service and an excellant room every time, I would consider this a 4 Star hotel. But this last visit (August 2011) our loyality had cracks appear. First at check in we arrive at 1:30 PM, early we knew so we went out to have lunch. Returning back at 3:15 PM they told us the staff were behind in room cleaning. So we waited another hour. 4:15, still no rooms ready for us. Completely different than any visit here in the past, it wasn't until 5:15 PM that our room was ready! Once settled in the room, things seemed back on track until 2:15 AM! When other guests on our floor came back to their rooms, talking loud, slamming doors, I would have never thought I was in the Vintage Park Hotel, maybe a Holiday Inn, but not the VIntage Park. The last somewhat disappointment was the bath towel size, they seem to have gotten smaller, maybe its just me, but they really seemed tiny! So, was it the full moon? Was it one of those things? Was it the wave of the future? Who knows, leaving the hotel, I knew I could not return the hotels to a 4 star class and was not even sure we would return for another stay, BUT.... My faith was restored in the Vintage Park when I received a call the next morning, from the hotels Manager. I did not prompt this call. As near as I can figure out the front desk people knew we were unhappy, and took thier own initiative to mention it to the Managers. The Manager apologized for our bad experience (even though it may have not been their fault) and asked us to give them one more chance! Wow! A very good outcome to something going down hill fast! The Vintage Park Hotel will be seeing us again! Great Location, walking distance to everything!

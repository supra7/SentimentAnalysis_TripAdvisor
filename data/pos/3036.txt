The hotel is in an excellent position on the corner of 6th and Pike, within easy walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the monorail over to the Space Needle at Seattle Center. There are lots of shopping areas around, and the restaurants and bars of Capitol Hill are within 15-20 minutes walking distance. Check in and concierge service were efficient and friendly. We had a Priceline deal of $75 a night. The room was on the 17th floor, in the corner, and somewhat smaller than most other rooms in the hotel. The room was fairly clean although some old stains were visible in the bathroom. A large screen TV, Starbucks coffee-maker, and an iron were supplied. A daily newspaper (USA Today) was left outside the door on weekday mornings. There is a mini-bar, and some snacks available for a high price in the room; an ice machine was near the lifts. The king-size bed was comfortable and we slept well. The gym and pool on the top floor was well equipped, with great views. Free wi-fi was available in the lobby, along with five computers (and a further terminal dedicated for airline check-ins). The lobby was always very busy, possibly due to the conventions being held in the hotel. Our stay was comfortable if unexceptional, with no problems encountered.

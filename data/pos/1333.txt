Terriffic hotel well located in the heart of down Seattle, but a real pain to get to with the cities one way system. I can see the hotel but how the hell do I get to it!! Superb Club level room with emaculate white linen, large and spacious with great veiws of the city, Rennaisance hotel and the freeway. Room service was efficient and well presented (and tasted good). Only problem we had was the wife went down with serious food poisoning from one of the fast food joints in the mall. A major problem in Seattle I'm led to believe. Overall I couldn't fault the hotel in the Emerald City, from its clean and upmarket lobby to the efficient maid service, this hotel makes you feel at home. Would certainly stay here next time I visit the city.

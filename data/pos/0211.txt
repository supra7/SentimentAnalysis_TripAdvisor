I would definitely stay here again. We have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and each experience has been great. The overall vibe of the hotel from the coffee service in the morning to the wine tasting in the evening in the hotel lobby was excellent. We have found their hotels offer a unique experience to other places we have stayed and we travel a lot with our kids. They had goldfish in our room! Our room had 2 queen beds, our girls are 7 and 10 and we never felt crowded or uncomfortable. Great location, close to everything (walking distance).

My husband and I visiting Seattle for a wedding, and we decided to book a hotel on Hotwire. We got the Westin for $99/night and received excellent service, a gorgeous room, and thoroughly enjoyed our great location near Pike Place. There were even items missing from the minibar when we arrived, and the Westin didn't charge us for them -- no questions asked.

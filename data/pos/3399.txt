We have been in a couple of hotels that belongs to the Small Luxury Hotels and we have been really pleased with them, but Andra wasn't for us up to those standards. It is well located downtown Seattle, if you don't have a car. There are a lot of places you can walk to, even the Speace Needle isn't really far and you can take the monorail to come back. Restaurants like The serious Pie are just a block away. The bed was good, however our bedroom was very small, and the bathroom too but with modern finishes. It's not really a room to relax, just to go to sleep after a day of exploring the City. Our bedroom was at the end of the corridor, above of the restaurant's kitchen so we get the food smell (it was good) but the fans were noisy if you open the windows. They charge for wifi and parking is really expensive. We didn't have any incident but the service was not outstanding how it has been in the other Small Luxury Hotels we have stayed before.

We spent four nights here on a sightseeing trip to Seattle and selected hotel based on location. Were we right here! We took the light rail Link in from the airport for $1.25 each (senior rate) and got off at the end - Westlake Center. From there we had some initial difficulty finding the entrance into the hotel even after asking the guards. At Westlake Center one can pick up the Link, the monorail to Space Needle, the free buses. Plus one can walk to Pike Market in about 10 minutes. We upgraded to a Deluxe Queen which had about 265 square feet and took the breakfast package. The food in the hotel Andaluca's (where we ate breakfast and had one dinner) and loved the bar lounge Oliver's where we went every night for drinks and appetizers. Light snacks and sandwiches here - could be your dinner. Lots of locals drop in to bar. Very lively and young. Even though hotel was built in 1927 and it does feel old, bathroom is modernized and staff service is outstanding. Really helpful people. We plan on staying here at our next visit in about 6 months.

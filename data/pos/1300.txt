We checked in early around 2pm. on thursday Sep. 10, the day before our cruise to Alaska. The clerk (rookie?) gave us a small folder with all our coupons and paperwork for room 2353. So, we wait for the elevator and up to our room. But she forgot to put the key cards with the rest of the stuff. Back down to retrieve them. The room had a view and noise of the freeway next to us. The room seemed a lot smaller than the last Crowne Plaza (Houston) that we stayed at, though. And not as nice. The room was ok for the night. We paid $173 plus tax ($199.99 total) for the cruise package. This included the room, 2 breakfast buffets, and 2 shuttle tickets to the cruise terminal. Celebrity left from the Bell Pier, which the shuttle goes to on the 1/2 hour. (On the hour it goes to the other pier.) We left CP after 11:30 and got to ship around noon, when everyone else did. What a mess! We had asked the bell hop about leaving at 10:30, and he told us that was too early. Big mistake. We had planned on checking back in at CP after the cruise. But decided to leave Seattle when the ship docked, and stop in Las Vegas for the weekend. We had flown SW Airlines from Austin to Seattle, so it was easy to change. Thanks SWA. I am a Priority Club Member and thought we would get upgraded to a room with a nice view. Silly me! They didn't even greet me as PCM. Oh well Las Vegas was fun.

My husband had business in Seattle and I accompanied him for the two night visit. The hotel was charming, the staff very efficient and made us feel most welcome. Loved the older type hotel, had a charming ambiance, nice break from big chain hotels. Location is good, short walk to waterfront, plenty of cafes nearby to get espresso, speaking of coffe they had french press in room to make coffee which was a very nice touch. We valeted our car at the hotel, it is more than the public parking garages but not by much and when you consider you have access to your car 24/7 worth the extra money, valets were qucik and very nice. We did not dine at the hotel, but I did use the gym which was good for a hotel. Part of my visit I choose to just stay in the room rather than walk around city because I found it so comfortable and appealling. Usuually do not do reviews, but thought this hotel deserved it. Both my husband and I would look forward to staying there again.

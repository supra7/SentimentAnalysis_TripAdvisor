The other reviews seem to have it right - best part about this place is the location. Easy walking distance to everywhere. We were on the top floor, so we weren't kept awake by any street traffic, but I can't vouch for the lower rooms. Reception were friendly, and the price is great for Seattle. Only negative points were a dingy little bathroom and a fairly small lift, but who cares?

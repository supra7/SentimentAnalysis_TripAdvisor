I took my wife to Seattle for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. We stayed at Inn at the Market for three nights and had a great time. We reserved an awesome room on the 6ish floor that had a great view. The service was excellent, and the room was comfortable and clean. The location is outstanding -- close to eveyrhing. We took the monorail to the Space Needle, and then walked back to the hotel -- very nice walk with great views. We also took the Duck tour which was a lot of fun.

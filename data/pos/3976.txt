GREAT location: close to excellent restaurants (newly remodeled Elliot's was fantatstic) and beautiful walking/jogging waterfront park next door. GREAT service: bellman offered to shuttle us to restaurants, car always arrived fast, front desk moved rooms quickly when one was a bit noisy (from fog horn/train), bellman got me a cup of hot tea in the morning at no charge when I was waiting for my jogging partner, etc. - everyone helpful and wanting to please. THE ROOM - FANTASTIC: all-new bathroom with slate floors and shower, big claw foot tub, shoji screens so you can sit in the bath and look out over the water; flip-on fireplace with furry footrest, comfy chairs; good size desk with adequate plugs, wifi ($7/hr or $10/day); all amenities in room - full iron/board, coffee maker, hairdryer, lighted makeup mirror; high quality towels, bedding, shampoo, etc.; THE BAR/RESTAURANTS: gorgeous, on the water, great meeting place for business or pleasure. THE PRICE - WOW: just $149/night on Hotwire. THE SMELL? - I was on the lookout for a moldy smell from other Tripadvisor reviews, but there was none. ONLY COMPLAINTS - exercise room was small, only 3 or 4 cardio machines. But it is accessible 24 hours.

We chose the hotel because we had booked a gourmet walking tour which started in the hotel lobby and stayed for two nights. We found the hotel stay very pleasant with particular helpfulness of the staff. The concierge service , for example had free entry to the Japanese Garden made available to us. The location is excellent for walking to Pike Street , the Wharf or the Convention Centre., the Art Gallery and downtown. The room was rather small but well appointed and maintained. Breakfast at the restaurant was excellent and Oliver's was pleasant for an apperitif.. We certainly would use them again (and take the gourmet tour again also)

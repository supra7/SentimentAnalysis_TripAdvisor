Found the Mayflower Park Hotel on tripadvisor of course. Love the traditional decor and the location is great...Macy's is across the street and Nordstrom's is a block away. Not only was the room comfortable (if available request a corner room...a little more spacious and nice city views). And, a wonderful surprise is the hotel bar, Oliver's. Happy hour every day at 4:30 with great martini's & food and interesting locals to chat with while people-watching out of the corner windows behind the bar. Great restaurants, Pike's Market and Seattle Art Museum are walking distance. If you don't want to walk in the rain, this is a hub for all the major transportation available. Definitely a nice small hotel with good service at a reasonable price.

After reading all the very mixed reviews on this site about the Westin, I understandably had some fears about what I might expect upon arrival for the 3-day Seattle segment of my vacation last week. Thankfully, those fears were quite unfounded and I had a great time staying at the Westin. As suggested by another reviewer, I booked an (admittedly) pricey room just so I could experience the views of the city/Space Needle/Puget sound, and I was not disappointed. I actually arrived before check-in and though I had been booked into a room on the 31st floor which was not ready yet, the gracious front desk clerk upgraded me (as I was a SPG rewards member) to an enormous ... I mean enormous ... room on the 39th floor! Unfortunately, the bathroom didn't have a separate Heavenly Shower/soak tub like other Westins, but the sweeping wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling view and the huge living space more than made up for it (room was furnished with a king-size Heavenly bed as well as a double sleep sofa with plenty of room to spare.) The hotel's location could not be beat either ... within walking distance to all of Seattle's major attractions and neighborhoods. All in all, I can say that I was very pleased to have stayed at the Westin and will do so again the next time I'm in the Emerald City!

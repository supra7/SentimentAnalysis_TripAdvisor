This hotel is a real gem, located really near to Pike Place market. The rooms were amazing. We had a view on the harbour with huge windows. We could have easily spent our whole time in the room. The bed was amazingly comfortable. There is a great little antiques market near the hotel and great restaurants in the vicinity. We were able to walk to the space needle (about 15-20mins) but there are several options for public transport. The Aquarium is also near by and well worth a visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

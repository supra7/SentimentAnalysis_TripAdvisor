My husband and I stayed in the Westin Seattle and were especially pleased with the convenient location. It is within walking distance of many tourist attractions and near restaurants/bars. Other reviewers commented upon the small rooms; however, ours was a spacious room with clean and modern furnishings. The buildings (there are two towers to the Westin) are circular, which gave the room a 'rounded-edge' look... but I felt this added to the charm of the room. The room/window shape also helped add to the panoramic view - which was gorgeous! We could see the Seattle skyline, Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountain Range from our hotel room window. The bathroom, though clean and somewhat updated, was very small and not what I would call "modern." This was really the only 'negative' I had with our experience at Westin. Our room was soundproofed well. We never heard outside noise, yet we were directly next to the elevator. The staff was friendly and accommodating - even allowing us very early check-in. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable. This is not a new hotel... nor is it one of the glorious older hotels. Therefore, it does not have the charm of the older hotels nor the totally modern updates of a brand new hotel. What is DOES have is exceptional staff members, clean rooms, comfortable beds, a convenient location and some of the best views in Seattle.

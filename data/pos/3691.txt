The Edgewater Hotel in Seattle has been there since the '60s when it was "the" place for rock stars. The Beatles, Roy Orbison, Mick Jagger & the Stones as well as anybody who was anybody in those days stayed at this great hotel. You used to be able to fish from your rooms in those days. The hotel sits out over the water...the only one like this...in Puget Sound. You just can't get any closer. If you fell out your window, you'd be in the water. There is a great bar and restaurant, beautifully designed, and part of the bar edges around the restaurant, outside. Food is great too. Rooms are not very fancy, nor big, but have so much 'woodsy' character and such terrific views, that the place is hard to beat. Within walking distance along Alaskan way to all the waterfront restaurants. Just next door to the Victoria ferry terminal, and on the otherside, there's a cruise ship dock. Up a few blocks is the main shopping center for Seattle's downtown area, and the monorail which goes to the Seattle Space needle. Cannot say enough about this wonderful Hotel and its perfect location. Oh yes, and on Thursday evenings, the Seattle Yacht Club has its sailing races and the boats get so close to the rooms and the main lobby and restaurant that you can see the faces on the sailors. Just phenomenal!

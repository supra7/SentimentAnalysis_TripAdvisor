After reading reviews on the Moore, my wife an I chose to stay here based on price and location. We were not disappointed. Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value. Our only knock would be that there was no A/C, which could be a problem on a very hot day as the room gets full afternoon sun.

Overall, I had a good stay. I did not purchase anything at the hotel restaurants so I can't say anything about the food there. I was disappointed that the gift shop did not have milk, and I wasn't about to pay what they wanted in the restaurant for a glass of milk. I didn't try the swimming pool and workout area. The main reason is that they were in a separate tower. It seemed a little inconvenient to take the elevator down, walk across the lobby to the other tower and then take the elevator up to wherever that was located. I was also disappointed in the internet service. I tried to connect from my room, but the connection was slow and did not work for very long. I eventually went downstairs to the lobby to use the free internet which worked much better. The hotel was very good about refunding the price of the internet service that I had paid for, but if they are going to make you pay they should at least offer dependable service. Another thing that I didn't like is that they did not give me all of the credit for my stay with the Starwood points program. I only got credit for $2 worth of expenses for a 4 night stay, so I had to send proof of my expenses to get credit for the rest of the expenses. Otherwise, I was satisfied with the room. It was a good size, and everything was in working order. But I definitely wouldn't call this an "Excellent" stay.

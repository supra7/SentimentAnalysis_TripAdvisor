Stayed for one night with my family when visiting Seattle. There were 5 of us (2 adults and three young adult daughters) and we weren't picky about sleeping arrangements, so we all stayed in one room (two queen beds and a pullout). Plenty of room for one night, the kitchenette was nice even though we didn't have time to use it much. Beautiful weather so we walked everywhere, but buses and monorail are also an option. This was more affordable than chain hotels in the downtown/Seattle Center area and had more character. Staff was very helpful. We could see the Space Needle from our window, not too far away! Only very minor inconveniences from this being an older hotel were not many electrical outlets and only one mirror in the bathroom. Head directly up the (steep) hill past the hotel for a great view of the skyline, mountain and Space Needle and some beautiful homes in the Queen Anne neighborhood! Wish we could have stayed more than one night!

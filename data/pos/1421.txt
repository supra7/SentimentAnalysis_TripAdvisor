This hotel is NOT for anyone who actually appreciates the sterility, anonymity, & tiresome consistency of a big-box hotel! The room furnishings are simple but tasteful, the bathrooms are small and showers sufficient but far from luxurious, the closets are enormous, the windows actually open, and the old-fashioned hot-water radiators quietly gurgle and clank. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic. We will recommend the Inn at Queen Anne to all our friends.

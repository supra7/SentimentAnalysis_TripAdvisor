I was in town for a convention from June 7-11. Great location: This was an awesome location for shopping, dining, and walking distance to Pike Place. The convention center was literally a block away but not connected to the hotel. Hotel dining: I did not utilize room service but for being a Westin, I expected a little bit more. There is only a Ruth Chris and a Starbucks at this location. Room: Very nice room that can fit two people comfortably.

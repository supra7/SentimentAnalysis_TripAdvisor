My wife and I stayed in this hotel during a recent vacation and were very pleased! The hotel is centrally located near all of the major Seattle attractions that everyone wants to see: Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, etc. It wasn't just the central location that was wonderful about the hotel, but also the attention of the staff. On our way into town, my wife called the hotel to ask about a local place that she could go to to get a pedicure. They not only provided the name of the shop, but made the reservation for her. We also asked about a great restaurant to try and they were not only happy to provide a name, Cutters (check out my review about them!), but also had the restaurant send over their free shuttle. Our room at the hotel was like stepping back in time. The room was spacious and very comfortable, with beautiful furniture and fixtures. The bathroom was also wonderful. Everything was also very clean. In the end, the staff, facilities, and location all added up to a hotel that we will definitely visit again during our next trip to Seattle.

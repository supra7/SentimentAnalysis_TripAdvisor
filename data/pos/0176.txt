My husband and I spent 2 nights in this hotel as part of our honeymoon. The room was spacious, clean, quirky and comfortable. We received amazing service from the hotel staff and they even provided us with a bottle of champagne and fruit platter on arrival. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It has real character and style. Something which is lacking in so many others.

Had an enjoyable 2 night stay here in a central location in downtown Seattle. The hotel is 5 minute to central shopping area and 10 minutes to Pike Place markets. It is also only 10 minutes to the waterfront but beware the steep climb to come back that way. The University St SoundLink light rail station is only a block away which is convenient for traveling to/fro SeaTac airport. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and was promptly checked in on the 4th floor in a smallish room but it was clean and looked quite modern. Not a bad look for an older style building. They are currently renovating the 5th floor and 1 of the elevators. The current elevators are old and pretty slow and I found myself running the stairs most times but that would not be practical if you were on a higher floor or had luggage. The lobby and mezzanine level with the free business centre looks great. I went downstairs and asked the front desk for some dining out suggestions for the Sunday night and they had no ideas for me, suggested I order pizza delivery. As I wasn't feeling like pizza I took a walk and found heaps of places within a few blocks and decided on eating at a British pub.

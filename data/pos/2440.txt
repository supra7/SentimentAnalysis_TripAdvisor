We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights ,our first night was the freeway view and we requested a room with city view for the next night and it was no problem. Staff is very friendly and helpful. For some people it might be a problem walking from downtown to the hotel, it is very hilly and if you are not used to walking, this could be a problem. The room are very comfortable and clean.

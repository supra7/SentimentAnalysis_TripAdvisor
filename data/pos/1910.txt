We were in town for a family wedding on Memorial Weekend. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Two women traveling together could not ask for a better room. Our room had two beds and two bathrooms. The beds are so comfortable you could get spoiled. Great view from our 8th floor room. The room is not that large but for the amount of time we spent in the room it was perfect for us. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown. Bring your walking shoes. We visited the space needle, pike's market, numerous restaurants, and did lots of shopping. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Even if you don't have dinner in the hotel restaurant I would recommend dessert. We would stay here again.

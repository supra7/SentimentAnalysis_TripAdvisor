The hotel is located in a great location a few blocks from several attractions such as the Space Needle, Seattle Aquarium and a great shopping district. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nicely decorated and the view of Elliot Bay is spectacular. Area recommendations Just visiting places around Seattle (city) would be nice. Do visit Alki beach, maybe to Salty's. Seeing the city from the ferry to Bainbridge Island was beautiful.

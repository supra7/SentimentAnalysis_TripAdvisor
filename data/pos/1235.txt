We booked this hotel through hotwire and got an amazing deal of around $100 last summer. They upgraded us to one of the top floors and the view was incredible. Location wise, it's great for walking around, as it's right downtown. Rooms were modern and very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable as well. The service was great. Having booked through hotwire before, past experience has showed me that sometimes hotels treat you a little differently. This was not the case for Crowne Plaza Seattle. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.

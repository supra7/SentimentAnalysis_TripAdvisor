Great two night stay at the Westin at the start of our holiday. Perfect location for exploring the City, whichever direction you are heading. We booked a high level room in the Norh Tower which justified the price and we would recommend - the views are terrific both by day and night. Room was very comfortable and clean and the beds are fantastic. Service was ok but not particularly personal - something we accept from a busy and probably mainly business orientated hotel (don't stay here if a steady stream of conference delegates would bother you). The cafe and room service were both great. The hotel would have got a five from us had any one helped us with our luggage or valet park the car on our arrival but apart from that, no complaints.

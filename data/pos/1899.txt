The Mayflower Park is within walking distance to Pike Place Market (don't go there on a week-end if you can help it) and all the shoping you could ever desire. Really nice stores. It it also next to the monorail stop and convenient to the new sculpture park at the waterfront. It is clean and comfortable and a real treat from the chains. Service was good. Parking was about 19-$20/day, I think. The restaurant is well regarded by our local friends although we did not eat there on this trip. Thisd is a nice place downtown that I'd stay in again. Veryy convenient to Seattle University.

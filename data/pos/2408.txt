We got off our ship & were at the hotel about 9am. We thought we would have the hotel hold our bags until check in time. We went to the front desk to let them know we would be back & they went ahead a gave us our room right then. Very nice...very unexpected. The staff at the front desk were wonderful! We used the concierge several times during our stay, they were very friendly & very helpful. The room had a fabulous view. We had a king size bed. I think it was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever had. We would definately book this hotel again. The only draw back was that it was at the top of the hill on the outskirts of the downtown area. Seattle does have the "free bus" area, which included this hotel, so we were able to use that very easily. We did walk down the steep hill once but took the bus back up. Unless you are fit you would want to take the bus or a taxi.

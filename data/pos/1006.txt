This is a great little boutique hotel. It is expensive but you get all the services you pay for - newspaper in the morning, spacious and clean room, free Wi-Fi in the room, beautiful view of the Market and Peuget Sound, express check-out. They also offered free valet parking since we traveled off-season, which is really important if you are traveling with a car - most other hotels charge upwards of $40 a night if you want to park overnight. We pretty much just left our car in the parking lot because we were literally half a block from the Pike Place Market and most of downtown can be explored on foot anyway. Be sure to view the city from the 5th floor rooftop deck!

We recently stayed at the Moore Hotel & had a great experience. No frills, for sure, but our room was big, clean & comfortable. It is centrally located, we could walk to almost everything Seattle has to offer. And the staff was super friendly & helpful, especially Bob at the front desk. The only negative is the hotel is on a busy street, so bring earplugs!!

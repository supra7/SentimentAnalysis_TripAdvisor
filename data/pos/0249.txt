I stayed at the Hotel Monaco years ago and it was great. I've also been to the Kimpton properties with this name in SF and Salt Lake City. My most recent stay had so many weird staff behavior things that I thought I was staying at the Tower of Terror Hotel. But I really like the hotel -- it's very clean and comfortable. The bar/restaurant is great too. The first encounter was when I went to the elevator after checking in. When I was waiting for the elevator, two housekeeping staff were sitting on the couch next to the elevator and the staff door was open with another person talking to them. So I was witnessing the staff breakroom there on my floor next to the elevator! The next odd staff encounter happened when a housekeeper followed me to my room and yelled in bad English asking when I'd be leaving for the day. I told her a time. But then when I went to leave before that time, she chased me to say she didn't realize I was checking out. ok .... Lastly, I checked out and told the front desk that I needed to check bags. I was late to my conference. They called the bell services and then I waited and waited right in front of the front desk at a chair. Finally, I asked for an update and they called again. I was right in front of them waiting impatiently with my bags looking at my watch and they couldn't help! The staff need some help with training. Otherwise, this is a top notch hotel. Very clean, great location, awesome perks with wine in the afternoon and coffee in the morning, and a nice bar/restaurant.

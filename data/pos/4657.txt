My husand and I renew our vows this summer, and wanted to go on a small vacation, we chose seattle because of it's beauty. When we arrived at our hotel, (westin seattle) our dinner there was prefect, not to mention we met the entire cast of Grey's anatomy, the hotel was a 4 star, but spend a little more money and get a room on the top floors. It really is a beautiful, beautiful city, we both loved it. However, we witness a shooting while we were there and it tore us apart. We were right there! But still, we made the best of the rest of the trip.

We stayed here Sept.14-17,2005. We loved the hotel. Room was great and location was fine. We thought the hotel room was superior to most of the four star hotels we have stayed in. Large room plus the hotel is cirular therefore room has uniqueness to it. Priceline rate 141 plus tax and other charges.

We stayed for just one night before a ferry trip to Victoria. We looked at three rooms before we finally settled on one with an amazing view of Elliot Bay out to Bainbridge. We watched the classic boats leave the harbor, saw jellyfish swimming under our window and waved to the cruise ship travellers. Wine list was decent, service for bar/appetizers was a bit slow, we moved to the bar. Service at the front desk was terrific, they held our luggage until check-in, remembered my husband's birthday (I wasn't even aware I'd mentioned it when making the reservation) and remained very patient while we "room shopped" before check in. We used their shuttle service, no need for a car. Perfect location for our needs, just walk to Pike's, downtown, etc. I left a favorite sweater in the closet and realized it two days later. They found it, wrapped it and kept it at the front desk until we came back through town. We love the Edgewater and hope to stay there again someday.

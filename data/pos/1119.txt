We stayed at the Ace hotels in Portland, New York and Seattle on our most recent trip to the states and while we loved them all, the Seattle Ace was definitely not in the same league as the others (although it was also a lot cheaper). It was more like a trendy hostel than a hotel. That said, the staff were incredible, our room was cute (but very small), and the small touches (like stumptown coffee in the breakfast room) made it a great experience. Everything was clean and super safe and while the belltown area felt a little sketchy at times, it was close to plenty of great music venues and restaurants, and a short trip from capitol hill, which was definitely our favourite area. Even though Ace Seattle lacked the buzz of the New York and Portland Ace hotels, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend to recommend this hotel to young singles or couples for short stays in Seattle

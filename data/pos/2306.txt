This was an overall great experience. I became discouraged when reading the other reviews, but I believe some were a bit unfair. If you are going to this hotel expecting it to be a 5-star resort, you will be disappointed. I went with my boyfriend from the 10th-12th, and I had an AMAZING stay. Check in was fast, no room mix ups, and it has a very convenient parking garage right next door for only 19$ a night, and you can come and go as you please. We stayed in 402, and it had a terrible view of the backside of the parking garage and the hotel generator, but we didn't get a room for the view. (Hopefully if you are going to Seattle you're not planning on staying in the whole time! That's not what this hotel is for!) WHITE GOOSE-DOWN COMFORTERS. Very clean room, comfortable bed. Flat screen panel TV of good size. We had to call the maintenence man to fix the toilet, but other than that no complications. The hotel is charming, a cute little coffee hosue down stairs, but very thin walls. You can hear a lot, so try to get a room away from the elevators, and we brough a portable DVD player and some movies for at night to help drown out the noise. PERFECT location. 6 blocks away from the mall where you can catch the monorail for 2 bucks and get to the City center/space needle/EMP museum in NO time at all. Only a short, downhill hike to Pike's and the waterfront. For it's location, price, and comfort, it is a steal. I would recommend this hotel if you are easy going and not expecting a 5 star spa. It was perfect for the weekend getaway.

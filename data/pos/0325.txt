From the minute my husband and I set foot in the Hotel Monaco we knew we were in for a fun stay. The hotel's lively decor hints at playful accomodations and it didn't dissapoint. Our room, though small, was perfect for our needs with a good bed, reading lamps, a table and two chairs, and uplifting with its sea blues, corals, yellows and reds. We loved the color scheme and looked forward to returning to its comfort during the record-breaking Seattle heat wave which occured during our stay. And the service is splendid. It included an almost immidiate visit from the hotel engineer when we reported a light not functioning, friendly greetings every time we entered the front door, a concierge hosted wine hour wine hour, the printing of boarding passes, the use of the hotel town car for the airport trip, restaurant reservations, directions to and from locations in the city, the offer of a goldfish to be named by you as a companion to replace a left-at-home pet, popsicles and cookies during the hot afternoon and even a tarot card reading. Now, I ask you, "What more could one wish for?"

I know it's been nearly a year since we stayed there, but the visit has stayed with me. We had less than a day to stay in Seattle (we actually only flew there as a cheap gateway from NY to Vancouver Island and Vancouver), but the hotel made Seattle feel more like a destination than a stopover. The hotel was absolutely perfect for us! From the moment we pulled up, the staff was extremely friendly. They made our three kids feel right at home with great goodie bags (thoughtful items in an insulated bag that my daughter still uses as her lunchbag) and great attitudes. The room was very spacious (it was basically a suite but I think was considered a regular room), clean, and there was a great view of the Space Needle. The room felt nicely updated, with two flat screened tv's and pleasant decour. We were a nice walk away from Pike Place Market. I don't remember what we paid for the room, but we got what felt like a very high class boutique hotel for the same price as the lower level, generic hotels in the area. I felt for the duration of my stay like we were getting away with something. We can't wait to go back to the Mayflower Park Hotel and experience Seattle in depth!

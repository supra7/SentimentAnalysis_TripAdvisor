We have stayed at the Vintage Park many times and the service is consistently good. The staff are friendly, whether you are talking to the parking valet or the Front desk personnel. The rooms are clean and have a great ambiance, the location is very convenient to walk downtown or to all the great restaurants in the area. Tulio's restaurant on the ground floor is super for dinner or breakfast.

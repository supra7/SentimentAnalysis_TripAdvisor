Stayed here in may 2005 for 3 nights. Didn't want to Leave!! Hotel is central to all shopping and attractions. Shopping mall across the street. Plenty of dining options within two blocks. Walked to Safeco and Qwest Field(Seahawks), took about 20 minutes. Was only a $8 cab ride to the stadiums. Only a $35 cab ride from Airport. Staff was awesome, room service great, view from room outstanding. I will be staying here again in November and look forward to it!!! Great value due to location and room quality.

Very welcoming staff, truly comfortable room, great restaurant and even an interesting and varied room service menu. Some rooms have a vie of the Space Needle, many rooms probably don't have much of a view - but the hotel itself is everything one could wish for. Great location for shopping, sightseeing and business in financial district.

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I did business in Seattle for a week and needed a quiet, clean place to stay. Every one of the staff I came across was courteous, helpful, and friendly. The hotel is attached to the hospital, and I ate most of my meals at the hospital cafeteria which was priced right and had many healthy options. This is a good no-frills hotel for people traveling on a budget who want to be comfortable. You will definitely not regret staying here.

I was in Seattle last month for vacation and stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park hotel - we were completely impressed with how gorgeous the hotel was and so centrally located...easy walk to Pike Place Market!! Aside from that, the staff there, especially the Front Office Manager, Anthony, was so accomodating and welcoming! They really made us feel like VIPs! We will definitely be staying at Hotel Vintage on our next Seattle trip!!!

I was there for about 3 days for business. The room was what you'd expect from a Hilton; clean, comfortable bed and room, nice decor, a good place for a business trip. The only comment I'd really make about it was that it was hard to find a more casual, less expensive place to dine in the evening when we got back. Though my colleague had rented a car, we really didn't feel like driving around struggling to find the places listed for us and parking once we found them, and the list itself was out of date - three or four places we tried to walk to from it were out of business or closed for the evening. So be prepared to either take a taxi, or eat at the hotel. One nice option we hadn't realized they had - in the the upstairs lobby, they were serving drinks and you could order from the restaurant menu, which included appetizers that were quite reasonable for an actual light meal and quite tasty, too. The restaurant itself had a very nice view - I had breakfast there the third day and it was very good, and not too expensive by hotel breakfast standards.

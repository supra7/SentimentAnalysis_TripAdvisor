In mid February my wife and I had the opportunity to stay at the Inn at the Market before we headed up to the Olympics in Vancouver. First all I have to say that you cannot beat the location of this hotel. Being only a very short walk to Pike's Market is awesome. We loved walking around the area, visiting the shops and eating at all the different locations. Lucky for us it was absolutely beautiful weather the three nights we were there. The room was wonderful and the bathroom was nice and large. The Ipod speakers were a nice touch and we liked getting the Seattle Times every morning. The small chocolates every night were a sweet treat. The staff was always very friendly and helpful in suggesting restaurants and talking about the area. The best part of the hotel is the (almost) rooftop terrace that looks out across the sound. On a nice day it was wonderful to have an escape with a wonderful view. My complaints of the hotel are few, but in general I would say that the basic rooms are overpriced for what you receive. I would recommend paying just a bit extra to get a room on the courtyard or have a sound view, because the street that we had a view of was less than desirable. Also, I'm glad that we got to try a Tempurpedic bed before purchasing one, because neither of us was a big fan. One other thing that would be a very cool touch in my opinion would be to have a hot tub up on the terrace. Just a suggestion of course. In all reality I would like to give this hotel a 4.5/5, but those very few complaints kept me from giving it the full 5. I could easily recommend this hotel to anybody looking for an oasis in the heart of downtown Seattle.

Such lovely decor, friendly staff, every creature comfort and dog friendly!!! We were so pleasantly surprised by this beautiful hotel. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble. Including our dog on this trip was a great bonus ~ she had all the comforts of home too! The restaurant was fantastic (but a little pricey) and the decor was really unique. We will make this our regular hotel in Seattle!!!

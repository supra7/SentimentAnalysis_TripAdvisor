We recently stayed at the Hotel Andra during a weekend getaway to Seattle, and couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay. Aside from the convenient location, blocks away from Pike Place Market and Downtown/Belltown shopping and restaurants, this hotel is beautiful. I felt comfortable and welcome immediately with the cozy lobby and friendly staff, and right at home in our room that overlooked Fourth Ave. The hotel is a seamless mix of original 1920's details and modern decor, and the bed was so insanely comfortable we actually opted to lounge about instead of touring around the neighborhood. This may have been the nicest lodging I've ever experienced, and I definitely hope to return on my next trip to the Emerald City.

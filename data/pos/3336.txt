We stayed here for two nights, wanting to be within walking distance of the Seattle Art Museum, the Pike Market, and all the great shops in that area. Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and its restaurant; great location. But if you are driving, be aware that the parking charges are the highest I have ever seen anywhere - $39/night! So if you're arriving by train or bus or plane, this hotel is ideal.

This has one of the best locations in Seattle for just the tourist not having a vehicle. We did a four day stopover on our way to an Alaskan Cruise, looked for ages to find the right spot and so glad this is the one we selected. Opposite Macy's, one block from the Train and bus station, Monorail at the back door, easy walk to Pike Markets and heaps of food places around the hotel. It is an awesome hotel, so friendly and the rooms are brilliant. We had a queen bed, found we wanted a King, so requested it and the office guys did their best. Upgraded us to a King for minimal cost and it was superb, this is the best hotel for the overseas traveller. Highly recommend it, clean, tidy, cosy and just the best.

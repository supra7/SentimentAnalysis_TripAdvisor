This mid-price hotel was just what I had in mind when we needed a place to stay after our Alaska cruise. It was smaller, neatly-kept, older, close to many attractions and transportation. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They offered free wine and apples in the evenings. This hotel is also connected to a Seattle's Best coffee shop. I'd stay here next time.

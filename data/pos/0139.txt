I agree with all ot the previous, positive comments on here. So here are some additional tips. Sign up to be a Kimpton In-Touch Member and you'll get $10 to "raid the mini bar" upon your arrival, plus free internet. Also, The Monaco has a very small gym in the hotel and your room card will get you access to Gold's Gym (2.5 blocks away). It's a smaller sized gym and the equipment is great!

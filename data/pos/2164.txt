We stayed with my partner for 4 nights at Miauw, one night at the white room and the rest in the black room. In my opinion the place is one of the most stylish in Amsterdam, and one of the most stylish I have ever stayed in. Elegant, understated, a kind of 17th century Amsterdam meeting today's city (one of the main capitals of European design). Ok, I will grant you that the baths were a tad small (and frankly a bit weird) and there was no closet in the white room. But both rooms were truly a unique experience. We felt like we were staying in our own place or as guests to a friend's house, not in a hotel. And the location was simply fabulous. Martha, the girl taking care of the rooms and checking us in/out, was so kind and smiley and helpful, it really made our trip even better. We will definitely return!

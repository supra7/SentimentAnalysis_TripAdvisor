My husband and I just returned from the most memorable stay in Seattle....and it was not for the lovely city of Seattle, the fun we had at the Seahawks game, the delicious dinners, or the beautiful views of the bay from our hotel. We have stayed at the Inn At The Market before. All have been wonderful, however, this visit touched me in ways no other visit has. I am so very grateful to the staff at the Inn At The Market, but particularily to our room maid, Josie. When packing up to leave our lovely room, I placed my travel bag of jewelry on the bed. We went out for breakfast. Upon returning we packed our bags and checked out. Enroute home, 5 hours from the hotel, when I remembered my jewelry. I forgot to pack it, leaving it on the unmade bed. In the bag was my wedding ring, my diamond engagement ring, a diamond pendant, pearls, among others....precious pieces that I have had for our 32 years of marriage. I immediately called the hotel to report my loss. The maid had registered my jewelry bag, sealed it, and sent it to the front desk. It was there when I called. The front desk staff packaged it up and sent it UPS to me in Canada. I received it, all intact, within 3 days. I am so grateful to Josie and the staff at The Inn At The Market. Thank you all so very much for your kindness. We will look forward to our next visit to your beautiful city and especially to The Inn At The Market.

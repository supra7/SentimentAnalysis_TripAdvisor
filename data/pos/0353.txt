Everything about this hotel was perfect. Our room had 2 queen beds and still plenty of space to move. The staff were friendly and the location of the hotel was perfect to where we wanted to go. It is within walking distance to pike place, shopping, restaurants etc. I can't fault this hotel i only wish we had more time there.

I stayed here with my 10-year-old daughter and we both loved it. Check-in was easy. The room wasn't spectacular, and neither was the view of the gentlemen's club parking lot, but for this price it was surprisingly clean and extremely well-located. Whole Foods is a quick walk one direction, and Pike Place Market the other. I connected to internet right away, which was cool. The bus back to the airport picked us up right across the street. Couldn't have asked for better deal.

We stayed at the Moore Hotel 6 nights during a recent visit to Seattle. It is an older hotel, with some remodeling done, and it was very clean. The best part about staying at the Moore is Location, location, location! It is in walking distance to Pike's Market, the waterfront, and great restaurants! The lack of air conditioning was a bit of a surprise but then I learned nearly all of Seattle doesn't have a/c, but they provided a fan. (IT was very warm the week we were there.) The shower is small, but durable. If you are looking for a place that is clean and close to major attractions, I highly recommend this place. The staff was awesome also!

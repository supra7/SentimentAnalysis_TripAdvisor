Clean, up to date, very comfortable room with a view. What more could one need? Close to the light rail/bus station, walk down the hill to Pike Place Market, around the corner from the 5th street theater. We really enjoyed our stay here. As an elite Hilton member, we were treated to the executive lounge. Excellent hors d'oerves. The breakfast buffet was just as fresh and plentiful. I would definitely recommend this downtown hotel. The management is doing it's job well. (Note: the lobby can only be reached by elevators. Do not panic when you enter and only see the bell captain desk and a rental car agency. All will be well!)

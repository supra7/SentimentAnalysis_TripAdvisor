Had a great stay at the Sheraton. Managed to secure a good rate through my Company and was allocated a room on the top floor of the Union Tower. The room was excellent - modern fittings, clean and practical. The bed was especially comfortable. Thje hotel has free wi-fi in the lobby and a good bar, with friendly staff. THere is also a good restaurant, which we ate in twice. The food was of a good standard. Location-wise, the Sheraton is hard to beat. About a 5-10 minute walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront. I would recommend jumping on a ferry to Bainbridge - at about $7 each it's a lovely journey across even if you don't do anything once you get there!

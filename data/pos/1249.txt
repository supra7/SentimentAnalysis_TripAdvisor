Flew up for a day of shopping with my Mom. Hotel is nice & clean and comfortable beds. We had a great view of the Space Needle. Cute little night package that includes an eye mask, ear plugs and a linen lavender spray. I thought it was a nice touch! You can walk to everything. So many shops and places to eat. We did eat at Tulio's around the corner and it was delicious! Fresh Halibut and wonder waiters. Do try if you have time. The lobby is small, but they have a computer out there where you can print your boarding pass. Very handy. And to get back to the airport take the Downtowner airporter $15. instead of a taxi which is $40. They can arrange that for you. I enjoyed my first visit to Seattle and look forward to returning.

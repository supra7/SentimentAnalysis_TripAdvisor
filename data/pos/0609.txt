My husband and I just spent 4 nights at Inn at the Market. The service was impeccable, Every employee that we came in contact with was polite and helpful. We knew that the weather would most likely not be that nice, but we still bundled up against the wind and cold and spent 2 evenings watching the sun set from the fabulous outdoor terrace. We booked a city view room, really wished we had booked a water view, but the property was full 2 of the nights so there wasn't an opportunity to upgrade. We were on the top floor, which was a wonderful bonus, but bring your earplugs, the night noise was pretty loud, especially after businesses closed on Saturday night (Sunday am). The short walk down the hill allowed for perfect access to Pike Place Market and the shops and restaurants of the area.

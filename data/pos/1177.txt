I actually liked this hotel, mainly because of the location. I was in seattle for a week and I was able to go to a different restaruant every night that was within walking distance to the hotel. The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants althought they weren't good about telling you how much the food is at the restaurant they were recommending. Of course it's seattle so there is a starbucks on every corner. The one nearest to the hotel was maybe two blocks down, and there was also a subway right next door for something quick and easy. The only thing that was strange about this hotel was the fact that they didn't have a microwave in the room. I thought that was the standard for most hotels but I guess I was wrong. The hotel room was very clean and the view from the window was nice although I didn't get a view of the water. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

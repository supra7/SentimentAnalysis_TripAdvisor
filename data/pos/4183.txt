I got to the hotel and was offered a room on the 18th floor with a street view. Although the room was renovated and really looked nice, I wanted the sea view that the folks on TripAdvisor had raved about. I called the front desk and told them I wanted a different room and the guy told me to come back down and he'd find me a different room. Upon getting there he got me a room on the 33rd floor with a nice view of the space needle and the sea/ocean (not sure which me it was). The room was nice and clean although it wasn't renovated and it was in the north tower. I found the gym to be spacious and nicely equipped with new treadmills and life cycle machines that are iPod compatible. There was always a stack of fresh towels and a rather tiny separate weight room which I initially mistook for the gym. Also, there's no way to get to the gym from your room by taking the stairs. I liked all the "going green options" like getting the $5 voucher for skipping the daily room cleaning. I also found the onsite restaurant and coffee shop to be pretty decent. The location was great for access to the convention center, a variety of shops, restaurants, the monorail, the pike street market, and other attractions. I would certainly stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. Oh, I forgot to mention that the heavenly bed and shower were truly heavenly and even though I had to sign up for an internet package, I didn't get charged for it at checkout.

Outstanding hotel! Perfectly located, perfectly priced and perfect service. I am more of a business hotel person, because I know what I am getting. I appreciate prompt front desk/bell attention, ice/vending on the floors, a gym, a safe, a large room and bathroom, good shampoo/conditioner, nice water pressure, early/late check-in/out, security, a thermostat that works, a very comfortable bed and pillows that I would have liked to take home, nice decor, good sound-proofing in the walls, very hospitable cleaning staff, etc. I am not a breakfast person, but my husband loved it. I am sure that I missed some things and I have to say that I am largely in bed with Marriott because I have so many reward points, but this Sheraton stands out. We spent five days pre-cruise and one after and we would go back in a heartbeat!

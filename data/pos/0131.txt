I have stayed here multiple times on business and pleasure. Everytime is amazing. The staff is always friendly and accommodating and the rooms are great. Free WiFi in the room for intouch members (sign up for free). The staff and environment always makes me feel like I'm in luxury, but without any snootyness or snobery. Plus...every night at 5pm they have wine hour which makes for a perfect starter to the evening events :) I have also stayed here with my 3yr old son and this place is great for kids. They greet him with a little plush toy upon entering and always have his kids leopard print robe ready next to mine. To top it all off, they give him a pet goldfish in the room that he always gets a kick out of.

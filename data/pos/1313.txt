We loved the Crown Plaza!!! This hotel offered everything we needed. A clean, quiet place to stay in an Excellent location. The Crown Plaza is only a few blocks from the famous Pikes Place Market & Puget Sound and about a 10 minute walk from the Space Needle. We read a mixed reviews, both good and bad. However, we are fairly laid back travelers who have stayed in 3 star hotels all around the world and decided to give it a try. The room was comfy with a king size bed, clean sheets & towels, a desk and a large flat screen TV. They even provided a "goodie bag" with a relaxation CD to listen to. Keep in mind this is a 3 star hotel and we booked an "ecomony" room (meaning no mini-fridge or safe) but if you are here to see Seattle & not really spend time much time in your room--it will be perfect for you. (Note: There was a small water stain on the ceiling but other than that we found absolutely no issues.) If you are looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel, this is not the place for you. Also, we read over and over again that the elevators are slow but found no issue with them. There is a fitness center and business center located on the 5th floor. The fitness center is free and the business center costs $5 to use the internet and .25 cents to print documents. You can also purchase wireless internet in your room for $9.95 a day or for $40 per week if you brought your laptop. Parking is also available for $30, however we did not rent a car. We used only public transportation or walked. Also, we didn't bother eating at the restaurant downstairs because there are plenty of other restaurants and cafes within walking distance (especially at Pikes Place). We couldn't have been happier at the Crown Plaza & we hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

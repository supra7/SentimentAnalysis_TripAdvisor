We just returned from a week in Seattle and chose the Inn at the Market and are very happy we did. We had a water view room and we were on the top floor. The views of Elliott Bay were breathtaking. From our room we could watch the market wake up every morning, the ferry crossings and the cruise ships. The inn is beautifully furnished, well appointed and the staff was very friendly. We did not rent a car for the trip, but wanted a car for one day to go to Mount Rainier. Just asked at teh front desk and the car was delivered right to the inn for us and picked up when we were back from our day trip. You are in walking distance to Pioneer Square, downtown shopping, the market, the piers for any water trips and lots of great restaurants. The inn has three restaurants as well. There is a rooftop garden with chairs for relaxing with your morning coffee or an afternoon glass of wine. We felt the inn to be the perfect choice for us and would definitely stay there again the ext time we are in Seattle.

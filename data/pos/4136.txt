We had a lovely small suite. The service was wonderful and very friendly. Food service was great and delicious. Did encounter a weird experience in the Hunt Bar awaiting a table. A definite poke in the small of my back. There was nobody around except my husband at a barstool some distance away. It was very startling. When we arrived home, we researched stories on the internet that mentioned other possible ghostly encounters. How scary and fun. Highly recommend this hotel.

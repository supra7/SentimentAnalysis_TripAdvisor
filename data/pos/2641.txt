I stayed two nights at this hotel and really appreciated the location (just a few blocks away from Seattle Center and from Greyhound bus station). Room was large enough for one person, beds highly comfortable, bathroom definitely okay. Breakfast enjoyable with quite a choice of stuff. Express check-out perfect. Rooms on the street side are a bit noisy but hey, you're in a city ! Overal, I would recommend this hotel if you're not staying a long time in Seattle and want to enjoy the most of it.

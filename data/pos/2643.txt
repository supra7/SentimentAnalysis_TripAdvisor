The staff is what makes this place great. They are all very friendly and helpful. Our room was very small. A single queen (was it a queen though?) and barely enough room for two people. Free parking upon availability (= don't arrive after 8 PM with a car) made this one of the better values if you're driving. Location is good right near the needle, but not GREAT because there is a very busy highway bypass that runs right by the front - and this adds a fair amount of road noise - also it means you can't cross the street easily if you want to walk east. Free breakfast in the morning. There are a fair selection of eateries and such around, if you walk in and towards the water. At the end of the day it is a quality inn, and a reasonably well kept one at that once you get past the road noise and congestion of the location. Though the rooms are smaller than standard. I would say my stay here was positive, and would recommend with the above caveats.

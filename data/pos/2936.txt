Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton the final two nights of a recent trip to the northwest, and we couldn't have been happier with the location. The amenities, room, and staff were fine but we probably wouldn't have chosen the Sheraton if we had to pay full price. Fortunately, they accepted our VERY low bid on Priceline and we feel we got a fantastic deal. Desk staff was very nice and helpful, and the bartender in the lounge was very amiable and had some good recommendations for nearby restaurants (as well as his favorite beers). We stayed on the 19th floor, so we were fortunate enough to have a great view. The light rail station that connects to the airport (just $2.50 per person each way!) is in the next block over, and the Pike Place Market is just down the street about five blocks. Being a Sheraton, we noticed that the vast majority of clients were apparently in town for conferences and/or business. I should mention that they feature a terminal where you can check in and print out your boarding passes if you are flying out of Sea-Tac - this was MOST convenient for us!

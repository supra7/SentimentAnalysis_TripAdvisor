My children and I recently stayed at the Moore for a few nights and found the hotel to be just what we were looking for--great location, clean room & a fair price. Pike Place Market, Westlake Center & Belltown are within very easy walking distance (a couple blocks), so we left the car parked during our entire visit. Our room was average sized with a lovely walk-in closet. We also had the shared bathroom & found it to be clean in the early morning & not crowded. Our room was cleaned well each day & the bedding was of average age/quality for an inexpensive hotel. The desk clerk, Robert, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in suggesting things to do/places to eat with children in the area. I'd read reviews about the elevator being scary, but don't agree--it's a small elevator & old, but seemed quite safe & not inordinately creaky. Overall, I felt it was a great place to stay for the price & will return.

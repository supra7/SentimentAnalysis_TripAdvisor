A good attempt at a luxury hotel that is really just more a rustic very nice hotel. At times, almost a ski chalet hotel on the water without the mountains. A true luxury hotel would have more amenities so don't stay there if you want luxury. However, it is very nice as an old hotel on the water that has been remodeled to be more up to date but still rustic. Wach room has a fireplace which is part of the heating system for the room; actually worked great and was a nice touch. The halls are long and old which helps you tell it was an old hotel at one time. The bar and restaurant are very chic and excellent. Great happy hour. The food is amazing.

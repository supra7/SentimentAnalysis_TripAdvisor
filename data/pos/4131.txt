I can't say enough about my wonderful stay at the Sorrento. I spent the first week of October there, and I didn't want to leave. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, and they were calling me by name by day two. One of the front desk clerks made a reservation for me at Elliott's Oyster House, and while I was there, my server brought me a crabcake appetizer, compliments of the hotel! All of the guys working valet were fantastic with directions. John in the bar was so much fun. The room was clean and super comfortable. I was made to feel as if I was the only guest in the whole place. Next time I'm in Seattle, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.

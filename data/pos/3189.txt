I was a little nervous about staying in this hotel as it was not in Trip Advisor's top 10! but we got an excellent deal with Expedia when we booked it along with return flights from LA with Alaska Airlines. When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are very spacious and the beds were pretty comfy. This hotel is in an amazing location, the shops, monorail, restaurants are all on your doorstep. We tried the buffet breakfast on the first morning, this was nice but quite pricey. The concierge was very helpful booking our trip to the Boeing factory. The top floor pool & gym are great. Our room was also very quiet which was good. The coffee maker was also a nice touch. We took the Gray Line downtowner bus from the airport which is a bargain at $17 return and stops directly outside the hotel. All in all this is a great hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it especially if you can get it for a good price.

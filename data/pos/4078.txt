My four night stay at this historic/majestic property was WONDERFUL...! My room was large and beautifully appointed. The Staff was Friendly, well trained, and attentive to details. The location in downtown Seattle located on Madison Street was perfect as far as getting on and off the expressways. Free parking was a major plus. The 10:30 PM Happy Hour (half price on food and drinks) resulted in my timing my evenings around this feature. 'tis a GREAT HOTEL...!

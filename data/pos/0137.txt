We booked this hotel through Hotwire at a rate of $120 per night. Check-in was smooth, bathroom and linens were clean, hallways were quiet and the staff was helpful and friendly. The only thing I didn't like was having a goldfish in the room because they're in such small bowls. Didn't use any services as we only stayed the one night. Am staying there again next month!

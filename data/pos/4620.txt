We stayed at the Westin Seattle for 2 nights following an Alaska cruise. The location is fantastic -- right in the middle of shopping, caddycorner to the monorail which takes you right to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Science Museum, etc), and just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market. The rooms were everything we've come to expect from a Westin: decent sized rooms, nice bathroom, and last but certainly not least the fantastic "heavenly" beds. Although we didn't have a view of anything other than the city, the large windows were very nice. We were in the South Tower, on the 24th floor. The bellmen and front desk staff were fantastic. We showed up around 10:30am, with lots of luggage, and were taken care of wonderfully. Despite the early hour they offered us a room - with 2 doubles instead of the 1 king we had reserved, so we decided to pass on the offer, and instead left our luggage at the hotel and went to explore a little. When we stopped back at 1pm they had a room ready, promptly got us checked in & sent our luggage up, and multiple people apologized for not having a room earlier. Obviously, we completely understood why at 10:30am they wouldn't have a room -- but the graciousness was appreciated. Also, despite how busy the hotel clearly was, responses to questions, requests for help with luggage, etc, were always prompt. Overall, it was just a fabulous stay, and we will certainly be back when we find our way to Seattle again!

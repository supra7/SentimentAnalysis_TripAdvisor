The Sheraton is located in the heart of downtown, but not too close to noisy tourist traps. It is a very walkable distance to Pike's Place Market and accessible to all public transportation. Although I expected the room to be a bit more modern in style, it was very comfortable. Our king size bed was soft, and there was plenty of space to move about in the room. The bathroom was also quite sizable. The ammenities are great. The pool and the jacuzzi are on the top floor, and are a great way to relax after a long day walking around. The staff was pleasant, and very helpful. Ask for a higher floor and get a great view of the bay!

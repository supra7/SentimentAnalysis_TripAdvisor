Stayed at the Sheraton 3 nights and we enjoyed ourselves. A lot of pros but there were a few cons. Pros- Location, location & location. The hotel is located in the middle of downtown Seattle shopping district, an easy walk to Nordstrom, Macy, Pacific Place, Pike's and other shopping places. Walking around downtown Seattle is relatively an easy stroll because everything is pretty close to each other. Hotel room is adequate in size, 26th floor offered a nice view of the high rise buildings and part of Elliott Bay. Beds offer a good night sleep that my wife enjoyed immensely. Cons- No self parking, only valet at $28 per day. Even though we didn't use our car for the 3 days (walked around), the hotel billed us almost 100 bucks. Construction noise from the new hotel tower being built next to the hotel. From our window, we could see and hear the work crew going at it at 7 in the morning. Housing keeping was slow and one day, our room wasn't made after 3 pm, had to call housekeeping to clean our room so that we could make a 6 pm dinner engagement. Overall-we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton and may return and stay at the new tower once it is completed next year. Grade- a solid B.

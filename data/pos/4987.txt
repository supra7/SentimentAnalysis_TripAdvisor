My wife and I stayed at the Vintage Park one night while she attended the Flower and Garden show. This our favorite hotel in Seattle. The first thing I always notice is how friendly and attentive the staff is. The rooms are small (it is an old hotel) but nicely decorated. The beds are comfortable and pillows great. The Vintage Park is located in the center of the downtown near the Washington State Convention Center and Pacific Place. Their on-site restaurant, Tulio, is always good. We went their for breakfast and again, friendly and helpful staff.

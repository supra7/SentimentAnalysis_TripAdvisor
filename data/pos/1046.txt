I wish we could have stayed longer, but our flight was delayed due to a snowstorm in Boston. We arrived very late at night and had been upgraded without asking. There was some construction going on the next morning so we were given a room on a higher floor to be further away from any noise disturbance. It was a minute or two walk from the Public Market. There was a lot to see within walking distance. The beds were extremely comfortable. the only down side was that you had to walk outside for a few seconds to get to some of the rooms. We had contact with many people at the front desk, all of whom were very happy to help and full of all kinds of information. We'd stay again and recommend it highly.

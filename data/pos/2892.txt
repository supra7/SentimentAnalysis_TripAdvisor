Arrived late with the family and was upgraded to a room with a pull out sofa for the kids to sleep in which allow my wife and I to have a king bed to ourselves. Went out to dinner and shopping (right in the middle of the shopping district) and then returned to splash in the indoor pool which is at the top of the hotel. All in all it was a great place to stay with plenty to do right in the middle of Seattle.

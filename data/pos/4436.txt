Stayed 2 nights in June and had a great time. We had a super-fast check-in and our request for 2 double beds was met without issue (booked thru priceline). The room was great. The wedge shape was interesting but not that noticeable. I especially loved the floor-to-ceiling windows. We were given a room near the elevators but had no problem with "elevator noise" ; after all that is what earplugs are for!. The beds were perhaps the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on. The shampoo/lotion/soap smelled divine. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of lots of things---Top Pot Donuts (yum), Pike's Place market, Nordstrom's, Macy's, Cheesecake Factory, Fox Sports Grill and more. If you need to rent a car there is an Avis across the street from the 5th Avenue hotel entrance. Westlake station is just across the street as well where you can take the light rail to/from SeaTac and the monorail, which will take you to/from the Space Needle. Be sure to visit the Emerald Fox Gallery in the North Lobby.

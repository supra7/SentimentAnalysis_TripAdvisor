From an early morning check in and for four wonderful days witha late check out I can not say enough positive things about the Westin. Outstanding customer service throughout the stay. From the front desk, to housekeepers, the doorman hailing us cabs, the waiter in the lounge to the lovely housekeepers who came to our room, all made us feel like we meant the most to them. The rooms are beautiful and the beds are so comfortable. Traveling with my sister and older parents(both 75). All agreed it was one of the best hotels we have stayed at ever. Location wise, in the heart of downtown, shops and restaurants all in walking distance. Big hint, walk out the hotel to the left to Pike to get to the Market. No real hills to climb and a little easier for the parents.

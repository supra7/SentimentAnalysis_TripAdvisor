The Hilton is in a great location downtown and affords wonderful views from the rooms. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are fine....nothing special. The bed is very comfy. The bathroom is small but fine. The lounge is nice. The restaurant has a great view of the city....didn't eat there but looks nice. There is a turndown service but other than that, nothing really makes it a hotel worth spending over $200/night to stay in. The value is simply not there.

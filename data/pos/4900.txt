I was given a king deluxe room on the 9th floor. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The hotel is in a convenient location. You can walk to the downtown shopping area, the Market and the light rail to/from the airport is 2+ blocks away. Unfortunately, the MLK weekend was when the weather turned nasty--snowing in Seattle is not good! So this location worked out well for not driving. There is a small, but well equipped work out room and a small business office, too. You can print your boarding pass there for free. I was sorry that I did not see any dogs during my stay, but they are welcome. Breakfast at the restaurant next door, Tulio's, was very good. I would highly recommend this property as it lives up to the excellent Kimpton Hotel reputation.

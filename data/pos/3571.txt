Since this is the only place in the world that I've found that shares my strange name, I'm obviously going to be prejudiced. This hotel is hip, clean, efficient, moderately priced and very conveniently located in Seattle. It has a small neighborhood feel in the heart of downtown. The staff is courteous and helpful, and the facilities are awesome. The rooms are well laid out with comfy beds, and the bathroom night light is a thoughtful touch (especially in the middle of the night!) Several very good restaurants are right across the street, and the very touristy things are only a few blocks away. Lots of shopping is also steps away from the front door. I love this hotel.

Seattle is one of our favorite cities to visit and the Westin is in the best central location. Overall this hotel offers the most comfortable bed and sheets and is child friendly. The staff is very welcoming and the Hotel manager Andrea Norton, even personally assisted us in making our stay back at the Westin Seattle an unforgettable weekend getaway.

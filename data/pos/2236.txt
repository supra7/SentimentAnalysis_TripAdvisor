An older hotel kept clean by a friendly staff. The location is downtown, close to Pike Market. Easy to/from airport by Light Rail for $2.50. Perfect place to explore downtown Seattle by foot. The rooms are more quaint than spacious, but cute in their old style way. Yes, you get sounds from the city, the hum of the elevator, and can hear your neighbors come and go, but this is a delightful hotel.

This was 'hip'. The rooms were fun, minimalist (i.e. lacking wardrobes), and spacious enough with large windows (we could just see the water). Things that I did not realise 'hip' would include: 1. I did not realise that breakfast was included - fresh fruit and the waffle machine I love. 2. I was not expecting was that the staff would be so friendly and let us check in early with our ten tons of luggage and then leave it all day on the day we checked out so that we could continue to explore the city. Everyone was so nice. 3. The location too was fabulous - just at the edge of the free bus zone, and not far from the sculpture park, surrounded by fabulous restaurants. 4. Shared bathrooms, 5 on the one floor we stayed on so never an issue getting into one for a shower in the morning and the showers were massive - could not reach from one side to the other. Do be aware that there is no lift (that I could find) and that the reception is up a rather large wide flight of steps off the main street - but the desk staff do help, which is lovely.

I'll keep it simple: the hotel was clean, rooms were a good size and service friendly and prompt. The location couldn't be better. About 4 blocks from Pike Place Market and within walking distance of Nordstrom, Macy's, Mario's, H & M just to name a few shopping favorites. Within walking distance to Safeco and Qwest field if you are a regular walker and enjoy a nice walk. If it were raining, I would cab it. Overall a great experience! Would definitely stay again! PS: Parking is $40 per day.....ridiculous!

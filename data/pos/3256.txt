The reviews looked good. Price and location, right on the money. Service was great. Some reviews said the bathroom was small. To me it was OK. Lack of counter space was a small factor. Dispensers for soap ect. were OK. Saves some money I am sure. The big thing for me. That bathroom was spotless. Corner to corner. Thats the first thing I look at . This may sound crazy. However the grout was uniformly the same color. My conclusion, it gets cleaned often and correctly. The room it self was clean and fresh. Heating unit worked very well. It was in the mid 40's. Some reviews mention the mens club nearby. Dont see the issue. The place is half a block away acrossed a parking lot. Noise not a problem. The hotel was near full. My room was facing the street. I live in a city so no big deal for me. Restaurant on site. Food was good and service was fast . A nice relaxing meal in nice relaxing atmosphere I was glad to find this hotel. It was an $8.00 cab ride from King Street Station. All in all a great stay. They are all about service.

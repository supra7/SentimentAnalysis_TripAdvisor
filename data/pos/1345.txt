Stayed here recently after booking the hotel on it's own website for a reasonable rate. Were over only for the weekend from the UK and had to pack plenty in over three days. Found the hotel very easily, just next to the exit Seneca on the I5. Valet parked our car which was expensive. About 16 ($28) per day. Check in was seamless and an unusually pleasent experience. The staff were very friendly. Took the advice from here and booked a exec room, which was not too much more. Beds were amazing as was the view, when the fog lifted. Bathroom was ok and the television had loads of channels on it. The buffet breakfast was great, but there are no eggs included so we had to eat downstairs. I liked the idea of having a seperate floor which can only be accessed by a room key. Loved the city, found plenty of bars, a great restaurant by the Benaroya Hall. Visit the Boeing Factory (about 30 miles away) it's quite breathtaking in size. Seattle made me remember why I love America and it's people so much.

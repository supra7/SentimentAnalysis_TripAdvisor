My stay here has been the absolute best ever!!. This coming from a guy that has dealt with it all (about a dozen times in Seattle); from the dirty rooms at the Quality Inn by Seatac to the snobby, charge-hiding staff at the Sheraton on 6th Ave, this place is awesome in comparison. The kindness and friendliness of the staff is just unprecedented. I mean where do I start; from the sea-view room upgrade right off the bat, to getting 5 days of internet for free and finally the complementary last-day late check-out cuz I didn't get much sleep the night before. It obviously met the other regular standards: prime location (going downhill at least), clean room, comfy beds, flat screen, pool, hot tub and a small 'gym'. They also have a knowledgeable and competent concierge that helped make out the best of our time. I should have been bummed out by the fact the top-floor bar/lounge was closed for repairs but instead I found myself 'forced :D' to extend my stay cuz it felt just a tad bit nicer than home. In-room dinning: bettterrr than home.

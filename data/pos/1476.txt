This hotel is historical and has class, making it unique. The staff are friendly and professional and the rooms are large. The kitchenettes are a nice feature too. My only complaint is the wireless internet connection was next to none and the coffee is horrible. Good thing Cafe Ladro is right next door. Great location right in the heart of lower Queen Anne close to a bazillion shops, restaurants and Key Arena/Seattle Center.

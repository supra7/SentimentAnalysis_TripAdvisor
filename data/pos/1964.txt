The Moore is one of Seattle's two truly historic hotels and is a great deal for downtown Seattle. I checked in at midnight and got one of the less desirable rooms, tucked away int he back overlooking the alley. It had a private bathroom with a non functional shower and no mirror and in the morning we woke to some insanely loud construction type activity in the alley. That said, I would definitely recommend the Moore... Everyone we interacted with was friendly, the maintenance guys even took my boyfriend and I down to check out the Olympic size swimming pool in the basement (it's empty)! Positives: -Super central location -Minimal, modern guest rooms -Very affordable -Laid back and likable employees Negatives: You can't have visitors in some rooms Not all rooms have private baths 11am checkout Slow elevators All in all a great old hotel, and the only one with rooms available the night of the Yankees game this month!

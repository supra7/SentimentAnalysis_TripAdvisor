My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle the week of August 31-September 4. We had an amazing time walking around the city and it was highlighted by this beautiful hotel. The Hotel is located in the center of the city for easy walking access to the waterfront and shopping. Highly recommend this hotel and we will return.

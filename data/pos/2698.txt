We are staying on 24th floor at Sheraton Seattle, as we did before on twice a year business trips to Seattle. Seattle is covered in snow, beautiful. A clean, beautiful and friendly city. Sheraton Seattle is clean and spacious in room and public area, elegant huge area with many sofas for guests in the lobby, service is good even though we rarely have contact with staff after check-in. Internet is $10.95 per day. The best part is the location, exceptional for our business needs, across the street from the convention center, regal Cinemas, Nike Town, Cheesecake Factory, Palomino, American Eagle, H&M, etc.. 1 block from Nordstrom, 2 shopping center and more shops, even more shopping centers, airport subway($2.75 each way 40 minutes), shops and restaurants within 2 block, it is the center of Seattle. We did not stay at Club Floor as there are simply too many better choices within 2 minutes walking range. Excellent business hotel, much better in many small details and services than the Hyatt 1 block away with much better price. Sheraton Seattle is our No.1 choice for Seattle.

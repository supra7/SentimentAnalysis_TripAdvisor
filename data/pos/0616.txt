My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights last week, 2/24/12. We had a wonderful experience. I chose the hotel based on it's location, I had never stayed at a "boutique" type hotel so didn't know what to expect. Our room was exceptional, we stayed in room 808 which offers a great view of the market and of Puget Sound. I don't think we could have asked for a better room. The service from everyone at the hotel was oustanding, I have never experienced this level of customer service, and I have stayed at numerous hotels. Everyone is s0 incredibly nice, and it's genuine! From the desk clerks to Andrew who gave us a ride to the Space Needle, everyone was provided steller customer service. Since we didn't have out own vehicle, we appreciated having the hotel town car available to give us a ride. If I had to find fault with anything it would probably be that the water pressure to fill the bath tub is a little slow. Other than that it was perfect. I would caution those traveling with kids, this is a boutique hotel which means that it does not offer some of the amenities that your larger resort style hotesl offer, ie, pool, spa, etc. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it. I fear that I'm ruined for any other hotel.

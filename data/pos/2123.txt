I stayed at the Moore for two nights in the end of December. From outside, the Moore looks like an aged Grand-Hotel which probably had its grandeur a long time ago. The worst about the hotel is the lobby, making a run-down and cold impression. Nevertheless, the staff behind the front desk is very friendly and tries to help you whenever possible. The room was large (and heated very well in winter) and even with two queen size beds, youll have enough space to walk around without bumping your legs. Although the furniture is modern and functional, there are some interesting details: A spacious old closet with a gloomy light where you could easily place a cot instead of hanging your coat. A bathroom with a ancient clawfoot tub. And a historical ceiling light reminding of past times. The very best about this place is its location (5 minutes to Pike Place Market, 10 Minutes to Waterfront) and its unbeatable rates. I doubt youll find another hotel in Seattle in such a central location for less than 80 US$ (Off-Season). There is a WiFi internet connection you can use for free in the Lobby. Sometimes it even works in your room. Other travellers were not sure if the neighbourhood was safe. I walked there in the evening when it was dark and I never had any doubts. If you prefer places telling a story, places that don't need to be tiptop in every detail, the Moore is a Hotel you definitely should consider staying at.

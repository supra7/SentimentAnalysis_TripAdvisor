We got this hotel on Priceline for $100 a night which was great...We thought maybe they would give us a higher floor with a better view but they said no. It was their busy season so we had one no view. It didn't matter we weren't in it much. The rooms were nice and bed heavenly. It was located near everything we wanted to do. Right next to the Light Rail from the Airport only $5 per person round trip. Next to Monorail to take to the Space Needle. You could walk there in 20 minutes. Close to Pike's Market and the Hop on & Off bus was close by. You can get that at Pike's Market. There is an Avis Rental car place right across the street. We took the light rail from the airport and then back to the airport with no problem. Lost of restuarants around and alot of friendly people. Could take a taxi for $8 to the ferry to go to Victoria. Great Place..

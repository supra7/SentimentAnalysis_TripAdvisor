I stayed here twice during the month of January and enjoyed both stays. They have a wonderful complimentary wine tasting in the early evening and they were very accommodating with any of our needs. The location is outstanding and parking, although not free, was very quick and easy. They allowed us to leave our car long after our check out time so we stayed in town and shopped after our stay. I would definitely stay here again!

The Mayflower Park is great! I can not think of one negative thing about it. The front desk people were the best! I have stayed there 3 times now and is the only place I will stay in seattle from now on. The location is great....right across the street from Maceys and 3 blocks to pikes market. The food was great, nice bar, and the decor suburb! This is an old old hotel beautifully decorated.Can't wait to return!! Overall......excellant!

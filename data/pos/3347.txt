I really enjoyed the Andra, and I've been recommending it to friends going to Seattle. I stay at a lot of Holiday Inn Express hotels, and when I get to travel to a bigger city like Seattle, it's nice to stay in a hotel with a little more style. Great location, and the room was big, clean, comfortable and stylish. I had a great sleep, and the room is also well-designed for work and even had a nice sofa for relaxing between business activities and dinner. I had an enviable view of the Space Needle and the shower was a noticeably good one - big, good water flow, glass door, real tiles. Felt like quality! The staff was friendly, but better still I had little need of them! Everything was just as it should be in a good hotel, and I had no complaints.

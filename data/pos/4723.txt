We did not get to the hotel until just after midnight, ( flight delayed) the staff greeted us with open arms and were very friendly. Room was fantastic and we could see the space needle , lovely sight at night. Breakfast I can't say enough, they had lots and lots of different items, from sausage to hard boiled eggs, waffles to pastry's fruit and donuts, not to forget the USA Today for you to have. The staff helped us plan our full day in Seattle, was super and said to say the pump had gone out on the pool, but jacuzzi was working. Upon check out on Friday a maintenance crew was fixing the pool, hats off to this hotel and its location, it was even safe to walk around in the evening.. There were 2 terminals with free access to the internet, coffee and cold drinks in the foyer at all times. THANKS FOR A WONDERFUL STAY

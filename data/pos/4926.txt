I made a trip to Seattle on 10/5 and 10/6 and was able to stay at the Hotel Vintage Park. As expected, the experience was wonderful. It took less than 10 minutes for me to drop my car off at the valet, check in and get to my room. The room had a nice living area, mini-bar and the bed was really comfortable. It was good to get settled and relax. Until I realized I left my cell phone in my car. So back to the valet I went. After explaining what I had done and that I would go up to get my phone, he asked me to take a seat in the lobby and he would retrieve my phone. A few minutes later he came into the lobby with my phone. I had one minor problem in my room with the toilet, but a call to the front desk resulted in someone in my room, fixing the problem within 10 minutes. Check out was quick and easy and because of my Hybrid, I only paid  price for parking. Add in the $10 raid the minibar coupon and the $20 coupon at the onsite restaurant and you have a great hotel stay at a wonderful price. I have been a Kimpton fan and have stayed at Kimpton hotels in Portland, Seattle and San Francisco and have always enjoyed my stay. The Hotel Vintage Park did not disappoint. I only wish I had more time to stay in Seattle. I am looking forward to my next adventure with Kimpton at The Grand Hotel in Minneapolis in November.

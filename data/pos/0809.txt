My flight out of Seattle after a convention was cancelled and I was lucky to get the last room available for one night at the Inn at the Market. My husband and I had stayed here before nearly 4 years ago. When I arrived, the front desk said, "Welcome back, Mrs. Adler. Do you still prefer the New York Times in the morning?" The location above the wonderful Pike Market is divine with those amazing $10 flower bouquets. And on a clear day you can buy wine, cheese and snacks in the market and then take them to the roof of the Inn for unparalleled views of Elliot Bay. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable and a bargain for what you get. I will always return to this lovely oasis in the remarkable Seattle!

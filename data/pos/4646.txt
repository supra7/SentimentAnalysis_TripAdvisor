I don't know how we managed, but we got a bargain price at the Westin, and loved it! Big room, great view, comfortable, roomy bed, excellent bathroom. What more could you want? It's very expensive at retail, but if you can get a deal, stay here. Right in the heart of Seattle, and you can walk to all sorts of fun destinations.

My girlfriend and I went on a vacation to Seattle and wanted to do it right! We spent a couple weeks trying to narrow down some hotels, but it started to become daunting. We had specifically ruled The Edgewater out for numerous reasons (the main being the large number of bad reviews we were constantly reading about it), but we waited until the day before and for some reason decided to do priceline and let fate decide. We wanted four star for fairly cheap ($109/nt) and close to town. When we were accepted and it The Edgewater we were kind ofdisappponted. When we got there the first night and saw our room we quickly realized why we got the dealwe did. It was a city side, of course, but the view is still really cool! Well, that night my girlfriend didn't sleep one hour because of the train noise and the rain on the all metal roof of the hotel (I personally love both of those sounds and could sleep all night to them all night). Shewentdown at 6am to the front desk and explained her issues with them. They were incredible about it. They upgraded us to a water view king with clawfoot tub and 50" flatscreesn and AMAZING view of the water, at no extra charge!!! That's four star! Unlined the bar in the hotel! The happy hour is fantastic while you watch the freighters roll in! Also the housekeeper, Idalia was the reason we stayed four nights and felt like royalty! She should get a raise. She wasn't even working yet and dropped what she was doing to grab us more coffee condiments when we couldn't find anyone else around!!! Thanks Idalia! You and the rest of the staff were great! The valets are top notch and everyone should take a lesson from this staffs playbook! Kudos to The Edgewater! The only negative thing i could think Tomsay would be the price of their patking...but its a big city! What do you expect? Having a rental car ther is key. Seatllemis an easy town to get around. Edgewater to west Seattle in 8-10 minutes! Word! Say

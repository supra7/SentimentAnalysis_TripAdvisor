I was looking for a moderately priced accommodation in the Belltown, Seattle area to stay at whilst enjoying the SuperBowl weekend in Seattle. A friend mentioned he had stayed for a very reasonable rate at a hotel called the SIXTH AVENUE INN. I found the hotel on Expedia and found the prices fit my budget, the amenities were excellent, the staff unfailing in their effort to please me and all suggestions of restaurants and clubs/pubs were spot on. The other members of my group who joined me at the hotel were completely impressed and still laud the hotel when our trip is brought up in conversation. A great feature is the hotels proximity to a fabulous gentlemans club, "lil darlings", at the foot of their parking lot. I will defiantly utilize this hotel when in Seattle for future sporting weekend trips with my friends. Top notch A+.

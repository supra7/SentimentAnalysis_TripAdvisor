I don't typically write reviews on sites, but I saw the last one and wanted to update it... I am physically writing from a room on the 16th floor of the Warwick hotel, visiting here from Hollywood, CA. I've stayed at a couple of hotels during this visit, and I have to say - this is extremely nice. I wanted to comment on the noise comment - I have to say, I think if you're familiar with city noise, this place is actually very quiet. I'm (again) from Los Angeles, so maybe my perspective is a little different, but it's actually a very quiet part of town. There is some construction going on about a block down, but it's during the day and not loud at ALL. I can't hear any of the other rooms, and the heater makes.. Well, the noise a normal hotel heater would make. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle ( and the museums around it), as well as Pike Place Market (and the waterfront). There is a very helpful store right across from it that stays open until 2 AM.. There's also constant cabs waiting outside the front lobby for when you want to visit other parts of the city. Also, if you have the opportunity - and no height issues - I would suggest asking for one of the higher floors - the rooms are all the same up until the suites on the top floor, so it's not pricier to ask for one. The view from either side is amazing - you can choose to have a view of the Space Needle, or of the city (I suggest the city - GORGEOUS). The staff have all been incredibly nice and helpful, and the room is exceptionally clean. Would totally suggest it to anyone!

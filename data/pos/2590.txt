After reading the many negative reviews on this property, I was hesitant. How long could it take to check in? Only a minute--and they have an "atm" style check in machine. The service: outstanding. Ask for a room facing Puget Sound on a higher floor for a view that rivals the Space Needle. The new flat screen TV was nice. The room was spotless. In short, the only thing I could confirm from reading the reviews below was that indeed the carpeting in the outside hall was a bit dated.

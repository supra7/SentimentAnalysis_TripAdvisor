The hotel is centrally located with Pike Place Market and the Westlake Shopping Mall a short walking distance away. With a taxi rank just outside the hotel, getting a cab was never difficult. Bellevue was approx. 20-30 min ride away and was around $45. My room was on the 30th floor with nice views over Seattle (even if not over the lake or Mountains). Checking in was quick and efficient and checking out even easier with fast check out available via video, TV or a box on reception. The room offered plenty of storage as well as a safe in the cupboard - there was also a iron and ironing board, which was handy. Unfortunately, I didn't get to check out the fitness room or the pool, but I wouldn't mind staying here again and checking it out then.

For my first visit to Seattle I chose this hotel because it seemed to have the best location. When I arrived I found out that I was exactly right. The views from the rooftop patio were Fantastic. The bedrooms were perfect with great amenities, i.e. designer shampoos/soaps, bed was memory foam, bathroom was clean and gorgeous. The staff were not far from my age(24) and when I needed advice on where to go for drinks they gave me their best. Everyone that worked there was perfect. When I return to Seattle this is likely the only place where I will stay. The Best!

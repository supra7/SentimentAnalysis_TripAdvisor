Booked a 4 night stay on Hotwire.com ($153/night), months prior to our visit. The Hotwire reservation gave us a standard room (2 beds), in the "older" tower. I took the advice of others and requested a King room in the newer tower (Union St.). Though the hotel couldn't grant our request until check-in, the front desk effortlessly obliged. Right away I felt our stay was a great value. The King room was spacious, impeccably clean, and had an exceptionally comfortable bed. What more do you need? There was of course Starbucks coffee in the room, a convenient business area in the lobby, and a knowledgeable, helpful concierge desk (all at no addt'l cost). It had the glamour & perks of a 4-star hotel without being stuffy. If I had to nit-pick; there was no free breakfast, no refrigerator, and a plain-jane tub/shower. But these are easy to forget. We didn't rent a car (public transportation and our feet were definitely sufficient), since the hotel is right in the middle of everything. We walked to the Pike St. market every day, did some shopping, and had a lot of coffee. The bus will take you to Alki beach (highly recommended), or most any other destination for dirt cheap.

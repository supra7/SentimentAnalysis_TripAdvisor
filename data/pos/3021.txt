We booked an extended weekend here through Hotwire and received a fabulous room on the 32nd floor overlooking downtown Seattle. Our hotel room was extremly plain for the quality of hotel that this was but the amenities were great: free wi fi, free breakfast, free afternoon appetizers, free workout center, etc. etc. My husband and I are very casual travellers so the bellhop was a bit intimidating when he made it very clear that I could not wheel in my own bags on the luggage rack but after that things were fine. The service was excellent: especially the staff members in the club lounge. They were extremly considerate, courteous and personable and were genuine in their desire to make your stay enjoyable.

We were traveling to Orcas Island for a wedding and wanted to stay in Seattle for my birthday. After much research we decided to book the Inn at the Market...WOW! The postiive feelings began with an enthusiastic greeting from the bell captain, then the warm reception from the reception desk! They had upgraded us due to my birthday! ( I wanted to show them my license that it really was my birthday!!!) The room was spacious, clean, and had an extrordinary view. The bathroom was also large and had wonderful soaps! When we walked into the room there were four mini cupcakes for my birthday!!!!! What a special touch! (I do love my birthday!!) We used the roof top deck that afternoon to enjoy a bottle of champagne; we met several peopel who also were loving the hotel! It was a glorious afternoon! We went back that night after dinner to enjoy the view once again! What can I say...service, view, rooms, location... all superior! Thank you Inn at the Market for a wonderufl birthday!

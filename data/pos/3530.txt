We stayed 3 times at the Andra; when first arriving in Seattle from Europe, then after a trip around Washington State and again after returning from an Alaskan cruise. We left a bag while in Alaska and it was waiting for us on our return. Each time we enjoyed our visit. The rooms were functional as well as attractive. We liked the big refrigerator and coffee maker and the large kitchen sink. Wonderful bed. Internet service was not provided in the room except for a fee. However we could sit in the attractive lobby and use the free wireless connection from the nice adjacent Lola restaurant where we usually ate breakfast. The hotel is convenient for shopping in the downtown area as well as the Pike Street market. Free bus service runs during the day on many streets around it. The area around the hotel is very nice during the day but changes character in the evening. Price for the room varied; very reasonable in late June early July, but went up during peak summer period.

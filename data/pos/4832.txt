My parents came to visit Seattle and stayed in a few different hotels while in the city -- University Inn was the nicest, friendliest, and least expensive. I believe their room was upgraded at no charge. It also included a complementary breakfast that they chose from a menu and was delivered to their room at the requested time. It's right near University of Washington, Lake Union/Washington, and the AMAZING Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast.

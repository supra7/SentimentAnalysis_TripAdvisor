The Hotel Sorrento was wonderful. The staff were extremely relaxed, friendly and helpful. The hotel has a wonderful old world charm. I noted a preference for vegan food in the online reservation and the staff went out of their way to address this on checkin and when I wnet to the restaurant. The room was superb. I would highly recommend a stay at the hotel Sorrento in Seatle.

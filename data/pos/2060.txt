Great stylish hotel for not a whole lotta cash - steps from the Pike Place Market, Belltown and the Space Needle. Staff was welcoming - didn't blink an eye when we showed up with our three kids five-years-old & under - even rustled up a crib for us. Mix of back-packers, hipsters and euro-travelers. Awesome dive bar on the first floor - which the kiddies prevented us from checking out - next time.

Found this hotel on Tripadvisor and delivered exactly what we were looking for. We used their Town Car service from SeaTac which worked smoothly. Great service and nice room at the hotel. It's a short walk to all that downtown Seattle has to offer. Did not dine at Lola in the hotel, but looked like a great spot.

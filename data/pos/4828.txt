We thoroughly researched hotels in Seattle which would be suitable for our family of four and we were certainly not disappointed with the University Inn. The service provided by the friendly and helpful staff was outstanding - the receptionists and shuttle bus service were second to none. A real home-from-home. The complimentary buffet breakfast served in the lobby each morning was an excellent start to the day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Seattle.

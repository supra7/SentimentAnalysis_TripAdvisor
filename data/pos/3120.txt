The Sheraton has the perfect location for attending a show at the conference centre -- it's right behind the hotel. I expected more from our room; it was nice but not four star deluxe. We weren't allowed to self park ("too crowded") so had no choice but to valet park which I felt was expensive at $35. Self park is bad enough at $28 but it's close to the going rate for downtown hotels. The great Priceline deal we got made it all worthwhile.

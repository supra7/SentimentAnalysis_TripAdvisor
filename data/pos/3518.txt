I stayed at the Hotel Andra after visiting Seattle several times. I had previously stayed at the Westin.I made the switch for the simple reason that i did not appreciate using paper cups for coffee, plastic in the bathroom ,no numbers on remote and being locked out of my room because of a problem with the old strip. The Andra was a step above at a more lower price the area was charming surronded with great resturants and a short walk to Pikes Market. The staff at the Andra was very helpfull in giving me directions for the transit system. YES I would recommend staying at Andra the room was big they even had a refrigator to stock my goodies and a nice bar sink with Glass Cups and Cerramic mugs for my Morning Cofee. Thank You For Putting Out The Welcome Mat.

The Sheraton is located across the road for the Convention centre which was very convenient for the early starts! The rooms are spacious and well furnished with two armchairs and small coffee table as well as a desk. Free internet access is available in the lobby area and there are 5 computers for guest use if you didn't bring your own. There is a little coffee shop offering a limited selection of breakfast food, lunch wraps and hot drinks- great to pick up some breakfast on the go. For a cooked breakfast head to The Daily Grill, located in the hotel but get there early. Would recommend The Daily Grill for dinner - the steaks were cooked to perfection. While in Seattle get to the Crab Pot down by the water, go on the Seattle Underground Tour and the Boeing Tour and visit the Mueseum of Flight.

I attended a conference at the Westin and stayed for 5 nights. After reading the reviews here, I asked for a recently renovated room. My request was granted and I'm sure contributed to my very pleasant stay. Everything was very clean. The room was large and the bed was very fresh, cozy, and comfortable. I didn't watch tv, but the room had a reasonably large flat screen. The honor bar, sadly, can't be used for storage. However, a complimentary bottled water and a coffee maker stocked with Starbucks is provided. The bathroom was also a reasonable size and provided the usual amenities. There was an iron and a safe in the closet. The hotel consists of two round towers, so there is a decent view from nearly every room I would guess. My room was not on a high floor, so I did not see Puget Sound, but I had a nice view of downtown and the monorail. I did not find the room to be noisy, but I live in an urban area so am not ultra sensitive to traffic noise. The greatest negative is the $9.99 per night charge for internet access in the room. (There is not a fee to print a boarding pass in the Business Center, however.) I ate a few times in both the restaurant and the "grab and go" cafe. The cafe was adequate. The restaurant was overpriced as hotet restaurants usually are, but the food was good and the service very nice. In fact, the few occasions I requested help from any staff member I was treated with great politeness. The location is terrific, a short walk to the Public Market and the monorail to the Space Needle, surrounded by stores and restaurants. I would definitely stay at the Westin again.

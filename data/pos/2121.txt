i must say that i was a little skeptical on such a place due to the price, in comparison with other hotels in the downtown area. man, was i wrong. very friendly staff, very helpful, and accomodating. building was very old, but very well upkept. only two blocks away from pike place market, four or five blocks from the shopping district, and the start of belltown (great restaurants and bars). would definitely encourage anyone looking for a great deal, and on a budget. will definitely stay again.

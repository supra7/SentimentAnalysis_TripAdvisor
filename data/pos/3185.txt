I enjoyed out stay at this hotel. Rooms were clean, staff was really friendly and we had a pretty great view of the downtown area! Not to mention it is very central to everything. The only things I had a bit of a problem with was that it was VERY over priced for some items. For example, long distance phone calls were expensive, snacks from the gift shop were overpriced, my friend got a bottle of water from the vending machine - paid a 1.25 and the bottle was a mini bottle, with about just a cup of water. You HAVE to have your car valet parked and it was about 30.00 a day. But other than that it was a good stay. The city was great, people were REALLY friendly, we are going back to explore more again soon.

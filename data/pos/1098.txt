Drove down to Seattle from Vancouver for my wife's birthday and she's been dying to stay at an Ace Hotel. We weren't disappointed! It's just like others have described it...a hostel for Adults. People were walking around in pyjamas at night/early morning and it just had a very cozy cool vibe. It's not your typical hotel so if you aren't flexible and open to new things you'll have a bad experience. Don't go! The continental breakfast was simple but fun. Fresh waffles, good Stumptown coffee, and clean. We were upgraded to room with its own washroom at no extra charge because I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. They also included a nice birthday greeting in our room. To everyone at Ace: keep on doing what you're doing! To those who are intrigued: give it a whirl!

We stayed here in September for my cousin's wedding and it was terrific. The staff was warm, friendly and helpful. While the room wasn't huge it was well appointed, clean and comfortable. I loved looking out the windows at the Library and being able to open them for a fresh breeze early in the morning. While they don't have coffee service in the room, it's available down in the lobby and they even provided us with "to go" cups for our morning walk. The location of the Vintage Park is wonderful. Easy walking distance to all of the sites and attractions as well as the Link. No need to rent a car. We will definitely stay at the Vintage Park the next time we are in Seattle.

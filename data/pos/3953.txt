My daughter and I made our annual 'day after Christmas' trip to Seattle and had decided to try the Edgewater Hotel. I found it to be a quaint, out of the ordinary place. The rooms were very nice and clean, the staff was friendly, and the food was just fine. Our room was lovely; we were given a room on the third floor overlooking the water. We had a great view of the ferry/shipping lanes and when it got dark the NOAA ship next door was all lit up with Christmas lights - quite beautiful. My only complaint is that the walls in this hotel are very thin. We heard everyone who walked by but worse, we heard a lot of noise from the room next door. It was late so we didn't call down, but I'm guessing from the sounds of things it was a couple on their honeymoon or something. It was a little embarassing to be sitting by the fire reading with my teenage daughter and hear the very obvious sounds that came from the next room. All in all, we'd likely stay here again sometime.

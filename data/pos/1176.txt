The hotel rooms are great, immaculately presented. The location of the hotel is excellent - within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, monorail, waterfront, markets. The $9.95 wifi charge was annoying particularly considering that once I agreed to the charge, I couldn't get connection. However since I only stayed the one night, it didn't bother me too much. The breakfast was quite good, with enough choice. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay at this hotel again if/when I'm back in Seattle.

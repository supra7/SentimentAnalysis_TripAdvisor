I'm a business traveler, and am about to book my fourth stay with Inn at the Market. If that doesn't say enough, then maybe you want to know that the rooms have always been impeccably clean without smelling like a bottle of Lysol, are well proportioned and not too small, have easy and reliable wi-fi access, and comfortable beds. The valets are quick and accommodating (pretty sucky job in the rain, but I've never experienced any attitude), the front desk staff have gone out of their way to be helpful, and the breakfasts from Bacco have been consistently good and delivered promptly. I have to assume the staff is following the lead of General Manager David Watkins, who clearly understands what it means to work in the "hospitality" business; he is accessible, responsive, thoughtful and seems to want guests to have an experience that makes them want to come back. (I have no personal or professional connection to Mr. Watkins. I just like to give credit when it's due.) The location speaks for itself. Overnight parking/valet cost is consistent with what I pay anywhere else -- LA, SF, NY, Chicago.

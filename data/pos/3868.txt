What a lovely accommodation...one could actually stand in the lobby and look straight down into the water of the Sound....it was breathtaking....the lounge was lovely with fun entertainment....the Beatles preview while we were there.....the food was wonderful and the rooms were very comfortable....but back to the view....unsurpassed....even saw Mt. Rainier and the Olympic Mtns.....

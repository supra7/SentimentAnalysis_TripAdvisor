We just returned from vacation where we spent 4 nights at the Mayflower Park. It was excellent. The service from the concierge to the bellmen was great. Our room was on the small side but it was fine for us. It is an old historic hotel so one has to expect that. The room was very clean and nicely decorated with a great view of the city (9th floor). The location of the hotel was very convenient. We walked to Pike Place in minutes (every morning!), we walked to the Space Needle through Belltown, to Pioneer Square and Capitol Hill. The restaurant in the hotel, Andaluca, had a great breakfast menu (never made it there for dinner). We went to Oliver's, the cocktail lounge, several time and recieved great service, expertly poured cocktails, and even free appetizers one night. I highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Seattle.

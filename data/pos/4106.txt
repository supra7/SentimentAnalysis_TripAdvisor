We had the pleasure of staying at this jewel of the Pacific Northwest the night before our cruise last week. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel also offered a complimentary pick up and departure in a luxury vehcile with driver; a definite bonus. The checkin was seamless and we were graciously welcomed by Desmond, the Head Concierge with an early checkin. Not sure whether it was due to Perfect Escapes or Desmond taking a shine to us but we were upgraded to a full one bedroom corner suite which was lovely. The hotel had an old world elegance with superb bedding, a marble bathroom and a very comfortable living room. The restaurant was as elegant as the hotel was charming and the food very tasty. We were however told that the "Continental Breakfast" included in our package enabled us to order anything off the menu, but when we checked out, we discoverd there was a $25 maximum sand had to pay extra. Thus we were mislead about that by someone. The hotel was still lovely tho.

Stayed here two nights, bookends for a cruise to Alaska. Bellman and Concierge were standouts and very knowledgeable about the area. We stayed in one King Suite and with an adjoining double queen room for our teenage kids. The guestrooms were quite large, especially the king suite. Loved, loved, loved the beds! Bathrooms were very luxurious, guestrooms were very quiet, and I never heard a peep from the elevator across the hall. Very convenient location, in the business district, but also very close to tourist attractions. Easy and enjoyable walk to Pike's Place Market and the Waterfront. We LOVE Seattle and would visit more often, were it not for the 7 hour flight. The Vintage gets high marks from this very particular traveler. Breakfast: La Panier, WOW..must go. Lunch: "Some Pig" Food truck at 2nd and Front Streets - Mon thru Fri Dinner: Ivar's Seafood on the waterfront.

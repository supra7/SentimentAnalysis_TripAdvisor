Was here for business for a week. Great shopping nearby and the first ever Starbucks is just around the corner. Hotel service was outstanding, from housekeeping to room service to efficient check in. Would definitely stay here again. Just beware walking outside late evening. A few colleagues walked back from a restaurant 5 blocks away and they walked past some very shady groups though no one bothered them.

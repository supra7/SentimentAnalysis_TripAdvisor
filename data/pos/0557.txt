Not a large hotel but newly decorated. Rooms are a good size and very clean. Excellent location, less than 2 blocks from the centre of town and only 4 blocks to the market area. Hotel resturant is a bustling place with alot of diners coming from off the street. Had a very good meal there. Overall, I would highly recommend staying there.

My husband and I enjoyed our three night stay at this wonderful hotel. First of all the staff is friendly and eager to help in any way. Second the location is perfect for walking to restaurants, the Public Market and shopping. Third we had a wonderful suite with a view of the water, a very comfortable bed., daily newspaper, access to a lovely rooftop lounge, complimentary coffee and it was quiet. Hands down the best stay ever for us in Seattle.

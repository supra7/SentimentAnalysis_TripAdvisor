We arrived a few hours before the wedding, and the staff treated us like royalty. They were right there asking us if we needed anything and offering thier services at any time. The room was lovely and the view was incredible! We have stayed in this hotel before and everytime we stay the service surpasses our expectations. We will be back for sure!!!!

Hi My wife & I just stayed there 2 nights. Like other reviews, the hotel needs a little lift up (which they were starting the outside facade when we were there) but we had great service. The Front Office employee : Darrell was really nice. Other staff are friendly too.We stayed in a Junior Suite, spacious and very calm. It was nice because we really caught up with the sleep we needed. I would recommend this hotel and will of course stay there again. Great location, just a couple blocks away from every thing. Have fun

We checked into Hotel Monaco on Thursday, May 24th. Drove up to valet and was immediately attended to. Check in was fast and easy. The front desk staff was nice and friendly. We were given a room on the 9th floor, I requested a higher room and not to be on the "pet" floor, days prior. Our room was nice, clean and HOT. The thermostat was at 78 degrees. We adjusted the setting and nothing worked. We called the front desk and they had some one up in 10 minutes to check. He said he fixed it and my party went downstairs to take in the free wine/beer tasting. (very good and they give you a nice size pour on the wine) I went back to the room to see if it was it had cooled down, it had not. I went to the front desk to see what else they can do. They gave me two options, they can send someone else to fix it again or give me a new room. I decided to not take my chances and get a new room. I asked the front desk manager, since it's an inconvenience pack up and move to a different room if there was any form of compensation they could give us. The hotel comp'd our parking ($31.00) I was satisfied with that. Our new room was COOL and had a working fan. This was my first visit to a Kimpton Hotel and overall I was pleased. What I liked: The beds The cool bath robes The TV The in room shampoo/conditioner/lotion The Goldfish sent to your room The location - smack dab in the middle of downtown shopping/restaurants/pike st. market and pioneer square/stadiums. All within walking distance. What I didn't like: The iron - it kept leaking water and didn't work. The bathroom - no fan

I was on a long road trip from Phoenix to Seattle before flying up to Alaska for 10 days. We'd been driving for some time and were really excited to pull up to the doormen and relax for a while. We like staying in Historic Hotels and places with a little back history so the Mayflower was perfect. The lobby was full of people which is always nice to see and we were able to check in a few hours early. The room was great, very clean, very traditional but with a great view of the city on two sides. Great bathroom! We got several recommendations from the doormen/bellmen on where to go (first time in Seattle) and good places to eat. We parked our car overnight ($20 overnight which is fine) and in the morning it was waiting for us as they said it would be. Overall it was great and we really enjoyed ourselves. No noise from the streets when you are sleeping so that's a bonus. The elevators always have staff in them but they were always nice and we just figured since it' s an older building they don't have a service elevator. Comes with the territory and only a negative if the staff were not outgoing and friendly, which they were. Great trip and highly recommend the hotel!

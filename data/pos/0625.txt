This location is perfect! It is right by the market and close to all other attractions! I was very impressed with the helpfulness of the staff especially with one ot the attendants, Andrew P.! He provided my husband and I with oerfect recommendations for dinner and went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleaant stay! The rooftop garden has nice seating and a great view! I would stay here again!

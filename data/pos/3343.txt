The atmosphere and cleanliness of this hotel makes it one of the top hotels in downtown Seattle. The staff is also very professional and courteous. The location is also perfect if you want to shop, site see or do anything else in the downtown area. I stay in Seattle at least once or twice a month and this is always the place I call my home away from home.

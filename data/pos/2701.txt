My husband and I stayed here recently when I was attending a conference in Seattle. I am somewhat familiar with the city, so I was very pleased at the central location of the hotel. We didn't have a car with us after the first hour or so, so we didn't have to worry about the parking costs--but the staff out front (the valets and the doormen) were very, very helpful when we needed to leave our rental car in front for a few minutes so that we could check in and then return the car to Hertz. Although I had written on my reservation form that I wanted a room away from an ice machine or the elevators, the young man at the front desk initially put us in a room right next to the ice machine. Fortunately, we were moved to a room at the other end of the hall (another corner room), which was lovely, spacious, and quiet. In all, we had a good stay.

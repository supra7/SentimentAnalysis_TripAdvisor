We have stayed twice at this hotel when we travel to Seattle Mariners games. The rooms are small but the location and cost are great. You can walk to the Amtrak, both stadiums, Metro, Pikes Market, and downtown. The rooms are small but ours have always been clean and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is very courteous and friendly. This past visit we forgot some expensive items in the safe both Gabriel and Roberto were so helpful in getting our stuff found and back to us. We would highly recommend this hotel to others.

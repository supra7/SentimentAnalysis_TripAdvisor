I had read several reviews before booking this hotel, and most of the positive ones were very true! Before staying here, you have to know that this hotel is older. They have done several renovations to upgrade the hotel. This hotel is not the nicest or fanciest hotel you will ever stay at, but it was located within walking distance of many of the destinations that we wanted to visit. If you are going to Seattle as a tourist, this hotel is perfect because you won't be in your room very often if you are out touring the city. The rooms and bathrooms were small, but again not that big a deal if you are in and out as quickly as we were. Stay here if you want a great deal and a safe, clean place to sleep at night.

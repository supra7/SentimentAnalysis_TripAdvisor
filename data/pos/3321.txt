We stayed six nights at the Sixth Avenue Inn. It was a nice, central location for the price we paid. We got a slightly better rate via Expedia than was available booking direct via their web site. We had a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor, on the side of the hotel not facing the adult bookstore. It looked like perhaps those on that side were all doubles? The neighborhood seemed safe, and was within easy walking distance to many restaurants, shops, etc. Hotel furnishings were not new by any means, definitely showing signs of wear, but no real complaints in that department. We could hear a bit of street and hall noise at times, but never enough to keep us awake at night. It was always much quieter when we had the curtains closed. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful, both at the desk and in the restaurant. Restaurant menu was limited overall, but had a good selection of reasonably priced items for breakfast. The room service menu (which we never utilitized) featured a handful of the same restaurant items at an average of $2 additional per item. Our room was clean, and housekeeping staff did a good job throughout the week. They give you the option of new sheets/towels each day. We went to Seattle to experience the city, not to lounge in our room. Overall, this hotel was exactly what we needed and we'd recommend it to friends and stay here again.

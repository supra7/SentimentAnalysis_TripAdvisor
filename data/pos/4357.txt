We stayed at the Westin for 3 nights. We got an awesome deal through priceline. We stayed in the 33rd floor with a beautiful view of the Puget Sound. The manager even sent a birthday cake to our room for my daughter's birthday. Awesome staff and location. One block from the light rail that takes you to and from the airport, one block from the monorail that takes you to the Space Needle and across the street from the street car that takes you to Lake Union for the boat cruises. Walking distance to the Pike's market, waterfront etc. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you Elisabeth James (Manager) for your outstanding service.

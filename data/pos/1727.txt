My husband & I just returned from a trip to Seattle celebrating our 40th anniversary and had a great time thanks to Trip Advisor. We stayed at the Mayflower Park and couldn't have asked for anything better. It's a beautiful hotel in a good location. We had a one bedroom corner suite, which gave us more than enough room to walk around. No noise in the hallways or coming through walls and very clean. We were touched to find a card wishing us a happy anniversary with a small box of candy. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly. We did the Boeing Tour & City Tour with Show Me Seattle. Nice to not have to battle the downtown traffic and one way streets. Both guides were friendly and informative. We also did the Queen of Seattle ride on Lake Union. It was nice to see the community of houseboats, including the houseboat from the Sleepless in Seattle movie. One day we did the Space Needle, and yes it was a bit expensive. But...it is the Space Needle and something I wanted to do. Definitely worth it. Plus they will take your picture as you are walking up the elevator, then send it to you via e-mail. The only thing about our trip that surprised us was the steep hills. It didn't stop us from walking down to the waterfront, but it was a bit of a challenge coming back up. For dinner, we ate at Il Fortunaio and enjoyed it. Father's Day we ate at the Six Seven Restaurant on the waterfront. We had a great brunch and a beautiful view. It was definitely a trip we will remember.

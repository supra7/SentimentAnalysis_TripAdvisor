I stayed at the executive pacific hotel for 5 nights prior to boarding a cruise. The hotel was in an excellent location. 10 minute walk to Pike Market every morning for fresh pasteries and flowers. There is a Seattle's Best in the lobby. My room was extremely small but very well appointed. Front desk staff was hit or miss. Kerri who checked me in was very pleasant as was Stan the front desk man. Lots of restaurants in the area and a straight walk down Spring to the harbor. I would stay here again when visiting Seattle.

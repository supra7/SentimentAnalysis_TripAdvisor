Hahaha. So I booked a room with two double beds for me and 3 of my friends online. And when we got there we didn't have a bathroom in our room, it was down the hall. And there wasn't an option for a bathroom online that I remember. And the room we got was tiny! So we asked the front desk and they were happy to accommodate us for only ten dollars more we got our bathroom, and a MUCH bigger room. But aside from that. Everything you need is right by the hotel! Parking was cheap, After the hotel discount. And the hotel was beautiful. The bathroom and the first room were a minor setback.

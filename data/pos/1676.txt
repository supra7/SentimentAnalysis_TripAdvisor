This was the second time I stayed at Mayflower Park, so obviously I liked it the first time around. The Mayflower is an historical hotel, and has the ambiance to match. Even the cheapest room was perfectly fine, and twice I was upgraded to a "deluxe queen" without extra charge. The food from room service was delicious, delivered quickly and always piping hot. The staff couldn't have been better. In short, one of my favourite hotels ever, and where I will always stay when passing through Seattle. Also, within comfortable walking distance from downtown, Pike Place, and just around the corner from Top Pot donuts!

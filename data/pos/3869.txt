My wife and I had a wonderful time in Seattle and chose the Edgewater for its location on the water and its proximity to downtown and Pike Place Market. We weren't disappointed. We read all the bad reviews prior to booking and just wanted to experience it for ourselves. I'm not quite sure what the bad reviews were all about as the whole staff from the valet to the front desk attendants to the wait staff to the maids were all very courteous and greeted you upon arrival and throughout our stay. We did have a partial waterfront view room and was great, very cozy and the fireplace kept the room nice and warm. The next time I am in Seattle, I would stay here again, can't wait unitl our next trip.

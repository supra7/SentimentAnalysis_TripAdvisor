I recently spent over a month at this hotel while staying in Seattle to work with a client. The staff where very accommodating and able to assist me with booking issues that came up over weekends when they where sold out due to the large conferences that where being held within the facility. Location wise you can not ask for much better if you are in town for sight seeing or a business meeting with close walking distance to the CBD and Pike Place market attractions. I also found the staff in both the Lobby Bar and Daily Grill where great. If you are looking for a decent happy hour the daily grill is a good find with running two per night with one at 3-6 PM and 10:00 PM till closing with excellent food and drink specials. The Club Floor Lounge available to people staying on the club floors has a very decent Continental breakfast in a clean quiet environment with a great selection of fresh fruits and other cold items. My only negative things to say about the hotel would be if you are staying in rooms 3425 or 3426 you will hear allot of noise above you from the work room area and can cause you to get woken up early. The only other downside is that the cleaning staff like to start cleaning rooms early and I had been woken up at around 8:00 AM on a weekend for cleaning.

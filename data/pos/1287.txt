I got the hotel room for a great price, using on online discount site. The staff was very helpful and friendly. There was a working fireplace and some comfortable chairs in the lobby. The king size bed had a pillow top, and on the bed was a pretty bag with lavender linen spray, ear plugs & face mask. The room included a safe, desk and office-type chair, plasma TV, nice quality ice bucket, coffee maker, CD player/radio/alarm clock. The heater was a bit loud, but I was so tired that I didn't notice it after a while. The bathroom included a clothesline, hair drier, nice shower head, magnifying mirror, night light, and great smelling shampoo, conditioner & lotion (not too masculine or feminine). There was a note on the big mirror saying that if you forgot to bring anything, such as toothpaste, comb or whatever, that they would bring you a complimentary replacement. The toilet was too low. I felt like I was going to fall into it every time I used it. The closet had an iron & ironing board, wooden clothes hangers and extra pillows. The room seemed large, and was very quiet (when the heater wasn't running!). It was a little bit of an uphill hike from the Westlake Mall, but it would probably be a lot easier to get to via cab or car. It's a shame that my room didn't have a little refrigerator. I had a great stay at that hotel, and wish I could have stayed there longer. I didn't use the valet parking, room service or wi-fi, so I can't comment on that.

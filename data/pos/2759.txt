* Location was great - walking distance to nearly everything we wanted to do, in a safe neighborhood. * Rooms were well appointed and clean * Doormen and front desk staff were excellent * Lobby was very nice and clean * Only flaw, the drain in our bathroom was clogged and the hotel maintance crew couldn't get it fixed right over the course of our three day stay. * Regardless, I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat.

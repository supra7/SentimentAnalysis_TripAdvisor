The inn is older, but well looked after. Great if you had business at the hospital next door. Walking distance to downtown and the Quest Field. The fold away bed in the suite was uncomfortable , my daughter ended up sleeping on the floor!!. If you do stay here, I would recommend eating at the hospital canteen,than the hotels. A lot cheaper, better and quicker.

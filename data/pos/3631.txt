I picked the Hotel Andra from reviewing the hotels on this web site and I'm glad I did. My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights in mid-July. It offered everything we were looking for - very friendly staff, perfect location, larger than usual room, contemporary feel, daily paper, and fairly priced. Really enjoyed the contemporary look of the room and a very comfortable bed. Staff could not have been friendlier. Since it was our first time in Seattle, we were especially pleased how easy it was to walk to the Market (10 mins), Space Needle (15 mins), Great shopping (5 mins), and even the ball park (about 35 mins). The only things that don't put it in the league of a 5 star is that the bathrooms are nicely updated, but basically older. Also, as mentioned here, the hallway lighting was kind of funky and took a day or two to get used to. We never once smelled any odors from the restaurant. It was noisy from the street several mornings, but I don't know what they could do to help that. Hope you enjoy your stay there as much as us.

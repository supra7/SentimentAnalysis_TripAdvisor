Spent a night here prior to shifting to a different conference hotel in town. The hotel is clean and comfortable, and has a very nice location near various attractions. Also, the floor to ceiling windows are neat, as are the wedge-shaped rooms since the towers are circular. There were a few *minor* annoyances, such as the following: 1) due to a delayed train, we checked in at almost 1am with our 6 year old. There was a line 4 deep at check in, and one of the two agents on duty just chatted with guests for a long time while the rest of us waited to get checked in and to our rooms; 2) the pool and spa area was completely closed the day we were there, and there was no announcement of that fact nor any apology for it until I escalated the situation to a manager; 3) as a SPG gold member, supposedly I can get an upgraded room and a late check out, but in this case I was told I had to choose one or the other (so I chose the late check out). None of this is a big deal, but I find these little things add up to the difference between a great hotel and a good one.

I booked this hotel on recommendations from other reviews on TripAdvisor. This was my first trip to Seattle.The hotel lobby looked like it was recently updated and the new wing looked great. Unforunately we were put in the old Tower. I forgot to request a room in the newer Union Square tower. This was the only downfall to my stay here. I got a great deal through priceline so I guess I shouldn't complain. The location of this hotel was perfect. Only several blocks away from the Monorail that takes you to the Space Needle. Walking distance to Pike Place, Nordstrom, Macy's. There is a Regal Cinema, Gamworks, Niektown, American Eagle, and The Cheesecake Factory right across the street. You won't need a car unless you want to go outside of downtown. I was debating whether I should get a car and I am glad I didn't. Parking at the hotel is $35 for overnight guest which is very pricey. You can take the bus around the free zone which is much downtown from 6am to 7pm.

We checked in during a very hectic time, Black Friday. Even with the crowds around for the Gingerbread Village, shopping and Westlake tree lighting, the service was great. We really liked our room on the 24th floor. The location was ideal, especially for walking to Pike Place. We got a great deal on the room, which made up for the expensive valet parking - and street parking is pretty easy in the evening time (best bet on Saturday after 6pm, because it will be free through Sunday). We would stay here again!

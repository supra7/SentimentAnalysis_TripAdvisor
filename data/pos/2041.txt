My fiancee' and I traveled to Seattle last summer and spent a night at the Moore hotel. While all other hotels charged upwards of $300 a night during the busy Labor Day Weekend, the Moore hotel was just under $90 a night (excluding taxes, etc). To say the least, it was money well spent!!! Great location... only blocks to the Pike Market. As for the hotel room... its nothing fancy! Clean room.... bed.....clean shower.... what more do you need?? Thanks to trip advisor, I was able to spend the extra money on a nice dinner, and a bottle of wine!! I would hightly recommend this hotel... especially if you aren't into the fancy, overpriced hotels.

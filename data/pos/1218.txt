Stayed at this hotel with my wife and son for four nights while we were attending the Penny Arcade Expo at the Convention Center in Aug. The absolute best thing about this hotel was the short walk (about 7 mins or so) to the Convention Center. Everything else about this hotel was pretty much average. The on site resteraunt is small but the buffet breakfast in the morning was a plus. The rooms were nice but having to pay everyday for internet access was a minus. The staff was profesional and did a good job giving me directions to various places when I asked them. Overall, I would only stay at this hotel again if I was attending another event at the Convention Center (or taking a cruise form the nearby port). If you plans include other destinations, I'd look for a less expensive hotel.

My husband and I made a trip to Seattle in mid-June for his niece's graduation. We decided on the Sorrento, based on the information on their website. We wanted something that was NOT downtown, but was within easy access to all the "touristy" things we usually do for a few hours. We found the staff to be very friendly and professional. The suite we had, which had formerly been the Music Suite and had been transformed into the Romance Suite, was well-appointed, the bed was extraordinarily comfortable, and the Martini package made a nice bonus at the end of a day. A special "bravo" should go to the Concierge desk. They were prompt with suggestions, accurate in their knowledge of the city, and always ready to step up to solve a problem. This was my 22nd trip to Seattle in the last 15 years and I'm pleased to say that I would gladly stay at the Sorrento Hotel on the next trip, and the next.... My advice to someone wishing to stay there - this is NOT an ultra modern hotel, but has character flowing out of every wall. Read the website, it is extremely accurate regarding rates, appointments, and features (except that the Music Suite information hasn't been changed). The parking is expensive, but well worth it. The courtesy vehicle is at the ready and quite handy for trips downtown. The bar and restaurant are wonderful too! Overall, we are glad we "discovered" it and will be back!

We loved our stay here at the Mayflower Park. We were upgraded to a suite for our anniversary. The manager also sent a small box of candy and card to the room later that evening. Very nice. The room was quite roomy, 10th floor and a view. Great bed and quiet. We arrived about noon and were going to store luggage until the room was ready BUT it was ready. Unfortunately the restaurant was being renovated. They had a small continental breakfast set up in the lounge. That was okay but not worth the $12.00 each they charged us since it was really not any nicer than a free Holiday Inn Express breakfast. The waiters were great and very apologetic. They even used only paper products since they didn't have a dishwasher. We would have ventured out for breakfast but it was pouring.

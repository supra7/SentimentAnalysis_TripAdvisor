Booked this trip using the new "hotel bucks" in the Entertainment book. The rate we got was $112 in early December. I love coming to Seattle at this time of the year, because there is such a nice energy on the streets. The Westin has a great downtown location. We like to park the car for the weekend and walk everywhere. (go to Serious Pie!) People complain about the parking fees, but all the downtown hotels charge for this. You have to factor it into the price. We paid $25/night to self-park in the garage with the skybridge. (ask the valet) This is actually cheaper than most places downtown. When checking in, the clerk said that she had us booked into a basic "two doubles" room. I asked if she happened to have a king or queen available. She said sorry, there was no king available, but she did have a queen. Sounds good. We headed up to our room on the 44th floor, and yes we had a room with a single queen bed. It was also a massive suite with a dining table and a living room! Oh, it also had an amazing Puget Sound view. So yes, we were pretty impressed. The hotel is older, but well kept. Location is its best feature.

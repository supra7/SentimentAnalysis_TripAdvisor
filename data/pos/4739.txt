As a youngster, staying at this Travelodge on family vacations was a real treat. I can still recall The Space Needle under construction during one of our visits. Flash foward to the present and this babyboomer checked in at the main desk of one of Seattle's venerable motor lodges. I was greeted by two smiling clerks. Informing them that my last stay was in 1979, I was given a Seattle street map to get me up to speed. Thanks again, guys. My compliments to the persons in charge of interior decor. Throughout the hotel, from the elevator entrances to the hallways, are framed prints of works from Salvador Dali and Jackson Pollock among other artists. My room was spotless and there were plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom, including a hairdryer. The bed was comfortable and not too soft, either. I would start my day with a complimentary USA Today and walk a few steps past the lobby to the buffet room with a free hot breakfast waiting. Their waffles are perfect and they know how to make a great cup of coffee, too. The only glitch throughout the whole stay was momentary when the toilet lever in my room suddenly wouldn't flush. I called the front desk and the courteous young man replied, "Ooooo, that's not good. Someone will be up in a few minutes to fix it." Within 5 minutes, there was the hotel plumber at my door with a smile on his face and the problem was solved. Housekeeping deserves applause, too, for their polite and cheery way they greet guests. Centrally located, this Travelodge is just a 10-15 min. walk to the heart of downtown. Taking the monorail cuts that timeframe in half. I took advantage of both modes of travel. At the end of the day, I looked forward to relaxing back in my room on the fourth floor.

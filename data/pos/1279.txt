The service at this hotel is fantastic, probably one of the best in Seattle. They have this really cool video about the hotel and their staff and it really shows that they are committed to providing a good guest experience. Rooms are BIG, and bed was fine, clean rooms. Their is a vending machine on each floor and also in the bottom floor. Breakfast at the hotel is fantastic value and the food was great, free newspapers are everywhere, at the door, room, restaurant. They also have a airline checkin station in the lobby if your interested that covers all airlines that have webcheckin. They also have no free wifi, but in the business center there was free internet on the computers, which might have been a tech issue because they advertise that they charge for it. Should be free anyway. Price was good value at normal rate on Expedia for $109 with the normal $10 off code so pretty good price for such a big and comfy hotel. If ever in Seattle in the future, or if friend/family head up there I will send them here! Cons: -Aircon/Heater unit would not stop! It was that loud that it takes a while to get to sleep sometimes and you cant even change the temperature. -To get the shower/bath working, you need to pull out this metal plug thingy in the wall, its an old device to get the water going and coming from another country I had no clue how to get the water going. -Location is at the top of the hill and walking into Seattle and back is pretty tiring at times.

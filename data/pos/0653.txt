I won a quick trip to Seattle from Vancouver, B.C. through Seattle Holidays and CKNW radio. The trip included two nights at Inn at the Market, dinner at El Gaucho Steak, a Savor Seattle Tour of Pike Market and lunch at Purple. We loved our room at Inn at the Market. The trip was for 2 but I called and said I had two children and they gladly up graded me to a market view room at no charge. This room was a corner room on the 4th floor over looking Pine street and Pike Market. I was impressed with the ease of finding the Hotel and the valet parking and check in was a breeze. The special touches of apples, candy canes, hot cider and fresh cookies in the lobby really put the personal touch on our stay. The in room coffee and newspaper at the door were a bonus. I would recommend this hotel for familys, singles or couples. It was a wonderful trip of bonding and fun with my two young teens. They had fun with their mom.

The hotel was conveniently located downtown near attractions and had a very friendly staff (someone was always at the desk 24-7 and helped direct us to downtown areas). Free Wi-Fi and printer access was a plus. The room and bathroom was very clean and I felt was spacious relative to the price and the area we were staying. My wife and I reserved a hotel reservation using an online special in March 2011 for a great rate. We planned to stay here on the way back from an Alaskan cruise so we could see downtown before catching our plane back home through SEA-TAC airport. I called a few weeks ahead of time to confirm and even received an automated e-mail 2 days before hand confirming our stay. However, when we arrived they could not find us with the e-mail printout reservation number or by our last name. At first I panicked, because the hotel was very full and I was concerned I was going to be stuck going somewhere else for 3X the price given that the summer season had just started. I am not sure exactly what happened (computer glitch?) but the staff was very patient and worked hard to find a room for us. We ended up checking in a little later but we got a complementary shuttle to the airport the next morning (normally $35-$40 from downtown) and upgraded to a king size bed. A mixup like this could happen anywhere, but what is important is if it does how the problem is handled. I was very impressed on how the staff was very polite and geniunely concerned to make sure we were taken care of. Highly recommend.

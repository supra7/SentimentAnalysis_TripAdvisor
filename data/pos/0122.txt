We have stayed in Kimpton Hotels before and the personal, friendly service is consistent regardless of location. The Seattle Monaco was no different. Seattle hotels can be quite expensive in the summer, but the Monaco, while not cheap, was affordable and very well located. We had the entire family with us, so we needed a suite and two rooms. We were all located together, a great convenience. We only used room service once for coffee. The cost of room service everywhere is absurdly high these days. I cannot say it was great value, but it was delivered promptly. Service in the bar downstairs was very hospitable and the evening refreshments were welcome. Finally, the bell staff were great at getting our rather large group in as few taxis as possible and this on a weekend where taxis were at a premium.

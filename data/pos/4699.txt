Great hotel. Very very clean. Great bathroom, bed, nice nice place. A bit noisy at night, but what hotel isn't? Stunning views from upper floor North Tower rooms (Floor 40 and up). Lounge was a very "happening" place at night. Also, location is great, about 5 blocks at most from Pike's Market.. about 3 blocks from the Convention Center. Literally around all shops and so on. Did not eat at hotel, but looked very nice. Hotel is very, very busy, but also well-staffed with nice people. There were numerous times I called the front desk for various things.. and no one answered. So I called later and was finally answered. To be expected. This hotel appears packed at all times. $183 nightly.

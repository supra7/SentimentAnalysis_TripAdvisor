As a Seattle resident I had eyed the Sorrento Hotel from buses and cars many times as I traveled into the city, and just loved its old swanky look. So it was the first one on my list when it came to look for special places to celebrate my anniversary. Although I live just a few miles from it, our stay at the Sorrento felt like anything but home, from the complimentary valet parking (which can be such a hassle) to the lemon water in the lobby. And there was even live music in the lounge that evening! Things were a bit chaotic when we got there because of a Halloween event, but I enjoyed the feeling of having it be a bit populated -- in case we wanted to mingle later! -- and the staff were still able to give us their full attention. The rooms are beautiful; the best bed I've ever slept in, terry cloth robes, and the prettiest little bathrooms full of marble, porcelain, and bright white linens galore. The golden details and little architectural additives make it feel very unique and very special. They even have locally-brewed coffee and french presses in each room! And the "honor bar" had anything I could have wanted - sweets, savories, wine! It was a wonderful place to spend an anniversary, complete with the best breakfast-in-bed I've ever had, delivered by a smiling, helpful staff member. All this to say that even as a local, I spent a better, more unique, AND less expensive night at this hotel than I could have at any other downtown hotel, and I would recommend it to anyone who has the chance. We had a lovely experience. Thanks Sorrento!

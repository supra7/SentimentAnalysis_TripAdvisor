This place is an enormous double-tower hotel around the corner from the convention center. The rooms are good, standard-issue Sheraton, not overly large, but adequate. It's right in the middle of things downtown and you'll be able to walk everywhere. We stayed in the new tower on the top floor and the peekaboo views of the water and mountains were fun. we also had a screaming deal on the room ($89).

I loved this hotel - we went as part of our honeymoon and the wonderful staff at the hotel upgraded our room for us (we brought our marriage cert!) and put some wonderful chocolate covered bride and groom strawberries in a box on our pillow for us. The room was brilliant, very comfortable and looked over Pike Place Market and the Sea. The hotel is so central and near some fantastic restaurants and all the brilliant shops of Seattle. We went to have a bucket of seafood on the boardwalk - what an experience - it was very enjoyable and very delicious. We had a truely lovely time at this hotel.

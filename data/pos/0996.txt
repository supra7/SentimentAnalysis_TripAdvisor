We just returned from 8 wonderful nights at IATM and were extremely pleased with our stay. First, the location couldn't be more convenient to just about everything in the city. You are conveniently about 6 blocks from Convention Center, yet away from the crowds that it can draw. Some of the best eateries are within steps of the hotel - including Campagne, which we highly recommend. Our room was a water view and we spent many evening watching the sunset - as well as morning watching cruise ships dock. I couldn't put a price on the views and the fact you can open the floor to ceiling windows and experience the breeze and sounds of the market. When the window is closed, we did not have any noise to speak of, although we were on the top floor. The room itself was extremely clean and I am a bit picky when it comes to that in particular. The staff was very helpful in a variety of ways including making taxi and dinner arrangements - providing a vase for fresh flowers from the market, or simply always making sure that the door was opened for us each and every time we came or left. Used the business center once and it was very well maintained and stocked. Although this hotel may be a bit higher is cost, I would definitely do it all over again and hope we can go back there in the future.

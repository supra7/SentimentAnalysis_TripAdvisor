The Westin Seattle has very clean rooms and very good amenities. It's location makes it a quick commute from the airport. I took the Light Rail and it got me to within a block of the hotel as quickly and WAY cheaper than a cab. It is a short walk from the waterfront and, being in central Seattle, has lots to do. Nice gym and pool facility and the in-house restaurant is very nice - though you want to explore the great food options in the neighborhood. Great choices. I recommend it highly

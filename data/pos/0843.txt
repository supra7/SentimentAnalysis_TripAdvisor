Small lovely boutique hotel. Very Frazier Crane! Professional, friendly staff. Perfect location for experiencing the public market and surrounding sights. Took in the Picasso exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum, which just is a block or two away. Lots of fun visiting thelively public market area during the Christmas season. Beautiful sweeping view of Seattle waterfront and market from our suite, which had a large, wemi-private large patio area off our suite. Easy walk to large number of great restaurants. We had a wonderful french dinner across the courtyard at Le Campagna. We are anxious to return soon!

This is a great hotel if you get a good price. The location can't be beat (unless you can get right at Pike's Market), and it's just across from Macy's and some other great stores. It's a very manageable walk to the Market and back. It's not too far uphill either way. The room was nice, the bed comfortable, and the service good. The restaurant service was a little slow, and the food was somewhat pricey. The breakfast buffet didn't look like a good deal to us, so we ordered off of the menu. We recommend this hotel and don't have any negative things to say.

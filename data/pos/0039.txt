Had a great stay at the Hotel Monaco. The rooms were gorgeous and huge, bed so comfortable, staff was super accommodating and the location was great. Although the price is a little high, it is well worth it as this was one of my best hotel experiences ever. They are also pet friendly which is nice and a lovely goldfish (courtesy of the hotel) was my roommate for the stay. I have since joined the Kimptons loyalty plan and will definitely stay at their hotels when available.

We booked this Travelodge because it was a good deal and seemed to be within distance of all the Seattle tourist spots. The hotel is right by the Space Needle. We flew into SEA-TAC, took the train to the end of the line, hopped onto the monorail and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel. Inside the lobby is coffee, lemon water, and pastries 24/7. The worker at the front desk was very helpful with directions and bus tips. For instance, this was a non-rental car trip, so we needed the FREE buses to get around downtown. The free zone buses run through most of the day (6 AM  7 PM, I think) in the downtown area, so take advantage. You will need to walk a few (short) blocks to get the free zone from the hotel, but its nothing. As for breakfast, it is very good for a complimentary breakfast: waffle bar, eggs, sausage, cereal, yogurt, juice, milk, fruit, and pastries--really good for the money. The rooms themselves are nice enough and clean, though the walls are fairly thin. In short, it was a very nice price to stay here at such a great deal!

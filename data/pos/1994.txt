The Moore Hotel has a really great vibe to it - a cool old building, great location, very friendly staff, great decor, etc. I stayed with a friend while in Seattle for a conference. The beds were very comfortable, the room spacious, and there was a good view. The only con.s for me were that 1. there's only one key per room (actual key, not key card) so we had to switch off who was responsible for that, which was tricky at times - although we could leave the key with the front desk as needed, and 2. the wireless internet was unavailable in my room - it was one of those things that maybe if your computer was positioned just right in just the right corner of the hallway or something you could get it, but mostly no. I was able to connect just fine for free in the lobby (which was comfortable and well decorated). A minor concern in addition was that my reservation didn't appear when I checked in - they were having some sort of computer problem that day. It was resolved quickly and the staff were really friendly through the process. Again, the location is wonderful - a quick walk to tons of restaurants, bars, shopping, etc., you're right over Pike Place, etc. I would definitely stay here again, especially considering the great price! PS: There were no shows going on during my stay so I can't speak to the noise from the music venue. Our room was nice and quiet.

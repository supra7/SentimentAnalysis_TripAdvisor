We stayed there in February, and despite the dreary weather we had gorgeous views of the water, and woke up to the gulls. The room was small, but cozy with a gas fireplace. The beds have a duvet so nice and comfy. The only issue was the bathroom with its stone floor is FREEZING and you can't go in there with bare feet. No tub either. It is a noisy hotel, presumably because it's older you can hear the pipes, the people around you flush their toilet etc. Otherwise, the room was okay, the view made up for it all. The restaurant in the hotel is awesome. Breakfast was incredible and reasonable. Again, you can sit and watch the tug boats and the ferry, great to sit and have a bottle of wine in the evening.

If you ever are in Seattle,you should stay at the Mayflower hotel.It combines old elegance with modern facilities.It is very conveniently situated,near the sky train and only a 10 min.walk to the famous Market square.The rooms are very spacious and especially check the Olive's bar where you can grab a snack while the barman mixes your favorite drink.Highly recommended

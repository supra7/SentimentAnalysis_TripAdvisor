This small hotel is at the corner of 4th and Spring, which is a very convenient location for all of the main downtown Seattle things to do, like Pike Place, the Public Library, Smith Tower, Bank of America Tower, nice restaurants, the SAM, the Symphony, shopping, etc. We almost didn't need a car except that we wanted to go around the Olympic Peninsula. The rooms are a little small, but still comfortable, and clean, and the price was very respectable. The customer service was great at the front desk, the valet, and the ladies who cleaned the rooms (we always left the room a little disheveled, and returned to a spic and span room). I booked the room and then later called and asked if it had a tub, to which I was answered with a yes. Turns out, they hadn't actually checked or something because we checked into a room without a bathtub, but when we called down and mentioned our problem, they immediately switched us to a room with a tub at no extra cost to us. I'd definitely stay here again based on the customer service and location.

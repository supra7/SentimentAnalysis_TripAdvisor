I have stayed at countless Seattle Hotels - but the Monaco Seattle is a step above them all - I had a very busy schedule and a million things to get done while in town, and this hotel was such a wonderful relaxing retreat to return to. Would stay here every time if I could! Can not say enough good things - clean, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and quiet rooms and the absolute BEST location. Just doesn't get much better. MANY MANY THANKS!

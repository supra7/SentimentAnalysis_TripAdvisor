Although about 30% cheaper than other hotels in downtown seattle, I found this hotel clean and staff friendly. The walls are pretty thin, so you can hear the noise from other rooms. However if you need a clean hotel with friendly staff and a place to get a night's sleep, this is an affordable and clean option.

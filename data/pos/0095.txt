We used the Hotel Monaco as home base for our recent wedding in Seattle. We chose the Monaco because it is very personal: they go our of their way to make you feel welcome, from the guys who greet you at the front door, to the complimentary coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, to the goldfish they will give you for your room if you ask. We wanted our guests to have the same welcoming feeling, since many of them were traveling in from out of town and hadn't visited Seattle previously. During our visit the staff was very friendly and accommodating, understanding some of our weird requests (for example, we asked that our guests' goldfish be named "Cupid") and helping us out when we were in a pinch (a tux was left in a taxi trunk and the hotel recovered it for us.) The cost we worked out for the group rate was a little higher than nearby chain hotels, but we feel it was very much worth it. The Monaco will be our go-to hotel for all our visits to Seattle in the future, and we suspect it will be for our guests as well.

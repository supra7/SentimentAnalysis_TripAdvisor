I stayed at the Sorrento for two nights. A colleague and I selected this hotel because it was within walking distance of a business meeting and we found a great rate on the Internet. The hotel was very comfortable and luxurious for the price. The standard rooms are on the small side, but that's to be expected given its location in downtown Seattle. I was given a free upgrade to a room with a more "suite"-like setup and enjoyed two TVs -- one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area. There is free wi-fi in the hotel, but parking is very expensive and valet-only (think carefully before you commit to parking there). If you don't mind walking several blocks, you can get to Pike's Market in perhaps 10-15 min. Convenient location in downtown Seattle; for the price we paid, would definitely recommend.

Just got back from a 4 day weekend with my husband and two young children at the Seattle Sheraton. We were thrilled with the location and impressed with the actual hotel. It was beautiful. Our rooms were modern, clean and comfortable. We ate at the Daily Grill (attached to the hotel) a couple of times and we really enjoyed it. The staff, from the valet to the hotel desk clerk to the bellboy etc., were all friendly, professional and courteous. We were within walking distance to the market, Westlake Centre and other major shopping (Macy's, Nordstroms, Niketown), monorail station, theatres, Cheesecake Factory, etc. The only downside was that we originally chose this hotel because of the heated pool since that would be the highlight for the kids. However, it was very cold. We could only stand it for a very limited time until we had to sit in the hot tub and warm up for a while. We spoke to guest services and asked if they could check it but they insisted that it was checked often and that it was heated to 82 degrees. Well, if it was, it didn't feel like it. The workout room was really nice and looked state of the art. Had lots of equipment and seemed like a great place for a great workout. If you are going to use the workout room, pool and hottub often, I would suggest staying in the Pike St. tower which would be more convenient, although the short walk from the Union Street Tower was fine. We would definitely stay here for future Seattle trips. You can't beat the comfort and location.

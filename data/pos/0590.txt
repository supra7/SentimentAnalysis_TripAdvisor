Just spent three nights at this most conveniently located property. As a flight attendant I stay in many big name brand properties so have a good idea of what's good or bad. The Warwick looks to have been renovated and yes some of the rooms are in places worn however they are comfortable and clean. The major thing we noticed here was the staff. Everyone from front desk clerk to housekeeping was just fantastic. They could have not been more helpful and really made Seattle a pleasure to visit. The hotel has a free shuttle which runs anywhere you want to go within about 2 miles. The drivers are well versed in geography and no journey seemed like too much trouble. It's not a Hilton or a brand hotel BUT it does have genuine personality and a caring team behind the product. It's not fake or pretentious. Great location and safe area at night. You have great shops and restaurants within walking distance - try Lolas just next door for flawless food.

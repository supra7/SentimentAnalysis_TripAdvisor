I choose this hotel because I thought it was located to easy transportation around the city. The Space Needle is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and catching the monorail to downtown would have made everything readily accessible. As it turned out, the Monorail is not running (and no one seems to know when it will be again). It is still possible to get around by bus but there are numerous routes and figuring them out on your own isn't easy. Seattle buses have a Free Ride Zone in the downtown area but be advised that this hotel is not within this zone. It will cost $1.50 to get downtown during peak (I used Bus #15). Get a transfer ticket and you'll be able to ride back for free if your within a couple of hours. It is also possible to walk downhill to the waterfront (about 15-25 minutes) to catch the free Waterfront rail line. However, be advised that this rail is not running either but there is a substitute bus (Bus #99). This bus supposedly arrives every 20 minutes but the wait seemed much longer to me. If you're looking to take a city tour, the tour bus that I went on picked me up at the hotel. I would think that most tour buses would do the same. Also, the Duck's tour is at the Seattle Center across the street from the Experience Music Project (EMP). Other than the public transportation issues, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The streets are quiet at night and the view from my window was great. However, once you've covered the attractions at the Seattle Center, there really isn't anything else to do in the immediate area. By the way, I recommend skipping the EMP. There are a good number of beggers on the nearby streets but they're non-aggressive.

It's not often we visit a hotel with high expectations, and yet have our expectations exceeded. The Inn at the Market is that kind of place. We traveled to Seattle via Amtrak, so arrived in the city well before check-in time. While the Inn staff were careful to warn that they could not guarantee early check-in (and we did not expect it), our room was ready for us when we arrived almost 6 hours before the 4 PM check-in time. We reserved a city view room and were upgraded to a room with a window seat overlooking the market and the water. After visiting the market, we returned to find a bottle of wine and welcome note from the Inn staff waiting for us. All staff, from bellhops to front desk staff were unfailingly friendly, exceptionally helpful, and each willingly shared favorite places to visit while in Seattle. The manager, David Watkins, has been at the Inn for 16 months. Disregard any reviews prior to his arrival- he's very "hands on" and runs an extremely well managed operation.

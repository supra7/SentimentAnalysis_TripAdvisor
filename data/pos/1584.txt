This was our third stay at the Mayflower Park. Each time it is great, but even better this time. From check in to check out the staff were excellent. All the staff were attentive and were always asking what they could assist us with. Oliver's is a great lounge and the Royale cocktail was delicious. This is a beautiful lounge, a relaxing place to sip and talk. Andaluca is the restaurant at the hotel. Excellent breakfast. The crab omelette was tasty and seasoned expertly. I would recommend the Mayflower for a greatstay in the heart of Seattle. Valet parking is a bonus in this location!

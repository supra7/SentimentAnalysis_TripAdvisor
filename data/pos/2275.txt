The room and bathroom were very small, yet this didn't bother me because I read the reviews ahead of time. Our room was clean and very functional considering we didn't spend much time in it. The location of the hotel is very close to everything worth exploring in downtown Seattle. We were within walking distance to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, many restaurants and shopping venues. The elevators were a bit noisy, but we didn't have any problems with them. Adding continental breakfast for just a few dollars is definitely worth it. For the price, we'll definitely stay again next time!

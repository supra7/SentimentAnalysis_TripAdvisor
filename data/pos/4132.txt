Stayed with my wife at The Sorrento on the last two nights of our wander around the Pacific northwest. Got a good rate on a huge room on the 7th floor. As we arrived on the last leg of our trip my wife had bought most of the goods available in the northwestern states and our car was jammed with cases bags, and even animal sculls. This was no problem for the concierge staff who welcomed us, and spent the next half hour ferrying our goodies to our room. Even the check in staff, a breed not famous for their conviviality, were friendly and funny. The hotel recommended places to eat, and they have a car that takes you out and brings you back in comfort. The bar is hoot with lovely staff, Meagan especially, customers were an interesting bunch as well. Be sure if your staying here you take your crampons with you, the hills are excessive, they don't show you that on Frazier.

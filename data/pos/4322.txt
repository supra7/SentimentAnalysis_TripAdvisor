Headed down to catch a couple of Mariners games so were only there for one night, booked through Hotwire (not a super deal, only 23% savings). The hotel is dated but tasteful - originally requested two rooms for three (two double beds) so called ahead to confirm after booking, very helpful. Had a person cancel so upon arrival at 12:30pm thought I would stop by and advise we could use one king/puillout and one double room. Very helpful and found two side by side on the 11th floor to save for us until check in time. Gave them my cell number and advised would call, off exploring we went. Hotel is very centrally located and found a great Mexican restaurant with a patio overlooking a square for beers and burritos. Hotel called at 2:30pm - one of the rooms was ready - headed back around 3:30 to check in - very busy but kept adding staff and had the backlog cleaned up in no time. Unfortunately one of the rooms was not ready and we were still waiting (at least in the other room) at 4:45pm so we requested if any others were available and we were moved to the 15th floor. By that time we'd missed batting practice, very apologetic for the delay. The beds are comfortable but I prefer a fitted sheet and that duvet that doesn't have a cover other than sandwiched between two flat sheets was removed from the bed pronto! Lastly park in the lot adjacent to the hotel connected by skywalk, called Westin Parking but not associated to the hotel?

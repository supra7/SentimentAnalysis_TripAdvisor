Wow!!! A must go!!! We just got back from a awesome time at The Royal Suites Turquesa. This adults only resort is one of the best going right now in our opinion. Its it own resort with restaurants,pools, private beach and etc.... ans you get to use all other Palladium Resorts and they cant use yours. We stayed in a honeymoon suite and we were treated fantastic. You have your own personal butler that's makes sure your stay is fantastic right down from your own request on what you want in your fridge to them making of your restaurant reservations. The beach i would rate one of the best i have seen. We have been to a lot of adults only resorts and this place is by far the best we have been too. We will definitely be back!!!

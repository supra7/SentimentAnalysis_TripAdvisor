Had a nice 2-night stay at Inn at the Market and was very impressed with the location, the staff, the premises and all that surrounded this hotel. There was plenty to explore in the neighborhood and lots to see and eat. The weather was excellent during our stay, so we took full advantage of the wonderful rooftop deck and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with fresh fruits from Pike's Market as a snack, while overlooking the water. We will definitely come back and stay at this hotel when we visit Seattle again.

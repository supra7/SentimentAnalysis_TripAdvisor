We recently attended a family reunion at this hotel. We can only commend the hotel for its service, friendly staff and great food. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for any member of staff to deal with. The only problem we had was a rather noisy maid on our floor but that was a minor irritation. I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.

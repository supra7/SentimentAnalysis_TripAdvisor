My roommates and I headed to Seattle for the Emerald City Comic con, to visit friends, and to take in downtown Seattle's famed landmarks and sights. The hotel was very easy to find from the highway, and parking was a breeze. These are important points to note, as we were ready to get off of the road after our three hour drive from Vancouver, BC. As a member of Hilton Honors, i enjoyed a quick and easy check in with the gracious conceriege. Again, this was very welcome, as were the lovely green apples available at the front desk. Our room was large, clean and included a many useful amenities. The beds were very comfortable, and easily accommodated two people each. Likewise, the bathroom and vanity area left plenty of room for us to get ready at the same time. The location of the hotel was central to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. We walked to the convention centre each day, past lots of terrific shopping, and right down to the famed Public Market. The Hilton Seattle was in close proximity to the best that the city has to offer. Next year, when the ECCC rolls into town, on our next shopping excursion, or when visiting the Pacific Science Centre, you can be sure I will once again stay at the Hilton. Great value from a brand you can trust.

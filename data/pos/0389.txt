The Seattle Hotel Monaco holds up the high standards of the Kimpton hotel line. Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in several other cities, I can easily say that the Seattle Hotel Monaco is one of the best I have seen. The service is attentive and very prompt. Based on being a member of the Kimpton loyalty program, I was upgraded to a 10th floor room with a great view of 4th street and the excellent public library kitty-corner across from the hotel. I highly recommend a tour of the public library; you will be blown away. My room is quite spacious, with a beautiful flat-screen television, with DVD/CD player. The exercise room is pretty standard Kimpton size, which means adequate but not outstanding: four eliptical cardio machines and two stationary bikes, each with personal viewing screens. The cardio machine screens accept DVD's, which I have not seen elsewhere. As with all Kimpton hotels, and the Hotel Monaco line in particular, the hotel's lobby is stylish, quirky, and inviting. It's easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable, over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Sazerac, is very good. So far, I have eaten lunch there and look forward to breakfast tomorrow. As always with Kimpton properties, I am able to connect to the free highspeed internet by ethernet in seconds, and am cruising the web and checking email back at the office with no problems. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with any Kimpton hotel, and the Seattle Hotel Monaco is certainly an excellent choice.

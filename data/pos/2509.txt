Like the previous post I was very concerned about staying here. I also payed $65 on priceline and figured you can barely stay at a motel 6 for that so what the heck. The front desk was very efficent I requested a higher floor away from the freeway and that is what I got 20th floor opposite freeway. The fitness center was clean with lots of equipment. The pool and hot tub were clean and pretty much empty. Our room was nice with down comforter and it was nice to get fresh air since the window opened. The shower had plenty of hot water. we recieved a complimentary Sunday paper and complimentary tea, coffee or hot chocolate delivered to the room. as for parking my husband was able to find parking on the street so we didn't use the hotel parking. Seattle parking is free after 6:00pm and on Sundays. Overall well worth the $65.

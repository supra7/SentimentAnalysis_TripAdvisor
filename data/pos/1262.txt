I will breakup this review based on the 6 categories of Tripadvisor: The hotel is clean, from the lobby, elevator, hallway to the room. It is very clean and almost spotless. We are surprised to see that our room is in excellent shape; obviously it is well maintained and well kept. The location is excellent, it is minutes of walk from the major shopping centers, Pike Place Market. I would have to say this hotel can cover many of the popular places in downtown. The room quality is excellent, we were given two queen beds. The room comes with a 32" TV, a desk, a mini-fridge, wireless internet with a relatively quiet AC. The wireless internet did not work, and we had to call front-desk for a password instead. Another problem with the room is that by the next morning, the windows is full of condensation when the room temp is kept at only 15C. Service is great as well, our hair-dryer is broken. We were given another one in about 15 min after calling the front desk. Since our room is prepaid and check-in and out are very quick. We haven't use any of the services so I cannot comment on others. We get this hotel by random as we bid this online. Value wise I have no other comments except excellent! Sleep qualility is great too, I was able to get at least 8 hours of sleep. The bed and pillow is firm enough that they don't sag. Overall, we are very happy with Crowne Plaza. I stayed in their Lake Oswego and was happy with it. The only concern I have would be the high price on parking. There are a few parking garage nearby that can provide overnight parking for a few dollars less and street parking is free on Sat after 6pm and Sunday.

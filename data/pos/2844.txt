Stayed during the Memorial Day Weekend to take in a baseball game -- Check-in was fast, efficient and cheerful. Was told during our stay that 700 guests were checking out and 600 checking in on the same day -- would have NEVER known. Vast lobby, clean rooms and the two elevator banks were very welcome and very fast. Close to all shopping, Pikes Market, great restaraunts and tourist attractions. Although we didn't get to test out the indoor pool on the 35th floor, it was truly amazing. We would definately stay here again.

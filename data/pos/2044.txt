This hotel is old and has the charm that goes with that. It is well maintained and improved but not extensively renovated. We liked the desk clerk who recommended a great restaurant for us and we liked the location of the hotel. Ww could walk to the restaurant and bar area around Pike Market and also to the seafront. We had a one night stay and found the hotel completely adequate for our needs. We'd recommend it for a budget stay in downtown Seattle.

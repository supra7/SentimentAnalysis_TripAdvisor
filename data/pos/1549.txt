We stayed at the MarQueen hotel for just one night & it was wonderful. Previous reviews mentioned the noise from the front of the hotel so I requested a room on the 3rd floor at the back and it was very quiet. It was a 5 minute walk to the Seattle Rep Theater, with lots of restaurants to choose from along the way. Our room was quite large with hardwood floors, crown molding & no musty smell whatsoever. The room and the hotel overall was very clean and beautiful.

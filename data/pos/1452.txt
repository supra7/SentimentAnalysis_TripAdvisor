If you arrive in downtown Seattle via public transportation, the first thing you'll notice about Virginia Mason is the hike up First Hill. (I'd told the kids to pack light.) Though the Inn seemed a bit too out of the way initially, I was grateful for the location when evening arrived and the huge SeaFair parade began weaving through downtown. We were able to walk to most of the attractions in Seattle from the hotel: downhill to the waterfront, over to the Space Needle, back to Pioneer Square. Though the kids complained about the lack of a pool, the room itself was spacious and clean, with a bathroom big enough for a small party and enough beds to accommodate our family of six. The staff was pleasant and accommodating, plus the place felt cozy--a pleasant contrast to the chains where we spent most of our vacation.

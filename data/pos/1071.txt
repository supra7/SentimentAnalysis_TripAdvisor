We spent a long time researching hotels in downtown Seattle for our 25th wedding anniversary. We are so glad/thankful we selected The Inn At The Market! It was perfect. We had a beautiful room overlooking Puget Sound. (Deluxe water view-8th floor) We watched the ferries and boats go by our window. The hotel was extremely quiet - it was like we were the only guests. We were treated kindly. On our arrival they set out a card and special chocolates for our anniversary. I can't say enough - I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very special place to stay. We plan to make this a yearly event - we had the best time!

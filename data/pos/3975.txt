Why the Edgewater? They accepted my $95/night bid at Priceline for Labor Day weekend. Great location on north end of the Seattle waterfront. Within walking distance to most of the downtown waterfront, Pike Place Market, etc. Hotel is situated on a pier between the cruise ship terminal and the passenger ferry to Victoria BC. Half the rooms view the water, the other half view city. Rooms are decorated with rustic cabin furnishings and are very cozy with a fireplace. Bathroom is very modern and seemed an odd fit in a log cabin themed room. Our room had a large patio with a couple chairs. Finished a couple bottles of wine one evening in the lobby area. It is very spacious with ample sofa and chair seating. Floor to ceiling windows display a great view of busy Elliott Bay. Returned to this same spot the next morning after making a run out for Starbucks and breakfast bagels. Unless you have time and patience, park at the hotel. We spent a good 30 min looking block after block for nearby parking before deciding to turn the car keys over to the hotel. It is valet only with unlimited in and out access. From someone who does not valet, it was well worth it. Though very pleased at the value, we would not pay $300/night for the Edgewater. Though it is an icon on the waterfront, its age is not well disguised. A water view room is a must. Maybe our room is reflective of the rate, but we expected to be wowed.

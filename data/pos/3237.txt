Like the other reviews, the location of the hotel is excellent. Walking distance (6 blocks) to Pike Place and the Waterfront and probably walking to the Space Needle (we didn't attempt). My son is 5 and he walked everywhere with us. You can take the Monorail, which is about a 7 minutes walk, to the Space Needle. We stayed 4 days and used our car only once, to drive out to Gas Works Park. Our room was on the backside, facing gentleman's club. The windows are thin, but we didn't hear anything. We stayed over a Saturday night, too. I say this room is "Very Good for the Effort" because it is clear that the staff has put a lot of energy into making this decent hotel. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. From the outside, it looks shabby. However, the lobby was comfortable, although small. Our room was large and the beds were comfortable. 99% of it was clean. Unfortunately, there was mold on the ceiling in the bath. There was also a foul smell in the hallway two nights in a row. But, we weren't sleeping in the hallway - just something my husband and I noticed when we walked from the elevator to our room. The weather was mild, but I tested the AC and it seemed to run quietly. Not sure if there was a smell, though. We would probably stay here again because of the price. It was worth it to be so close to everything.

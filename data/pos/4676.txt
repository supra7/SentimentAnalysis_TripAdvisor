I stayed here once about 9 years ago and recall it being outdated. I didn't feel it this time. On the 32nd floor next to the elevator, the room was very nice. The noise wasn't an issue from the elevator. I had a king bed and a beautiful view of the Olympic Mountains. Stunning... There are numerous restaurants and even a deli in the hotel. I only had breakfast and the services and food were very good. It is reasonably close to the business district and also many restaurants. I have stayed at the W in Seattle before and also liked that hotel. Different style and location make it a totally different experience. I would recommend the Westin for both business and leisure travel.

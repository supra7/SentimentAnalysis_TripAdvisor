A great little hotel. Perfectly located and easy walking distance from everything you'd want to do centrally. Also a very short walk to the ferry terminal to catch the boat across to Vancouver Island. Staff were super helpful and friendly too. Rooms were clean, beds uber comfy and breakfast yummy. We stayed a night either side of Victoria - one night in a pretty small room with separate bathrooms and another night with an ensuite - both nights were great and all bathrooms, whether attached to the rooms or not, were ideal. We'd recommend this hotel for any length of stay in Seattle but it is ideal for a quick pit stop!

I'm just finishing a 3 night stay at this property. It's a good full-service property with all the usual things you'd expect from a Hilton, except perhaps a pool. It does have a lounge/restaurant at the top floor called creatively, "Top of the Hilton." They have a breakfast buffet in the morning and a decent spread of cold and hot apps in the evening from 5-7PM. The room is pretty standard. The bathroom, however is super small. I don't know if I could close the door if I was seated on the toilet. And the bathmat they give you doesn't fit in the room. Not a good sign. I asked for a room with a larger bathroom, but they said that all of the rooms were the same in that way. The hotel is fine. Parking is super expensive, but it's pretty standard. If you're a HHonors person, I would rather stay at the Arctic Club. Much more charm, bigger rooms and a cooler place.

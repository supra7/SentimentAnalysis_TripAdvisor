We were in Seattle September 5-9th and had a heck of time finding a hotel. Apparently UW, Boise State, WSU and San Diego Street were in town for football games and brought their entire schools with them! Rates were higher than we had hoped for that weekend (should have come over Labor Day, rates were much cheaper) but the Hotel Monaco was worth it. Be sure to check the event calendar of the city as rates fluctuate dramatically. We booked a Monte Carlo suite as that was the only room available and it was fantastic for a four night stay. The extra sitting area was more like a funky living room than hotel room. There were curtains that partitioned the bed from the living room but I think they were decoration only (would have been cool if they really closed). The room has bold striped wall paper and a very spacious bathroom. What really made the stay was the staff, they were amazing! I was worried at first because they seemed so young but they were most attentive. The property is small enough that they get to know you and are always trying to help you out. Location was good, all hotels that we considerd seemed to be in a 5 block radius so I can't say anyone really has an advantage. We walked everywhere. Highly recommended!

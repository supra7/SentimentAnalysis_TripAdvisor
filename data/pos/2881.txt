We booked this hotel during our stay at seattle to attend a scientific conference. The location was just adjacent to the convention center and to the nearby shopping streets. We stayed for about a week and the stay was really nice. They also arranged a baby-sitter for our daughter and this made our trip very convenient. The rooms were large, quiet and clean. The hotel staff was also very friendly and room service was efficient. We would like to stay there again and it is good value for money.

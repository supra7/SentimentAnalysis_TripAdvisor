Stayed at The Edgewater in a water side room for a two-day weekend getaway in February. There are a lot of fine hotels in Seattle and many more upscale than the Edgewater, but if you want a true Seattle/ Northwest experience, this is the place. Photos can describe the ambiance better than words, so I've attached a few. Basically, the decor is Northwest Lodge with ample use of logs in the furniture (as in a log four poster bed) and plaids in the carpets and bedspreads, and a gas fireplace in each room. The bathrooms have a glass enclosed stone shower. Public spaces provide comfortable seating for conversation, enjoying a good book in front of one of several stone fireplaces, or just enjoying the view. Lots for famous performers have stayed here so there are photos of those celebrities in the lounges. The Edgewater is unique enough that one gets the feeling that the staff really enjoy working here. Everyone we encountered was very personable. The bar, with its water view, was busy when we stopped by for a drink after check-in. Later, after a symphony concert, we thought we'd stop by for a quiet nightcap but it was not to be... the place was even livelier with the 20-30 crowd. The restaurant, also with a drop-dead view of Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains (on a clear day), has creative entrees at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Edgewater is a great place to stay anytime but, particularly for someone planning on taking the Victoria Clipper to Victoria, BC, the Clipper dock is right next door. Also, for summer cruises to Alaska (depending on the cruise line), Seattle's Cruise Terminal is also adjacent.

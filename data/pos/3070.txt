We stayed for 3 nights in a corner tower room. The room was very light and airy, modern, very spacious, comfortable bed and spotlessly clean. As Platinum members we had access to the Executive Lounge and free high speed internet access in the room. The continental breakfast was fantastic...the berries were superb and in abundance! Drinks in the evening were also great as were the staff. Lucie at the Concierge desk was extremely helpful. Great stay and will be returning.

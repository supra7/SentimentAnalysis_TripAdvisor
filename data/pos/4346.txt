I became very nervous about this hotel after reading some negative reviews that all seemed to be related to booking through Hotwire and alike, as I had booked through Hotwire ($88/night). Long story short I could not have been more pleased. The room was luxurious, clean and had a view to die for. The bed was absolutely the most comfortable thing that I have ever slept on. The roomy bath and duel shower heads rocked. Having saved for a long time to take my girlfriend on an Alaskan cruise, I wanted everything about the trip to be perfect. The Westin did not disapoint in any way. My thanks and graditude to the staff and especially Elisebeth James the hotel manager. She is a true proffessional and her word is gold. We will be back!!!

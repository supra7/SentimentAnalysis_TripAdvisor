Very convenient location near the Space Needle and EMP museum. Check-in was very quick. Elevator is a bit rusty and after you got of on the floor the hallways to the rooms were very hot. Hopefully your keycard works the first time ;) The room itself was ok and the beds were comfortable for the night. To bad that you are looking directly onto another hotel and have no view of the space needle. This is the right hotel if you are checking out Seattle all day and stay there only to sleep.

This was my first trip the Seattle area, and while I was on business (hospitality meeting no less), i have to say that this hotel was beyond comfortable. Its a great little gem, right on the water, and close to some great spots. The staff, especially the front desk staff and banquets staff were very friendly and polite, as well as very engaging. The front desk agent that checked me in had a great attatude, and was very personable. The asst. front desk manager was also very considerate in helping me have a great stay. Im from San Diego, and in the hotel business and i have to say, this is a great hotel. The views on the water are something else, the fire places in the rooms are a great touch, and my favorite is deffinately the shower set up in the rooms. This is asolutely the place ill be staying at when I travel to Seattle.

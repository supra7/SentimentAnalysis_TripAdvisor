I booked reservations at this hotel because of the responses of manager, David Watkins. I thought someone who cared that much to respond to every trip advisor comment, truly cared about his hotel. He does! This comes across through every single employee, from the second you arrive at the hotel. Everybody employee comes across as happy. Happy to be there, happy to be of assistance, happy to recommend great places for dinner. The rooms were beautiful with fantastic views. The beds are tough to get out of! High quality bedding was wonderful and almost worth spending all day in. My only con...low flow shower. Great for the environment (not for a good shower!) Regardless, I will chose this hotel for my stay, every time I come to Seattle!! Well done, David!!!! Many thanks!

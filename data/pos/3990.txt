I stayed here for one night on business and was never in the place during daylight, sadly. So I missed the view and did not mind my city-side room at all. The room was a little on the small side (and eentsy-teentsy sized TV) but perfectly adequate. Great mattress and linens. I loved the bathroom, with stone floors and shower. Great service at the front desk, arranging transportation to the airport at 4:30 a.m. However, i thought the price ($279) was a little pricey for what you got.

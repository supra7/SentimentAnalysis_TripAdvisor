We booked this Hotel reluctantly because it was too expensive for us and the parking fee was ridiculous, but the location was what we needed in order to attend a wedding without getting stuck in traffic or lost. We booked our room early with an advanced pay option which made the price lower. There is valet parking which turned out to be a plus since we didn't need to drive around looking for parking elsewhere. The beds and pillows were excellent...and I have a bad back and hips but had NO problems at all. The location of this hotel makes up for the pricing and parking...It is surrounded with all kinds of shopping and there is a HUGE, excellent, and very affordable selection of food/restaurants at the Westlake Center which is about two blocks away. This center is a stop for the Monorail which will take you to the Seattle Center. There are also wonderful shops at the mall. We aren't shoppers but the atmosphere and the large variety of shops surrounding the hotel, including the close proximity of Pike Place Market and the Piers make this hotel a jewel. There are also in room safes which was another bonus. The view from our room was spectacular especially at night. We will be back.

The Sorrento Hotel is a stunning sight and an even more stunning experience. The attention to detail is felt whether it is in the Fireside lounge with the roaring fire or whether it is at the bar having "Chad" prepare you a fabulous cocktail. The hospitality team were eager to please and eager to make my time in Seattle an effortless and wonderful time. The rooms were lovely and modern with enough room to dance around like you were in a penthouse suite. The luxuries and attention to detail are seen in the toiletries and the amazing rooms. My time spent at Sorrento was delightful and filled with fabulous warmth from the staff and the management team. I would encourage visitors of seattle to treat themselves to a fabulously warm experience filled with first-class accommodations on a friendly budget. I look forward to coming back and re-experiencing my recent trip.

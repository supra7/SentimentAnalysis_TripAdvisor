We stayed in the new Union Tower which has beautiful, spacious rooms with excellent amenities. The check in went super efficient, the service is excellent and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Great concierges too who arrange everything for you regarding tickets, restaurant reservations etc. Nice fitness area and swimming pool. Very convenient computer located in the front desk area for airline check-in. Food in Daily Grill Bar is great.

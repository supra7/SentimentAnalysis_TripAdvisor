We needed a place to spend the night on our return to the states from Canada as our flight left in the am. I wanted to be near Pike Place market so my son could see the fish throwing before we headed to Sea-Tac, I found the Moore, and couldn't belive the rate ($80/nt plus taxes and fees in downtown Seattle!). It seemed a little sketch/hostel-y on its website, and in my 30's with a child I'm not too into that, but the reviews were such that I felt that we should give it a shot. It was wonderful, the staff was nice and helpful, check in was a breeze and it was obvious staff was attentive to who was entering the hotel to make sure they belonged there. Our room was right on the street (6th floor), but a fan was in the room and once turned on you couldn't hear any of the traffic down below. The bathroom had been recently redone and was neat, clean, and attractive. The room was large, and the beds comfortable. Add to that the the location is unbeatable - this hotel is a jewel!

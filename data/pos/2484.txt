While not as plush as many higher-end hotels, the Renaissance was comfortable, clean, and provided friendly and good service. Parking was easy, though fairly pricey (~$33/night). The breakfast available in the hotel was actually surprisingly good (and reasonably priced for downtown). There are a few caveats, as a few others mentioned: the proximity to the freeway can be bothersome if you're a light sleeper (and get a room on that side of the building); the heating/cooling fan is fully automatic, regardless of what you push; the sliding bathroom door is neat, but doesn't offer much privacy. Overall, a good value for downtown, and in easy walking distance to Pike Place, dozens of restaurants, etc.

We arrived on a busy boxing day evening with jet-lag and a vomiting child. The staff couldn't have been more sympathetic and caring, even sending up a complimentary tray with crackers and herbal teas to try and settle her stomach - not what you expect from a big 'corporate' hotel. Nice atmosphere, and rooms lovely, clean and comfortable.

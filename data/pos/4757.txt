After seeing some of the past review I wasn't sure I wanted to stay but it was close to the area we wanted to be. Got to the hotel early and was able to check in early, then went to room and checked out everything to make sure all was okay. We were pleasantly surprise with the room and the staff was definitely some of the friendliest people. I was happy that I didn't overlook this place because of the past reviews. And the next time I go to Seattle I will be staying at this Travelodge.

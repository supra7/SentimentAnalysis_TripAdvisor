My husband and I recently spent a 3 day weekend in Seattle and due to bad weather were very delayed in checking in. When we got to the hotel 8 hours later than originally planned we were greeted by a very nice young lady at the front desk who was very pleasant and efficient. We got into our room with no fuss and given it was already after 10 p.m. and we had been travelling for over 8 hours, we were very thankful for the fast efficient service. This was our third stay at the Warwick. Every time we have had occasion to stay at the Warwick we have always been very happy with the service. We love the proximity to shopping and the Warwick will remain our hotel of choice when we visit Seattle.

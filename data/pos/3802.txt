We loved the Edgewater. We had a waterfront room and our balcony hung over the water. We received a great rate on-line as they had a June special. The hotel is very quirky which makes it different to other hotels, plus the history was fascinating. Location was great as you could walk to most of Seattle's attractions, and the free shuttle from the hotel was available when we needed it.

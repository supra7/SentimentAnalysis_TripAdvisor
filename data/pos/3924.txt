As we pulled in late at night we were a little hesitant - it is clearly a 1960s hotel updated. The lobby was fantastic and the view simply spectacular. The staff was courteous and helpful. The room was delightful. Updated amenities including a fireplace and a lvery nicely decorated bathroom. A delightful place!

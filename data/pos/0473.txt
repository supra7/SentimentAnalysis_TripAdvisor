We had a very positive experience at the Warwick. The staff was especially friendly and helpful. We had a large room with a great view of the Space Needle, Lake Union and Elliott Bay. The bathroom was spacious. The location was great and it was easy to walk to public transportation. We enjoyed the swimming pool and hot tub. I'd stay at the Warwick again and would recommend it to anyone.

I booked this through Hotwire and paid $100 (which after reading reviews, I should have said $80 for a 4 star room b/c people got it for that much a night). It was clean and close to everything downtown. It's in walking distance to the Market and the Aquarium, as well as shopping. The concierge wasn't too helpful but we managed by ourselves. Do not park in their garage. It's $30 a night (24 hours). We found one down the block for $26 but that was the cheapest we could find (trust me, we looked). The gym looked nice and the pool and hot tub were both clean and nice to use. I read some of the reviews but thought overall this was a great hotel for our needs. We were traveling and were not spending a lot of time in the room. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were nice. The bathrooms were clean and had Bliss lotions and soaps. Buy water outside the hotel and get your fridge key to store it.

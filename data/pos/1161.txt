We loved our recent stay at the Ace hotel! Here is why you should choose the Ace (according to us): Location. The Ace is in Belltown, we walked everywhere we went, and we found that belltown was the perfect spot. The best resturants, and close to the free bus zone if you can't stand the walk. We even took the bus back to the airport (it only cost $4.00!) *try the Macrina Bakery, and Marco's Supperclub which is located across the street from the Ace! Price: for what we paid $85.00, we didn't expect much of anything. But, we received first class treatment for almost nothing! Our room was one of the cheapest rooms they offer (shared bathroom, no view) and we liked that. It was very cozy, and the shared bathrooms were always clean! Believe me, I was scared of the idea of shared bathrooms, but at the Ace, I prefer it. The showers are huge, and they pump in soft music. Our room was clean, and the hotel itself was beautiful. Modern, and crisp. The breakfast in the morning was great too! Fresh juice, milk, toast, fruit; we were always happy to eat down in the cute kitchen area. Staff: I can honestly tell you that the staff at the Ace hotel is and was the best we had ever met. They always were willing to look things up for us online, give info, loan dvds, and a dvd player to the guests, give out free magazines---just all around helpfull. The Hotel vs. Other Hotels: After our trip in Seattle we headed to two other cities...we booked the most expensive hotels, and yet we were still pining for the Ace!

The Inn at the Market is a cute hotel in downtown Seattle. When you step out of the hotel you are literally steps away from the Pike Market. The hotel has about only 80 rooms and definitely has a quaint feel to it. The rooms are small, so if you're looking for something spacious, you're not going to find it here. What you will find is a spotless room with comfortable beds in a great location. The hotel staff is very friendly. There is a roof top deck with a view of Puget Sound. At night it can get cold, and there are not heaters out there. On our first night in Seattle my partner and I walked over to the Pike Market and bought a couple of freshly cracked crabs, fresh bread and brie, and a bottle of wine. We took our dinner to the roof deck and enjoyed it by candlelight. Great dinner! The only drawback of the hotel is the cost of valet parking. There is no self parking, so you are forced to pay $25/day. Overall the Inn at the Market was a great experience.

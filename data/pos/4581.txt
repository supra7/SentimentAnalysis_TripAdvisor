Our family of four shared one room with a king size bed and pull-out couch. Very spacious, clean, modern design. We walked in and got great rate - about $140 US/night. Walking distance to monorail and Pike Market. Choose parking carefully - adjacent parkade (accessible by skywalk to hotel) $36/two nights as opposed to Westin parking at $35/one night.

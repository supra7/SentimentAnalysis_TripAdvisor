I read some of the past reviews and was hesitant to stay here. I usually stay close to the Seattle Center on 5th and Roy. But, at the urging of a friend, I decided to choose this hotel. Valet service is great but the whopping valet charge scared me off. Since this was President's day weekend, I parked on the street and found ample parking. The rooms, which are pretty dated, had a modern feel to them. There was a nice sofa bed in the room. The Heavenly bed was indeed nice. The internet was easy to use, but there is a charge for the service. Housekeeping service was great; the attendant was very courteous and professional. Front desk personnel was friendly and cordial. And I did receive a phone call a few hours after I checked in to see if all was in order. I did use the business center and the gentleman running the office was attentive. Room service was surprisingly fast and efficient. Since it was pretty cold to go out at 10pm on Saturday night, I was very impressed with the efficiency and quality of service with the room service. Food was not bad. Be prepared to pay a hefty price for the food, though. I will definitely return here.

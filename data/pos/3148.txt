This hotel was about a five minute walk from Pike's Market. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The fitness center is adequate and gives a great view while on the treadmill. Parking was pretty steep at 35 bucks a night. We spent two nights and with parking it cost us a little over 400 dollars. The business center offers free computer services and printing. This was helpful in getting directions from MapQuest.

A friend raved about this hotel, and i wasn't disappointed. Very modern, clean, crisp well thought out design (loved the blown up photos on the walls), fairly basic in terms of food (shared, help-yourself kitchen in the basement) - but for the price couldn't have asked for any more. Great location, close to Pike Place Market, and very friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely stay there again and again.

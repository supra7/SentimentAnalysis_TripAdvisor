This hotel was booked for me when I took my trip to Seattle and I didn't have a hand in choosing it so I was a bit apprehensive about what I was going to end up but it turned out to be just fine. Location was excellent, hotel was in walking distance to many places downtown as well as the monorail to the Space Needle and many bus lines if you're venturing to other neighborhoods. It's also in the 'ride free' zone which means if you're just staying in the downtown area between 6am-7pm, your bus rides are free. I'm sure there are many airport shuttles that can take you here too but if you're on a budget and just have a carry on, you can take regular public transportation buses as well. Room and bathroom were a bit small but not unbearably so. Decor wasn't bad but not super modern either, could use a facelift in the near future. Everything was clean and air conditioning worked well (which was a necessity because I ended up there at the beginning of the 100+ degree heatwave!) Staff was very pleasant and helpful - when I checked in, the woman at the desk complimented my shirt. Another time I walked outside the hotel and stood there for a few moments with a map in my hand trying to figure out which way I needed to go and an employee from the desk actually came outside and asked me if I needed help with directions. I also had a problem with being double charged for my stay, which I wasn't aware of until I got home and saw it on my statement, but I called the hotel and left a message explaining the problem and within 15 minutes I received a call back apologizing for what happened and the double charge had been refunded. I wish all customer service could be that quick and efficient!

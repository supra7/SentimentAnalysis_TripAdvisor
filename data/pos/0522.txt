The staff was terrific, The bed was wonderful. The room was impeccable. The concierge desk was most helpful. The rate was a bargain. We had a reasonable walk to most downtown attractions (market, dining, vistas, access). What more can one ask for first-time visitors to Seattle on an anniversary trip?

I stayed at the Crowne Plaza during the SLA conference just this week. The hotel was nice enough and our room, at least, was quite big (we had two double beds). The elevators are horribly slow (as at least one previous review mentioned) and while we were there one of them was out of operation. This gets to be a pain in the butt after you've been out and about all day...standing and waiting for what seems like forever (and there's no way to tell where the dang elevators are, just a light for when they arrive). The Crowne Plaza is right next to the highway but we noticed no noise. It's also hard by the YWCA which has some interesting characters always hanging around. It's a clean place with very helpful staff (the bellmen were the best) although it is not in what I would consider the main happening part of downtown. Oh and also, it is an uphill walk from what seems like almost everywhere. It's not a bad uphill walk but again, at the end of the day it can be a bit tiring. I'd probably stay somewhere else my next time around but I think the Crowne Plaza is a safe bet for most travelers.

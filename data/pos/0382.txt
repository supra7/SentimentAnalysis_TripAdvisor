I am trying to go through all the Kimpton Group hotels and this was my first stay at the Monaco in Seattle. Everything was a breeze, from check-in to check-out. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the room (a double queen room) was spacious. I especially liked the l'occitane shampoo and conditioner, it's a nice treat when the toilettries are nicer than what I use on a normal day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an upgrade to the other nearby downtown hotels.

The Best Things about the University Inn are the simple, clean, quiet rooms, the large, free parking lot, the friendly staff at the front desk, and the Portage Bay Cafe ... a fantastic breakfast spot adjacent to the hotel that serves up one of the best breakfasts in Seattle. It's not the most hip, charming or romantic hotel, but it's a great value in a good location with all the conveniences of parking and dining that made our trip especially relaxing.

We only stayed one night at the Inn at the Market but the location was perfect. It was easy to walk down to the Pike Place Market to grab breakfast or something to eat. The rooftop deck was spacious with a great view of the market and water. The front desk was friendly and helpful. We had a city view room which had a large bay window but it was quiet. The room was spacious with a sitting area and large armoire with TV as well as a side table by the door with a fridge, coffee maker and pay snacks. The bathroom was great - large, with a floating glass shelf above the sink for storage as well as another table against the wall with more space and a large shower. Overall, it was a great stay in a top notch hotel in the perfect location.

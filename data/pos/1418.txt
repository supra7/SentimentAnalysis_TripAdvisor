This hotel is in a great location and a few mins walk to the Seattle centre and Space Needle. It has very friendly staff. The staff at the reception were very helfpul - from providing help with our luggage to assisting us with directions to the attractions. We reached the hotel quite late in the night, around 11:30pm and the staff member (Rorth) happily asssited us with the luggage. We stayed for 2 nights and it was five of us travelling together. The hotel managed to give us two good sized rooms on the same floor. The hotel also provided free shuttle service into the downtown and also to the pier from where we boarded our cruise. There is also a complimentary breakfast that constitute of tea/coffee, toast, fruit juices, croissants, and other pasteries. There is also free internet access in all the rooms which was very convenient indeed. The staff - Rorth, Dana, Jessica were so helpful that a special thanks need to go to them. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone who don't want to spend too much time at the hotel.

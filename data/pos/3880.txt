Stayed in Beatles Suite... Well kept and some nice touches. Staff overall friendly and excellent. Breakfast brought to the room was excellent. No instructions for the in-room coffee maker though, and the guy who brought up our breakfast didn't know how it worked either. My wife found some of the harbor and train noises a little disturbing to her sleep, but I had no problem -- in fact to me it's part of the ambiance. I can imagine though if you are not on the water the train in particular could be annoying, as another reviewer noted. Overall this is great place to stay near Seattle's downtown.

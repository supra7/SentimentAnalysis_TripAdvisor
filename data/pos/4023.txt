The Sorrento Hotel is my first, and generally only, choice for accomodation when I am in Seattle. To stay anywhere else would feel like 'cheating'. The Sorrento is very comfortable - both the rooms and the public spaces. Staff turnover is very low and it is always nice to be recognized and greeted by name when returning. The staff remember guests' details and quirks and seem genuinely interested in doing their jobs well. This hotel is a quiet, intimate oasis in the midst of a busy city.

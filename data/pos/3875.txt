Was a great choice to stay. Next time we would try the water side rooms! We so much liked that you could NOT smell cigarette smoke in our room or hallways, thus a true Non Smoking premises!! The room was on the hot side, we figured out the controls for adjusting for airconditioning, and opened the windows,. Would not want to have children in a room that the windows opened that way though. The room was clean. We liked the sea air, the trains were interesting?! The theme of the hotel was truly in lodge fashion, which we very much enjoyed this. The washroom by the dining area were very accomidation for the patrons! The restaurant was wonderful. Our waiter and hostess were so truly and outstandingly professional! Thanks to the valet staff they let us keep our car there till 4:00ish PM till we finished our shopping.

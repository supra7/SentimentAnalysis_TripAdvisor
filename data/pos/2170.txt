We are frequent visitors to Seattle from Vancouver Canada. Take the train down, relax and walk about 15 minutes to this refurbished hotel. It isn't five star but it is good value and great location. Rooms: clean and neat. Bathroom: smallish but very well appointed. Location: excellent access to SAM and a few blocks to Pike Place (but transit in Seattle downtown is free, so don't take the car and pay for unnecessary silly parking). Staff: helpful and professional. Shout out to the doormen/bellmen: great guys who hustle those cabs late at night. Stop whining about "it isn't big enough" "we have to walk uphill": Hotel has all the amenities of a more luxurious stay: robes, hair dryer, coffee maker and upscale toiletries. Seattle is a get what you pay for place as most are and this is my best choice for a budget conscious weekend get away. Save a few bucks and go out for a great meal. Only downside was a slightly noisy heating system- but you can get over that.

For location, this hotel is ideal - it is right in the heart of downtown, we walked to Pioneer Sq, Pike Street market, downtown shopping etc. The 5pm wine reception is a really nice touch. Check-in was a bit odd - they seemed not to find our booking and were a bit uncommunicative, then our room was 904, next to the elevators, which we heard constantly. Not a big deal, other then early in the morning but one to avoid. Overall, good for a short stay.

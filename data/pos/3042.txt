We decided to use priceline.com to book a one night 4 star hotel stay in Downtown Seattle just 1 night before our departure. This was the 1st time using priceline, and we had some reservations not knowing which hotel we would get. However, we were pleasantly surprised to be awarded Sheraton Seattle for an incredible price - 40% off the lowest price advertised on spg.com website. We are Starwood preferred members and typically book directly through spg, but had thought we would try priceline after hearing so much about it. This is our 2nd stay with Sheraton Seattle, the first being several years back when the renos were in place. This time round, we were given a room in the older tower which was fine with us. The room was spacious. I loved the clarity of the TV screen. We took a look at the gym and pool facilities which looked awesome to use, but as usual did not have time to utilize. Valet parking was $38 including taxes, though expensive was considered norm in downtown. We had to wait a while for check out and valet parking to bring our car, but I guess that was the peak check out time. I guess we could have used the express check out methods to save time. Ultimately, the location was the best..close to Pike's market, Westlake Centre, and lots of shopping/stores all around the hotel.. Too bad the weather wasn't that great this weekend with the wind, rain & snow .

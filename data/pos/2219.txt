We stayed here for a quick weekend trip and on a budget. The location was great! We took the lightrail from the airport into town and the University stop was only a few blocks from the hotel (about 3!). Pike Place market is a short walk away, as is the train to the space-needle. It wasn't the fanciest or roomiest place ever, but for our needs, it was good. My only complaint would be that we couldn't get the air conditioner to work and it was quite toasty at night (even with the window open).

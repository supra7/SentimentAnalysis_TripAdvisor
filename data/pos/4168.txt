This is a wonderful hotel on a hillside minutes from the city centre. With a friendly and helpful staff this hotels bears every mark of being well run and maintained throughout. My room was a twin with a comfortable bed made up with three options of pillows and a down comforter, a wonderful bathroom, comfortable chairs and a desk where you could. work. It is a small business centre in itself, with printer/scanner and a drawer containing stapler, scissors, paper clips etc. Good lighting all around. Complimentary press coffee in the room. Reception and adjoining Fireside Room has beaautiful dark wooden panel and comfortable furniture, there is pleasant live entertainment most evenings. Hunt Club restaurant never really was my favourite in Seattle. It is OK for breakfast but for dinner I strongly recommend going somewhere else. The Metropolitan Grill downtown is excellent, serving great steaks in an informal atposphere.

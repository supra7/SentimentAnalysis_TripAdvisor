My husband and I stayed one night as a short, romantic getaway. The hotel could not have been better. We had a package that included parking, breakfast, chocolate and champagne, and late check out. I felt welcomed and pampered from the moment we pulled up. Check in was quick, the room was beautiful, the chocolates were great and breakfast fantastic. Everytime I turned around someone wanted to open a door or carry my bags, but without being intrusive. My favorite was the bell hop who saw me waiting at the desk to ask about cab companies. He asked what I needed and then went out the valet to get the name and number of a cab company for me (we wanted it for coming back to the hotel later.) There was none of the "it's not my job" attitude, just a desire to please. I will be back.

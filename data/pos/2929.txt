Stayed and conferenced here this past Spring. The room was large, quiet, and comfortable, by urban hotel standards. The staff was friendly and accomodating and the hotel also boasts a nice gym and pool. A nice touch was their collection of the beautiful glasswork by Seattle artist Dale Chihouly. One of the hotel staff was happy (and proud) to show me his work. Photographs were also in my room. The hotel's location was perfect for walking to Pikes Place Market and other local attractions. There are some excellent coffee houses, eateries, and shopping areas close to, around, and in the area (especially the Market). Quick, inexpensive massages are available in the Seattle Convention Center, only one block away. Please note that the hotel is in the business district of Seattle. As a female travelling alone, after dark, I was more comfortable walking close to the hotel. There are several good restaurants within a block or two, including the hotel's restaurant, the Daily Grill. Re negatives: the room rates were predictably expensive, on par with other urban hotels I have visited. The room was also absent small, but important amenities such as an in-room refrigerator and free in-room Internet service. I paid the extra fee for in-room Internet and had no problem with connections, however. Overall, if I had reason to come to Seattle again, I would stay here because of its location, the comfortable accomodations, and the friendly staff.

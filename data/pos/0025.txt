I was torn between here and the Hampton Inn across the street after reading the reviews of both on this site. I was using my Hilton points, and this hotel was 5K less for a free night so I picked here. I was so surprised at what a great hotel it was! We checked in late at night after having driven from North Carolina and were exhausted. We were greeted by free fresh baked cookies and coffee! The room was brand new, had a flat screen TV, a microfridge, neutrogena products, free wireless, and even a sleep number type bed. Even the room service was delicious! I've stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, and would rather this room than a whole lot of those. I would stay there again in a second.

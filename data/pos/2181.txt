The hotel is a short walk from the link light rail (word of warning - the map makes it look flat ... You are in for a steep climb!) which makes it great coming from the airport. The service was great - from checking thru to checking out - I honestly have not had such welcoming people at hotels. The room is small so don't expect too much from that. Would definitely be coming back here

I have stayed at the Innat at the Market a number of times and it's always my first choice for Seattle. The location is wonderful, within blocks from almost anything you want to visit. The rooms are super comfortable, with beds that are out of this world. But, best of all are the friendliness, competence, and professionalism of the staff. The fact that the Inn is just steps away from the Pikes Place Market is just icing on the cake.

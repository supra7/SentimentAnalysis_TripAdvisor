This hotel is well-situated in downtown Seattle, with easy access to all tourist hot-spots. The room I stayed in was in one of the towers. This was comfortable and well-appointed, but definitely tiny. I had the opportunity to see some rooms outside of the towers and these were bigger more typically decorated hotel rooms. The bed was luxurious and the bathroom, though again very small, was very nicely done. The rooms were clean and I would be very happy to stay here again.

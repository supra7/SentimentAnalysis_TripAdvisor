The hotel is very centrally located, with shops and restaurants within a half block. The valet people are super friendly, offering to take pictures for people. Always greeted with a smile. Pricey service, didn't use it. The view from our 29th floor room was of downtown, still nice. Would have preferred the water. Great black out blinds, makes the room pitched dark at night. Could not hear noise from other rooms, which is a bonus. Free wi fi in the lobby, and computers. Would stay again!

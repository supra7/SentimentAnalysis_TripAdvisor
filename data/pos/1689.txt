The Mayflower was a fancy and comfortable hotel in a great location. The rooms were spacious and clean, and included a very comfortable bed! It was easy to get a cab from here, thanks to the taxi stand at the entrance. The hotel offers free wireless internet, which was a plus. It is also easy and free to print out boarding passes in the lobby. The hotel staff were all very attentive. I really enjoyed my stay!

We thought we'd try a different hotel, and the pictures looked intriguing. Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised to find they had upgraded us to a king size room. Check in was quick and easy. Staff were friendly and helpful. We liked the free wine bar they put on between five and six pm, and the happy hour price (between 4 and 8pm) for wine and appetizers were a good deal. The location is ideal, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, downtown shopping and Pioneer Square. The decor in the room was different from the standard hotel, a nice change. We thought the chocolates on the bed every evening was a nice touch. A few complaints: The animal print robes felt kind of grubby, and the doors slammed when people left their rooms. Also, we had no choice but to use the valet parking. But other than that we had an enjoyable experience and would stay there again.

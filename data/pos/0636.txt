After a long trip from Melbourne we arrived at the very welcoming lobby of the Inn at the Market. Receptionist and Bell Man both extremely friendly and helpful and our room was ready for us. The first impression was outstanding and the lobby had a delicious aroma... Complimentary coffee, fruit and cookies were on offer as well. We had booked a parlour suite which was a lovley big room with a good sized seperate sitting area, we had a great view of the market and out to the Sound. The room was very nicely appointed, bed was very comfortable, bathroom good although the shower could have used a bit more water pressure. There was also a good sized fridge so you could buy drinks outside the hotel and keep them cold. The concierge arranged a tour to the Boeing Factory for us which was very worthwhile, the Museum of Flight was absolutely outstanding as well. The best meal we had was at Wild Ginger, about a ten minute walk, also enjoyed Steelhead Diner across the road, Elliots Oyster House on one of the wharfs and we also enjoyed Etta's which is right near the market. Would not hesitate to return if we find ourselves in Seattle again.

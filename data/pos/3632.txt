We have stayed at the Andra for two nights at the end of June and were very happy with our choice. The design of the place is extremely nice for those who like a modern style. The beds were very comfortable, the location excellent. In particular we were very pleased with the friendliness of the staff and the manager. If I had to go back to Seattle, I would not hesitate to book the Andra again.

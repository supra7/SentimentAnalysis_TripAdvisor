Hi, a group of us arrived on Sept 5, 2011 to see Seattle before we cruised out to Alaska, The hotel concierge Terry Keifer, arranged private transportation for us from SEATAC to the hotel for a small fee of $12.50 per person. Checking into the hotel was very smooth with great customer service. We were assigned rooms on the 27th and 29th floors facing the harbor. The rooms view was great. The rooms were very nice and modern and I have no complaints. The next day, we ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the food and service was great. Again, Terry Keiger had pre-arranged transportation service for us from the hotel to the pier. The hotel is located within walking distance to the Farmers market. Our hotel stay was great and I would recommend this hotel to anyone for like great service and expectations.

I stayed at the Edgewater for 2 nights while attending a business meeting that was held at the hotel. This was actually by second stay at the hotel and while my first experience was not bad I beleive my most recent experience was better. The hotel is located on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and feels like (and is decorated) a lodge rather than a corporate hotel. It's walking distance to Pike Place Market and a few restaurants. Restaurant 67 is located in the hotel and there is also a bar which has a pretty extensive wine and drink list. Unfortunately, I did not have a view of the water from my room but I found the room to be quite enjoyable. The room was very clean; each room has a fireplace; the bed was very comfortable; and the bathroom has a beautiful stone shower. Guests can also find an umbrella in the closest which comes in handy given the frequency of rain in Seattle. The hotel offers wireless internet for a fee. The things that aren't so great include the business center and the gym. The equipment in the gym is a bit dated. Overall, I was pleased with my stay and would patronize this hotel in the future.

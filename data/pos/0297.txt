We are Kimpton Hotel fans after our recent trip to Portland and Seattle. Our stay at the Hotel Monaco was fabulous. We took other reviewers recommendations and found nearby street parking which allowed us to avoid the hotel parking fees and cranky valet. Our room was incredible, ammenities top notch and front desk staff were very helpful and friendy. We will definitely return to this hotel!

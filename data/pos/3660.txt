This is one Hotel than can expect a return visit from us! They were almost booked when I set up the reservation, about a month prior to our travel, and only City views remained. Upon check-in, however, "Camille" said a Bay view room was available, for a $50 upgrade. We took it, and this room (454) had a view of both the City and Elliott Bay. Breathtakingly gorgeous. Gas fireplace in the room, which we turned on immediately (temps were only in the 30's that evening). It heated up the room rather quickly. Very clean, with field stone on the floor of the bathroom. Our group of four dined in their dining room and, although pricey, was delicious, both presentation and taste. If no one is staying in "The Beatles Suite" (room 272) ask Camille (front desk) if you can see the room. It's usually booked, but that evening (we were lucky) it was not. All furnishings have long since been renovated, since the Beatles stayed in this room, back in the early 60's, but it was still a thrill for our group to "take in" where the Fab Four once stayed. Photos of the Beatles fishing off the balcony from this room into Elliott Bay are available in their Gift Shop. A classy Hotel, beautiful location, friendly staff (look for Camille). You won't be disappointed.

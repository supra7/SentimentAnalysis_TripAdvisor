Hotel Andrea is conveniently located only a few blocks from the wharf and a few blocks from the convention center, which made it ideal for my business stay. I had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was nice. I got in very late and had some appetizers and wine at the bar. The staff were friendly and offered to put me somewhere with a power outlet so I could work. The room was also lovely with a full length mirror. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were quiet - so basically everything a business traveller needs. I had high speed Internet and an iron at my disposal, so all in all I was pleased. I'd definitely go back.

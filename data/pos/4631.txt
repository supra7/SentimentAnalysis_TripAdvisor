I have stayed at this hotel for 6 weeks while on assignment in Seattle. This is one of the few decent hotels in downtown Seattle, and trust me I travel all the time. The location is unbeatable - close to everything. Try and get a high floor. I always got the Sound/Lake view and the view is great. The hotel has a nice gym. I only got room service twice - it was excellent one time and dreadful the other. I did like to 5th Ave Cafe for breakfast, and you can get breakfast to go. What I like about the Westins is that they are the same everywhere, so you always know what to expect. If you ever stayed at a Westin, you know what you are getting. I dont know what other reviews complain so much about. I find it the only adequate place to stay. Renaissance is simply dreadful located right on highway, Sheratons are never as nice as Westins, W was ok, but rather pretentious and they dont work hard too make you happy (often times i felt like they simply dont care) plus the fitness facility is absolutely awful. The only nicer option is the Fairmont Olympic, but its way more expensive and does not have a good rewards program. So I give this 4 out of 5. If I am back in Seattle, I will stay here again.

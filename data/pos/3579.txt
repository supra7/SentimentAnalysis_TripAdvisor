We stayed for one night this month since we were in the city for a concert and this hotel is in a perfect location. The ambiance of the lobby, low-key and professional desk staff, and the charming valet made us feel quite welcome. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which gave us a sofa and chair and it was good that it wasn't football season because my husband eyed that flat panel television with longing. Rooms are quiet, bed comfortable, and bathrooms well-laid out. Dinner at Lola (adjoining the hotel) is a fantastic experience, and so (unexpectedly) was breakfast. We'll definitely be back.

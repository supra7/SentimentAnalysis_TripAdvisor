Following yet another US roadtrip, we spent out last night in the Andra - a hotel I had shortlisted via tripadvisor. The hotel is rather stylish, and we were greeted by generally friendly members of staff. Quickly on our way to the top floor room, as per my standard request at all hotels. Decent sized room, with a comfortable sofa, and nice king size bed. The GF enjoyed the little area she could sit to do her makeup, and I was very impressed by the fantastically designed toilet/shower room. One of the nicest I have seen in a long time. I read a lot of comments on tripadvisor about hotel shower pressure. Let me tell you - in the Andra, it might be TOO powerful! Very refreshing. The location of the hotel was very good. We managed to easily walk to all that we wanted. We prefer to walk around the neighbourhoods, to really get a feel for the places we are visiting, and we walked to and from the Space Needle in the evening after dark, with no issues at all. Easy. Area seemed very safe too. My only negative comment is that of noise. Yes, I know that the hotel is located in the middle of a city. But our room was located on the front side of the hotel, overlooking 4th Avenue. Even up on 10th floor and it remained very loud late into the Friday night, with sirens and loud vehicles. My GF had a tough time sleeping, and I was also woken a couple of times. Not what we needed the day before our 11 hour flight back to Europe. My tip to you all would be to demand a room on the rear of the hotel, away from 4th. I will absolutely consider this property next time I am in Seattle. But might ensure I have earplugs with me in case..!

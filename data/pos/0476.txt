We stayed at the Warwick as part of our Coastal Starlight package (train trip) June 25-27. I am glad we had a chance to upgrade upon checkin to a non smoking - room with a view of the Space Needle as I am sure this made all the difference for only $30 a night. To have a run of the house smoking room woul have been our demise! The room was lovely - clean - great view of the needle - comfortable bedding - and what is of most important to us - CLEAN! Great location for walking to the tourist spots - would pick this hotel again.

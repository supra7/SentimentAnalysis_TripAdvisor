The Sheraton is conveniently located near the Pike Place Market, which is a destination that must be seen while in Seattle. It also located near the paid tram system that takes you to different areas within the city. The hotel was very elegent and full of business travelers. The room was spacious and was originally a bit pricey but luckily I found a great rate on Hotwire.com.

I stayed here with my daughter and two sons, my daughter had to attend a conference in Seattle and it was all booked very last minute. After reading some of the the reviews of this hotel I was very apprehensive to say the least however I was pleasantly surprised with the place. Yes there are posher more up to date places but if you want them then you have to pay. We had the complementary buffet breakfast which is served in the very busy coffee shop downstairs and you are entitled to a pastry, bottle of juice and hot drink which was fine for us but there are plenty of places to eat in the area if you didn't want to go for this option. The rooms are small but clean and have all you need. You can have a long wait for the lifts as the hotel was very busy with all types of traveller. There is a comfortable lounge with internet access although if you want to use the computer you may have a wait, but there is a huge beautiful library over the road with computers aplenty. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful and if I am ever fortunate enough to return to Seattle I wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again.

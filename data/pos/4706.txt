You cannot beat the location, not our first stay. Our checkin was fast and efficient. Our room on the 36th floor newly remodeled and provided us with a beautiful view of the Sound and the Bon-Macy Star. They were busy, the holiday season program at the nearby Mall and a marathon on Sunday. The pool was a zoo, we skipped it. No self parking and the valet took FOREVER. (my only complaint, except I miss Nikkos.)

I stayed at the inn for a work trip, and it was a wonderful experience! My room was very spacious, including the bathroom. It was nicely decorated, comfortable chairs, a nice desk area, nice sized tv, and comfy bed. I had a great breakfast at Bacco and enjoyed the complimentary tea in the lobby. The free business center came in handy, thank you! The service was wonderful! Everyone was very nice and helpful in directing me around Seattle. The inn is steps away from the Public Market and some fabulous restaurants. My only complaint would be the lack of a beverage area on the rooftop deck, which provided stunning views of Puget Sound. If I ever return to Seattle, I will definitely stay at the Inn.

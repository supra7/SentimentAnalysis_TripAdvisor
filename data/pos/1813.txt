We ended up staying here after booking through hotwire.com. This hotel was clean, the staff was exceptionally friendly and the location (across from Macy's, blocks from Pike Place Market) was perfect! The beds are super comfortable and the room was so quiet it felt like we had the place to ourselves! Everything was within walking distance!!!!! We ran the seawall (which starts just North of Pike Place) We ate at PF Chang's (next door) which was delicious! There is also a great looking restaurant and bar right in the hotel but we didn't have a chance to try either...

This hotel has a great location,classic designed rooms and a friendly staff. We were checked in early on our arrival to a warm and cozy queen room. The bed linens, towels and wonderful bathrobes were a welcome treat coming in from the Olympic National Parks! Small details like a soap dish, large hand cream and shampoos and the best amenity-a multiple electric port that handled all of our electronics were really appreciated! What a concept! Thank you! Great idea! We had a breakfast/parking package that was perfect for us. The car valet was quick, friendly and helpful with directions. Breakfast choices were excellent with large but tasty portions. Dinner at Andaluca was excellent as was Oliver's snacks. What a great location for sightseeing-walking or catching the city transit! This is the hotel of "yes", I can help you. The professional, friendly staff made our stay perfect in every way!

Overview: This hotel is marketed as modern design at a good price. It's definitely one of the more affordable places to stay in the area and the location is great. As a young couple, we felt right at home. Pros: We enjoyed our stay, it met our needs with style and was a fun change from more conventional hotels. Our room was clean, compact and comfy. It wasn't a huge room, it's definitely a compact design with everything in its place but we didn't feel cramped. We got one of the rooms with a bath attached. You can see in the photo that it was an open shower design, sort of Japanese style. You might think water would get everywhere, but that wasn't a problem. The breakfast provided the next morning was perfect--granola, DIY waffles, coffee, juice and tea. It's also located centrally, we walked to the art museum and other attractions with ease from the hotel. Great bars and restaurants are also nearby. Cons: The only con was that parking wasn't directly adjacent to the hotel and that the parking didn't seem to be in the best location. Parking was available but the lot was a couple blocks away. I made sure to park my car under a bright light in the lot because there were a lot of random men lurking about at one end of the lot.

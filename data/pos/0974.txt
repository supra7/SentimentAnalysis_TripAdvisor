I'm mystified by the couple of terrible reviews. The staff at Inn at the Market was very professional with us and the accomodations were very nice. I had booked a Town House City-View Suite for my wife and I as the last stop on a 10-day trip. We both were impressed with the spaciousness of the room(s) and quality of the little touches. Huge flat-csreen TV's upstairs and downstairs, small safe in the room, quiet even with the large windows facing the city streets. The 5th floor deck is wonderful, it would be even nicer if there was more space (impossible) and if the hotel would prohibit smoking (possible). The hotel itself is non-smoking and Seattle is a healthy city. C'mon management...go all the way and make the rooftop no-smoking too! Easy access to Pike Place Market, the first Starbucks and not that far from Safeco and Qwest Fields...great location. We also had them arrange for a town car to SEA and it was ontime and had us at the airport less than 30 minutes later. Granted, it was not a "bargain", but you can't expect Fairmont style for La Quinta prices! All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay.

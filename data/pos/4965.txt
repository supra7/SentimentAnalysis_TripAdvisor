We stayed two nights in the only suite at this hotel. When we arrived we had an easy time with valet parking, the check in was quick and friendly, the room was bright and clean, and the bed - phew. Amazing. Make sure you sign up for the Kimpton In Touch membership - it's easy and provides you with free use of the Internet during your stay. In the morning we were left undisturbed with our privacy door hanger, and had the luxury of showering with four different nozzles in the separate shower. The animal print robes are fluffy and comfy (though mine was a bit too fluffy and had me lint-rollering afterwards), and the shampoo/conditioner/lotions were actually lovely smelling and really useable. As mentioned in other reviews this hotel is wonderfully located for getting TO different local attractions - everything goes steeply downhill and the doormen were really helpful with getting taxis (even so far as running around a corner to catch one for us) - however the hike back UP to the hotel was exhausting. I recommend finding a cab for getting back home at the end of the day. On our third night we rearranged our reservations to accommodate another couple staying in the hotel, and the GM Sandy took good care of us in our new digs - supplying fresh flowers and an ensuring an overall positive experience in what could have been a very challenging situation. The King Premiere room had high ceilings and a nice view of the park and city library, and the sitting area was just right for us to enjoy room-service breakfast on our last morning in Seattle. Thank you to all the staff at the Hotel Vintage Park.

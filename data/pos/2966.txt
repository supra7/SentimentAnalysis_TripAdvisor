Very nice hotel, awesome location. Walking distance to everything, didn't even need our rental car. Very happy with our stay. Clean, elegant, nice staff. Definitely do not miss Pike's Place Market or Von's Roasthouse. We also had a good time visiting the Spaceneedle and the REI store, don't miss Feathered Friends across from REI either.

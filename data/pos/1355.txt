The Crowne Plaza is an excellent hotel in downtown Seattle. The rooms have been updated with down comforters and nice furniture. The view from the upper floors is spectacular; the best view of the city. I highly recommend staying on the Club Level. They have a complimentary breakfast and appetizers (which you could make a meal of) in the evenings in the Club Lounge. The elevators are fast and the restaurant in the hotel is good and affordable as well. The location is about four blocks from all the action but walking up Fifth or Sixth Avenue is no big deal and is a nice area of town. My wife and I felt totally safe walking late at night. We checked out a couple of other hotels that are similar like the Red Lion and the Westin and we like the Crowne Plaza better; it was also a better value. The Westin is old and while closer to everything, it feels like it is in a run-down area. My only complaint is the ridiculous charge for parking at $26 a day and no free Wifi (did pick up a network with computer on window ledge which was large enough for laptop to rest on. Nothing like browsing from the 32 floor.)

We arrived just before the cruise season began, so the whole city was less crowded than usual, and so was the hotel. We arrived very late from the airport to the hotel, and they gave us an upgraded room just because it was available....We were travelling with our son and were exhausted, so we really appreciated it. The hotel is very pet friendly, but so clean that you wouldn't know it. They apparently cater to any size pet, which is unusual for such a nice hotel, and if you don't have your own, they offer you your own pet fish! Nice touch, especially for our 8 year old son. The upgraded room has a dividing curtain and it's beautiful. Two flat screen televisions, not that you need them, but they're there. Fun tiger print robes and beds that are ohhh so comfortable. The food is delicious, and the chef gives demonstrations too. I can't remember ever enjoying being in a hotel so much that I didn't want to step outside, but that's exactly how I felt at Hotel Monaco. If you prefer something extraordinary, then try Hotel Monaco....It is NOT your typical luxury hotel.

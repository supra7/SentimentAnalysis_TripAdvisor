I stayed at Vintage Park with a girlfriend for an overnight stay. Hotel was very nice, stylish and comfortable - although the room was quite small - it was adequate for us. We didn't use the mini bar but it was very well stocked. Parking was quite expensive but normal for downtown in that area, at 34 dollars a night for valet parking. We were able to walk to shopping, restaurants and bars easily from the hotel. I would definitely recommend it for couples.

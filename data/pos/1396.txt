Incredible deal! Great hotel in a fantastic neighborhood. This isnt the place for you if you want high-end luxury but if you want clean, convenient and charming - stay here! This place was filled with nice little surprises such as French-milled soap in the bathroom and the lobby offered fabulous fresh coffee and fruit in the mornings. This hotel is within walking distance of great restaurants, boutique stores and a crazy-fun piano bar. The pizza place around the corner is open late and has great slices. Its located next to Pace needle and Key Arena!

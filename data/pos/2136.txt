Entering the hotel was like entering a 2 star European hotel in a major city. Simple, spartan but friendly (minus the smoke). We were there 3 days and the hotel grew on us. It's age turned to charm and the clean and simple rooms a bed and little else were just what we wanted to pay for. We didn't miss the pool, restaurant, fitness center, in-room coffee or any other nice but unnecessary 'frill' provided and most other hotels. At just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market, the location is perfect. The parking shuffle can be an issue - moving from street to lot - but the timing really worked out OK for us. (need to move the car off the street by 8am). The neighborhood seemed safe enough - as did most of Seattle - although the panhandlers around town are a real annoyance. The mayor might do well to read up on Giuliani's program in NYC. Back to the hotel - For the price and location, it's a must for anyone on a budget or just interested in a nice old place in a great location. Just don't expect all those creature comforts....

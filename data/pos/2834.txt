Staff was helpful and friendly. Hotel was well appointed with typical nice quality amenities. Room was on the smaller side. Seems to be common for a standard room at most Sheraton Hotels. Location was outstanding. We walked or used the monorail for just about everything. Starbucks across the street. Peet's about 1 block away. Luxury to Bargain Shopping all around. Close to Pike Place and waterfront restaurants. Be advised that one needs to be able to climb stairs and walk uphill on return as hotel is a handful of blocks uphill from waterfront restaurants. We enjoyed the climb in such a beautiful city after a wonderful sunset and seafood dinner! The gym was well equipped with a great view. We would return to the Sheraton again.

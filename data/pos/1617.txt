We have made a point of visiting Seattle yearly, for the past three years during the "Black Friday" weekend. Besides the obvious reason - great shopping bargains! - we return to Seattle because it is an attractive city easily reached by car from our home in BC, Canada. For the past few years, after trying other hotels, we have stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel. We especially enjoy the Mayflower's room rates, central location, friendly & helpful staff, tasteful ambiance, lounge (Oliver's) and restaurant (the Andaluca). When we arrive on Black Fridays, the lobby and Olivers are abuzz with a happy crowd enjoying hot chocolate, home made cookies and drinks awaiting the lighting of the Christmas tree at Westlake Centre, next to the Mayflower, followed by Macy's roof top fire works across the street. Although we have had a room with a view onto the fire works, we always choose to join the outdoor crowds and enjoy the happy atmosphere - a good start to the Christmas season. Upon arrival at the hotel, we park our car and leave it parked for the weekend as everything we want to see/visit is within easy walking distance. Seattle has a wonderful selection of restaurants, interesting neighbourhoods, good shopping and, of course, the always entertaining Pike Place Market. Our stay in the lovely Mayflower, which always includes breakfasts in the Andaluca, adds to our enjoyment of Seattle.

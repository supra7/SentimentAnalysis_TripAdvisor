Nice hotel, good location. However they offer a 5$ coupon per night if you don't have them 'refresh the towels' -- at least that is how it is presented. We were expecting them to still make the bed and generally straighten up the room (normal housekeeping service). But that was left entirely up to us! Housekeeping never once visited! I think the 'green initiative' is an excuse for them to cut housekeeping staff under the guise of helping the environment.

The service at this hotel incredibly gracious without being stuffy, which was great for a weekend spent with friends. From the minute I arrived I felt like I was with family. The front desk and concierge were so attentive to our requests, the bartenders were awesome, and the staff throughout the hotel were just the nicest, day or night. Besides the great service, this elegant spot was charming without sacrificing modern amenities -- the beds were so comfortable (I counted 8 pillows!), the bathrooms were completely renovated and sparkled with the look of Restoration Hardware, the Bodum french press set-up was perfect for waking up in a coffee town, and complimentary wi-fi everywhere in the hotel was key to getting work done when and where I wanted to. The Sorrento is now my go-to for any visits to Seattle.

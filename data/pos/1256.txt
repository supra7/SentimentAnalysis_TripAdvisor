This hotel was recommended to us by another couple. We went for a baseball game. It was a few blocks up the hill but once you made it to the water you were in walking distance from everything but the Space Needle. I would spring the extra money for a room with a view - the view was awesome. We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was good. We also finished each night with a night cap in the hotel bar - very nice relaxing place to enjoy each others company. Only warning is check in was crazy. We got into town at 3:00pm, check in was not till 4:00. and they would not accommodate us early. No problem we just drove around and checked the city out, when we cam back at 4:00 the lobby was a mad house. I would still stay again.

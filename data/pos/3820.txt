We went to Seattle for our honeymoon over the weekend, and booked the hotel and flight through Alaska Vacations. We were already getting a really great rate due to booking the trip that way, but when we went to check into the hotel, they upgraded our room to a Junior Suite at no additional charge since it was our honeymoon. The room was beautiful, with a great deck right on the water. It was clean and I LOVED the bed; the sheets are high quality, which is a huge plus for me, and the bed was extremely comfortable. I also loved the bathroom; no tub, but the BEST shower ever! I had read other reviews and several mentioned the noise level, but we noticed none at all. A little hallway noise, perhaps, in the morning, but VERY little. My only complaint was that the coffee isn't marked on the menu as being a charged item, so I was a little annoyed at being charged $5 to make coffee in the room. One, this is the first hotel I have ever been to that charged for the in-room coffee pot. Second, since it wasn't clear that there was a fee, I wasn't prepared. Same with the phone; I made two TOLL FREE calls and was charged $1.00 for each call, which didn't make sense to me. However, all in all, those are mild complaints (though I am glad I didn't end up accidentally costing us a LOT of extra $$!), and I would definitly stay at this hotel again.

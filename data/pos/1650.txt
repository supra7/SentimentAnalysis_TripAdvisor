The hotel has a great location in downtown Seattle - within walking distance to major attractions and retail. We had one of the four suites available - a corner room - which is well worth the cost. There was good natural light and cross ventilation. The hotel has been nicely renovated with comfortable seating areas and good lighting, sometimes a rarity in hotels. The bathroom could use a little better lighting and more surface to put toiletries. Robes are provided. The hotel is clean and staff is very accommodating. There is complimentary wi-fi and, if you need them, computers available to guests. Breakfast is not included, but there are plenty of places nearby to get a light meal. (There seems to be a Starbucks on every corner. Not surprising since they started here.) For dinner, one night, we wanted a casual dinner and the concierge directed us to the Icon Grill, a restaurant with a wide variety of choices. Despite its casualness, the place is decorated with a lot of art, including an abundance of Chihuly glass. It was a good recommendation. You will need a car to get to places like Bellvue or Capitol Hill, home of the renowned Elliott Bay Book Store. However, the hotel provides valet parking and they are very efficient at retrieving your car quickly.

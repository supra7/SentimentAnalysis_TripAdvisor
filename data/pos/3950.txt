This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel after booking it through Priceline. The first time I stayed we were offered an upgrade to the water side for $50 and took it. We were offered it again this time but declined so that we could put the money toward a nice dinner. Our room was on the third floor closest to the road and train tracks that others have written about. My friend and I both sleep with earplugs, so noise wasn't and issue for us, but it definitely is quite noisy on that side and if you are sensitive to noise at all, it will probably be a problem and might be worth booking the water side instead (where I didn't hear the trains at all). The decor is a bit odd for an ocean-side hotel - hunting lodge chic is how I would describe it. There is no close place to get a coffee in the morning, so I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning. The food wasn't outstanding, but you can't beat the view. We sat in the lounge with drinks one afternoon reading and looking over the water and it was wonderful.

We stayed at the U Inn over a long weekend in Dec and really liked it. Nice to be away from the buzy downtown in a cool hip neighbourhood with lots going on. Rooms are clean and modern with free wireless. Continental breakfast bar with hot waffles, fruit, toast, eggs, etc. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable about Seattle. We liked that this hotel was outside the downtown core and yet it was very easy to get downtown, either by free shuttle bus, transit or car. Overall, great experience and we would definitely stay at the U Inn again.

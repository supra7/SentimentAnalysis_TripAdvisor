My husband had business in Seattle, so my baby and I came too, and I bid on priceline and got the Edgewater. Originally I was nervous about the location, and having read a lot of previous reviews I was really worried that we would not enjoy the Edgewater. I would have to say it ended up being a great stay. I agree with a lot of other reviewers, It's probably not a "4" star quality hotel- at least the rooms aren't. The lobby, and restaurants are fantastic with the incredible view! The rooms are nice, I had one on the third level towards the street, it wasn't very noisy which was good. The bathrooms are nicer than the actual room, I liked the shower. I loved the fireplace in the room! The bed was a king and a 3 out of 5 on comfort level. One issue I had with the room is the air conditioner was so loud! It would constantly turn off and on, and was way too loud! The worst part of this hotel is the outrageous price for parking!!!!!!! It's valet only, with a overnight-24 hour fee of $33.00, and $6.44 sales tax!!!! So over $40 dollars once you pay the valet a night!!!! We paid more a night for parking than we did to rent our car for a day!!!! There is a parking garage across the street where we parked our car the last 3 nights and I highly recommend doing this! It's 20.00 a night! The hotel does provide complimentary shuttle service to the down town areas, which is nice. So I warned you the parking is crazy, the rooms are cabin themed, not your typical 4 star Westin, Hilton, etc. rooms, but are still nice. The staff is so great! They were extremely helpful and very kind- from the valet, to the front desk, to the room cleaners! Great staff! Also the location is great being down by the pier and trendy Belltown - if you want to be close to the shopping stay more down town! Oh and I had a room with a great view of the Space needle, so if you aren't paying extra money for a water view room, I suggest asking for a view of the city!

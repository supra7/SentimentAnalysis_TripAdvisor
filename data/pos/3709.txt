The Edgewater had a friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff that made up for the fact that our room was very poorly designed. The bathroom lighting makes it impossible for women to put on their makeup, do their hair or complete the myriad other tasks they must accomplish before going out the door. The bed was not up to the standards of any of the other hotels I stayed in over the last several years. The hotel has a great location, being the only hotel that is located right on Seattle's waterfront and it is convenient to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Seattle Center, and many of the other neighborhoods of Seattle. One of the hotel's claims to fame is that the Beatles stayed there during their 1st United States tour in the 1960s. As a result they have a number of photographs of the Beatles and other entertainers who stayed there over the years. Their downtown shuttle is a very nice amenity, and I cannot praise the staff too highly. They were friendly, accommodating, efficient, and thoughtful. The hotel was quiet in the room had a gas fireplace. Unfortunately controlling the temperature was difficult, and it was frequently to warm in the room, which caused us to turn the heat off completely. The only meal we ate at the hotel was breakfast, and the food and service were both excellent. We did have a waterfront room, and since we looked at the rooms on the other side of the hallway, I would agree with Kaytwowa, do not even think about staying in any room that does not have a water view. From the other side of the hotel you see the parking lot, the soon to be torn down Alaskan Way Viaduct and the railroad tracks. Surprisingly, the trains were barely heard inside our room, and we never heard our neighbors, so the hotel is obviously well constructed from a sound standpoint. If you are looking for a waterfront hotel in Seattle or you are a Beatles fanatic, I would recommend the Edgewater.

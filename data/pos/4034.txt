Gorgeous building, terrific staff and wonderfully comfortable beds (with lots of huge pillows)! The ambiance is sophisticated and tranquil. Anytime we chatted with staff they were absolutely helpful, polite and genuinely friendly (in Spanish AND English). Our stay involved a large group of friends and we were all accommodated superbly. Upon (early) check-in, we were even offered an upgrade on our room for a minimal fee to a huge suite we loved! Also, the location is very accessible. Our stay was fantastic and we definitely want to return to The Sorrento in Seattle soon.

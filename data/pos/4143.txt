We had booked a room with a hotel that was not opened, so this was a last minute switch. An upgrade in quality. A super little hotel. The staff was a bit stuffly...but I loved the brit car that they picked us up in at the train station. Lots of very nice touches in the room. Jazz playing when we walked in. Lots of nice extras. The room was very small and very oddly shaped. The only down...the staff was a little stuffy.

I was quite happy at the Mayflower and would stay there again either on business or leisure. It had a lot of historic charm while still being clean and up to date. Some of the complaints are true--there is some noise from traffic outside (though it definitely dies down at night and if you are particularly sensitive, ear plugs would do the trick), no real counter space in the bathroom, no fancy flat screen tv--but the location (an easy walk to the Market, the monorail, and to Dahlia's-yum!), the comfortable pretty room with nice beds and towels, and the excellent service overrode these minor problems. The front desk and the room service waiters were particularly friendly and thoughtful. I had a deluxe room which was plenty spacious; however, the regular rooms I poked my head in, while still nice, were definitely smaller--I'd recommend springing for the deluxe--the rate was only slightly higher.

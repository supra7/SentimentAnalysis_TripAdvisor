Mayflower Park Hotel is a great choice if you want something equidistant between the Space Needle and the basball/football arenas, as I did. The needle is definitely walkable. The stadiums are too, but are much longer. Definitely leave 30-40 minutes for that walk. Another thing that's very close is Pike Place Market. It's only a few blocks away. Also, you're right next to all major shopping, tins of restaurants, Starbucks of course, and plenty of fast-food joints. The staff was extremely friendly and I would easily stay there again. The rooms are pleasant. I had a classic room, and it was a touch small, but it's fine fine for one or two people.

We've stayed at The Moore 3 times previous, which, right away, says a lot. Sure it's older. Sure the rooms are basic. But where can you stay in downtown Seattle for under $100? Not many places. Fabulous location. Easy walking to shopping and Pike Place and we also walk to and from the Mariners games from here. Front desk staff are always nice and helpful. Rooms are always clean. My requests for a quiet room are always honoured and I think the beds have all been replaced with new ones in the last year.

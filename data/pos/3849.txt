Stayed again at the Edgewater in March 2011 for four nights. Our room was beautiful, on the first floor over the water, with a wonderful view. Ate in the restaurant (Six Seven) three times over the four days stay and loved it. Food was outstanding, with excellent service. Sunday brunch was particularly good. And, sipping a single malt, with a good book, looking out over Elliott Bay - aaah......... The Edgewater's location is excellent, with good walking access all along the waterfront (shops, acquarium, harbor cruise, restaurants) and a short walk up the hill to Pike Public Market. Lots to see and do.

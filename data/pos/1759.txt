I wrote to the Mayflower to tell them I was returning after not being there for some time. We had wtinessed something in the area that was really tragic and hadn't been back since. It was no fault of the hotel what had happened. When we arrived we found they had put us in a beautiful suite and written a nice letter. They had also put some yummy treats in the room which my 2 17 yr olds loved.The service was excellent-they let us keep our car and bags there the next day until 6 pm while we went to the market. We will definately be returning soon.

I purchased one night's stay through expedia.com without doing my research on this hotel. I needed some place centrally located in downtown Seattle. I reserved the room for my wife and I in the early morning and then was able to check in at approximately 10:30 AM. No hassles about being there too early. The staff at the front desk got me in a room quickly., I was very impressed with the room. It had a nice view, very comfy bed, and a modern theme. If I knew hotel rooms could be this cheap and be this luxurious, I would have been a customer of Sheraton a lot sooner. We had a wonderful stay.

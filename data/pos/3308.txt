We stayed here for a couple nights over the weekend, and found it to be a great spot. The location is perfect, the price was good. The parking was a decent price ($15/night). The hotel staff were very helpful - they suggested places to eat. Our hair dryer did not work - a new one was brought up within 10 minutes. The room was clean. The bathtub is a little dated, but that's about it. The water pressure was amazing! The bed was pretty comfy. There is a restaurant there, but we didn't try it. The prices seemed a bit much. We walked to the market and to the Space needle in minutes. We had a room on the 6th avenue side, and it was a little noisy on the street around midnight, but it wasn't that bad. We would stay here again. A great experience.

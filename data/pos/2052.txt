Our stay at the Moore hotel was very enjoyable. We were visiting Seattle on a busy weekend, so rooms were a little hard to find. We took a chance on the Moore after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were glad we did. The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of downtown attractions, especially Pike's Place Market. In fact, if you stay at the Moore, don't even think about renting a car. Parking is too much of a hassle to worry about, and walking is just too easy. There are a couple of things that were not great about the hotel: The immediate surroundings are more sketchy than some of the more touristy areas. Also, the rooms are not air conditioned- which is only a problem because this part of downtown has plenty of bars that can be loud with an open window. Overall, the Moore was great, and the staff is very helpful.

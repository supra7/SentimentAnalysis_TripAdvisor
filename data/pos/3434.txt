My husband and I stayed here for our first trip to Seattle. The hotel is in a great location, it's in an easy to walk to the monorail, city center and pike market. We arrived hungry and way too early for check in. We asked one of the employees outside (I wish we had gotten his name) where we should go for lunch. After quickly describing what type of food we where looking for he pointed us to an amazing little restaurant. He was so friendly we immediately felt good about our choice of hotel. After lunch we wandered back and check in was quick and painless. Our room was clean and modern. Layout was much nicer than your standard hotel. Robes where very comfortable. My only complaint is that some light is let into the sleeping area of the room at night. The lights in the hall are very bright and shine in all around the door. We had to lay a towel down to block most of it out. We also could not find a way to turn off the under-shelve lighting in the bathroom, so if the bathroom door slid open the room was bathed in a blue light. That being said, we slept great, the bed and linens are so comfortable! Check out is at 1:00, and that gave us plenty of time to have breakfast and explore pike market and the aquarium before we needed to be out. Check out was just as easy as check in. This will be our go-to hotel for future trips to Seattle. We Loved it!

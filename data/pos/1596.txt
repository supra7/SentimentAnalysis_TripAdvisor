I have stayed at the Mayflower Park 4 times for business purposes. The location is very good for business or pleasure, being right between Macy's and the flagship Nordstrom store. It is 4 blocks from Purple Cafe (wine bar), a block from Lola (the donuts!), and very close to many other great downtown spots. Valet parking ONLY. Oliver's (the in-hotel bar) might look stuffy, but the staff are friendly and the drinks are top class. Food is generally tasty. Be sure to try several of the specialty martinis, including the Paradigm Shift (vodka, raspberry, champagne, campari). The "well" gin is Bombay Sapphire. If you need a cup of joe and are tired of the Starbucks routine (a huge location is a block away - a big glass walled building on a bustling corner), you can head 2 blocks down to Caffe Senso Unico, a coffee shop run by an Italian family. BEST value in downtown Seattle with FREE wifi. The ONE negative I can cite is that the building is on a busy corner, so if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for an inside room.

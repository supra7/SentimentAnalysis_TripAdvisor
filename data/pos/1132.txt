If youre looking for something a little different than the cookie-cutter type hotel rooms that could be in any chain anywhere in the world, try this. Great minimalist-style while at the same time managing to be cozy. Beds were very comfortable and everything was scrupulously clean. If youre turned off by the comparison to a hostel - don't be. It was nothing like any hostel we've ever been too. Its more like house sitting in your hip buddies loft. Great eating and drinking establishments within walking distance. Overall an experience we would repeat.

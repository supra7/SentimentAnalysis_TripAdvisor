My wife and I stayed at the University Inn for several days in late August. As so many others have said, this is simply a great place to stay while in Seattle. We stayed in a premier room that had a very comfortable bed, sofa, mini-fridge, microwave and a view of Mt. Rainier. The staff are very accommodating, and provide great service. The shuttle is a real plus if you want to visit Seattle attractions and leave your car behind, and a fine breakfast awaits you at the Portage Bay Cafe next door. Overall, an excellent experience, and we will return.

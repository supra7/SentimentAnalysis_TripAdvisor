We stayed two nights at the University Hotel and recommend it to other travellers. The rooms are contemporary design and comfortable and clean. Above all the staff are very friendly and helpful - giving directions, recommending restaurants,arranging for the shuttle van. The hotel is located near the U of Washington campus and offers complimentary shuttle service to the downtown core. It was great to be able to park the car for a couple of days! In the evenings we walked 2-3 blocks to nearby restaurants in the university district. Our room looked out over a courtyard pool in the back which was undoubtedly quieter because of less traffic noise - so you may want to book your room with that in mind. We would definitely stay there again.

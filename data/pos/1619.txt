I can't say enough about the service at the Mayflower Park. I seriously doubt if I will ever stay anywhere else in Seattle. Kelly at the front desk went above and beyond to help us when we stranded ourselves in Fremont. We went to see a play at a little theater not realizing that it was a bit out in the sticks. We tried to call the cab company that took us there but got NO ANSWER. So we called the Mayflower and Kelly sent another cab company for us, tout suite! Then, the morning of our departure, we asked for directions to catch the light rail to the airport. We were a little confused so one of the clerks said he needed a walk anyway and he walked us to the corner! Incredible service in this day and age! The hotel is also beautifully appointed and in an ideal location, close to Macy's, Nordstrom and Pike's Place Market. Thank you Mayflower for restoring my faith in old fashioned service....I will refer everyone I know to you and even some I don't know (aka Trip Advisor).

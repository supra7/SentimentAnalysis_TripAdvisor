The Hotel Andra is truly a little gem in downtown Seattle. The rooms are freshly redone in a stylish contemporary vein. We stayed in a jr. suite, which was very roomy and separated the bedroom from the living room by louvered doors (very handy when one partner wants to sleep and the other wants to read). The restaurant Lola occupies the corner and adjoins the lobby. The food is excellent and they were still serving dinner when we checked in at 11:30 PM on a Monday night (they provide the 24 hr. room service, which was also excellent). The location is great, just a couple of blocks up the hill from Pike's Market and other downtown attractions. Other Tom Douglas restaurants (Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery, Serious Pie) are right across the street. The staff was super friendly and efficient. The only negative was that the bathrooms are a little small, although very well appointed and functional. An excellent choice and value.

Fantastic staff at this hotel. Lots of character and fun little perks/touches, just like the other Hotel Monaco locations nationwide. Join their rewards program ahead of time to get free wireless internet and a $10 "raid the minibar" coupon. There's also a free wine reception in the lobby from 5pm-7pm daily. Easy, clean business center and fitness center.

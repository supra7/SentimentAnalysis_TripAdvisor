Me and my teenage son came to Seattle for the weekend, with the highlight being the Seahawks game on Sunday. We arrived on Friday morning at the hotel at 10:30am, I was hoping to at least drop my bags off at the hotel as we toured the town, but to my surprise, they actually checked us in our room, it was only 10:30am! I was very pleased with that and a nice way to start off the weekend. I had asked for early check in, but I really didn't expect it that early. The room was acceptable and clean, very much a typical room I would stay in, we weren't here to stay in the room all weekend. Even got a corner room (on 6th floor) that had a view of downtown and of the space needle. Cleaning staff always said "Hi" to me when they could have easily ignored me. Even though we could have stayed closer to the more active part of downtown, I didn't want to pay the higher price and had no problem walking the 4 or so blocks to get to some of tourist spots or the public transportation hubs (we did not rent a car). This area of diowntown seemed very quite compared to just a few blocks south, wasn't much activity around or people walking around when we were there, but I always felt safe. I checked out on the morning of the game, but the front desk still allowed me to check in my luggage with them so I didn't have to take it with me to the game. I was vey appreciative of that. Not renting a car probably saved me $200 in car rental and parking fee's, but we did have to walk and take busses/train, which was pretty simple since I had researched it well, but would have been much more difficult if I had not. Hotel is real close to Top Pots Doughnuts too! Overall, I would stay here again, I felt the combination of the price and location was ideal for this type of trip.

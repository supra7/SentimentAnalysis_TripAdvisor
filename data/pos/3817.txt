We've stayed there a few times and would do so again. Some rooms face towards the city and the railroad tracks are very nearby with freight trains moving through at times all night long. The hotel does supply earplugs in those rooms. We prefer the waterfront rooms which have nice views over the water to the dock area with large cranes for large ships. Ferries go by too. Desk staff is friendly. The resturAnt has a very nice view and a good happy hour. Breakfasts also fine although some wait staff left quite a bit to be desired. The rooms have gas fireplaces but we've noticed they can have problems lighting and we have had to get a maintenance man up repeatedly to crawl around on the floor to light them.

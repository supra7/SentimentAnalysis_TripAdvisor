This hotel is right in the middle of the shopping area and the convention centre of Seattle. I love to come to this hotel, i've spend a couple of trips here. The rooms are spacious and quiet. The views from the rooms on higher floors are nice. The staff is really good and friendly. Nice lobby and bar too. I just can't say anything negative about this hotel. If you are going to Seattle, just stay here.

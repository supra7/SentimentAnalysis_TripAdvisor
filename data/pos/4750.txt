This hotel is located just 2 blocks from an entrance to the University of Washington. Husky Stadium is just down the street. The daily rate is very reasonable and includes a free breakfast (cereal, oatmeal, muffins, fresh fruits, coffee/tea/juice). The room where breakfast is served is a little cramp but adequate and includes a flat screen TV. There is also a PC in the same room which you can use to check in for your flights. Our room was clean and pleasant. The walls are a little thin, so you can hear the doors to nearby rooms closing. Not a major problem, though. The University Village Shopping Center, which is an upscale shopping center, is located right across the street. There are some good restaurants and a 24 hour supermarket located in the shopping center. Very convenient!

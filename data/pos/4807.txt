We stayed here 4 nights with our family. Everything was very good and lots of great family friendly amenities...afternoon snacks, free breakfast, helpful staff, free use of washer & dryer, comfy rooms, pool, free parking, and complimentary shuttle. Ivar's restaurant a short drive away was just incredible. Would come back again!

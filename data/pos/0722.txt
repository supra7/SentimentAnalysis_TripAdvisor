We splurged on this modern, comfortable hotel with a great location for anyone who loves Pike Place Market and we do! The front desk staff was excellent and helped us plan our stay but our favorite part of this hotel was the 6th floor roof top patio. It is very comfortable with lounge chairs, couches and a canopied table area with plenty of room to relax each afternoon before going out for the evening. This is an excellent choice

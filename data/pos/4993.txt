We go to Seattle every couple of months for a weekend away, and this property is our favourite. Once again, it did not disappoint. The Kimpton InTouch program is worth signing up for- upgraded rooms, "raid the mini bar" vouchers and a hand-written welcome note have all become expected after a few stays. The rooms are alway immaculate, lavishly decorated and comfortable. The views aren't fantastic, but the windows open! The service is outstanding, and Tulio is an incredible dining experience. The food both in-room and in the restaurant is divine (make reservations!). Our waiter, at the end of our indugent 4 hour dinner, even offered to bring our dessert and coffee up to our room for us to enjoy there. Everyone at the hotel is friendly, service-oriented and professional. Love it!

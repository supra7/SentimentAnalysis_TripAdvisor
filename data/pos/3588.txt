Stayed at the Hotel Andra for one night as a quick stop in Seattle at the start of our family vacation. It's a nice clean hotel with exceptional service. The rooms and bed are comfortable, with the exception of the airconditioning (a bit noisy). The bathroom is small, but clean. Will stay again, but if travelling with the kids again for a longer stay, will definately get two rooms.

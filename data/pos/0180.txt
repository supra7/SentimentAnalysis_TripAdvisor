Hotel is in a great location that is walking distance to waterfront, restaurants, and Pike's Market. Loved the quirky decor and furnishings. Definitely different than most of the vanilla chain hotels out there. Rooms were a little bit small, but nicely furnished and clean. Bed was comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Daily wine happy hour was nice. Parking was valet only at $50. I would definitely stay here again- I really enjoyed this hotel!

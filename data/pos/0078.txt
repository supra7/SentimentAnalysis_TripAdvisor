Great service began as we pulled up for valet parking, and were immediately greeted. Front desk gave our large party rooms on the same floor, and assured us they had a wheelchair we could use for an elderly family member. After resting for an hour we came down for a festive wine tasting in the lobby area where a fire was burning and a large Christmas tree stood. In the morning fresh coffee, tea and hot cocoa was available early, then two mornings we had excellent breakfasts at Sazerac, the hotel's restaurant. No complaints at all.

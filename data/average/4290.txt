Wonderful base for most tourist attractions. We tried some of the hotel restaurants and found the food excellent as was some of the restaurants nearby. Hotel lobby looked very upmarket. Room was clean and tidy, very average but bathroom was extremely small, no room to put anything. Room had no view, just overlooked air conditioning fans which were quite noisy at night. Concierge desk very helpful and all staff we encountered were courteous.

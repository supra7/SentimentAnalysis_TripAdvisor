The hotel was OK. The staff was the big positive about the hotel, they were exceptional and provided excellent reccomendations. Also excellent was the health club but the pool was closed while we were there. The rooms (especially the bathroom!) was on the small side (but we did get basic rooms, so suites were likely bigger). Rooms had sweet views of city. Location was decent. The biggest issue I had was the constant nickle and diming Hilton has resorted to. We ate out for breakfest each morning to avoid paying exoburent fees. Would try somewhere else next time

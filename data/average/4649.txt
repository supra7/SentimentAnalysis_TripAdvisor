I must say I was really impressed when I stepped into the hotel. I felt like I was in a European Chateau, with all the chandeliers and marble. Unfortunately, my feeling changed once I got to my room. The room is very small, so small the TV has to be put on the side wall (making it very difficult to watch), and closet only fits a few items. And the noise level is unbearable. I could hear the door slams and ice machine (although my room was a good 70 feet from it), not to mention the conversation of my neighbors. In addition, the phone was not connected even 1 hour after I checked in (I had to call reception to have it fixed) and the pay movie channel was not working the whole time I was there (2 nights). Overall, as beautiful as the hotel is, I would not go back again unless the paper-thin wall is fixed.

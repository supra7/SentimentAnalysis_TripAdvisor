I stayed for 5 nights with my wife during our Istanbul trip April 2011. Booking was based on tripadvisor reviews as usual. The Good things about the hotel: 1- Staff are polite and helpful 2- Breakfast is simply excellent 3- rooms are clean / bathrooms are excellent 4- close enough to Taksim but away from the noise 5- Booked room only and was offered free daily breakfast The not so good (why only 3 stars): 1- rooms are very small, my deluxe room was very small and just enough to move around, couldnt imagine how small normal rooms will be 2- furniture and interior are very dull & tasteless 3- Honestly for the price, I know I could have booked a better hotel, this price anywhere in Europe will give you really good trendy hotels. 4- room service lady knocked and opened the door once without checking if someone inside or waiting for us to open 5- trash bin in room was not emptied once although full, and complimentary coffee/tea bar not refilled 6- the bed is seriously small, for a couple it's barely enough, for me since I'm 190cm (6'10") tall it's not confortable Don't get me wrong, the hotel is really very good, and I have no real complaint about it, it's just that I'm not staying in it again, nor recommending anyone to it because I've seen more trendy and interesting options during my visit for same/less prices.

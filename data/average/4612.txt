Beautiful old hotel (nearly 100 years old). In possibly the best location, close to subway stations right in city centre. Staff are friendly and helpful, nothing was too much for them. The only drawback is probably part of the attraction - the hotel is old and grand , but at the same time the rooms are old and would benefit from a full renovation. Many of the rooms face inwards, towards an inner courtyard therefore no view or sunshine, and you should ask for a sunny room facing the street. Also the hotel does not have a pool or gymn, which is a drawback for those who like a swim/train In fact there is an arrangement with local gymns/YMCA but you have to pay extra and this costly. On a positive note the rooms are quiet and private.

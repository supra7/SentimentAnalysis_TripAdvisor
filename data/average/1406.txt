Stayed here a few times, just a 1-2 nights each time. Big rooms well equipped, the reception and lobby is no frills, but the location is not bad, very close to Mall of emirates. Suited me for a place to drop my bags and then head out with mates that I was meeting, always clean and comfortable. I once had a room which seem to smell of sewage slightly, never complained as I want in the room for more than ten mins at a time.

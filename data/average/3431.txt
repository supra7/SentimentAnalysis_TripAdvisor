JUST BEAWARE...that this hotel though super close to the airport only has room internet for a minimum 24Hrs - @ 29.00$'s SIN plus tax plus 10% service...no 1 hr service....There is internet in the bar - but you have to buy food/drinks to use it...if you need internet when arriving at the airport remember from a flight into Singapore that before immigration there are multiple free PC's( there must be 150 in the airport) that can access the web...just felt that they were after every dollar from the guest...No extra service semed to be delivered to PRIORITY CLUB MEMBERS- MAYBE THE WATER BOTTLE IN THE ROOM - BUT NOT SURE.

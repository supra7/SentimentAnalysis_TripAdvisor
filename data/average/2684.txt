I got a fantastic corner room at this hotel with spectacular view through the floor to ceiling windows. Rooms offer great features are clean and large, certainly good value for money. I was less happy with front desk staff, I thought they were arrogant, slow and unprofessional, which is unacceptable for a hotel in this category. The lobby looks very tacky and smells funky but the pool area is spacious and perfectly located facing South-West. I also used the gym that offers good quality equipment. My room service dinner arrived quick and was of good quality. A lot of people complain about the 'scary' neighborhood that this hotel is in. I really don't get that, the area is not the busiest you can imagine, but you can walk everywhere and the convenience of having the bus and metromover station right next to the hotel saves a fortune when traveling around. This is a good down town hotel, I enjoyed my stay here.

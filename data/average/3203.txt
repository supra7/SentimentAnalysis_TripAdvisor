This hotel is a good value especially given the location right in the middle of the boardwalk action. It was clean and the people were friendly. The roof top deck was nice for people watching. However, the hotel didn't really work for our family. I have two small children. The rooms are very, very small and there was no room for them to play and it was frustrating bumping into each other. It would be nice if they had balconies for each room, that way mom and dad can sit outside and enjoy the view while the kids napped or slept. The absolute worst part of the hotel was that there was no elevator (there is an old one that has to be operated by hotel staff which is rarely available). It was terrible lugging in all of the luggage and baby necessaties. We had to take the stroller in and out of the car after each use because it was such a pain to take it upstairs plus we didn't have space in the room for it any way. I think it would be a great hotel for a couple or a family with older children but it is rough with young children.

When I saw the rate on online sites we werent planning to stay there, but we got a group rate of $129 per room which made it worthwhile, I certainly wouldnt pay the more often seen rate of $199. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had a really great view over the city. The service was friendly. Front desk was pretty slow as the hotel was fully booked so they were very busy. The pool was pleasant and the restaurant about what you expect in a Renaissance. The hotel is at the top of the hill which was a fairly steep climb to get up, but it would only be a cheap taxi ride if you didnt feel like walking.

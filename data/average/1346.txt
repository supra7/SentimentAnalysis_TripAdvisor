If you ever want to stay at this hotel, don't stay at the Garden Level or Pool Level rooms. The room that we stayed in was outdated with small bathroom. We walk very far and it seems we enter a labyrinth. At check out, the front desk didn't give us option to pay cash.....and everything automatically charged to my credit card even though I booked the rooms throughh the hotel website NOT expedia etc. Parking was expensive for airport area. I will not stay with this hotel again. If you want to book at this hotel......make sure you choose the new tower.

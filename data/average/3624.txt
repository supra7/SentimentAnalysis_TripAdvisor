This location is great if you need to be anywhere near the Market Center area of Dallas, or even Downtown (5 mins away). The hotel itself is older, and looks like at one time was pretty nice. However, it could use some renovations. The room we had was very clean and i had no problem with it at all. The hotel could stand to paint and upgrade the bedding.

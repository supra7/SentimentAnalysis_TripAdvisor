I just returned from my stay @ the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and until this morning, I had a pretty good experience. I was there with a friend from Thursday afternoon until Sunday morning. The room we were in had 2 double beds and 2 full bathrooms, which I thought was pretty cool for a standard room. Housekeeping took forever to get to our room on Saturday, but since we were out most of the day, it did not affect us. I woke up this morning (Sunday) to find a cockroach crawling around our room!!!!! It was not something we brought in with us and until last nite, we had not eaten anything in our room (brought back Coldstone Creamery to have to eat after a nite out). After a major freak out and making sure our stuff was clean and roach free (I trapped it in a glass on the floor), we got the hell out of the room. The hotel staff was very apologetic and even took Saturday night's stay from our bill, but, I will probably never stay there again.

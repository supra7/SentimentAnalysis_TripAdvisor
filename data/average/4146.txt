We stayed in August with my husband and two small children. The room was very small and smelled of mold. We did not have this problem the last time we stayed at this hotel. The gym is nice as well as the pool area. This hotel needs a major facelift. The wonderful part of this hotel is that you are on the wharf and only minutes from the North End.

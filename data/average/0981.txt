I was in Seattle for business and stayed at this hotel. I work for a start-up so we don't have huge expense accounts and price is something we look out for. This was the cheapest place in the City and it was really easy for me to get downtown. They were fast in calling me a cab when I needed it and friendly when I asked about restaurants in the area. The rooms are a little dated but hey-you get what you pay for so I can't really complain. It was a clean and decent place. I will stay here again when I'm back.

I'm not sure whether to recommend this hotel for the great "old" feel and comfy beds, or to not recommend it for the terrible service of the front desk staff and the dirty appearance of the bathroom. My husband and I stayed here over the weekend and found that the location of the hotel is wonderful, if not perfect. The condition of the hotel is, however, far from perfect. The headboards had tears in them, the bathroom was less than sanitary feeling, the room was rather small, and the paint was coming off of the baseboards in places. I feel like there were cosmetic changes that could have been made to make the room more appealing without spending a lot of money on the part of the hotel. Nonetheless, the beds were great, the tv was nice and conveniently placed, and the feel was nothing less than hisotric Seattle. If you are expecting something breathtaking I don't recommend this hotel. If you simly need somewhere to stay- this will suit you fine!

I am a fan of the W Hotels Worldwide chain and the W Seattle did nothing to dissuade me. There were a few small snafus, however, the management handled these with care and courtesy. I will start with the positives: The concierge was fabulous, my husband needed a haircut and they recommended Rudy's Barber Shop which did a great job at a very reasonable $10! The rooms were spacious and the beds wonderfully comfortable. The nightime lobby bar was not as 'happening' as in some other cities, however, it was comfortably crowded with beautiful people for a Saturday night and the drinks came quickly and were well-mixed. Some negatives: They charged a friend of ours for a full day of parking when he was only there two hours - we mentioned it to the front desk staff and they promptly corrected this on our bill. Also, we stopped by the front desk at about midnight and asked for a wake-up call for the next morning as we had an international flight to catch, but the call never came, and our 'backup' alarm never went off - so we missed our flight. We were fortunate enough to get on another flight at a minor cost which delayed us approximately half a day. I wrote a letter to the Starwood Customer service center and copied the general manager of the W Seattle. Within 3 days I received a letter from the G.M. stating that they would refund our one night stay in full due to their error. In summary, if you like the ambiance and feel of the W Hotel chain or if you are just looking for a convenient and hip hotel with great service in Seattle you will not be dissappointed with the W Hotel.

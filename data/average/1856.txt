Although rated 5 star I think it is over rated. Its hard to find anything thats not beautifull in Hawaii, it is the attention to detail that makes a hotel worthy of five stars. In this case there were many things that were lacking. From chandeliers in the lobby needing dusting to rugs fraying (also in the lobby). We were at the pool and were accompanied by a pile of used towels for almost an hour before someone removed them. Although minor details, I at least do not expect these things for these prices and 5 stars. Without firsthand experience visiting each hotel the rating system is important. Hopefully reviews will compensate.

Ended up in a nice corner room with a King size bed on the 21st floor. My biggest complaint was the smell. I could tell the room used to be a smoking room and I can't stand it. To confirm my suspicion, I visited a room on the 32nd floor. The air up there was nice, crisp, and clean smelling. Even though the property is non-smoking, the remnants of the past still remain. If you're sensitive to old smoke, then avoid certain floors. Also, the volume of the TV wouldn't go below level 6, other than mute. This was very annoying when trying to watch TV, while my wife was trying to sleep. Besides these two issues, the hotel was average. The breakfast buffet on the 2nd floor was decent. I usually avoid hotel breakfast buffets, but this would get a return trip from me. The location is good in relation to the freeway and shopping downtown. Parking is a bit expensive, but you have to expect it for the location. The valet service was nice.

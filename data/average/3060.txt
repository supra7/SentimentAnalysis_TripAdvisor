Location: The hotel is relatively small and situated literally a five minute walk away from the Termini Railway Station. I flew into Ciampino and was able to take a bus direct to the station for 6 euros. The colloseum, Spanish steps, Trevi fountain and Roman Forums are all within easy walking distance. The hotel is situated on a quiet road, so there was no trouble with noise. There isn't really much of an atmosphere in this part of Rome however and finding a happening spot to have a drink in the evening involved a journey. Nearby there are couple of good restaurants - I can recommend la Gallina Bianca, which seemed popular with the locals and Cotto Ristorante, which is very trendy with excellent service. The hotel itself I thought was quite pricey - 120 pounds per night for what we got. The room was small, with a monitor-sized flat screen TV. There was a mini-bar. The bathroom was clean and both the room and bathroom were well decorated with everything in good working order. I understand the hotel is in the process of creating roof-top bar, but I don't know when that will be finished. Breakfast was dismal, with terrible coffee, foul tasting orange squash and plastic cheese. There are chipolata sausages, cold scrambled eggs and very fatty bacon if you can stomach it. The service was pretty good and the blokes who work on the front desk were amusingly helpful.

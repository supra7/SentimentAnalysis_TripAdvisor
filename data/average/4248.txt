Stayed at this property for three nights for a conference. Based off its Tripadvisor rating would not have stayed here, unless designated as the Conference location. Booked a Tower room in advance as based on previous reviews those rooms had been recently updated and reviewed well. Upon check in was told they were "over booked" and they placed me in a 9th floor King room with an attached suite. Really, as a solo traveler i didn't need a big suite, and truly all I did was walk through the suite when I came and left. My King room was small, with a poor functioning AC. Bathroom was even smaller. I was let down to have a room as was described in other poor reviews. It was fine, but not what i had paid for. This room had standard tube tv, (not the plasma that the tower rooms have) and was just old and tired. The rooms don't have wireless internet and cost 12 dollars a day. I believe you can get wireless access in the lobby for free. The plus is the location of the hotel..great for everything in Boston and the people that work are very nice. I would not pay full fare to stay here, but if you win on Priceline or get a good rate through AAA, or some other consolidator it may not be too bad. If I return to Boston for any kind of travel I will not be staying here. It needs to get catch up to the year 2010 and get up to speed.

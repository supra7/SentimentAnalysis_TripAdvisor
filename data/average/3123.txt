Firstly location this hotel is convenient for the airport and the tower block next to it but if your office is on hong kong island forget it. 45 mins bracing death in a local taxi just to get to work in the morning is just too far. There is a shopping centre next to the hotel but that's it everywhere is a taxi ride so net result you feel miles from anywhere. The hotel itself is cool hip and trendy. However not being able to buy wifi in the room is a pain. You have to goto somewhere buy a card, goto the room type in the card. Who has time for that. The rooms themselves are beautiful ultra trendy and cool. But at night don't expect the room to be dark as even with all the lights off the switches emit enough light to disturb you. Bed is amazing very confortable, rain shower us great. Bliss toilteries are a nice touch. Pool is nice amazing view but take up your bath towel as the pool man religiously stops any pool towels leaving the pool area. Which is great as you are dripping wet in the way back to the room. I ate at kitchen which was good but there werent many other dining options in the hotel. Overall this is a great hotel but there are a couple of niggles that stop this being an amazing hotel. Maybe w hotels aren't for me but having stayed in many top hotels on hong kong island my view is there are much better hotels for your money in hk.

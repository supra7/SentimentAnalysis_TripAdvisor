The Palmer House Hilton clearly has a lot of history. It's also in a great location: a very short walk from the Adams/Wabash and the Madison/Wabash train stops, a biscuit toss from the Art Institute and Millenium Park, and surrounded by many good dining options. The hotel itself is attractive and is staffed by very pleasant, competent people. My room was high enough (the 16th floor) and well enough sound-proofed that I could barely hear the L train, though the train went by below my window. My disappointments with my room were minor. First, there was no in-room coffee maker. That made the mornings harder than I would have liked. Second, the wallpaper, carpet, and bathroom fixtures were showing their age a bit. The leaky faucet wasn't audible with the bathroom door closed, but I would have preferred that it not drip. And, as at other large downtown hotels, I had to pay extra for wifi in my room. I hate that. Still, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the room was quiet, so I slept very well there. I was at the Palmer House for a conference and I found the conference facilities fine. The rooms in which our sessions were held were not all beautiful, but they were all adequate and *some* were indeed beautiful. There are few windows in the conference rooms, and I found the absence of natural light a little depressing. Not much to be done about that, though. The business center was frustrating. I ultimately gave up on using the printer because it appeared to require the use of a code, but I couldn't tell what I was supposed to use as the code (my room number didn't work, and there were no codes posted anywhere).

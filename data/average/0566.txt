Nice hotel - nothing extraordinary - room clean, spacious; no bathrobe for us mere mortals; no view from the room (across an office building; below the ceiling of another building). Door was knocked when the staff tried to deliver a bathrobe to me by mistake, so a bit fuzzy - the snacks available as part of "minibar" were out of date but wouldn't have had them anyway so didn't really mind though it gives a bad impression somewhat. Location pretty central, shopping areas and market by the shore within walking reach, next to the financial district so pretty tranquil. Checked in too early and could not get a room, once returned to the desk, had to queue again and do most of the checking anew though promised a simple key fetch so was disappointed at that point. My room had no free internet which these days is often complimentary so that's another disadvantage. But room was quiet and big enough. Might consider staying there again, but not necessarily, though nothing really to complain about big time.

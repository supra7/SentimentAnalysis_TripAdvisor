I have always wanted to stay at a W Hotel and we got the opportunity to when we booked with Priceline for one night after our cruise. I was disappointed by several factors: hotel is very dark (hallways). Condition of the room was really beat up inlcluding banged up furniture and dirty dust ruffle. Lobby is very small. Location is very good for walking to anything in downtown Seattle. If you can get it for cheap on Priceline, then go for it, but wouldn't pay full price for this one.

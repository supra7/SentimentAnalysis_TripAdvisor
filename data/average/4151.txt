I booked a King Deluxe room and that was not what I got based on the description and pictures. I had to scoot sideways between the bed and dresser just to get thru. The hotel was overrun with foreign college students who were blocking the entrance with their smoking, who hijacked both the main elevators and service elevators, and who just made getting around difficult. As I was checking in and out, they would come right up to the reception desk, interrupt and demand service. Thank goodness the reception staff told them they were with a guest and to go get in line. My room was 90 degrees and the heat wasn't even on - I had to sleep with the window open because the hotel could do nothing about it and the A/C wasn't "in season." With the window open at night all I heard was the noise of sirens and screaming drunk people - needless to say I didn't really sleep for the 2 nights I was there. This was my second stay at the Park Plaza, and was the last. Even though it is convenient to activities in Boston, it's not worth the aggravation.

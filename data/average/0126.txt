I was in Seattle for five days for a convention in Nov 05. Booked this hotel, very near the convention site and very convenient to downtown Seattle for about a third of what the "convention rate" rooms were going for. After I booked the hotel, I read some of the reviews here and began to question my choice. True: my room was small - bed, TV, table, chair, two lamps, dresser, and bathroom (no alarm clock, fridge, or microwave) - but I was warm at night (despite the not-so-great heater), had hot water, reliable wake-up calls, and the room was clean. False: excessive noise, peeling paint, unfriendly staff. Realistic expectations are important: if you want a place with a great location on a limited budget, stay at King's Inn. If you want all the ammenities, the company of more "sofisticated" hotel guests, continental breakfast... - pay a little more for your comfort and peace of mind.

This is a mid range hotel. It's a fair distance from the centre city (though there is an easy bus connection) but useful if one is working in the area. Room was clean, though in need of some updating (repainting is going on throughout the hotel). Rooms have a bar fridge, phone, TV (limited selection of channels in English). A couple of downsides: (1) The AC is centrally controlled and I found at times the room was very cold. Even though this is Singapore, you may want to have a sweater and a hot water bottle for your bed! (2) There aren't many restaurants in the area. There is a large restaurant in the hotel itself BUT it focuses on a buffet and one can order from the menu only during certain, fairly limited, hours.

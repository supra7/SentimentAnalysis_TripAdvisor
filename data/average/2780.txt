This hotel is walking distance from Hollywood Blvd but not close to the rest of the tourist area in LA. The hotel is clean, basic, no restaurant/bar, no big lobby, attentive service, the room is spacious, beds are comfortable, restroom is ok. Overall it's good value for your money specially in that area of LA where hotels are very expensive.

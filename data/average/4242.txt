This was our first stay at Park Plaza. It would be hard to have a better location: a half block from the public garden and all the shopping of Boylston and Newbury streets. Just a short walk to Trinity Church (a must see), Copley Place, Prudential Center. The hotel is quite lovely - spacious lobby, lounge, and numerous restaurants. We splurged for a concierge level room (they call it the tower level) at a conference rate of $365 per night, including tax, so quite expensive I think. Our room was spotlessly clean, the king bed was very comfortable, and the large flat screen TV worked ok. The bathroom was miniscule. In fact we could not open the door all the way, because the toilet blocked the door! And the bathtub has this very strange gel-like padding on the bottom. It made for a rather dangerous shower, since you had to worry about keeping your balance. Just don't close your eyes, or you might fall over! The size of the room and bathroom are typical of older, historic hotels. But this bathroom was REALLY teeny. The concierge level had a nice lounge that served an ok breakfast and a nice afternoon snack with a cash bar. Overall the Park Plaza is an ok place to stay. Just don't expect a large room like you might get at the newer hotels. It's an historic building. Great staff, very accomodating.

We chose this hotel on the basis of location, price and the excellent TA reviews. The first 2 were as expected but overall the service and rooms did not quite live up to expectations. When we arrived, tired and carrying luggage, the lady on reception was in the middle of explaining something to another set of guests. She asked us to wait and we stood waiting for about 15 mins - which is fine and which we're not complaining about: we realise that's how queues work. But then when _we_ had just started to check in, someone without a booking came in to ask about spare beds for the evening. Instead of finishing dealing with us first, the receptionist promptly stopped and proceeded to spend a good 15 minutes discussing hostel options with new arrival. Overall, it took us almost 3/4 hour to check in and we were pretty unimpressed with the welcome. That having been said, the man on reception on the day we checked out was very friendly helpful, so it wasn't all bad on the service front. The room was clean and not as noisy as we had feared given the central location and modern walls. However, it was small (certainly smaller than I have stayed in previously in Madrid or Barcelona in this price range) and the air con unit struggled with the temperature. Also, the bed was a bit thin and it wasn't possible to prevent the shower water from spilling onto the bathroom floor. Finally, as others have mentioned, the storage space is inadequate. The breakfasts were adequate but limited in range. Overall given the choice of places in Barcelona and the welath of special deals on offer, we wouldn't choose this place again.

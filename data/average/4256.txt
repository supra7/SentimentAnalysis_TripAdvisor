This hotel is in a great location. However, the hotel rooms need to match the lobby by being updated. The furniture looked like it was taken from a garage sale or off someone's curb. The bathrooms need to be updated and looked dirty even though it was clean. The woodwork was very worn and looked dirty as well as the wallpaper being torn in spots. The heating and windows need to be replaced with more efficient ones since there was a horrible draft and the thermostat needed to be turned up to accomodate the draft. You could hear everything going on outside as it was noisy. The bellmen and parking attendants were very friendly and helpful.

My boyfriend and I just stayed one night in the Sheraton. We were down for a Seahawks game and had previously stayed in the hyatt across the street. Obviously the Sheraton wasn't up to the level as the hyatt but overall we don't have really any complaints. Upon arrival they had us in a double bed room but we're happy to change us to a king bed room. The room was clean and a nice size. The bathroom was nothing special but clean. The Starbucks coffee in the room was a nice plus and we appreciate having wine glasses in the room as well. The pool on the top floor didn't have as nice of view as I thought it would. I didn't go in the gym area but it looked huge and full of nice equipment. We had forgotten toothpaste and the front desk was happy to send someone up with some, probably only took about ten minutes. If you're looking for someone really nice to stay I wouldn't suggest it but of you're just down a night or two and need somewhere to stay it'll do the trick

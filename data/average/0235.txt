This was my second stay at the Mayflower. The first time (December 2009) I had a double room which was a reasonable size and value for money - we got a late deal through Expedia. On this stay, the service was good, the staff polite, friendly and helpful. Check in and out was quick and easy. However, the twin room I'd booked was cramped, the hairdryer had a dodgy connection and the toiletries in the bathroom were not great. The standard probably hasn't changed from my first stay and my comments are all made in relation to the amount I paid for the room on each occasion. The first visit was a good deal, the second quite a bit more expensive and I therefore didn't feel I was getting value for money - hence the three stars.

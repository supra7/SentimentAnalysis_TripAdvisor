Location good, rooms good. However, when we tried to check in early the day before our flight home, we were told that there were only a limited number of family suites and none were available, even though they were checking other people in right and left. The girl took my cell phone number to call as soon as a room was ready but promply forgot me. I arrived at regular check in time and had to wait in line about 15 min. only to be told they only had 1 room on the bottom floor ready (we had requested an upper floor), she did comp our rental car parking fee as I complained it would only be on their lot a few hours as we were returning it that evening. My big complaint was that even though we paid more for a family suite, we were given the furthest room, in the furthest wing, as far away as possible from the main hotel. WE FELT LIKE VERY UNWANTED GUESTS, and it was very inconvenient to walk such a long way to reach the rest of the hotel facilities.

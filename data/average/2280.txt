We planned a last minute trip to Key West with my parents for the first week in January 2012. As you can imagine, it was not easy finding an available property at the last minute, but I had waited because my elderly father had been ill from leukemia / chemotherapy treatements and not able to travel. However, he had gone into remission, was feeling better and had his doctor's blessing to travel. He wanted to go to Key West. So I looked and looked online at the available properties and finally decided on this one. I also called ahead and explained I was travelling with elderly parents and needed a 2 bedroom suite with no stairs. Cons: They put us in a 2 bedroom "townhouse" that had a "lift" that would take my parents from the ground floor to their bedroom on the 2nd floor. The unit was on the 2nd floor, so we entered the unit doorway and walked up a flight to our living room. My parent's bedroom was on the 2nd floor. Our bedroom was on the 3rd floor. I was very disappointed to find out our unit only had a small refrigerator / microwave and coffee machine like you would find in motel room. There was no "kitchen" -- no sink, no oven. I asked to be moved to a ground unit with a full kitchen, but was told the ground units only had 1 bedroom, so we would have to get 2 units with no credit for the unit we had paid for. There was a "beach" area, but no access to the water. The front desk was not very knowledgeable about area attractions/ restaurants -- they told me the Sarabeth's in Key West was not affiliated with the Sarabeth's in New York -- it was. They didn't know anything about the sunset cruises on the sailboats either, but gave me a number to call. Pros: The grounds were beautiful and well kept. The "townhouse" was nicely decorated and clean. I did like the balcony views over the pools and gardens. The breakfast in the outdoor cafe, although of limited variety, was adequate and reasonably priced. The location was convenient to downtown.

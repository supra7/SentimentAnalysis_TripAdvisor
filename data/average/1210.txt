I was laid over in Seattle due to Tropical Storm Irene and moved from the Comfort Inn to Double Tree for better accommodations. The hotel was supposedly full but a room was made available around 11:30 AM on Aug 28. I reserved two nights, since the earliest available flights left around 11:30 PM on Aug 29. My room had a faint smoky odor that was irritating to me, so I requested a change within a few minutes, and was moved to another room which seemed better, though it had a strong deodorizer smell. When I came back a few hours later, the deodorizer had worn off and the smoky/musty smell was more apparent. But I decided it was not worth complaining again, since I would only be sleeping there one night. The hotel employee told me that sometimes people smoke outside and the smell gets into the room. But I find that hard to believe. One reason I moved to this hotel was for the free internet terminals in the lobby, which I needed in order to rebook my flight. But, most of the time all four of them were busy - I don't think four terminals are sufficient for a hotel of this size. Eventually, I was able to find a free terminal after 11 PM and was able to rebook my flight for the next morning (Aug 29). Aside from the air quality, the room was better than the Comfort Inn. I did not get a chance to try the breakfast. When I checked out (at 5:45 AM on Aug 29), I was forced to pay a $50 early checkout fee. Had I known this, I would have only reserved one night at a time. I doubt my travel insurance will cover this fee. I feel like I got cheated, since this room would obviously have been vacant anyway. For this reason, I do not plan to stay at this hotel again.

We've stayed at the Seattle Marriott Airport Hotel a couple of times in the last month. We found the staff and the hotel rooms always pleaseant and helpful. Unfortuneatly, the restaurant does not live up to expectations. Breakfast was good but service was lousy. Avoid the fish and chips - it's the first restaurant where I've been served what I call "artificial fish" or processed fish meat instead of filets. I can recommend the hotel but not the restaurant.

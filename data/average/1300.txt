Not That Bad It's not that it is a bad resort, but it is not 5 star. I would say a 3 star plus. The rooms are very basic but we had no problems in buildings 1 and 2. We thought the food was good and could not complain. We ate at the steakhouse 3 times and it was very good, it may not be alberta beef but the flavor was great. We ate lunch at the beach buffet and it was always good and breakfast at the main buffet was fine too. Apparently since we left, there was a fire in the buffet restaurant,not sure how much damage. The service was very good in all departments. The y have a make-shift casino and disco right now. The new casino will be open in about 2 months. We played in the casino, blackjack and texas holdem. The machines paid quite well, but pretty old. The entertainment will improve, they have only been there a short time, but they did a pretty good job. We didnt't have any problem with the beach and had a great time in the ocean. It was windy everyday, but that could have been a lifesaver because it was hot.If you want a 5 star, pay the extra money and go to DREAMS, just a short walk up the beach, its very nice, but we got the holiday we paid for. We went on the Carribean Festival tour, it was fun. Deep sea fishing was enjoyable, with gravol, but saw no fish. We also went on the Monster Truck Safari which was great and very informative. American money is all you need. We had Leoni as our Sunquest rep and she was very helpful. We had a great time, if you get a smokin price you should go, otherwise I'd give it a little time.

Like some of the other reviewers, I stayed at the Intercontinental during a business conference. PLUSSES: Clean room, with a very comfortable king-sized bed with great pillows. Nice bathroom with granite counters, enough hot water and towels provided. Excellent concierge service (especially a nice young man named Tate) who can direct you to restaurants, walking/jogging paths, parks, shopping, etc. A complimentary shuttle service to nearby places, though you may need to wait a while for it to arrive. Excellent food and service at a lunchtime meeting catered by the hotel. Large variety of restaurants within walking distance. Nice breakfast buffet that gets you in and out quickly. MINUSES: Not up to the standards of other Intercontinental hotels, somewhat dated decor, especially in common areas, as others have stated. VERY inconsistent service in the dining room and lounge areas. On a Friday night with a 1/3 filled restaurant, it took us 2 hours to complete a mediocre dinner due to nonexistent waitstaff. The excuse given by management was "we didn't know we'd be so busy." "Free" appetizers at "happy hour" in the lounge do not exist after the first tray is consumed by the conference attendees and other hotel guests, unless you complain to the management. SUMMARY: A comfortable, fairly quiet room. Good concierge services. Don't eat at the restaurant for dinner unless you have lots of time and don't want to walk to a local restaurant. I didn't mind the dated decor, but it isn't what I expected from Intercontinental.

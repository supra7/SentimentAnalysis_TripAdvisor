Upon checking in, we were not asked if we wanted a twin or double bed or if we want a smoking level. Ended up with a smoking level with 2 twin beds. Imagine the shock for my parents and myself who is travelling with my fiance. Location of hotel is not optimal. Nearest MTR is Ngau Tau Kok which is a 15mins walk for my family. Not near to any places worth seeing and imagine after a tired day out, one still gotta walk 15mins back to the hotel..it greatly dampens our mood. Though staffs are considered quite good and cheerful for Hong Kongers, but sorry..definitely wont stay over again.

This is the second time I've stayed here, because every other hotel was sold out or a small fortune. I tried to save my company a few bucks. I didn't love it last time, when the room I checked into wasn't clean and I didn't love it this time when the room I checked into had two bathrooms - super weird and creepy. I asked to change my room, the manager first told me to shut the second bathroom door, before accommodating my request. All this place needs is a few renovations, including new bathrooms and new room doors and maybe it wouldn't be half bad. And it might not have seemed as bad if I was traveling with somebody, but being a woman traveling alone, this place is two for two in terms of creeping me out. In the future, I'll definitely book in advance when I can and stay at the Westin or Back Bay Hotel.

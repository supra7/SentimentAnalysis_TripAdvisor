The hotel is beautiful, and there is definitely some benefit to staying at a place with No Casino (no smoking, no indigents, classier environment). Our suite was lovely; but they only have King Sized Beds (according to their front desk). Many nice amenities; free internet, really really fast elevators, great morning brunch, free valet parking. Watch out for drunks at the pool-for a lovely quiet place, the pool staff doesn't care who's been "overserved"--this isn't the partying type of place. Mainly---Be Careful!!! We usually just do 'express check-out', but since we were waiting for our car anyway, we stopped in front to check out in person. They tacked on an additional $560.00 charge!!!!!!! If we hadn't read our bill carefully, we would have gotten stuck--as it was we asked the receptionist for an explanation, and after a few minutes of hesitation, he agreed to speak with the manager---and they took off the unknown charges. With No Explanation. Our impression is--they probably pull this on business travelers all the time; so make sure to pay attention to your bill!

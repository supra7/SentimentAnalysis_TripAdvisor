Hotel is in a great location, but for the supposed quality and history of service the hotel advertises, we were very disappointed and discouraged from ever staying here again. First thing we noticed upon arriving is there are an unusual amount of hidden fees that are standard in most hotels of this supposed quality. Things such as shuttle : - service to and from the airport is $17 per person. - Internet connection is $11 per day to have in your room, and it is strictly from a ether port connection. NOT WIRELESS! iPads, blackberries, or any other modern Internet device is unable to be used. - If using the business center to access the Internet, you are charged $7.95 for 15 minutes and there were only 2 working older, computers that are on an unsecured connectiion. - Room service was adverstised as 24 hours but ends at 11pm. -Trying to reach the front desk or anyone else for that matter to address a concern was difficult. Phone would ring with no answer. - Alarm clock did not work, and was not replaced per our request. - No express checkout. Great location, historic, but does not keep in step with what the moderate traveler has come to expect from a hotel of the supposed caliber at this price point. Very expensive for such little amenities and low service. Would not recommend !!!!

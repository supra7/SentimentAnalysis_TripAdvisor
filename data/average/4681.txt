My family just returned from a 3-night stay at this hotel. It's central to everything and we had room 1701 with 2 queen beds, perfect for 2 adults with 2 kids. However, I woke up the 2nd day with large red bumps on my arm and initially thought they were mosquito bites, which seemed odd for a chilly October 23rd in Chicago, and I was wearing a coat and sweaters all the time. By the next day they had swelled, itched horribly and had open sores. I realized that they were not mosquito bites. I showed my bites to the front desk staff at check out and suggested they investigate for bed bugs. The first reaction from the staff person was "I can guarantee you we don't have bed bugs" and "could I possibly have sensitive skin?" I assured her I didn't have sensitive skin and asked her if she was prepared to personally guarantee that the room is free of bed bugs, and she then changed her tune and asked if I wanted to write a report. She offered me antibiotic ointment which I gladly accepted (I was itching like made). I've googled pics of bed bug bites and mine match them exactly. Ewwwwwww. Sure hope she makes good and files that report with management.

Love the lobby!! Love the historical value!! Love the old world feel!! Gorgeously decorated for Christmastime!! Sadly the rooms were a bit under par for Hilton. & the housekeeping wasn't quite up to usual... Stayed for 3 nights & 2 of the 3 days had to call down to have the room cleaned (3pm). The fitness center is extremely clean & machinery was state of the art. Disappointing that robes weren't available for the steam room..... & the spa is 4 floors away....the massage therapists are amazing though!! Not sure if the rest of the staff was just over-worked b/c of the holiday or just underwhelmed in general.

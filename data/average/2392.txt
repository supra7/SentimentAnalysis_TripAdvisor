Hostel prices in Sydney are pretty steep, with many of them focused around Kings Cross. If you are travelling with one other person And prefer private/twin rooms, then this might be the accommodation for you. It will cost you roughly the same price as a 2 person room in a hostel, but it is quieter and you will have your own ensuite and tv in the room. However while it is clean, it is one of those places where the furniture hasn't been updated for 20years and the staff are generally never around did you have an issue (but they do give you a mobile num to call them). Wifi Internet is extra costing $5 a day or $20 a week. It's a 5 minute walk to kings cross but thankfully not in the middle of it like some hostels. Trust me when I said the place is a nightmare at the weekends! Unless of course that's what you're looking for!

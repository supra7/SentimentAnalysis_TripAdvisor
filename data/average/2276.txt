Nice grounds, friendly staff, big room w a nice porch, 4 pools surrounded by amazing lush greenery but the overall hotel location left a lot to be desired, especially when you're looking for keys charm. It's located quite a ways from downtown, across from a Walgreens/Home Depot shopping center (where you'll most likely have to park because their lot is packed), just off the overseas highway so you can hear cars whizzing by, and on the bay w no water access as it's elevated...the waterfront "beach" area was depressing really, made me wish I had spent the extra money and stayed at Southernmost. If you want to see a beautiful sunset, you'll need to head downtown as there are powerlines ruining the view.

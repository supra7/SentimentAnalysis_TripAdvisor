Traveled alone, so I booked a single room on-line for one night. Room was clean, but very small and spartan, with no view. Very old building which has been re-habbed. One elevator, which holds only 4 people if they don't have baggage. Free continental breakfast was acceptable, but not great. Small bathroom, but everything worked OK. Staff not unfriendly, but not overly helpful either. My reservation was in order; I arrived at 10 am and they gave me my room right then--a big plus as they originally told me I had to wait until 2 pm. Great location, only 1/2 block from the Rambla and easy walking distance from Plaza Catalunya. One free computer in the lobby, but always busy whenever I passed by it--they didn't seem to have posted time restrictions for use. Paid 80 euros for a Saturday night pre-paid stay. Would probably not return due to the very small room.

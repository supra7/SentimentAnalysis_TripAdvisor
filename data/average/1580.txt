Lovely decor, although the room is very cramped, especially if you have more than one suitcase. Overpriced despite position. Air-con controls seemed to have no effect and often got stale cigarette smoke through the vent from other areas of the hotel. Cold breakfast was pretty poor for a hotel claiming 4 star status. (Ask to have a fresh coffee made on the machine rather than use their filter coffee.) Fantastic being so close to Trevi Fountain although makes area very busy, especially when taking luggage to end of street to get taxi. Porters were great but front reception staff were pretty unhelpful. No help when internet access in our room not working so we refused to pay for it. They were a little arrogant actually. Worst of all, bad drainage in shower and sink. Not sure if this is all Rome plumbing or just this hotel but if you don't mind showering in ankle deep dirty, soapy water, book here.

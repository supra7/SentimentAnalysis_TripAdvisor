As I am a Gold Starwood member, I was able to procure an upgrade to the top floors. What a view. As with all downtown lodging everything costs... $5 for a bottle of water, $6 for a bag of M&M's.... No wifi unless you want to pay $14... and parking @ $43 a day.... yikes. BUT if you want to stay smack downtown, within a short walk to Pikes Market place, this is as good as it gets. We took advantage of their concierge, a totally pretentious kid named Adam, he did not listen and proffered his agenda and interests. I agree with other posters who say the staff is not overly friendly.

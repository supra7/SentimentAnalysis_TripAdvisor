Handy location and walkable to pikes peak Market, monorail for space needle. Hotel is 40 years old and rooms need upgrading. Air con unit in our room was very original and was so loud that we couldn't have it on at night, the toilet flush was broken and the shower control was missing parts. That combined with a very small bathroom and generally small room, made the price seem not good value. The staff (front desk, bell boy, concierge) were all excellent- friendly and helpful.

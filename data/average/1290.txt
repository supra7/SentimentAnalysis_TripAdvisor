From a Travel Agent, just be informed and understand. I stayed at the Colony Bay as part of a Travel Agent Conference April 10-17th 2008.People have to remember that the property has not been open very long and was in a rush to even open when they did. As a Travel Agent I am telling you that your Agent (if you used one) should have told you this and prepared you. I personally don't sell properties that have been open for less than a year without knocking off 1 usually 2 stars.At this point it is DEFFINATELY NOT a five star. Probably closer to a 3.5The staff is wonderful and they try very hard. The resort is clean and the food is decent.It is cozy and unlike the massive properties in the DR there are only about 200 rooms.It is in Uvero Alto NOT BAVARO so yes the tide is a little rough but still nice to lay out on and you can walk it without being crowded, just be careful swimming.As long as you are informed as to what you are getting this is a nice property to get away for a week and relax. If you are told its a five star right now they are wrong, maybe one day, but not right now.

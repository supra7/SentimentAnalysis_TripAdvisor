I paid 74+tax thru priceline, got the free upgrade to Deluxe City view room. The hotel and the room looks decent. It was also nice to be able to bring along my Chihuahua for free. The experience went downhill from here. First the toilet won't flush, and then there's noises here and there thru out the whole night which prevents me and my girl friend from getting any quality sleep. I express my concern when I check in regarding the noises on the first floor and was assure that it won't be an issue. Overall it's bearable for what I pay for, Now I will have to figure out how to avoid this hotel on priceline the next timeI want to stay in the Seattle Area.

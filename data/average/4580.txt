To me this was your typical big chain hotel. Clean, basic amenities, comfortable bed, lots of towel, standard room layout with spartan decor. The hotel did its job without being overly memorable. Good location if you want to stay within walking distance of both the theater district and some of the big tourist attractions. The biggest plus was its proximity to The Littlest Bar - simply the finest Irish drinking establishment in the country.

Two large, tall towers containing rooms attached at base by a few floors in common. The room, on the concierge floor (or one of them), was large with a good view. Resto, bar areas were enjoyable with fine food/drink. The common areas such as these, plus the main lobby is constantly jammed: the convention centre is less than a block away and conventions are obviously a large source of business here...usually three lines to check in each about 15-20 deep every afternoon. Our biggest problem was we needed the internet and the Sheraton's system (newly installed we were told) kept going offline..either the part where you had to identify yourself as a guest (and thus get free internet service) or the whole internet feed itself (the last three days we were there). Staff seemed to have no idea when anything would be fixed..just that IT was working on it. Loads of complaints voiced loudly in the bar area!! The concierge lounge was too small given the number of business travellers trying to use it, and the waitstaff keep the coffee and soft drinks hidden away, then bring them out to you with a piece of paper asking for your name, room and place to indicate a tip. Unlike most hotels of this level, coffee/tea/softdrinks were not available outside of lounge meal times. Despite a sign outside the lounge blocking children from entering (at all not just at drink times), breakfasts had screaming kids and one day at drinks a child was present. Really inappropriate we thought. So a good stay if you're at a convention, but shop elsewhere if just touring: Seattle is on the small side with good transportation so other hotels are equally or more convenient--although we did enjoy the rooftop glass enclosed pool.

I am shocked that the restaurant got such good reviews. I ate there twice & both times it was unbelievably bad! Without a car, options were limited. The french fries were raw, the toasted bread was burnt & they do not have enough service personnel. The asian salad had huge blocks of carrots & dressing that was terrible! My room was clean & comfortable.

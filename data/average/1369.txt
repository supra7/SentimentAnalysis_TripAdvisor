hotel charges $20 for parking - unusual for an airport location, but they did have a garage, so i guess i see the expense. and at least you had in-out access I was able to get a rate of $40 on a priceline bid - so i guess i cant complain too much pros nice rooms quiet very close to airport will be right beside the new rail line opening this year - easy access to downtown great fitness center cons pay for internet use and parking

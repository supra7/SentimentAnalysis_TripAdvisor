Obviously been a grand hotel in it's heyday, BUT, that was a long tome ago. The pictures are great but it's quite a bit shabbier in reality. Plus Point, the staff were really friendly and gave " GOOD OLD AMERICAN SERVICE ". I HAVE STAYED IN PLACES A LOT WORSE BUT I REALLY DID EXPECT BETTER IN AMERICA.

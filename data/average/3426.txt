We checked in to this hotel because we had a 12-hour stop in Singapore (bad flight connection) and we were too tired to venture into the main part of Singapore for an alternative hotel. The hotel was clean, surprisingly quiet considering your room view is of moving airplanes and is very close to the three main terminals, it might even be considered to be in Terminal 3? Since our stop in Singapore was less than 24-hours our checked baggage was left with the airline, i.e. checked in all the way, so we just had to worry about hand luggage once we got off the plane. It took 15 mins to stroll from our plane seat to the hotel reception. Check-in was quick and efficient and the room was large, with good range of TV channels and all the basic toiletries were provided. After a sleep, we dined in the all day restaurant because we knew the food options available in Singapore airport are limited. Between us, we tried an Asian style and American style but were rather disappointed with both. The food was functional - that was about it. Overall the hotel served its purpose and we would check-in again if we had the need for a stopover hotel.

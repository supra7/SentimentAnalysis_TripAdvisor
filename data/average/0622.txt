We stayed here for one night because of its proximity to Lake Union - we were on our way to Victoria on Kenmore Air and all other hotels on the lake were booked or very pricy due to a marathon that was held in the city the same weekend. We took the train into town from the airport for $2.75, got off at the last stop, and walked about 2-3 blocks to the hotel - so it's easy and inexpensive to get to from the airport. The hotel staff was pleasant and the room was pretty quiet - some squeaking floors from the people walking above us, but they thankfully retired pretty early. Ate breakfast in the restaurant, which opens at 7:00, but they saw us at the door at about 6:45 and let us in early and gave us some of that wonderful Seattle coffee. We took a taxi to Lake Union - about $7 - but there is a nearby streetcar that also runs out there.

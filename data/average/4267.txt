This is a very difficult one to write. The location is great, central and one minute from the subway. It could be so much better. Check in was good, no waiting. We were told the floor our room was on and pointed towards the lifts. This suits us, but there were two bell boys standing around doing nothing and watched us pass them. The room was really nice but the bathroom is tiny. Far too small for such a grand looking hotel. The bed though was huge and really comfortable. We asked reception / concierge for advice a few times but not great unfortunately. The room could do with a coffee machine which would be a welcome addition. We left with mixed views. Very comfortable bed but the tiny bathroom was disappointing.

The Hilton Garden Inn has a great location to the inner harbor and only a 15 minute walk to the convention center., and many of the great local restaurants and nightlife. At 179.00 per night, the rooms were ver y nice as well as clean. Overall, the property is quite nice. As a Hilton Diamond member, I was a bit disapointed that the room was not ready when we arrived nor did they offer any free breakfast coupons for valued customers. The morning and afternoon staff was very nice but the evening staff sincerely needs some help. Oh, and cell service within the hotel does not work. You have to go outside the building to make a call. Due to the location, and cleanliness of the hotel, I would reccomend.

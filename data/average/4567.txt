Just returned from an over night at the Hyatt. I have been staying here for several years and have always been pleased with nlocation and the room itselfl. I do understand though why poeple that are paying full price complain. They used to deliver your paper to the door but now have stopped that. They also used to have complementary coffee for the early riser in the lobby but that was also discontinued. The staff is responsive to your requests but most of mine have not been carried out. One time I needed a roll away bed and that took four phone calls. This trip I needed a tooth brush sent up and that never arrived. I arrived early and understood that a room was not ready at that time, but after walking around for an hour and a half and waiting for them to call I checked with them and they said they would "rush" a room for me. I waited another hour or so and no phone call, so I went back to the hotel and checked with the desk. A room was ready now. I put my stuff in and then left. About half an hour after this, the desk called and said my room was now ready. On another stay, I requested a room with two beds and was given a king. Upon complaining, I was told I "requested" two beds, but "reserved" a king. Also some of the concierge staff is wonderful and knowledgeable. (all were polite) Some however have very little knowledge of Boston.

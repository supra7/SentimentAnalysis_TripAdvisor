I asked a local acquaintance to recommend a boutique hotel for my first trip to Dubai. They laughed! But we found this place, and it worked well - not ideal, but it worked well. First, the location's good - my geography's not good, but we rarely got stuck in traffic and could always get a taxi, and I understand that's not typical for Dubai. Second, it's a beautiful property (I suspect it's 4 villas put together) and the rooms are large and although simple are tastefully decorated. Third, the food is off-the-scale super, as you'd expect from the (all-girl) French management. Four, it's within strolling distance of a very pleasant public beach. Five, the internet works, and it's on LAN not wi-fi so it's reliable and fairly fast. Finally, it's much less expensive than the gin-palaces around Dubai. The negatives? They don't [--] well take credit cards, so you have to wire money ahead, or pay with wads of cash. Unbelievable in the 21st century! There's no tea/coffee facilities in the room, which I consider almost a basic human right for a hotel-dweller. And you need to pick your room carefully - the first one we were offered had a view of a brick wall (I complained, and the staff, with a little moaning, found us another with a tree between the window and the brick wall), and some don't have internet connections. The staff were generally friendly and helpful, but could be a bit dopey - food service in the restaurant ranged from fast to painfully slow, and the check-in staff were clueless about how on earth to get money into the hotel's account. So it's not perfect, but pretty good, and unlike most of this armpit of a wannabe city, it has character, charm, and a human touch. We'll stay there again.

We stayed here between Christmas and New Year's for two days. It's in a great location, right by the Chicago River and only a few blocks from Michigan Ave. There are many restaurants and activities within walking distance. Check-in was easy. We were early but our room was ready. The suite isn't very big. More like one big room with a desk and partition dividing it. The decor was nice and the room was clean. It had one of those bathrooms where the sink is outside of the bathroom and the toilet and shower were together. I personally don't like that. I like a regular bathroom setup. Also, since there wasn't a bathtub we had to give our two year old a shower instead of a bath and that was incovenient. Not sure if other rooms have bathtubs..... The first day we were out all day and when we got back to our room, housekeeping still hadn't cleaned the room. We had to go and find them for toilet paper & towels. The second day they knocked on the room early and we told them to come back later in the day. The proceeded to knock again an hour later. Inconsistent service. All in all it was a good stay for the price we paid. I would stay there again but would find out if they have rooms with bathtubs!

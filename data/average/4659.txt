As mentioned quite frequently here, the hotel is nice. Despite having reserved 4 rooms earlier in the week, when we arrived, our rooms were not ready, which caused us to be late for our event. When I mentioned that I had the rooms reserved, the front desk person said that they were not ready because I had reserved 4 rooms (yet others were being checked in). Her attitude seemed to be that we didn't belong there anyway. Oh well, she perhaps had a bad day & we just happened to show up on her clock. The check-out person was somewhat better.

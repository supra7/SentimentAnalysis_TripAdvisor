This hotel is in a great location for travelers visiting Universal Studios. I chose it because of this and because they were offering a Florida Resident Rate of $84.00. The room was clean, beds comfortable, and quiet, however nothing special for a junior suite. The drawback was that after additional charges, the rate for 1 night ended up being $125.00 and the room was quite cramped (especially the bathroom). The price did NOT include complimentary breakfast, which is not on par with other hotels in the area.

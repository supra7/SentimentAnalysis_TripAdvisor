Stayed for 8 days on business on the top floor. Sumptuously finished, rooms are high tech and really unique. Staff were fine. Biggest issue is the lobby, or lack of one. You go up this nightclub style lift into...well nothing really. There is no focal point or heart to this hotel - it never feels like anything much more than a room the whole time I stayed. I think the concept is ineffective overall - but everything else is fine and well executed.

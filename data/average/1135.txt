We stayed at the nearby Westin Hotel for the first half of our trip to Seattle and finished the week at Hotel Max. The Westin was only mildly more expensive for the extra 1/2-star, and worth the upgrade to us in terms of space and staffing. Check-in at the Max was FOREVER with only 2 staffers and a firm check-in time (4pm). Might have been quicker if early-travelers had been given rooms first-come, first-serve. Valet Parking had the same problem. Truly, I recommend not driving in Seattle anyway since public transport is so great and the city is very walkable if you are in reasonable shape. Need another reason? How about valet-only parking at $30/nt? This was the most expensive and worst service we found in the area. Only 1 or 2 valets working the garage, so give yourself at least 15-20 mintues to get the car (in fairness, we noticed valets going on break with 2-3 couples still waiting for their cars--this was brought to the attention of management and very promptly corrected). Hotel Max was well-decorated and interesting, but the rooms had a dorm-room quality. We are small people and still had a tough time maneuvering around the room together. On the positive, the adjacent restaurant had amazing sushi rolls and martinis, we had a great view of the Space Needle from the room, the elevators were really cool (but don't forget your room key: you need it to use the lift), and the entire hotel was certainly designed well to maximize the space (or lack thereof). If you just need a place to sleep in the best shopping area near City Centre, within a brisk walk to Pike's Place Market, you're not driving around the city, and you'd rather take a shower than bathe, this hotel is unique enough to stay near the top of the list. Would we be back? A conditional yes. Only if check-in speeds up and only for a couple nights (before claustrophobia sets in).

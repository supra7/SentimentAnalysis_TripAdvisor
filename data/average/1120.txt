Nice little hotel and we mean little! The room was quite small yet very functional. It is difficult to get more than 2 people with luggage into the elevator. The art work did not impress us and the black hallways with black and white photo murals on the doors made it way too dark. The walls are very thin and we could hear the people in the next room. The restaurant and bar were very good; the service was hot and cold. Be aware that the sushi bar/kitchen closes at 11:00 despite what the in room literature says. We received a hotel special and our room was $99.00. This was a good price. The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. We would stay here again. A nice hotel with a great downtown location for a night or two.

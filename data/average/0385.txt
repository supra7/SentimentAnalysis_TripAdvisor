We stayed here 2 nights before going on a Princess Cruise to Alaska. I thought the rate was kinda steep (I think we paid $200 a night) The breakfast was good and the employees that work there were so kind and helpful. The enclosed pool/spa was nice on the top floor with a great view. Our room didn't have a memorable view. Our toilet overflowed the 2nd night. (Note to self- alway s wear flip flops or slippers in hotel rooms, you don't know whats been on the carpet.) We changed rooms with help from the bell hop. It's a large hotel and you have to wait a while for the elevators. There is a bus 1 or 2 blocks away that goes straight to the Princess terminal, which is quite far. The bus is 1.50, much cheaper than a taxi.

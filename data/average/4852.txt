I booked this last minute for business and got a great price. The hotel is centrally located downtown which makes it great for business or site seeing. I was able to check in 4 hours early, which is a big plus when you need to prepare for meetings. Breakfast at their Lockwood restaurant was good and the bar seemed to have a decent crowd. The room was very big and clean, however there was one MAJOR issue. The room smelled like mildew. I would have changed my room but I had so many meetings, I didn't have time to deal with it. I will send a note to the managers, because, had the room not smelled, I would definitely come back for business.

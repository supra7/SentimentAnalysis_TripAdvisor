For the price of deluxe room....really??? They charge $12.95 a day for internet use...only 1 bathrobe...only 1 regular coffee for single coffee maker...and no mini bar??? You had to use your card for elevator...but it was so loud in elevator we couldn't hear the stupid thing telling us to use card!! Good luck finding the lights in your room if you arrive in evening also!!

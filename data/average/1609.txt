Hotel was fine, Breakfast was good, but there are a couple of things that need to be brought to your attention. When the Kleenex box was empty in my room after just one tissue, I phoned and asked for another (this should have been checked by maid when cleaning the room before my arrival) they told me they were out and they had a truck coming in the morning. I just commented that that would not be of any help to me then. Also, when using the one remaining tissue from the box, the holder which had been pushed back into the corner of the Bathroom counter, I found a used Kleenex behind the container. That tells me something about how the maid cleaned the room and had me questioning how good a job was done on the rest of the room. I think this was a poor response to me as a customer. My thoughts: why would there have been a shortage in the first place?, and two, were all the rooms filled in the whole hotel that they couldn't have gone to an unused room and pulled the Kleenex box out for my room? I know this probably sounds trivial, but I didn't appreciate the answer, or the idea my room was not clean. You also need to know the TV stations were not always what was on the list in the room, and just going through the channels with the remote they didn't go in sequence, and several stations had poor color.

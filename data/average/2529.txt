I normally stay at the Ibis the other side of Euston Station but for various reasons on this (work) visit to London I didn't. The welcome from the staff on reception was lovely. Quick service and very chatty and welcoming. The rooms are clean, v.basic but fine for a short stay. TV worked ok, shower OK, bed OK. Didn't use any hotel facilities as was just literally sleeping there (i.e.. checked in at 8pm out at 7 am). So can't comment on bar?breakfast etc. Bit steep price wise at 109 but it is central London. I do think the 19 a night advert is a bit of a joke to be honest but I didn't have any complaints.

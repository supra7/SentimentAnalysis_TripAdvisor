This is an average hotel conveniently for Copley square shops and connected to the Hynes Convention Center by a covered walkway. Negatives aspects of my stay were a mattress that sagged in the middle, a maid who did not vacuum for several days while I was there (crumbs from my muffin stayed where they were) and bell staff who were unhelpful on arrival. On the plus side, I really liked the large swimming pool and hot tub. Overall, I thought it was an average, high volume, anonymous convention orientated hotel where a guest is treated pretty indifferently.

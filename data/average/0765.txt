I would echo the previous several reviews. It is an above average property, but nothing really deserving of the (to me anyway) high rates. I was there for a business conference, so my room was paid in a group by my company, but I would have probably tried priceline, etc, if I had been making the call. I must have been in the same room as the previous review (405?) because we had all the same problems with the fireplace, train noise, etc. We brought some of our own wine and put it in the mini-fridge, used the hotel wine glasses. The next morning after returning from breakfast, our room was made up, but we still had the same dirty wine glasses. My wife saw the cart in the hall and took a couple clean wine glasses. The mini-bar guy flagged her down and told her that his service was seperate from the maid and that we would get clean glasses later. He also let her know that the wine glasses and fridge were intended for patrons who buy MIMI-BAR wine, etc. Very snooty.

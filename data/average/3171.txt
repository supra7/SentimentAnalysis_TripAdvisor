Like other reviewers, we found the hotel to be comfortable and relatively clean. We stayed for 3 nights. We DID get smoked out in the lobby (apparently the non-smoking law goes into effect July 1, 2008). The breakfast was pretty extensive (and was included in our price). The proximity to the tram was good but the 25 minute commute was a little long. Our room seemed small, even for Novotel, with 2 adults and two young children. Overall, an average experience. Would definitely recommend a trip to Texel Island which is only about an hour's drive from Amsterdam plus a 20 min. ferry ride.

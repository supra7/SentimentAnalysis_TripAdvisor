I'll preface by saying the hotel is being renovated and should be complete in March; we stayed on an "old" floor, so take some things in stride. We went for a weekend shopping trip and booked a room because of a decent price and good location. The check-in and all interactions with the staff was excellent. They were friendly, professional, informative, helpful and always pleasant. The room seemed small at first because of the dark colors, but is really adequate with a small kitchenette & nice work area. The work station had a nice-sized desk, comfortable office chair and was well lit. I don't hear well, so if I note it, it is definitely loud. The old heat/cooling unit was rather loud (and annoying). The sirens from below bothered my wife (we were on the 14th floor). It wasn't a busy weekend, but we both heard everything in the hallway. The bed was comfortable for me, too soft for my wife. The bathroom was clean, and the rest of the room seemed okay, but had some suspicious deficiencies, such as stains on the chair, drapery, wall and ceiling (don't ask me!). The TV hutch was very dusty on top (we were going to store some purchases out of the way there...we decided against it). The carpet probably could have used a good cleaning. I'm not sure how much they've been delaying maintenance because of the renovation, so some issues might be rectified by. (To be fair, I did not contact the management about the situation). Room service is from either the Weber Grill (on the ground floor) or from Buca de Beppo (on block east). We had ribs at the Weber Grill (they were good) but that's another story. Given the service, price and location, and assuming that the renovations reduce the noise and cleanliness issues, we would recommend this property as a good base for your time in downtown Chicago.

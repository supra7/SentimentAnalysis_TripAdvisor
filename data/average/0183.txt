This was a decent hotel but there are better ones in this price range. There was a cute bag of signature Crowne Plaza goodies on the bed when I walked in--scented pillow spray, an eye pillow, CD, etc. It was a nice touch and I actually used the eye pillow and spray. The elevators took absolutely FOREVER. One of them was broken, and the hotel was pretty full, so that was definately a factor, but I was on an upper floor and I am not exaggerating, it would take 5-7 minutes for the elevator to come almost every time. Overall, this is a nice property and had no real flaws. Great location!

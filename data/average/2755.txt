My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of May. I had very high expectations of the hotel and was coming here looking forward to place that we could prepare ourselves for the next part of our holiday. First let me begin with the positives. The hotel rooms are very clean and spacious. They do provide you with either 4 or 6 complementary water bottles. They have free internet access that is quite fast, the cjeck--in process was quick with no problems at all. It has also easy and quick access to the beach. The downside of staying here is if you are in Barcelona as we were for the very first time, the hotel is really quite far away from the centre although the metro is about a 5 minutes walk away which was great - it is true based on the other reviews that it is very lonely and a walk alone can make one self-concience. Back the the hotel, the only anemities that one gets in the bathroom is a soap, shampoo and shower gel! Full stop! Not what I was expecting for a 4-Star Hotel. The other things to mention is that in the mini-bar there is nothing but the complimnetary water. For the food, should you decide to order room-service I placed an order for a hamburger. It came to me raw and col (it had not defrosted properly). I did ask them to come and replace it which they took away and re-cooked. They did not replace with a fresh one but only re-heated. The bed kept moving and we had tofigure out how to make it stable after various attempts. The breakfast we had only had one day and we thought was ok but over-priced. There are some restaurants and cafes that offered reasonable priced breakfasts outside the hotel that I would recommend that you try. All in the all, it was a very average hotel and I would not be really looking to stay there again were I to go to Barcelona again.

The hotel is clean and elegant and the rooms are well appointed. The location was great, just a few blocks from the MARTA- mass transit train. Starbucks in the building on the ground floor is very conveinient for coffe fans. My only negative remark would be the fear of impending death on the elevators. They are slow and noisy and we got stuck between floors for five minutes and the sounds from the elevator shaft where chilling as we said our prayers hoping to make it off alive. Dont ride in the 3rd elevator cab unless you like to defy death.

Booked for a few days after leaving ski vacation in Whistler to hang out in Vancouver . . . (which is the greatest city). Booked L'Hermitage after seeing the ranking on tripadvisor, so my expectations were high. I should have known that I was in trouble when the friends we were going to hang out with asked where we were staying and we got a nonplussed reaction, which is different from when I have been staying at other places which proved to be really nice. Booked 2 Bedroom Suite. The rooms and bathrooms are beyond tiny, and though "re-done," aside from the very nice Kitchen area, it is anything but first class. The hotel is close to the worst part of downtown, parking (even with the valet which is sometimes nowhere to be found) is difficult, at best . . . though the staff is always nice and tries to be helpful. If you can get over all of that . . . you are never really far from anything in Vancouver, and you are still within walking distance to many good things... but I have stayed in Vancouver several times, and I would easily preferred to spend more $ for a place which lived up to the higher ratings here.

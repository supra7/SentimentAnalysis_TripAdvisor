hotel max is in a brilliant location. only problem was a king size bed in a room the size of a cupboard was very uncomfortable. cases had to be placed on the bed as there was no room on the floor. we spent 2 days banging our legs off furniture . this should really have been a single room.the hotel was clean and friendly staff but would not go again.

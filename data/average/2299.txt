My family had a beautifully decorated and well-equipped 3-bedroom unit on their sand beach area (no access to gulf). The quality of housekeeping was poor - dirty floors, beds not made properly, kitchen not cleaned, missing supplies. The general maintenence of the unit was not well looked after - loose and falling off knobs and towel bars, quality German knife set not sharpened, Cuisinart thermal coffee maker broken through cleaning in dishwasher, missing cutlery, plates and glasses, etc. Also there is no transport service to downtown Key West which most of their competition provides.

i stayed in the hotel from Friday to monday. we arrive very late friday night to find the hotel in an area surrounded by outdoor clubs, fast food outlets and young drunk kids, mostly of the Punk variety. we did not feel safe on the train platform or walking the 200 meters to the hotel. once at the hotel it was beauitful, you cannot hear the techno music from the clubs or the sounds from the roads outside. the room was a good size, the staff were excelent, the breakfast will keep you full well into the day. during the day the surrounding area looked fine. mainly young students living and working in the area. there was some broken glass on the gound from the nights before. i would not recomend this hotel if you have young children as the drinking culture in this area is a big turnoff good hotel if your looking for cheap, comfortable hotel close to the train lines.

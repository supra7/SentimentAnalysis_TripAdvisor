The hotel is just okay. The rooms and lobby are what you would expect from a Marriott--not particularly sleek or modern but not necessarily dated or threadbare either. The elevators were super slow however and unusually crowded, in part because they were running so slowly. The best part about this hotel is the location. It's connected to the mall and is in a very central location in the Back Bay area, within close walking distance to the shops on Newbury Street and a Shaw's market--which came in handy. I also recently stayed at the Westin and to the extent the two are comparably priced, I'd recommend staying there over the Marriott. The rooms at the Westin seemed newer and the hotel didn't suffer from the slow elevator problem plaguing the Marriott.

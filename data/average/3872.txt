The room with a kitchen has a very small kitchen with very little room to move or store food. They had plenty of pots/pans to use though. If you get more than one room for your family it is not attached. You actually have to go outside of your room and use a key to go into the room for your family/children. This is not for us because they are not in the same area as us. The pool is not very big and they have nothing there for small children to play with. The hot tub is way too hot and we could not enjoy it. The building/rooms are old and smells when you come down the hall. We had to pay extra for them to come make our beds, replace towels, and take out the trash and they only came twice in a 6 day stay. We would not recommend or stay here again. It also has a view of the top of old abandoned buildings.

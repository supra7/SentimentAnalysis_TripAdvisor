From slippery/oily marble floors in the bathroom to a pile of someone else's dirty towels greeting us, first impressions were not favorable. Although housekeeping did take care of the problem, the indifference by the other hotel staff was surprising. The hotel's location is inconvenient if you are wanting to visit the casinos on the strip. In addition, no shuttle service to and from the airport is offered. For a fairly new hotel, it already looks worn, particularly the furnishings in our room. Although various amenities were offered, additional charges - above and beyond the 5-Star rates already imposed - applied to each of them. We always try to look for the positive, so here it is...the bed was comfortable and the view from the 58th floor was nice.

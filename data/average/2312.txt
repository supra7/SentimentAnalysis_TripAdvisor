Check in was a disaster here. Worst I have ever encountered and I travel for a living. We were early to standard check in time but had to wait 3 hours for room to be cleaned. Maid service very spoyyt during the stay. Could not seem to replenish the in room coffee two days in a row. Desk staff not very knowlegeable about local attractions and definitely not flexible. Accomadations were very nice and the room was clean and bright. Resort definitely needs to offer a shuttle to Duval street . You have a walk to old town or an $11 cab ride each way

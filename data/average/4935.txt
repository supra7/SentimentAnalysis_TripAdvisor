When I first checked into the Palmer House last week, my impression was very favorable. It is a beautiful hotel, well located and the room I was in was large (although the bathroom tiny). However, that was before I learned about Hilton's nickel and diming at every turn. Just a few examples. Rooms did not have coffee makers, and it cost you minimum $10 plus room service fees to get one. Late checkout was $50 and use of the exercise facilities was $18/day. I was at a conference and they wanted $120/gallon for coffee service, which is nothing short of comical. That being said, it is a decent enough place but the Hilton chain really needs to decide if this is a mid-level hotel or an upper-level one. Only then will it have a consistent product.

We are from Portland and wanted a night away and decided to stay with Hotel Max for a night. The room was really small, much smaller than expected by looking at the pictures online. It grew on us though even though the bathroom was nothing we had seen before with the shower being in it's own closet area. Front desk was amazing and provided us with a fantastic place to go for dinner. Every time we called down for something they were there to help in any way. It was about 4:00am though and the neighbors were up partying with the music turned up and screaming and laughing. We had to call the front desk a couple times to get them to be quiet but they wouldn't. By the time we were leaving at 10:00am to check out they finally started to calm down. So this kind of left a bad impression for us on this hotel. If they would have handled the situation it might have been better though. Also the valet was pretty backed up so every time we came back with our car we would have to follow them to the side alley so we never really received valet parking.

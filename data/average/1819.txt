Hotel was nice and clean. Good location. Rooms could use an update. Pools were large and did not seem crowded even though it was Spring Break. Food and beverage selection were good near pool. Great take out selection. Buffet breakfast was included with room. It would have been pricey for the selection if it had not been included.

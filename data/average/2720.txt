Room was nice- 2 bedroom, 2 bath- with an amazing view. However, note that half the rooms have a view of the parking lot. Front desk personnel were very nice, helpful and spoke fluent English. Had 1 dinner at the hotel's restaurant, which was delicious and very reasonably priced and our waitress was very sweet, but the restaurant was closed during the dinner hours the rest of the week. I understand that we were there during new ownership. There were only a few places open in town to eat during the week. The pool is fine, nothing special though. They have a water play area that children seemed to enjoy. Plenty of lounge chairs. Hotel provides towels. The beach is a public beach, which would be fine if you came with beach chairs, a cooler with food and drinks... When on vacation, I prefer to have lounge chairs on the beach and staff to take drink/food orders or at least places on the beach to purchase something. We only had hot water for 2 days - showering was not pleasant. Boiled water to wash the dishes. Really nothing to do in town but drink. Hotel has no activites. Went to Cabo Rojo lighthouse. Very pretty views and a beautiful beach, but an SUV/ jeep is recommended for the drive.

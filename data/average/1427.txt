My wife and I stayed at Le Crystal for 3 nights while she attended a conference. This hotel has many good things going for it. A great location, nice rooms, salt water pool, spa, etc. If they could tie up some loose ends, Le Crystal could be a top hotel. Here are a few things that made us wonder. We arrived and our room was hot and stuffy. The AC unit was not functioning so we had to get maintenance to work on it. They fixed it pretty quickly. We then decided to go to the pool. The young girl that was working there seemed mostly interested at looking at her laptop. At one time she went outside with another worker and it looked like they were both complaining about something. We decided to order a salad and something to drink, and waited, and waited. An hour later someone from the restaurant came to the pool and asked if anyone ordered any food. We said it was us and told him to cancel the order. He didn't seemed too concerned. The next night we decided to get turn down service while we were out. We followed the instructions and left a message. When we got back nothing had been done. I don't think anyone checked for messages. Our last night we decided to eat at their restaurant. I think this is the weakest link for Le Crystal. It was not very crowded but the atmosphere seemed chaotic. Waiters running back and forth - we were never really sure who our waiter was. The two men (probably restaurant manager and beverage manager) in charge took turns laughing it up loudly with one table for 30 minutes at a time - not really concerned about the other customers. I think if those two chipped in and helped their waiters, the chaotic atmosphere would go away and they would earn some respect from the wait staff. The food was just average, but very pricey. A very weird dining experience. In our experience, Le Crystal clearly has 5-star amenities but only 3-star execution. We would give it another try in the future.

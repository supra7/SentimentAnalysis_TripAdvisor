We have stayed at the Ramada, Travel Lodge ,Westin and the Quality Inn since we have been making the Anual September Pilgrimage to Seattle. Ramada was sorry, Travel Lodge by the Needle was so disgusting I was refunded $90. Should have been more. Then we found this place. Yeah the elevators are slow (supposed to be upgraded now) and the carpets need replacing. Yet other than this,for the money and location, it can not be beat. We even stayed down the road at the Westin one year, yeah swanky, but no free parking, it cost me a fortune as I have an overheight vehicle, I had to valet the 3 days. We always come back here. Walk to the Needle and surrounding grounds, Top Pot donuts, Dicks Burgers,walking distance to downtown and Pikes. Also the heated pool which my 3 kids love and you can not beat the savings on a free breakfast for a family of 5. I am making my reservation tonight for our return this September.

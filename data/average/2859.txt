We stayed here for only 2 nights and honestly I booked this hotel by mistake thinking I was booking the regular Marriot just next door. The rooms are fairly basic and the AC a little on the noisy side. None the less this hotel was sharply clean and well maintained. The desk staff and buffet staff were as friendly as family. Good selection of channels on the TV and the internet is free. So after staying here I can safely say that, I would not choose it for a vacation hotel. But as a base room or while in town on business this place has all you need and holds to budget.

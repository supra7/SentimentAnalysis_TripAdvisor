had to pay an extra 10 to check in an hour before. put in room at front hotel but asked to be moved as far too noisy and heating not working. moved to quieter room but heating not working, seemed to be problem in hotel and was to be looked at. reception loaned us a heater and i asked for an extra duvet. heating finally fixed late at night but heating in our room still didnt work. as we had returned to hotel after a theatre trip and it was near 11.30 couldnt be bothered going to report to reception. breakfast not worth the money there are plenty of eateries in euston station which is across the road. if you want a basic hotel which is ideal for the mainlines and tube this hotel is ideal. reception staff were pleasant and helpful even though there were quite a few residents complaining about the heating, some were checking out and getting money back. we didnt bother as we didnt fancy wandering around in the cold looking for alternative accommodation and as husband has a knee injury walking too far wasnt an option. ask for a room at the back of the hotel (view non existent) but front of the hotel is so noisy. Still feel room rate overpriced 110 even though it is central london. would recommend hotel with a few reservations, dont book breakfast go to euston, ask for room at back of hotel. if you just want somewhere clean and central to put your head down this hotel will tick the boxes

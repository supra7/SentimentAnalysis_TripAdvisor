...if you are looking for a vacation retreat, keep looking... Penn Tower is only a short indoor walk away from the hospital and having spent 8 long, hot summer days with a relatvie at HUP,it was a good choice for me, rather than hoofing it blocks and blocks to another hotel in the scorching heat. The room was big, the air conditioner was strong and despite what I read in other reviews, all was clean and I didn't see any bugs... My one complaint would be the temperature of the water in the bathroom..."lukewarm" doesn't cut it after you spend 8 or 9 hours in a hospital room... If you are in town looking to experience the city, go elsewhere...if you are looking to survive a family member's hospital stay at the closest proximity possible, this is the place. (You will not starve despite the lack of dining options...there is a good sandwich shop on the ground floor and the hospital food is better than you'd think...)

This hotel is what you would expect from a Holiday Inn; corporate, clean, bog standard in terms of facilities and service. We booked a double queen room but were allocated a suite which was good in size. The room is well equipped, although for a suite we had no crockery or cutlery so quite how you could eat what you cooked in the microwave or kept in the fridge is beyond me! The hotel has a small outdoor pool and decent size breakfast room. The warm cinnamon rolls are the saving grace of this hotel. The staff on reception are okay (when they're not cursing the computers!) and the valet staff are superb. If you are looking for a base for a business trip in Hollywood or a brief stop this would be fine. Be warned, if you are staying in the Hollywood area hoping to see lots and experience LA, don't bother. Hollywood Boulevard (where the stars are in the sidewalk) is only one block away, however it takes about 5 minutes to visit and after you've done this there's nothing else to see. If you want to go shopping or see any of LA's seaside resorts, you'll need a car. LA is spread out unlike London - which you can pretty much see on foot or via the excellent tube network. Those in the hotel and tourist information office looked at me like I'd come down in the last shower when I asked if I could walk somewhere or take the bus. Didn't find people in LA all that friendly. Please note I have selected that I wouldn't recomend this hotel, purely for the location and lack of things to do nearby

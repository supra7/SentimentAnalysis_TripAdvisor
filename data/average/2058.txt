Easy walk from the train station and close to metro and sights. There are also cafes and stores nearby. The Indian gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and hardworking making our stay that much better. The hotel is small and the rooms are small but clean. Our windows opened out onto the street which was nice. Breakfast was good too. Overall good value for money.

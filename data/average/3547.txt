I stayed for 3 nights in April 2011 at a nightly rate of USD 79++. For the price, its fine but I wont stay here again  like another reviewer, Id prefer to pay a bit more to avoid some of the annoyances and be closer to the creek. First of all, Ill say there were no major problems. My complaints were: 1. As another reviewer said, the room was musty and damp which was immediately noticeable but that I thought the aircon would dry out. I complained after the first night and both the housekeeping manager and an engineer quickly identified the problem as a water leak. This was obviously not new (from the bubbled paint) and so I fault them for continuing to use the room. 2. The room I was moved to wasnt damp but the internet didnt work. Of course they told me it was my laptop but was finally moved to my third room where everything seemed okay. 3. The aircon worked but not well, and this was only April! 4. Message button on the phone didnt work and when I called the front desk to get my message, the receptionist said it was a missed call. However, my friend later said she definitely had left a message. 5. Clothes line in the shower was broken. And some complaints would probably be the same at any HI Express but this was the first I'd stayed at. 1. Pillows are a strange, mini size. Other than that, the bed was comfortable. 2. No bar soap, only liquid, in the bathroom. No washcloths either. 3. Hallway noise was very noticeable. Noise from outside was not bad at all. 4. The dirt-hiding color scheme in the room is really depressing. What did I like? The price. Also, most of the staff were professional, courteous, and interested in making my stay pleasant. I would prefer to be closer to the creek, but the location will be good if you plan to spend a lot of time at the beach or Dubai Mall (and Burj Khalifa). The rate included unlimited internet which generally worked well. Finally, the room was clean and fairly new, although the furniture and carpet are starting to show wear.

This is a difficult hotel to review - the rooms are nice but the entrance on the second floor is awkward. The location is convenient to everything and yet hard to find and out of the way unless you know where you are going. Service is solid for a Hyatt - it doesn't overwhelm but it doesn't disappoint either. I love Boston and have found that you can often find deals on rooms here - the location works for me since I know the city but not sure everyone else will like it.

The Hotel Max is neat in the funky colors and decor. The location is fantastic but the rooms really disappoint in regards to size. For the price point these rooms are at (retail - we paid $75/night via Priceline Name Your Own Price) Beds are comfortable. We had a room with a queen bed, desk and mini-fridge packed with honor-bar overpriced items. Shower is a separate closet. Bathroom has a toilet and a very small sink. No room to keep toiletries or apply makeup. We had 2 suitcases and 2 carry on totes. Barely enough room for one suitcase. Small closet didn't help things. Overall this is not a 3.5 star hotel. More likely a 2.5 star. Yes it is updated. Yes it is chic with it's artsy walls and decorations. The location is great (except for close proximity to the Greyhound station) but the rooms are way to small for this price point.

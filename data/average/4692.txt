Upon arrival it was before the posted check in time. One of the people in our party had requested early check in in hopes of arriving before 3. We left & went shoping & came back after 4:00 pm & they said our room was not ready. Not only was ours but they had 3 other people at the desk who were in the same spot. We had all left our luggage & were on a tight schedule & other people who had arrived after us got a room (one of the people in our party came after us & got a room). They appoligized but it did not detract from the fact that because we were early they gave away our room to people who checked in after us. Luckily the person who helped me was at least trying to help while the person next to me dealt with an employee who was not helpful at all & even got snotty with him. The hotel was very pretty. The bathroom countertop was not clean (still had hairspray on it). Don't know if I caught them on a bad day or if it is always this way.

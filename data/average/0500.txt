I had to make a last minute trip to Seattle while two conventions were going on and this was the closest hotel to the downtown area I could. When you arrive the dingy 70's exterior doesn't do a lot to ease your mind, nor does the location but once you get into your room things improve. It seems to be newly renovated and everything was clean. Bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, despite facing a rather busy street. The rooms are quite small but I live in NYC and I'm used to tight quarters so it didn't really bother me. The breakfast room makes your high school cafeteria feel like the Ritz and is a rather depressing start to the day, I'd skip it and talk a walk over to Belltown for a proper cup of coffee and any kind of breakfast you'd want. Totally acceptable for what it is, a motel on the edge of town.

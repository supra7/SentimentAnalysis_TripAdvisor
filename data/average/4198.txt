This is an older hotel with charm but the room we stayed in needed updates and a thorough clean! The best thing about our room on the 8th floor were the comfortable beds (2 doubles even though we requested a king) and the fact that there were 2 bathrooms. I also appreciated the black out blinds and the Keurig coffee maker. The cons.. peeling paper in both bathrooms and sockets that did not work. A noticeable accumulation of dust/dirt around the edges of the bathroom. Fixtures were clean but dated and/ or damaged (mirror was watermarked? bathroom socket was hidden behind a tissue box and didn't work). I tried to plug the hairdryer into 2 different sockets that didn't work and one of these was coming away from the wall. We arrived late on the Friday night and there were no rooms left with king beds.

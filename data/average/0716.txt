The high point of the place was the view of the water. BUT if you choose a waterside room (and why, except for the cost, you'd stay on the land side is a mystery) be sure to ask for a room far out on the water since otherwise you'll be looking in large part at an adjoining dock. As to the room itself, it's quite small though the bath and shower (no tub if it matters) are lovely. The staff, front desk, building engineer, housekeeping, restaurant and bar, were all helpful, pleasant and accommadating.If the Inn at the Market is booked (which it was) this hotel will give you a look at the bay.

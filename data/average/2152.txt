Stayed at this location 10/11-10/15. Impressive lobby. Upgraded to strip view to avoid much train noise. Since we were on 57th floor, doubt that would have been an issue, though. The Positives: Room itself was spacious and well nicely decorated. Comfortable bed. Ample closet and drawer space. Amenities in the room included a small refrigerator, cooktop, and microwave. A few dishes and silverware were provided. The bathroom was huge. All usual toiletries were provided. Wonderful plush robes are available. The robes were not in our room at check in but were promptly sent after calling the front desk. Friendly staff. Tasty breakfast buffet. The Negatives: Nightstand shabby and scratched. Spots on furniture and floor. Hot water was inconsistent in the shower. Kept getting cold. Finally let the hot run for about 10 minutes before getting in to have hot water all through the shower. Room smelled like it had once been a smoking room. Not bad enough to warrant a room change, but noticeable. No self parking. Valet only. Self park in the mall parking garage across the street. Location quiet since the hotel is sits off the strip, behind Fashion Show mall. Quick walk to the strip. Good hotel as a home base for day trips to surrounding areas.

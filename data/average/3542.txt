Before i talk about my substantive stay, i would like to warn all fellow travellers of a "scam" taking place which dupes guests at this hotel. It involves the security staff at the front of this hotel who lead guests to private taxis waiting directly outside the hotel. Guests are lied to and told that these taxis cost the same as WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS. This is a lie, these private cabs are much more expensive than WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS. The security staff tolf myself and several other guests that the private cabs are the same cost as WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS, AND THIS IS A LIE. I also heard these unscrupolous security staff telling guests that WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL AREA. This again is a lie. I WANT TO WARN ALL GUESTS OF THIS SCAM SO YOU CAN AVOID BEING A VICTIM. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO FLAG DOWN A WHITE GOVERNMENT CAB OUTSIDE THE HOTEL YOURSELF. THEY ARE READILY AVAILABLE WITHIN A COUPLE OF MINS AT THE ROADSIDE. ONLY GOVERNMENT CABS ARE WHITE SO STICK WITH WHITE CABS THROUGHOUT YOUR STAY. I saw the secutiy staff making a note every time they managed to get a guset into a private cab. My hypothesis is that the security staff are receiving a commission from their "friends" driving these pricate cabs. REMEMBER PRIVATE CABS ARE NOT WHITE. I informed the hotel manager of these issues on 20/11/2011 and he said this problem would be addressed that night. So i was shocked to observe that on the following day the SCAM was continuing. I managed to advise a few guests who were angry and shocked and decided to take government cabs. REMEMBER FOR CHEAP TRANSPORT USE WHITE GOVERNMENT CABS OR THE EXCELLENT METRO SYSTEM. HOLIDAY INN SENIOR MANAGEMENT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE ABOVE EFFICIENTLY. I would have given this hotel four out of five but due to the avove issue i have had to mark it down. In terms of my stay the hotel maids on my floor and receptionists were good overall. Check in could have been quicker when i arrived at the hotel at 3am, the reception staff prioritised answering the phone than dealing with checking me in when i was tired from a long flight. After this they were much better and helpful throughout my stay. The maids who cleaned our room were good overall. However, when i inspected my room closely i found a plastic bag behind the sofa and a lot of dust behind and under the bed. Also my sheets were not changed sometimes when they needed changing. But again i would stay that aside from these issues the maids were friendly and good at maing up our room. The hotel is in a quiet location but close to majot landmarks and an excellent metro system. Wi fi should be available in rooms and should be cheaper or free. Breakfast is good.

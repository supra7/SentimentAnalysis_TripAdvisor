We found the staff to be very helpful during our 3 day weekend break. The location of the hotel (or should I call it a hostal) is excellent. It is adjacent to La Rambla, unfortunately this leads to rather a noisy stay. Noisy revellers and the bells of the local church/cathedral are a constant distraction. The dining room leaves a lot to be desired, there is no luxury to be found. Breakfast is a disaster, we attempted it one morning and gave up after that, cubed hot dog sausages were served with scrambled eggs, one choice of cereal, no fresh fruit option. The beds are very uncomfortable, all four in our group woke up full of aches and pains from the beds. The saving grace of this hotel is that the staff were very helpful and friendly.

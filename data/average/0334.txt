Stayed here for one night at the end of September. it is clearly an old hotel that has been remodeled. They've done a good job - the lobby, our room and the bathroom were decent, but the elevator was still very rundown and dated and the hallway on our floor had a bit of a musty smell (as well did the closet in our room). It is in a great location and very reasonably priced compared to other downtown hotels, the two items I noted above wouldn't stop me from staying here again - however, the heat in the hotel would. It was SO HOT! There is no A/C and the windows in the room only open a couple inches. There are also no fans in the bathroom. I left my room to get outside to cool off and encoutered others in the elevator who were also complaining about the heat. If they were to add air conditioning I would stay here again, but I couldn't stay here again without it.

My partner and I locked ourselves out of our flat on a Sunday, so had to track down a hotel in our area during a very busy period. Despite checking with 10-12 hotels, this one was the only one with availability. So... now that you have the background...here are the pros and cons: PROS 1. Cheap - we paid 40 pounds for our room. 2. Location- next door to Victoria station, as the name suggests. 3. Free breakfast with the room - nothing fancy, eggs and cereal 4. Receptionist/owner- we found him very helpful CONS 1. Rooms - ours was tiny, and there were two double bed instead of one king. 2. No en suite bathroom. 3. General dilapidation of the place. Overall, this place is run down, small, rickety and true, on its last leg. However it should be said -- there were not bed bugs in our bed.For 40 pounds in London, we got a decent night's sleep but wouldn't want to stay here for more than 1-2 nights.

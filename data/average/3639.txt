Stayed 5 nights here for a company regional meeting. Friendly, helpful staff. Free parking, wireless internet and an OK light breakfast. The restaurant is closed but if they got a good manager and opened for breakfast lunch & dinner, they could make a nice profit. Friendly bar with bumper pool. The rooms are adequate but the motel is ready for a complete makeover. I'd certainly stay there again. Good value.

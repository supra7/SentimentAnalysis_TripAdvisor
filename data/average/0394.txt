I stayed for 2 nights in May while attending a conference. The room was clean and smelled fresh when I entered...this is GOOD and I what I expect every time but don't always get at all hotels. I was on a fairly high floor (16th) and had a view of both the freeway and a "sliver" of a water view. When I visited the bar on the 28th floor that had a nice view which included the Space Needle. I found the staff friendly and helpful. I ate only one meal at the hotel, breakfast, and it was adequate, wouldn't go there if I had time to go outside...Seattle has so many good restaurants that it's easy to be a food snob here. Worked out in the hotel gym...it was small, got a little crowded. On the other hand it was clean, had plenty of clean towels and all the patrons were polite to one another I will stay again because I do business with a company that uses this property...but would not rush to come back on my own. It's an adequate hotel, nice staff...but really nothing unique or special.

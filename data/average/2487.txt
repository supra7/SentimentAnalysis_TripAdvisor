Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly and helpful doorman. At the desk things weren't running as smoothly, it was busy and the staff behind the desk were very unfriendly and unattentive. The staff had this attitude the whole week we stayed there, if you would ask something they would role their eyes and sigh ... very unprofessional. Actually I have never experienced this in any hotel and I do quite a bit of traveling. Housekeeping and the doormen on the other hand were very helpful and friendly. The room, a serene king, in itself was ok and well fitted except that it was missing a safe. Bathroom was big, with nice big fluffy towels and a good shower. The window could be opened and free-wifi is always a bonus. The room is on the noisy N State st side, which didn't bother us too much but be warned if you are a light sleeper. All in all the stay in Chicago itself was great, the city has a lot to offer and we were lucky with the weather. I will definitely be back, but not at the Dana, way too much attitude.

The Park Plaza was recommended by friends who grew up in Boston. While the location is great - the hotel itself was a bit disappointing for the price. We were initially put in a handicap accessible room - they did switch us - to a room with a bathroom that was very small, I was constantly putting the toilet seat down because I was afraid my toiletries would fall in the toilet- the only space to put things was a small ledge above the sink and toilet. I do understand this is an old hotel with size restrictions. We did not watch much TV since we were out and about, but was surprised by the old TV with a poor quality picture. The bellmen and valet people were nice and friendly, but the Concierge desk was another story. I was waiting to ask for a map, when they finished helping the person in front of me they proceeded to criticize and belittle that person, while I was in earshot - not very professional and actually immature.

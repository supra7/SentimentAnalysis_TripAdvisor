At right angles to both Boston City Library and Trinity Church, and facing onto Copley Square, this hotel is in a great location. When we arrived a farmers' market was in progress on the square. The Copley is impressive and certainly has the wow factor. The lobby is like a mini Versailles, complete with chandeliers and mirrored doors. We stayed two days and plushness of the lobby area never lost its impact. Room decor was faux Edwardian and it was very comfortably fitted out. Particularly impressive was the silver and black marble bathroom. Of course this all came with a hefty price tag. Our stopover here cost us more than anywhere else we stayed in Massachusetts. But the experience was all show and no substance really. Breakfast would never be included in such a grand place and internet use in the room was priced exorbitantly. Our first stopover on a 12 day trip, I wondered later why humbler, CHEAPER but just as comfortable hotels could offer free wireless internet but not the lofty Copley. Wonderful to look at and pass through it may be, but it totally lacks the essential ingredient of any hotel - hospitality! By all means stay there, but expect to pay.

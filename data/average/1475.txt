I don't know about anyone else but I am a true romantic. When I go somewhere exotic I want to feel like I am in another land, Sometimes a place, all though absolutely "over the top" beautiful is just that "too much place" not enough personality! Maroma's staff is amazing but the place fell short of my idea of a hot steamy, romantic all inclusive.

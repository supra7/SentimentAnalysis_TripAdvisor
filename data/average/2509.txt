The Aloft hotel, Montreal airport, is located very close to the airport, but you couldn't tell as there was little to no noise from arriving or departing aircraft. The room was pretty small for the price charged and in my room, the phone handsets did not work and nobody was available to address it. Also, the tissue dispenser only had a couple of tissues in it and ran out. On the surface, each of the 3 are small issues, but combined, made my first experience at an Aloft hotel fall below expectations. I am returning to this hotel for my last night in Montreal and hopefully the experience is better.

It's exactly what you'd expect. Clean and comfortable , no frills. A place to sleep but definitely not to spend any time in. The staff get a mixed review ; On the first night they insisted they had no double rooms in the hotel, and forced us into a twin room. The next day, after complaining again, they miraculously found a whole floor of double rooms.

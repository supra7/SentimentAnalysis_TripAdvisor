My fiance and I chose to stay here because we wanted to be downtown without breaking the bank. The rooms are basic but adequate - especially if you plan to spend the majority of a weekend stay exploring Seattle, as we did. The location is excellent - walking distance to trendy Belltown shops and restaurants. We had a memorable Italian dinner at Barolo Ristorante, a ten minute walk from the hotel.

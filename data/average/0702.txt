We stayed on a Sunday night in December. The rooms are nice but ours was pretty small. The fire place has great ambiance but when it is on it puts out a lot of heat for a small space and the mechanics of it are really loud, we couldn't have it on and carry on a conversation, plus had to have the slider open all night for cool air. It's a good thing that there was only water out side. The bathroom has been redone with the obligatory rain shower head but since it is in the far end with a glass wall there is no way to turn it on with out getting all the way in and standing under cold water. The shower wand is a nice touch but there is no obvious way to turn it on. A shorter person wouldn't have had a chance. There is a small lever on the top of the shower head. The card implores one to conserve water but there is no where to hang up a towel to dry, how about a couple of towel bars? there is room for one but the towels are folded and stacked. There is no sound proofing between the floors, we were on the ground floor and could hear every step and movement from above all night long. Our party of 7 had dinner in the 67 which is a beautiful space but when every one had to get out their cell phone to get enought light to read the menu it should be a sign to lighten it up. The servers don't have little flash lights, we asked, and their was no candle light. The server said they could turn up the chandelier but never did. This hotel has great ambiance but many of the design decisions are not guest friendly. A great example of placing esthetics over practicality.

I was looking for a 3 star hotel within walking distance of the Seattle sites. I chose Hotel Max due to the rank/price ratio. I knew ahead of time about the valet parking fee. I asked about the wi-fi fee and was immediately offered a comp pass. The Queen room is small with a tiny bathroom that was as big as the closet. Speaking of the closet, there is no light in there or the entry way so you are reaching blindly into a black void. (OK not that dark but pretty close.) The room is tiny and half of the counter space and storage space is taken up by the coffee maker, snacks, mini bar, hair dryer, iron, safe, etc. There is absolutely no where to put toiletries except for a little glass ledge that held my toothbrush and soap and thats it. Luckily that was all I had. I arrived at 11am and had planned on parking my car at the hotel and walking to the market until check in time at 4pm. They were nice enough to look for an open room and I was able to check in early. Unfortunately the toilet seat had wet urine spots (or some other wet yellow spots) and that made me wonder what else hadnt been cleaned. If the room wasnt ready then they shouldnt have offered it as an option. Not sure what the valets did with my car but the radio was reset and I had to go to the Honda dealership to have it unlocked. I liked the location. It was about 6 blocks to Pike Place Market and an even shorter walk to the monorail which will take you to the Space Needle and EMP Museum. For one night it was fine. I would not want to stay longer than that because there is no way to spread out and organize. FYI - Walls are very thin and you can hear everything that your neighbor says or does.

We stayed at the Palmer House with our 2 kids for a long weekend. Immediately upon checking in, the front desk person gave us an "upgrade" to a room with two bathrooms. This was enormously helpful. The room itself was OK, the lighting was bad and the furnishings a bit dated and worn but in general it was satisfactory. But, the hotel in general seemed to lack the comforts and "extras" you might expect with a hotel of this class. The only real restaurant was very expensive and there were not many other attractions in the lobby area where there was construction going on. However, the gym was excellent, the pool a big plus for the kids and the staff for the most part was helpful. All in all, a mixed review.

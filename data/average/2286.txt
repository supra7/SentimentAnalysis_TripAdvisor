The best thing about this place was the staff. They were very friendly and helpful. The property is too far away from downtown, which can be cured by a $15 cab ride. Though, when you use the cab up to 4 or 6 times a day, the price tag can add up. So, if you add an additional $60 per day for a cab, on top of the high lodging rate, and the additional resort fee, this become a pricey place to stay and not really worth it. (Cabs might be near to impossible to get during fantasy fest and New Year. Our ride home on New Year was an adventure unto itself.) Except, if you are not in Key West for the Duval St. experience. The resort has the old Key West feel to it and nicely appointed. The rooms are clean and roomy. And, the pools are small yet nice. There are no on-property services for breakfast (that we found), so you are always on your own. Next time, we will bake in the additional costs associated with staying at this resort and will most likely stay somewhere downtown.

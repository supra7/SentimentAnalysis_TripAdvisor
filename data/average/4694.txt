We were in town for a wedding and had two rooms booked; one for this hotel and the other for Residence Inn for a much cheaper rate. (See my review for Residence Inn) We arrived early as our flight landed at Midway at 7:55am and I had already called about an early check in. When we arrived they indicated that they were at 90% capacity. They did not have a non-smoking king room sbut had two queen non-smoking available for the same rate, so we took it! The room was nothing to write home about. The bed was not comfortable at all but the pillows were nice. The remote was old and barely worked most of the time which annoyed me to no end. Breakfast was not complimentary and just to get pastries and yogurt it was $10.95. If you wanted meant that was going to cost you an additional $4.95. I called one of the restaurants in the book from the hotel and ordered myself breakfast which came up to $19.22. They informed me that the menu has not been updated and the meal that was priced at $8.25 was now $10.50. I decided to cancel my order.

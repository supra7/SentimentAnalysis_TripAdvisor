We stayed there for night because a friend of us got a "good deal" with groupon. Would not have chosen this hotel otherwise. We had one of the bigger rooms for 4 persons, which meant a nice king size bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was absolutely NOT comfortable, had a hard time sleeping. It may be ok for kids, but we could feel all the springs and the was a plastic cover around the mattress that made lots of sound every time we moved. Not cool. I can't believe the prices they charge for their rooms, since it's a actually just a normal 3 star hotel. Not more or less. The rooms could need some refurbishment to motivate the prices. Wouldn't stay there again,since there are other hotels which offer more charm at a better price. The location is perfect, though, for most tourists.

I reserved a 2-night stay back in February for May 26th for a short stay before our cruise. When I went to check in I was told the room with King/pullout couch was not available. The desk manager was helping me and he said that room types are only a request, not guaranteed. When I made the reservation, there was no mention of this only being a request. I had also called the hotel a couple days prior to confirm the room type and was told no problem. I was quite upset and explained to him that is the only reason we picked this hotel and there are many choices of hotels with 2 double beds and for less money. After realizing I was not going to let this drop, he typed and typed and finally said he had what I wanted. He then said  I want you to realize that I am flipping someone out of their reservation for you. I told him obviously, they had already done that to me and this is contrary to him saying room types are not reserved. After assigning a room, I asked to confirm the price, it was incorrect. They were charging me $40 more than the confirmation I had in my hand. Because I had the confirmation, the price was lowered with no problems. After we were given our reserved room type and correct charge, all went smoothly. The hotel is in a great area for sight seeing and close to the pier. Housekeeping did a great job and the concierge was very informative and helpful.

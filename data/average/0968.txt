Domus Ester is 'Rooms' not a hotel as such. Having said this it was very good, the room was ideal, situation was excellent for getting around once you knew where it was, staff very helpful and friendly.. Only reservation was it was so difficult to locate. I would advise anyone going there to use the hotel's shuttle from the airport, especially if it is dark when they arrive. An added measure is to be familiar with hotel number (dialling code etc.) so you can phone them and they will come and collect you if you are wandering around lost. (hotel's suggestion) Though we had the address and were in the right area no-pne seemed to know where it was, including taxi drivers we asked. Eventually we did find a taxi driver who could only locate the hotel by phoning them. His help was marvellous.

paying extra for the special seating a big fat rip off. we got there early were the 1st in line for the special seating with promise of being seated 1st and fed 1st and watched the whole 1st row of tables fill with peope who arrived after us and were waved straight by us standing in line,when the lady behind us complained they took her in and also sat her in the 1st row promised we had assigned seats and well much later came back for us and sat us in 2nd row the show was good so was food DONT PAY EXTRA FOR SPECIAL SEATING

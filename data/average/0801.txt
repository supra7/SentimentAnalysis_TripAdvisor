I stayed here while on a business trip for 2 nights. The location was fantastic, I loved being able to walk to the Seattle branch of our office as well as do some shopping after work. The service was good, front desk was pleasant and helpful; wakeup calls were on time. The wifi was fast and the place was extremely quiet; I never once heard a peep either from the hallways or neighboring rooms. The room, however, was less than stellar. The bed was comfy but the entire room had an odor that was unpleasant. Not enough to switch rooms, but unpleasant enough that I had to get some air freshener. Also, the carpet was stained and gross; i was glad I brought flip-flops to wear in the room because I would not have wanted to walk barefoot. I was on floor 22 of the south tower, it had a plaque on it stating that it was an SPG floor.

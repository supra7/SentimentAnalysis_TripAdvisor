I booked a double room here for about US$269. It was TINY! We barely had enough place to put all our luggage. Breakfast was way too simple. Other than that, everything else was fine. The manager was very helpful and so were the other receptionists. The room itself was clean and comfortable, although I felt rather awkward with the glass wall of the toilet - not the most comfortable if you are travelling with someone other than your spouse/significant other! The location is good, just opposite the subway. I was satisfied but I'd only stay here again if I couldn't find someplace better.

Wanted to spend the weekend in Philly and save some money. This place fit the bill. Got a great rate through Priceline and then was worried when I saw the terrible reviews. Ended up everything was fine. Internet access was $4.99 for the entire stay and was very good. No frills (no pool,etc). Clean room, crisp linens. Cable with Showtime. Nice having a full kitchen.

Not horrible, but certainly not worthy of the Intercontinental name. Lobby is creepy and outdated, exterior as well. Restaurant food was subpar but on a good note, there are tons of places to eat in the neighborhood. Location is great. Room seems to have been one that has been renovated and was fine, although odd to see the bathroom lighting fixtures have rust on them already. Lack of in room wifi is unacceptable in this day and age however. Staff was competent if unenthusiastic.

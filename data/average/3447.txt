We arrived at the reception desk at 9.00am after a long haul overnight flight desperate for a shower and a bed only to be "greeted" with the news that the Crowne Plaza has a check in time of 2pm. When we pointed out that it was an airport hotel and asked why we couldnt be accommodated earlier we were told that the cleaning staff did not start their shift until 9.00am and that our room would not be available until 2.00pm. Thoroughly disgruntled we continued to complain, pointing out that most hotels manage at least a 12.00 noon check in time and they eventually capitulated and said they would get us into the room as soon as they could. In order to speed up this process as much as possible we made makeshift beds of the chairs in the lounge/reception area and denied their offer of luggage stowage (we were flash-packing, i.e. backpacking but in some measure of style) so that we made the place look as untidy as possible. Result was that they managed to get us into a room within an hour and a half. The room itself was lovely with very modern decor. If we hadnt had this experience with the check in then we would have been much happier with the hotel. We understand that you cant make rooms available if people are still in them (as i recall the check out time was 10.00am) but feel that as it is an airport hotel and people come and go at all times of the day and night then it is totally unreasonable to have a check in time of 2.00pm.

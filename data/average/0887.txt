1. Let's start with the address of the hotel, 1900 5th Ave. As a first time visitor, I didn't find out the motor entrance is on 6th Ave until I got out of my car and checked in. Then was told I'd to drive further. Maybe I was the only guest who had ever encountered this situation. The clerk checking in gave me unclear directions and enquiries made of another assistant yielded a hand-drawn map. Clear signage at the 5th Ave entrance would have been helpful. 2. The elevators were slow and creaky. If you are on a lower floor with luggage, you probably have to wait a few times before you can get in the elevator. 3. The hotel directory does't identify where the fitness centre is. We'd to call the operator to find out. 4. No blackout curtains. These are annoyances that are not worthy of a 4 star hotel.

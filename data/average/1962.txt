If you walk up and down Kaanapali beach, one hotel sticks out as being the neighbor that doesn't mow his lawn or paint his shudders. But his wife makes awesome homemade chocolate chip cookies that everyone is welcome to stop by and enjoy. That is what you get when you stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. It is an overpriced outdated hotel that is in the second best location on Kaanapali Beach. What makes this place worth it is the friendliness of the staff, the (lower) price of the drinks, and the free breakfast. Also, the rooms are quiet....because there were two types of guests: AARP members and Honeymooners. At first I was skeptical about staying here, but I would definately stay here again to save a bit of money. We didnt spend a whole lot of time in our room, but in Maui you dont need to. Pros: 2nd Best location on Kaanapali Beach. Quiet Room. Decent room condition. Ohana activities desk was very helpful. Free breakfast every morning. Welcome breakfast and show was very accomodating. Nightly turndown service with candies or chocolates. Free nightly Hula show very entertaining. Cons: Oceanview isnt really oceanview. It was more like partial ocean view. If you want an oceanview room, go for OceanFront. Just dont bother spending extra on oceanview. Save some money and get a gardenview room, however I heard that the gardenview rooms are in poor condition. Your choice. Poor water pressure in the shower. The pool is small, but clean.

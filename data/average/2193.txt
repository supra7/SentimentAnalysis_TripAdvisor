Stayed at the Trump in one of the rooms facing the strip - spotless room, lovely comfy bed but no little touches that would make you think you were staying in a five star hotel. The newspapers promised each morning - did not arrive, the tv in the bathroom - did not work, the shower in the bathroom is nothing to write home about. It is a lovely hotel with lovely friendly staff both on reception and in the restaurants, however it is not the five star you would hope for at all. We stayed there as a treat to ourselves and it was a bit of a let down. Looking for that five star treatment - do not stay at the Trump.

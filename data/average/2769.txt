Quite a good hotel if you consider that in Istanbul hotel prices are higher than the rest of Turkey. The room was a bit small, the sink was broken and the WC was leaking at every flush. Breakfast in the average, the hotel and the rooms very clean and the staff was really helpful. The free parking available was an essential facility for us, since we left the car in their garage for 5 days! Good location, near the major cultural attractions, and a few metres from the Cemberlitas tram stop. BUT if you're more interested in nightlife (clubs, pubs, restaurants and shopping) maybe Taksim square would be a better option to stay. Even because the tramway and the tunnel close before midnight and then you have to take a taxi (20 - 25 TL) or walk to go back to Sultanahmet (30-40 minutes walk).

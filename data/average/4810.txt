Stayed here for business recently - and didn't manage to get a cheap price, but was late booking. It is a very historic hotel right in the middle of the loop area of downtown Chicago -very well placed for most of the big attractions. The foyer is fantastic, and you can feel the history in the walls - but the bedrooms are pretty ordinary for those who pay the full price. There is very limited wifi and it is expensive (although the starbucks across the street (not the one in the hotel) has got free access!

We've stayed here many times for lots of good reasons ... friendly staff, great location, easy to get in & out, very reasonable prices. We stayed this time because we had reservations at Jazz Alley, a short walk away. Overall, the hotel is old & tired, but fairly well maintained. The rooms are average, bathrooms are marble (reflecting their age) & pretty small. The ceilings in the bathroom have been lowered in a remodel from the 1960s or so, making them rather claustrophobic. Water pressure was terrible. The TV was in a large cabinet facing the bed, but was so low you had to sit up in the bed to see it. The bed was OK, the towels & sheets were very tired. The sheets were thin & shabby, & there was a hole in the bottem sheet. One thin blanket on the bed -- thank goodness they had a spare in the closet. The towels were similar -- pretty bad. We didn't eat in the restaurant this time, but we did have drinks & dessert in the bar. After 2 drinks I wasn't convinced there was any liquor in them. The dessert was described as multiple layers of chocolate torte. It was a tasteless cold concoction sitting on top of Ready Whip, drizzled with raspberry syrup. Terrible. The bartender nicely took it off our tab. All & all, we've decided the low price is just not worth it, & next time we'll stay elsewhere.

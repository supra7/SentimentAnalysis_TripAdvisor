Booked the room for a good price on their website and THEN read the reviews on tripadviser. Wrong way around, so was a bit worried about what I would find when I arrived at the hotel. The hotel's location is great- near Central Station, a block from Paddy's Market, just near Chinatown, easy walk to Convention Centre and a stroll into Pitt Street Mall/ QVB. The hotel staff were great but I know it's the room you want to hear about. It was small, a bit dull and tired and I had to ring Reception to work out how to turn the lights out to sleep (pull the Card out of the wall). However, the room was fine. We were only there for an overnight stay and it was a great sleep in a comfy bed with good pillows. It was basically a suitable, basic room and a good shower. Nothing flash what so ever but it did its job for a good price. Would I stay there again? Probably, unless I wanted a nicer, bigger, more modern room with a few indulgences.

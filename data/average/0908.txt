We arrived late and tired after a flight from NYC. Receptionist was efficient but unfriendly - no help with our luggage. Foyer was huge but a bit frayed at the edges - in need of an urgent refurbishment We were on the 31st floor with sea view - lovely - but the room was not that big and I think the could do with upgrading -the bathroom floor could do with a good scrubbing. We had breakfast in restuarant and found it good value and bettervalue than the smaller cafe on the premises. -. Concierges very good - great tip for 50 cent oysters on shore cafe and happy hour. Well placed for most tourist sites. Space Needle expensive for what it was but good tourist talk given. Pike market quite good - people friendly- loved Seattle

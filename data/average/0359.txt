Relatively cheap by downtown standards, the PP offers little more than a place to sleep -- and without AC, not sleep well when daytime temps soar. There are fans in the rooms, but they can do nothing about the humidity. Numerous air purifyers operating throughout the hallways don't quite get the musty smell out. I've seen bigger bathrooms on cruise ships, but at least you need not worry about falling down -- there's no room to do it. While I'm sure the bellhop would help with bags, the elevator doesn't stop at ground level -- you either carry your luggage down about 20 steps or up 10 steps. (I don't think wheel chairs could be accom- modated -- check with hotel,) You decide if it's worth $100/night more for amenites lacking in this older but adequate facility. Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on site with good coffee and bakery items. Walk to many downtown sites and restaurants or ride the 'free zone' busses in the downtown area. I initially was going to give this 2 stars, but in reviewing the plusses -- location, price and friendly staff -- I elevated my rating.

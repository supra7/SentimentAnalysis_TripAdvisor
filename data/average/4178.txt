The location of this hotel is excellent but unfortunately the hotel itself is only average. Positives were: location, ok sized room, big bed, big tv, mostly clean Negatives were: noise from the street (despite having asked for a quiet room), small bathroom, no bottled water in the room, charge for internet, pretty decrepit curtains

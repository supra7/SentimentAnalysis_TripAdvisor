I travel alot for business and while this is a new Marriott Suites hotel, it reminded me of a Courtyard with suite rooms. I have stayed at some of the older Marriott Suites that have been renovated that are much nicer than this. Also a little disappointed when I called for a toothpaste twice and waited for 45 min, before I decided to go to the front desk to get it myself. Overall the stay was average, but for the great rate which included breakfast, I can't complain.

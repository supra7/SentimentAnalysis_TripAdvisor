Though not much expensive, this hotel have rooms that are too small! We were staying at Fragrance Hotel - Oasis last 2008 and its too cramped for two (and to think my mum, sister and brother shared a room -- you can just imagine!) So we went and booked again this year (October 2011 -- been accustomed to stay at this place) Since both my mum and sister are staying, we thought we can still handle it. I've checked-in in behalf of my family and we were told to stay at another hotel (Fragrance - Classic) because the aircon needed a repair! We asked if we can be assisted for the transfer and the guy at the receptionist informed a lady employee (wearing only tight leggings and shirt) to help us. We thought she can help us even push just 1 luggage bag but she just said "come". hmmm... The towels are not new; by seeing it I can feel that there were more than some hundred guests that are using it! :( No free access to the internet, even wifi! its 2011 people, "dawn of the new age/year of the internet!" duh!? *But at least they keep the room clean before we come back late.

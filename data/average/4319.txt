After reading all of the reviews on here, I was terrified to stay here! As many people have said, the lobby is nice and deceiving. The hotel is very old and it shows. The elevator is old fashioned but it works! I got to my room and realized there was a screw loose on my door. The housekeeper saw me fiddling with it and said she'd call someone to repair it. About 10 minutes later someone showed up! There was a wet rag in my sink, trash in my garbage can and a shopping bag on the floor in my room upon entry. The room was clean but smelled. The above items left in the room was very weird but overall the room was fairly clean. It is what it is-it's cheap but it does have some faults. I was only there for a few hours overnight for business so I could over look the problems.

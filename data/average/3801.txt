We stayed here based on the reviews for being pet-friendly & somehow didn't manage to see the complaints about planes. I guess they were dog-friendly enough but when researching dog parks in that town, we found that we were not welcome because they were for Addison residents only. Also, all the food in the area was expensive. And the planes were ridiculous--at all hours of the night. We didn't sleep through the night on the two nights we stayed. It was clean enough & we did not bother with breakfast. It was close to shopping & most things we wanted to do. Don't think we would go back though.

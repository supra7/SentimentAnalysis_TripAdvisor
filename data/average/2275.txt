This is a beautiful luxury hotel. Rooms make you feel like you've died and gone to heaven - luxury everywhere. Walk in shower (but no seat or shelf so you can shave your legs) Beautiful bed (but it's HIGH - need a step stool to get in...) Pretty french doors leading to your deck on the sand (but you cannot get to the water - floral hedges try to make up for that fact, but you can't put your feet in the Gulf). Lots of pools, a Cafe for food and drink (BUT - they stop serving food at 5PM!!! We ended up having to walk across the street to find someplace to eat! With what you pay to stay here (it IS beautiful...) you would expect to be able to have dinner on site (dinner AFTER 5PM that is...), Great place to stay if you like to live in luxurious surroundings but don't mind having to wander around elsewhere for food and ocean. Also, you can't really see the sunset into the ocean from this location.

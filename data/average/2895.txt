If visiting Madrid for a long weekend I would suggest you look elsewhere. As has already been stated , this hotel is well away from the centre and has little to do close by - a couple of restaurants and a McDonalds. Great views from the rooms especially the higher floors. Hotel is also very dark and modern, all black marble and mirrors. Staff are friendly but facilities very lacking for a supposedly 5* international hotel. There is no pool area to relax, no film channels on the TV and only 3 english speaking channels- Al Jazeera! , CNBC and BBC World News. Breakfast buffet very extensive but no hot choices - scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, mushroom and tomato from heated cabinets only. We ate at a restaurant called Casa Juan, a 10 minute cab ride - it was excellent especially the taster menu at 52 Euros including wine - almost never ending tapas dishes, plus main course and dessert. Also Casa Nemesia - a 5 minute walk and mainly fish. We took a train to Toledo (30 minutes) which is well worth a visit as an antidote to the modern cityness of Madrid.

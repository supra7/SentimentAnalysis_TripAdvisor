This hotel was perfect for a sight seeing trip. Somewhere to lay your head at night, and crash out when worn out from walking around New York. Very basic, but clean and tidy, with good reception staff, unfortunately no-one mentioned the highway and the train lines some 30 yards from our room. We were unlucky and got the 'train side' of the hotel which meant the overland trains passing all night and every 60 seconds from 6am - 9am (very noisy, and shook the room), so no sleep on night no 2. Such a disappointment and this was a good value hotel, unfortunately positioned. On the plus side it did have free internet access which was the fastest connection i have ever experienced.

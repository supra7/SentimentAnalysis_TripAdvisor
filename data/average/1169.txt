If you are claustraphobic or don't like elevators avoid this hotel. The room was tiny, but the elevators were the size of shoeboxes. And, to make things worse, there was no access to the stairs from the lobby floor. And, although there were 5 people in my party, they had booked us for a room with one double bed. They insisted it was my fault. Why would I have ever approved that? Only when someone else cancelled did they finally agree to give us a new room. Bottom line: for the price there must be better hotels in Seattle.

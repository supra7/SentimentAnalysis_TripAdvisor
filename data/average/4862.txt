I generally favor more modern/chic rooms, so the decor and room set up wasn't quite my style. I did enjoy my stay though. Nice walk in closet, however the full length mirror was on the opposite side of the door, which was a little inconvenient. The desk was nice, it was spacious and had plenty of light. What really charmed me was the staff. The front desk, bartenders, doormen and even housekeeping staff were notably friendly and enjoyable to speak with. They really improved the overall experience of my stay.

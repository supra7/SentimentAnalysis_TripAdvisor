Nicely in walking distance of convention center and, if you're active, the monorail and waterfront. Rooms nicely furnished with great view, but mine was very small. Ridiculously overpriced room service and minibar, but lots of local places will deliver. And don't even think of trying to park your car. $25 a day!

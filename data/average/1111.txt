I've stayed here a few times - initially due to the low winter prices. It's easy to get to from the end of the Light Rail from SeaTac airport - just a short couple of blocks from the last station. Summer rates are too high for the tiny rooms; at least the beds are super comfortable. My main complaint is the tiny shower - what is hip about a shower stall that can't possibly be shared? Also, the excellent japanese fusion restaurant attached closes too early for late arrivals - go to the end of the alley to the west of the hotel to find an elegant late night italian-style fine dining option. Lasty, high charges for Wi-Fi (still!?) and use of the business center computer, and $30 parking, have driven me elsewhere.

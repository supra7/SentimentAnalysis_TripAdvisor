As I thought several of the reviews were helpful prior to our trip, I'll throw in my two cents: Good: Grounds are beautiful, beach is beautiful, pool(s) are great, quiet, relaxing; Service at pools is excellent, David is hands down the best; Drinks are good, good liquor selection Rooms are clean, bed is nice. Previously I saw complaints about TV, I thought TV and channel selection was great; Preferred Club is nice, service at bar in preferred club excellent, constant appetizers and internet access nice; Spa has a very cool design; Bad: Bathroom is kind of ridiculous, there is a huge open window between bedroom and bathroom. If you want privacy, tell your partner to leave; Pig Flu scare may be the reason but the hotel seems understaffed. Those that are working are working hard and very courteous, but there is not enough of them, especially if you want drinks at the beach; Take a cab to and from airport, don't use olympus tours for the shuttle from airport, should cost between 30-40 dollars (although they were very good for side trips once at the hotel); Probably a food snob but I thought the food was worst part of the trip. Restauraunts are rarely open (probably Pig Flu scare again and lack of staff), so there are often lengthy waits (not too bad when you can drink away the wait, maybe annoying to some), but the food I would consider not even OK (although El Patio was decent). Either way the staff that is there tries hard; Dress code a little ridculous,apparantly khakis and flip flops bad, long jean shorts and tennis shoes good. Room service food is terrible and slow (understaffed), but people bringing it very nice. Take all with a grain of salt, not really an all inclusive fan.

This hotel has been recently refurbished and was better than we were expecting. It wasn't cheap but it was one of the cheapest we could find in central Seattle. The rooms are fairly standard - 2 queen beds, fridge, TV, small shower room etc. However, parking was cheaper than most other hotels I looked at and although they say it is limited, there is actually quite a lot. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle and the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate.

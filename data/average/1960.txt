Ka'anapali Beach Hotel has an excellent ocean front location, with very beautiful grounds. It is an older hotel with not as many perks as the larger chains have but it is a quaint little place. It is a reasonable price and they have special packages which are also reasonable. All in all, this hotel has prime location and good prices.

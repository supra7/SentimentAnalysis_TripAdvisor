Hotel is in a busy street near the Trevi Fountain - ideally located. Friendly welcome on arrival, lift available. Rooms were on the back of the hotel so they were quiet, views were of roof tops. Rooms are cleaned every day but the carpets do need cleaning by professionals! Single rooms are small but as I only slept in the room it was fine. It had averything needed - safe, etc When my room flooded (the water in the hotel had been turned off due to a broken pipe and the staff had left the shower on so when the water supply was reinstated the short shower curtain and shallow shower tray allowed water into my bathroom, bedroom and corridor) the porter was unable to offer anything more than a pack of bath towels to soak up the water and turn on the air-conditioning. I was also asked to help so I requested another room. Unfortunately the hotel was full and another room was not available until the next night - as this was my last night I decided to stay in the room. The hotel did buy me a bottle of wine and apologised. Breakfast - food fine but dreadful coffee, tea, etc. I would stay in this hotel but would not recommend unless carpets were cleaned!

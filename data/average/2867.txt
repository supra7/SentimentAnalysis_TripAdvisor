This place has many positives but also several negatives. Overall I would say the place is adequate but not outstanding. The location is great and the service is good. The place is fairly clean, although they only wash the bedlinens and towels every two days if that matters to you. Fatih, the owner, is very nice but will try to sell you a Bosphorus tour as soon as you arrive. This can be a bit too much after arriving right after a long day of travel. The city map they give you is useless- it is a very zoomed out view of the city. Of course, they have a good map for sale for 3 euros. I think it would be nice if they gave you a map that you can actually use. The room: The price exceeds the value for the deluxe room. I would recommend an economy room if you stay here. Water was completely shut off in my room twice: once when I wanted to brush my teeth and another time when I wanted to shower before leaving the room. Interestingly it was only shut off for about 15 minutes each time so I did not even bother complaining. The breakfast: The breakfast has a lot of variety, but that does not mean quality. I arrived one morning at 7:45am (15 minutes after breakfast opening) and the lights were shut off but everything was sitting out. The food was covered in plastic but had condensation. It makes me wonder how long it had already been sitting out. The coffee is stale and barely drinkable. If you want fresh juice, get out your money because not everything at breakfast is free.

A big room in an elegant old building, with a tiny bathroom, a little too much heat and thin walls, and an often-absent concierge. But it's a great location for anyone who wants to explore Boston -- and the discounted rate was impossible to beat. Half a block from the subway, a five-minute walk from the Freedom Trail and an Au Bon Pain next door for breakfast. Also a good fitness center and a large, well-appointed lobby. I'd stay here again.

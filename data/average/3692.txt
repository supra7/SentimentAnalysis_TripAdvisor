We stayed in a double room for one night and the room was small. The bed covers have a stale smell, I don't think they wash them very often. The mattress is saggy and the hallway carpet is worn out and dirty. The waiters at breakfast were a bit rude and spoke very little english. It it not all bad as the location of the hotel is perfect, the building is historic and the lobby and the bar are very elegant. Also there is a nice fitness centre. However, for what we paid (US $160) we probably should have gotten a better room.

Enjoyed the hotel, but was taken aback at the lack of professionalism by the staff. Felt like I was to be punished for interrupting their personal phone calls/conversation, then made to feel embarassed because I did not have a credit card to check in with. The room was prepaid, so i assumed they could turn off the incidentals. I would have been more than happy to find an ATM for a cash deposit, but their attitude towards us is what turned us off. I even felt like I was bothering the concierge when I asked for directions, then had to clarify her instructions. Sorry - not accustomed to being treated in this manner, so we will not be back. Hotel management might want to look at branding or customer service classes for front line personnel.

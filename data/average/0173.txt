Before I got to the hotel, I called from home and asked if I would be able to park my rental car. They said valet was available for $32 a day but that I could easily find street parking. There was no street parking, so valet here I come. The desk staff was friendly. The room was freezing cold and I could not find an electrical outlet without unplugging my laptop. Then I found a power strip nailed to the back side of the dresser. Then when I went outside to get my car to go to dinner, the valets were playing catch with a football on Seneca Street and the ball actually hit my car when we pulled out. Oh well, I am a good sport and it was a nerf. Then, this morning, I showed up at the restaurant on the second floor for breakfast at 6:10 and it was deserted. The sign says it opens at six. I really needed a coffee and breakfast. Coming from an eastern time zone, it was 8 am to me. I did not have breakfast. The room was dated. Just too many little things went wrong... But the price was very good-- only $118 for a Sunday night.

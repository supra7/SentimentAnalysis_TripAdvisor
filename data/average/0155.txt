I stayed at this hotel just for one night prior to taking my cruise from Seattle. I had booked two rooms and being a Priority Club Elite member, they upgraded one room to an executive suite with a connecting room with 2 double which made it perfect for us as a family. The location is near to everything but not really next to it as you need to walk a little bit. Not much of an issue. The hotel seems to be showing its age as you can notice when the lift creaks it was up . Check in was quick and the bell desk staff was happy to keep all of our luggage in the store room rather than taking it up to the rooms. Just as good because otherwise the rooms would have got cramped up for us. They even got for us a good private van to take us to the pier next day. Unfortunately the hotel was totally sold out so I could not get a high floor room and got one on the 10th floor - the rooms actually start from the 8th floor upwards. Again , as elite members, we were given free access to the Club lounge on the 32nd floor which had good views. We were able to partake in the regular continental breakfast next morning. There were no hot items of food there. Nevertheless, well appreciated. We did have dinner in the main restaurant on the second floor and the food was superb! Worth mentioning is the overall service of the staff in the hotel. Each and every one of them were so friendly and helpful. Luckily, next day I was able to check out from the room itself as it was a mess downstairs and the lobby overflowed with guest all checking out almost the same time - probably leaving for some cruise or the other.

We stayed at this hotel for just a night when we took Marshall to his freshman orientation at Northeastern. This hotel is nicely located just a few blocks away from the campus, so it was an ideal location for us. You can walk to the Fens and Fenway Park, as well as the restaurants on Boylston and Newbury streets. This hotel is pretty standard for a Hilton. Biggest complaints about the hotel are small bathroom and no free wifi in the room (they do have computers downstairs in the lobby though). We were hoping for an early check-in and left our bags with the hotel, along with our cell phone number, but they never called us. Wound up checking in at the usual time. Hope that's not an indication of what service is like at this hotel, as given its location, we'll probably wind up staying here a number of times over the next few years.

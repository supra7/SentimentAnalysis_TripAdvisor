The good news about the Roosevelt is that it's in a great location, a block from the Convention Center and in the midst of downtown shopping and restaurants. The lobby is also quite attractive and welcoming. The good news ended at the door to our room - we had reserved a "deluxe queen," but the bed was actually a double bed (we stayed in queen-sized beds the next four nights elsewhere and I can assure you that this was NOT a queen-size bed). The water pressure in the shower was non-existent and one had to hold up the little knob on the tub faucet for quite a while to get any water to dribble out of the shower. All in all, the room was pretty shabby for a "deluxe queen." Breakfast is available in the bar of the attached Vonn's Restaurant for $9.95; however, for $9.95 you get toast and a small selection of other breakfast breads, maybe some cold cereal and coffee. We went across the street to "nyc" and Starbucks. The hotel staff was not particularly welcoming, either. If I was by myself, I might stay there again, due to the location, but my wife and I will not return.

I will just list the negatives, there were positives but the negatives made up for any positives. 1. Elevators were inoperative on several occasions. Security at one point took over a evelator and ejected the people, when they finally let them back in and departed it still did not work. Room service was not performed until after 4:00PM They attempted to charge for a movies not ordered or watched On one night the hospitality room was miserable due to noise from a band in the ajoining room. They promised adequate room for the Saturday banquet, they put 108 people in a room that should have only held 72. (according to submited plan in the initial planning stages) Excuse, they could not clear the ajoining room in time for the banquet. They charged the Association for 40 gallons of coffee at $40.00/gal. Coffee at the free breakfast was to have been included free. It is impossible for the consumption of that much coffee, my only conclusion is they poured it down the drain. The vast majority of the attendees were not at the hotel between the hours of 9:00AM and 3:00PM. Gratuity was excessive, 947.00 , I give on the basis of service beyone the normal. I will be warning other organizations of these "tricks of the trade" by Marriott hotels by scanning magazines advertising reunions and meetings.

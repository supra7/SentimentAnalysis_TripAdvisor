We stayed in one of the larger rooms at a superb rate with a terrace connected to the room. The hotel is modern, clean and quiet. The rooms are spacious with fresh bahtrooms, nice beds and a modern light ambience. Really very nice. I did not really enjoy the breakfast as the restaurant is a bit too sterile for my taste... but hey! At the price given i would happily stay and have breakfast there anytime again! It is a nice and basic place too sleep if it is sleep you look for. Coctails and hustle bustle barlife is all out there outside the hotel i alla of Berlin.

I stayed here for one night due some mix-up with accommodations in Ft. Lauderdale but that was fine as my cruise was departing from the Port of Miami anyway. Location-- very close to the free people mover and major bus connector to get all over Miami or South Beach. A Burger King was directly across the street for a quick coffee or salad but that was it for restaurants. Room-- I did like the floor to ceiling windows and it was clean but, in all honesty the room was no more different than any hotel that I stayed in with a lower star rating. The bathroom light is on a timer so that was good for energy conservation. Bed was comfortable and TV worked fine. Walls looked a bit old though so I am thinking that perhaps this hotel could be showing its age somewhat. Staff-- were nice, friendly and always had a smile. Negative-- the wireless internet. I decided to purchase it and it was horrible. Kept crashing and when it did open it was slower than dial-up I had years ago. Was good for one night but I would not do longer.

Fair sized rooms, clean and tidy. Nice re-decorated bar and restaurant area. Breakfast is al-right, order your own omelette is a nice feature. The dinner menu is rather boring, and so is the food. I'd eat out elsewhere if possible. A thank you to the excellent bartender who took very good care of us, mixing up drinks on request. Room service was slow, 30+ minutes for a simple dish. TV signal kept dropping out for no apparent reason. And Novotel please, one ironing board placed in the hallway to be shared by the whole floor is not good enough. I'd like on in my room. Location is ideal for visitors to the RAI (convention centre), but not the best choice for exploring the city centre.

The hotel, room and service were very nice. Wireless service was available.The room was very sleek and modern. Beautiful shower and bathroom area, very clean, comfortable king sized bed, great layout, however; pricey for the location. There is nothing around the hotel at all. Additionally, the taxi trip from the airport to the hotel cost $24.00 for a 5 (yes 5) minute drive in circles to get to it. It would be a great location for a layover, but that would be it...

It seems a shame to condemn this hostel, because it is probably similar to many others in the heart of Rome, but there is a price to pay for such a central location. If you are claustrophobic, I would think about staying in a hotel outside of Rome and getting the train in every day. The rooms are small and I mean small. The bathroom was biggish with a bath and well stocked with freebies and the rooms were immaculately clean - you can't fault them for that. The landlady was very friendly and spoke better English than many Londoners. So if you can bear to have the walls coming in on you, its a great place to stop. Certainly for the price, you won't find better.

It's an ok hotel but the rooms were small. We had a suite the first night and the bathroom drains smelled so bad we had to keep the door shut and request a new room the next few nights. The next room was down the hall facing the front of the hotel so there was an overhang that fronts the lobby. The overhang was used for other guests empty beer cans and cigarett butts. That was room 232. So needless to say when my daughter pointed it out I was a little disappointed. It's as if know one from the hotel has ever looked out these windows to see the garbage. Minimal sound proofing between the rooms and the worst is the slamming of doors from the hallway. It might be fine for a business hotel but is lacking for the family and is very average in my book. The front desk staff seemed great and very pleasant.

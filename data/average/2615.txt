This hotel is in a convenient location - easy access to transportation, good local restaurants. I travel alot and have to say that the employees here are some of the happiest and most helpful that I've encountered. In fact, all of the other guests seemed happy too! Other points about this hotel: Very small lobby, good restaurant/bar on first floor, typical NYC room: small but efficient. My only issue with this hotel was the shower: the shower curtain did not contain the water within the shower stall so the entire bathroom floor got soaked! They really need longer shower curtains.

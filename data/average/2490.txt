We were looking for a uber trendy/hip hotel as we are not keen on the large chains. We booked the TranquilitySuite (please note every floor has one - its the corner suite 560 sq ft) which was fine - 2 small balconies although views not great (and we were on 23rd floor). The bed is so amazingly comfortable and overall service good - just not great. The roof top bar/club is a bit lame and shoddy decor and sushi restuarant on ground floor nothing special at all. However the staff were nice and friendly (TJ the bell hop is great and a font of all necessary knowledge), spa is OK (small gym/no pool) breakfast is typical American ($10 per person vochers per day provided), location pretty good so yes overall more than acceptable - just not great!

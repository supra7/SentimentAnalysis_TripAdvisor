We arrived at the Eliot after spending a wonderful night at the Lenox. The Eliot is closer to The Boston Conservatory, so that is where I initially wanted to stay, but there was no room the first night, so we stayed at the Lenox. The rather small but charming lobby of the Eliot was somewhat chaotic as a large group was checking out. It was raining when we arrived in the evening and there was no doorman to greet us or bellman to help us with the bags. There were steps to enter the hotel and steps to go down to the lobby and carrying the luggage was not easy. The room was nicely decorated. Clean bathrooms, cute window seats, very charming. The beds were very comfortable. In room internet access was a $10 charge, which I think should have been included. Turn down service was offered nightly. The neighborhood is very convenient to shopping (Newberry Street) and is very close to both Berklee and The Boston Conservatory. Upon checking out, once again...no help. Lugging bags to the street and hailing a cab ourselves. After arriving home, I received $10.00 fee adjustment on my bill for a luggage tag. I was told I had taken this from the room. I can assure you, I have no luggage tag. I have asked for this fee to be removed, and was told that it would be, but as of today, it still remains.

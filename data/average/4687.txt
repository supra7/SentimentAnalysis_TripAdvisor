I booked two rooms for Saturday so my wife and I could take our two young children and her parents to see the windows at Macy's. The hotel is clean, the location is great, the rooms were nice (shower heads and pressure not so much), but both of our rooms had horribly cold water in the shower in the morning. I showered at around 7am and was fine. My wife in our room and my in-laws in their room tried to shower between 8-9 am and got tepid at best, icy at worst, and all temperatures in between. I called the front desk and asked if something was wrong. She said no one had complained that morning, and she sent the maintenance man up right away. He arrived promptly, told us he gets that call a lot and it's because we were on the 13th floor (the first floor of rooms in the building evidently) and "the hot water comes from the roof, so you just need to try later". Try later? You are a Hilton property right? He was very polite, and I believe I understand how gravity works, but it's ridiculous to have a hotel where you KNOW some of your guests are going to have cold water if they take a shower at peak usage, e.g. 8-9 in the morning. I went down to the front desk and she said "No one has complained this morning." I said maybe they haven't this morning, but you can't tell me they've never complained at all, and she admitted that she does get that call from time to time. I told her I had the same hotel booked for three nights this coming week and I needed to cancel and move to another Hilton property. She moved me to the top floor so it shouldn't be a problem... for me anyway. Apologies to the poor schmucks on the bottom floors that day.... Long story short... really nice place, nice little pool that's warm for the kiddos, and a great location, just get a top floor or don't plan on a nice hot shower on a late December Chicago morning... yikes.

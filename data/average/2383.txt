Hotel is in the industrial area beside some auto shop. Nearest food stall is a Chinese restaurant and 7-11, Room is big. Though I didn't like the breakfast. Cafe feels eerie with no people dining with you and hotel staff keeps on chatting at your back making you think they can't wait for you to finished your meal immediately. Overall, hotel is okay still as it's near my office.

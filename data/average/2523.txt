Currently staying at this hotel. I'm in SAN quite a bit for work and wanted to check this hotel out. Very new. Very clean. Good location. All the character of a dentist's office. I don't want to intrude on the lovefest, because the issues I mentioned are all good hotel indicators. It's just that I'm not feeling it for this place. Staff is efficient. Rooms are clean, but remind me a little of a hospital. Some airplane noise. Built in the midst of a yuppie commune that used to be the Naval Training Center. I'm going back to the CY Old Town. It has its issues, but it's just more my kind of place.

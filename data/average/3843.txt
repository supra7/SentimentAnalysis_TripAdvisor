The hotel is very trendy, very green, modern furniture, flat screen tv and lots of plugs for computers etc. And nice beds. But chaotic scene at check-in (in fact, check-in desk doesnt even have a sign saying that is what it is.) Confusing layout and almost all rooms have showers only. No tubs. Which if nothing else should be front and center on hotel website. Front desk agrees that people want tubs but they don't have them. After a long day on my feet at a convention I wished I had stayed at the Holiday Inn across the street. It's a silly way to save money (tubs take longer to clean for housekeeping, or so I was told.) Will find another hotel next time in Los Angeles.

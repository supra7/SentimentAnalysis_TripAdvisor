a great downtown location. Close to everything. Parking is ridiculously expensive. Needs to be totally refurbished. Carpeting is fraying, beds are lumpy, A/C was not fully operational for part of the stay ( did receive a bottle of champagne for our problems ). Will return after it gets redone. Lobby area and bar with free wi-fi albeit a bit noisy. Lots of checking in and out due to cruise ship traffic, Staff very helpful and accomodating.

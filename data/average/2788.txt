We chose this hotel after reading the reviews. It is in a ideal location for the major attractions and within walking distance to shops and restaurants. The staff were very friendly,the hotel was clean and the express breakfast a bonus with 3 children. Whilst the parking wasn't cheap it was very convenient and worth the money for a couple of days. Value for money it was excellent.

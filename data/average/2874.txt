We chose this one as a base for touring down town Memphis. C researched the travel flyers picked up at the TN tourist information and we decided the location looked OK. Until we arrived there. The exit off I-55 took us under a tunnel and past several derelict buildings so I'm getting more apprehensive the nearer we get. The place didn't look very welcoming from the outside, a very old and tired concrete block. After enquiring at reception for a room and presenting our voucher we were offered a ground-floor room. At this point we noticed that the staff were running a shuttle to Beale Street for $3 each way - so now I'm less apprehensive about "downtown Memphis". Our room - metal door looked like it had been crowbarred open at some point during it's life. Key card didn't work first time so a trip back to reception to get that sorted.Fixtures and fittings looked old and tired, however the bed was clean and comfortable and there was a safe, a TV and free Wi-Fi. We noticed an outdoor pool and terrace that was available for use but we never had time to try it. Staff really were friendly and it all appeared to be run by the same extended family. They took us to Beale St. in their shuttle, all we had to do was call them when we were ready and they came and picked us up where they left us earlier (by the statue of Elvis). Slept OK, everything functional in the room even if it was well worn. Breakfast looked OK but unfortunately it was extremely busy and cramped in the dining room so we decided we'd breakfast elsewhere. So to sum up - the location may be a bit down-market but the hotel staff and service more than compensated for this!

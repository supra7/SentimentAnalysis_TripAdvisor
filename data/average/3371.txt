Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 25th March - 29th March 2012 with my 11 year old daughter. First impressions were good as the reception area was nice and clean and welcoming, but that's where it ended. We were dropped off outside the hotel to be greeted with a flight of steps. After travelling 10 hours from Thailand someone to help with our luggage would have been a welcome sight but instead I had to struggle with 2 suit cases and 2 lots of hand luggage up the steps. At reception we were given our room cards and told "we were lucky' as our rooms were ready, other wise we would have had to wait until the afternoon (we arrived at 10am). When we saw our room we were very disappointed to say the least. The room was dark and dingy with old brown blankets on the beds, the carped was dirty and worn and even had an iron mark on it. There was a socket hanging off the wall next to the bed. The TV remote had no batteries, the light switch was cracked and the bathroom tap was missing the "cold" sign. All the signs and notices were yellow from age. The beds were very soft and uncomfortable, the clock next to the bed didn't work, I experienced that when I set the alarm to wake us and it failed! There were no hand towels for the whole of our stay even when I requested then we were given a bath mat! On the second day even the swipe cards did not work the lift. We had to pay for the safe in the room the internet in the hotel and to store bags. All in all I wouldn't stay here again unless there were no other hotels available. The only positive was that it was less that 10mins walk to Darling Harbour and 5 mins to Central station, and it had tea making facilities and a fridge.

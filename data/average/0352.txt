Great location in downtown Seattle within walking distance of Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, shopping and monorail. Overall, the room was clean, but very small. We had a double/double room and it was very crowded for two people. We had a great holiday rate which is why we booked this hotel and I would stay there again if the price were right.

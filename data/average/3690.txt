The building from outside looked promising. Walking in, the decor was beautiful. I was very optimistic. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Then, things starting going sour when we got on the elevator. It was very old. It started shaking when we were inside. I wasnt even sure if were going to make it to the 26th floor. When we got to our floor, the carpet was dirty. There was an unsettling smell. We got to our room and the decor, furniture needs updating. Half the bathroom was updated the other half was dated. I liked the soaking tub. That is were i took showers. It's actually pretty nice. The floor is textured so dont slip. Its clean. I couldnt really sleep at night because of the funny smell in the room. We ordered room service. The tenderloin steak, mushrooms, roasted potatoes are excellent! The free breakfast in the morning is also wonderful. The food does make up for the room. The front desk staff, Tara is FANTASTIC! She went above and beyond to help get the things i need throughout the day to make my stay more comfortable. Housekeeping is wonderful is well. Parking is right across the street. Read the sign before you park. It closes and you cant get your car out when it closes. Better to valet your car.

Arrived at the Hampton on June 20th and was staying for 4 nights. I am a hilton baby so to speak, i always try and stay at hilton properties whenever possible. I am not too picky when it comes to room, so as long as it is clean, quiet and convenient. I was given room 114 (apparently, my profile at hilton.com which states my preferences and my diamond level did not play into their room selection this time around)... i was on the ground floor, by the back entrance, right by the outdoor pool - people walking by would see inside my room if i left my blinds open, hence they were closed the entire time, the heat in memphis (86 degrees farenheit) kept the a/c on and the compressor sounded like thunder whenever it kicked on. Needless to say, i did not get much sleep all four nights... between the poolside guest who never seem to sleep and the back door in constant use, not to mention the a/c noise, it was not a good experience rest-wise! Other than those inconveniences it seemed like a decent hotel, the lobby was clean, free breakfasts every morning, free internet service in my room, the grounds were kept clean, the room was clean and spacious (see pictures). When i went to checkout and was asked about my stay, i reluctantly told the hostess that it wasn't really a pleasant one, but i was there on business so whatever... but she apologized and proceeded to take a night off the bill ($150 in all). If i stay there again, which i doubt, i will not be staying in room 114 or on the ground floor for that matter!!!

We only booked this Hotel because it was the cheapest & nearest to Golders Green Tube where we needed to catch a shuttle bus to a concert. The Hotel is STILL being renovated & the public lounge & lobby look quite smart; however, we were in the end of the Hotel that is yet to be renovated (I hope!), the bathroom was literally in a cupboard with double, unlockable doors; the sink hit you as you stepped in & the mildewy shower was to your left & the toilet to your right! I have never seen anything like it in all my travels! The huge TV didn't work & we only had 1 cup for 2 of us! Not all the lightng worked & the double glazing wasn't the best at keeping out the noise of the busy road below us! Furnishings like the the lampshades were shabby & the curtains were partially off the rail! But, the beds & pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable & bedding fresh & clean, it was probably one of the best night's sleep in any hotel of any standard anywhere! Breakfast was nice if you like cereal & toast, tea was rank & coffee not much better! Cooked offering consisted of fried egg in 1/2 slice fried bread with tiny rasher of bacon & similar sausage & some baked beans. All in all the Hotel was cheap (49 per room per night B&B) & served a purpose, but it would be difficult to recommend it! It would be interesting to see it once the regeneration work is finally completed!

Looking for decent hotels in Key West we decided to try the Parrot Key Hotel. After 6 days at the best hotel we have ever stayed in on Miami Beach we were a bit disappointed when we arrived. This was a much more expensive hotel but the rooms were only average. Two beds, a chair, a desk and a TV.. As you can see in other reviews there are no water pressure at all, the Internet was dead slow and timed out all the time and there was never any towels at the pool after 9pm. They had 4 small pools isolated from each other, and its to bad that they dont have at least one bigger pool. It was just an average hotel, and we expected more from what we had payed, however i would recommend it to others as there were no "really negative experiences". However consider whats important for you before choosing it. If you are a smoker find somewhere else, as their policy on their entire premises is extremely strict. And you have to sign a form that you will pay alot of money if caught. It also felt weird that you had to sign a form saying that if you weren't out of your room before 11am, you would get a $50 fine on your credit card. And as check in is 4pm they sure have enough time to clean the rooms..

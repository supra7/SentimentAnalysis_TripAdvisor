We've stayed at many hotels in the U.S. and around the world. We had to make last minute arrangements to visit Baltimore and the convention center hotels were full. We ended up at the Hilton Garden Inn. It's OK, the beds are comfortable; our room on the 4th floor was quiet; good desk chair, free internet; it actually is a lot better than we expected. I was disappointed that the housekeepers did not replenish our toiletries or provide us with more bottled water (as part of the Hilton Honors program). Other than that, it is OK for a couple of days business travel stay. $7 to $10 cab fare to the convention center when not rush hour traffic. The greatest thing about this property is that is so close to so many great restaurants - you can walk out the front door and within a block be at Roy's or Oceanaire, a couple of more blocks, Ruth's Chris, McCormick and Schmidts and Little Italy. It is totally do-able for a short stay. I would consider it again. The inner harbor area is so much nicer than the convention center area.

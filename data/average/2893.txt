Eurostars is a landmark fo Madrid.One of the very few sky scrapers in Madrid. It is very hightech. Rooms are overdone in terms of hightech.For 5star it lacks supplies in the bathroom, proper ironing desk(something funny on standard equipment), proper AC (it was or too cold or too warm), English channels on TV. Service is rather avarage. Staff in the restaurant mastered the art of avoiding eye contact - no chance to get they attention.

I was excited to bring my wife to the W in Seattle as I thought it would be a perfect get-away from which to explore the downtown area. My head has been on a Westin pillow many a night - but this was my first chance to "experience" the W effect. We arrived in a downpour but that's ok. One's pupils need not dilate in the W reception area....dark, dark, dark. At 2:00 p.m., all you see are candles and the reflection of the computer screens off the faces of the staff. Hmmm, interesting, I thought. Friendly folks - great "welcome" by the guys at the door, and in no time we were up to our room. I was ready for dark hallways, having read other reviews, but these are REALLY dark. Wow. Interesting. I kinda like it to be honest with you. Room - they call it "spectacular" but I might call it peculiar. Not very large by any stretch, a cool sofa in the window, some IKEA-looking furniture and there you have it. Did we feel a warmth from the room? No. Was the bed "heavenly?" Not if you compare it to the Westin down the road... Overall, the W is a cool place. Yuppies will love it. Techno freaks will love it. I wouldn't bring my kids, or if you are over 50 and want something a bit "classy", there are better choices. Lots better choices. Kudos to the concierge - always on top of things, went the extra mile and did it with a smile. Well done.

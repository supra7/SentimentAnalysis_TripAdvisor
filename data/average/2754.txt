We stayed here in august 2010 for 5 nights with our family. We got a very good deal with booking.com. This year you have to pay twice as much for the same room. Hotel is modern and stylish! Even standard rooms are big and the bed is a king size! The mattress is a little hard. Bathroom is also spacious. You get 6 very small water bottles every day for free, which is nice! We didn't like the staff. They don't show any hospitality. We had a problem with our room keys and had to go back and fort to the front desk, and they kept doing the same mistake at least 4 times. No apologies! This is very sad for a such a nice hotel other wise. We ate the breakfast every morning since it was included our deal. I wouldn't pay for it other wise. But it is above the average in Spain. Location is far away from the city. But is only 10 minute walk from the beach, which is nice! It costed around 20 for 4 people to get to the hotel by taxi from Catalunia Plaza. Not bad! Subway(Lacuna/Yellow line L4) is about 400m away. Neighborhood is a bit weird full with wearhouses and car repair places. Wouldn't like to walk there alone at night. You can find some tapas places aroud the corner, but we went to the city every night.

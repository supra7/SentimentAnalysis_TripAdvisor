On two occasions, the maid attepted to enter our room whilst the do not disturb sign was on the door and well before 12 noon check out. Also, the receptionist moaned at my wife when we requested a hair dryer, which was advertised as being available from the reception desk at the hotel. Otherwise the hotel is clean and in a good location.

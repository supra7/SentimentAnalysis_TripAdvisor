So I didn't know that the W Seattle was undergoing serious renovation to the lobby, bar and restaurant. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have chosen to stay here. Not the fault of the hotel but of the conference organisers who booked the W as part of their package. So with this caveat..... Very friendly staff, mostly helpful but not so much when I asked them why the bar was closed at 10pm. They had a makeshift bar and restaurant in the hotel. They made a great fuss about handing out this schedule on check in. In my room they had left a message for me to contact the front desk to ensure that I had received the schedule. But it was worthless. The bar closing time was midnight on the schedule but in reality, they were closing it whenever they wanted. What's was the point of the schedule? Anyway....the room was good, nice smellies in the bathroom. Terrible view but it was away from the street and so relatively quiet. Nothing else to report really as I didn't really use any of the services. At the conference rate, the hotel would have been a good deal had all the facilities been in place. Without these I would not want to stay there again.

We rented a three bedroom condo at WQ over Memorial day weekend (we were there for 8 days). The condo was beyond what we expected- three bathrooms! It worked out perfectly for our party of six... each of us had our own bed/bath area. The kids loved the pool and the place was very quiet. The grounds were kept up very well, and, overall WQ was clean and very nice. The continental breakfast worked out well for us and our kids... they loved the muffins. We had an issue with our room being left open (presumably by the cleaning staff) which was not dealt with the way we would have expected. Overall, I would rate this hotel ok and would recommend it... just make sure you use the in room safe and keep valuables at home. They need to learn that a problem should be dealt with and not ignored; which is why I rated the experience as average.

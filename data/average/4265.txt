We found the Plaza an excellant place to stay for the location and comfert but were somewhat surprised at there being no fridge in the room, and the biggest shock of all was a $10 daily charge for internet use! The hotel is located next to some excellent resturants and great shopping, including a store where you could buy water to take up to your room as none was provided. All in all we would stay at the Plaza again, but only because of it's location, they are just a bit cheap when it comes to providing basic amenities.

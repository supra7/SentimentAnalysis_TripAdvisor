Just your standard Hilton but the bed wasn't quite as comfortable as the other HIlton's I've stayed in. Very close proximity to the airport (just across the street.) Try to avoid staying in a room that faces the airport because the noise from outside is quite loud at night. I actually like a little bit of road noise to help me sleep but this was over and above a little bit. Parking was expensive, $26/day for valet. Overall it was an ok hotel but definitely nothing special.

Service: Can't say enough about the service. Concierge was fantastic. They went out of their way to make the stay nice. Bar and room service was great. We ordered room service for breakfast every morning. Bar side wait service was great. Food: Lunch by the pool was good. Nice selection and tasted great. The restaurants for dinner left us expecting more. It seemed like they tried too hard on the menus and we didn't particularly enjoy the Italian and Mexican restaurants. The Japanese restaurant was very good though. Room: was very, very nice. I highly recommend the rooms with the swim out pool. The bugs were real bad in the morning and evening so we didn't use it as much as we would have liked. The room, bed and bathroom were real nice though. The air conditioning in the room wouldn't get as cool as we would have liked. Complaints: We are not very picky guests, but they're were a few things that bothered us. First, the air conditioning in the main hall and restaurants didn't seem to work. There were no fans anywhere and it was real hot. Our whole group and everybody around us was always sweating at dinner, sitting by the bar or in the disco. It made things a little uncomfortable. It may be refreshing to the locals, but it didn't cut it for us. Second, the pool area could have had a little more excitement. This resort is obviously set up for people looking to sleep by the pool. They played the slowest, most boring elevator music until noon everyday. The only excitement was pool volleyball everyday. Third, their dress code doesn't make sense. They actually asked us to go put on pants for the Mexican restaurant when we were already wearing nice shorts and it was 100 degrees out. Jeans were ok, but nice shorts were not. This made me mad! Lastly, the mosquitos were horrible in the morning and at night. I know this isn't really anything they can control, but it made it unbearable to be outside when they were bad.

Convenient for Main Station and U/S-bahn. Breakfast good value (5euros), comfort room large and adequate but lights dim. Additional services such as availability of drinks and snacks or comlementary tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms would have been appreciated. The shared entrance and hallway were not clean and created a poor first impression of the Hotel.

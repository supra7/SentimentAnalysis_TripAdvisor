The hotel service is great, the cleanness is super, and safety is present.. but what made my stay at this hotel unbearable are the following: 1) Climate : we went on November the weather was little bit cold so the hotel decided to shut down the A/C, the rooms are steamy hot all day and you can't open the windows so I tried to minimize my stay at the room as much as possible put into consideration that I have a toddler, an other option was keeping the room door open which was inconvenient since you won't have your privacy. 2) Noise : our room was on the 10th floor yet I keep hearing loud music from a night club near by every night starting at 9PM till after midnight and I'm a light sleeper so I didn't have a good sleep through out my stay specially that the mattresses were rock hard while I like having a comfy mattress and they didn't offer other mattress options. adding to that : on the last night I spent on that hotel there were some inconsiderate guests who had their children screaming and shouting up till midnight slamming doors and making any kind of disturbing noise you can imagine ! I called the room guest and the front desk but no use I had to wait for the children to sleep at around 12:30am so that I could finally get myself a decent couple of hours of sleep before my flight ! I was just worried that the noise would wake up my child who was fast asleep at 8:30pm so if you can handle the heat, noise, sleepless nights then this is the hotel for you !! will I visit Istanbul again ? certainly ! will I ever consider staying at this hotel ? Never in a million years !

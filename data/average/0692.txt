We stayed here because priceline had it rated 4 stars and in the Pike Place Market area; both grossly inaccurate! Our room was slightly larger than the full size bed (aka "queen" according to the front desk) and two people could not stand at the bathroom sink at the same time. There was no desk and a bedside table on one side only. Our room was quite warm when we arrived, despite a thermostat setting at 60.5; we complained and when we returned the room was at 72F (22C). The lower room numbers are quite close to the freight train railway crossing, and a note in the room explains that some guests find this romantic especially the bells that ring each time the gates go up or down?  while others will want to use the "complimentary earplugs" they provide. I counted at least 4 crossings during our night there, between 11pm and 8am. They do accommodate pets and were great with our dogs.

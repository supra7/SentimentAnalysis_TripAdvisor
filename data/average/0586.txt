Stayed at the Sheraton while attending a conference during the week of 10/28. The hotel is literally a hop away from the Washington State Convention Center which was extremely convenient. Within 5 blks from the famous Farmers market and ocean ports. Plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. You are definately a cab ride away from the Space needle, SafeCo field and Qwest Stadiums. One thing about Seattle were the ever so present groups of mischevious teenagers hanging out on the streets and the lot of beggars constantly looking for spare change while you tried to navigate the streets and shop. Seattle is a very cute downtown with plenty to see. It smelled very clean and it was great to see the buses didn't emit nasty gases like they do where I'm from in Chicago. As for the hotel, the staff were very friendly and prompt for everything and anything you needed. They seemed to remember you. The lobby was impressive and very modern with nice floral touches. The elevators were always very fast. The room I stayed in was on the 16th floor (right off the bank of elevators), didn't hear a sound any of the 3 nights I stayed here. The room is very plain, didn't feel like a Sheraton, it was a plain room. However it was extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable and had 4 pillows on it! No wifi service in the room you need to go the lobby for free wifi, or pay for it in your room, which is annoying. The room service was very tasty and arrived within 30 minutes as promised. Maid service seemed to come late every day, about 4pm which was a little annoying.

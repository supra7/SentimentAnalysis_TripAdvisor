We stayed over the holidays.. What an awful mistake to stay at the Hyatt Regency Boston. The room service food was just plain bland tasteless raw chicken.. The chicken sandwich about the only decent item on the hotel menus unless you specify burn the chicken cook it throughly it will come raw cold and white with sprinkle black pepper and to top if off kinda expensive two chicken sandiwh with one clam chouder soup about $50 .. The only good thing is the Breakfast in the restaurant the food is fresh and for $5 extra you can have it cooked in front of you egg whites, pancakes. etc. If you ever in Columbus , Ohio The Hyatt in capital is the best of its kind. The Regency room serves fresh fruits, crossants. you name it they have it.. The rooms at the Columbus Hyatt are so spacious .. It is a shame to even be compare this the Boston Hyatt.

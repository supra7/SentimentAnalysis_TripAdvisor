We used Priceline to bid on the hotel. Paid only $70 per night for a standard queen room. You would think the Front Desk should be the "FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE" for the hotel. The staffs barely greeted you. I was standing there for almost 5 mins & only one person in front of me. Front desk staffs stared at me for a little while before he said anything. ****Check in was for bad.**** Arrived early & the room was not ready. Front desk told us they would call once the room is available. Check in time was 4PM. No phone called from them, called the hotel ourselves at 4:30PM was told the room now available. We arrrive at 6PM. Guessed what?!! NO ROOM STILL. Waited another 30mins. WATCH OUT. We got the bill for all the charges everything looked fine. When tried to pay we were told THERE AND THEN. there were a $35 charges per night for upgrade. WOO HOO. What a surprise??? We were not even told when we waited 4 hours for our room. SWEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTT!!! After all the compliants NOW here are the good sides of the hotel: Room was fine. Roomservices were very warm & professional. But setting is old. It was a very old building. Great location for first time traveller. It is only worth for 4 stars for the "Hyatt" name. Front desk services are barely there. Amenties were just average. From my world travel experience I would give it a 3 stars.

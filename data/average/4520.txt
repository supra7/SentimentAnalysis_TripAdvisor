At the first night, bath towel is missing, so I left a note. At the second night, everything is OK , so I let 5 dollars. At the third night, the room was not cleaned, so I left only two dollars, At the fourth night, unbelievably, the bath gel and treatment was missing, and my toothbrush and toothpaste were missing! I could not help that it was done on purpose!! I have never experienced such a poor housekeeping at so-called star hotel!!

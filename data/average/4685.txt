I stayed here two nights with my parents and my boyfriend. Our room was clean but the beds are very uncomfortable. The location is great. The pool is clean but it has so much chlorine, more than any other pool I've ever been in. Our skin and eyes hurt after a 20 minute swim. The valet parking was great, the desk clerks and housekeeping staff were very nice.

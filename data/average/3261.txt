great location near st marks with an excellent wine bar adjacent. Very quaint. Room was very dark as faced another building side on, No full length mirror, small bathroom. Breakfast was average, and served in a small room with tables close to each other. Honest bar at top of hotel offers a nice view but v small so only would fit 2 couples. Free internet is a great offering.

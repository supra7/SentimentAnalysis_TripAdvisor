I am in the Hyatt Maui right now. It's my 1st day here. I am writing this review in the room. I am going to stay here for 3 nights for my honeymoon since tonight, but we are not satisfied about the Hyatt. When checking in, we were told that $25 resort fee is required for EVERYONE! I was not told about this before and after booking. I cannot find the information on their web site. We have NO CHOICE for the resort fee. I don't think it's reasonble. And, the room is facing ... parking lot!! Besides, our room is UNDER the lobby! We are in level 1 and lobby is in level 2. Face to parking lot and lower than lobby!? Are you kidding me? And, actually, TV is useless unless you pay for it. We need to pay for most activities in Hyatt. The most horrible part is, I saw some reviews here and they said the snacks are located above weight sensitive machine?! After seeing the reviews, I saw our snacks, and found it seems that they are truly above some kinds of weight sensitive machine! We might touch some snacks before seeing the review. Now, we are worrying about being charged. Overall, we feel like, we would be charged for almost EVERYTHING and the quality of rooms is not so good. It's just OK. Don't have higher expectation for the Hyatt, or you'll be disappointed.

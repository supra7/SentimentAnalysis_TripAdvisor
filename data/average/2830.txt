I took a last minute trip to Amsterdam and chose this hotel as it was one of the few to have rooms available at a decent rate in a good area. The location is brilliant - easy to get to from central station on the tram and very close to the Van Gogh museum and Rijksmuseum in one of the nicest parts of the city - something I appreciated as a single female traveller. The hotel does look terrible from the outside at the moment as it is covered in scaffolding and nets, and you have to access it via scaffolding steps at the side, but inside the room was fine. Be warned though - I checked in at 11am (the stated check in time) and was given a key to a room that had not yet been cleaned, though this was quickly rectified by friendly, efficient staff. The room (once done) was clean and comfortable for the price, and was quiet at night. Unfortunately it is not the best choice if you plan on spending any time in the room during the day. I attempted an afternoon nap but was disturbed by the builders knocking windows out in the room above, and felt the need to have the curtains closed as the builders were walking past my window all the time. All in all though, it is a nice little hotel and a bargain at the moment if you are prepared to put up with the renovations.

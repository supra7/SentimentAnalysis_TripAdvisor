All in all it was a pleasant stay in a nice hotel. For the price paid you got value for money. Good points: - Location (bus runs past the hotel that takes you into the centre of London. 15mins walk from Camden High Street - where the closest tube station is) - Room was clean, reasonably spacious and well presented. (towels were changed daily, but the sheets were not changed in our 5 day stay). Bad points - Room had no air-con (so in 30 degree heat it was unbearable at night). When you opened the windows the noise from the traffic outside was deafening, at virtually any time of the day or night. - Beds and pillows were fairly uncomfortable - The continental breakfast was extremely limited. In terms of food there was a choice of cereal, toast and.... well, thats it really!! - Our room was 4 floors up, with no lift. Be prepared for a big workout, lugging your cases upstairs.

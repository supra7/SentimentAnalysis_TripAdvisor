We paid extra to be on the "Concierge Level". These "recently renovated" rooms are no different than the rooms on the lower levels. No view and the same small "charming rooms" as in the rest of the hotel. The lounge amenities aren't enough to account for the difference in cost. The street noise (despite a room on the 15th floor) kept us up all night and didn't quiet down even on Sunday morning. The hotel is in a nice spot with great access to many downtown offerings but there are far better options in the area.

We choose this hotel because it offered, modern decor, quadruple rooms and was in a central location. Agree with the others - breakfast was poor, very poor. Orange squash masquerading as fruit juice - sent our kids loopy. Plastic cheese, processed ham, stale bread, undrinkable coffee - by the forth morning of our stay we couldn't face it anymore and if you've ever gone looking for breakfast in Rome, you'll realise that it's not something the Italians are big into - unless you fancy a cake, or a coffee while you stand at a counter. We were so desperate we even tried McDonalds but again a cake was the only thing on offer. So the poor quality of the breakfast is probably more important that it first seemed - as there is little alternative offered by nearby cafes. In subsequent hotels we stayed in the standard of breakfast was much higher, so I wouldn't agree that it's a typical continental breakfast. Fix the breakfast and we'd return - until then no way!

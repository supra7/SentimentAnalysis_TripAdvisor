Got a good deal on Priceline and so had an okay stay for 2 days. Nice rooms but poor housekeeping - they didn't clean the coffee maker or replenish the coffee supplies/coffee mugs. Beds were very comfortable. There were absolutely no extras - as everyone else has mentioned, they charge the earth for everything other than your bed. Parking is ridiculously expensive but you can park streetside on some of the back streets and come in through the back entrance. Free airport shuttle was convenient though.

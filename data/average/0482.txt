My wife and I stayed here for a marriage weekend and were physically in the hotel for the entire weekend. Here's the rundown: CONS: The first room we were put in was in a section of the hotel undergoing renovations. The hall had exposed cabling and the walls were being worked on. Our room was small and faced Aurora which is a very noisy street. (we were moved later - see PROS.) The hotel building itself was poorly built - the bathroom tile floor was freezing cold (the second floor sits over the parking area - my guess is no insulation in the floor) and the halls and the meeting room were very cold and drafty at times. The area of the city the hotel is in is just OK - a little sketchy but a quick walk to great restaurants and Seattle Center. PROS: We realized we made an error in our reservation and were moved to a different room already reserved for us by the conference. The manager was very friendly and helpful and canceled our old reservation no charge, no problem even though we had already checked in several hours earlier. The new room was in a newly renovated part of the hotel that was tastefully decorated and the room itself was big and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. We had all of our meals for the conference catered by the hotel and the food was very good - much better than food I've had at more upscale hotel conferences. The hotel rates are really good for Seattle in an area walkable to city happenings. In short - I think most people wouldn't be in the hotel all weekend like we were for the conference. If hotel atmosphere is very important to you, you may want to pass on this one. If you want a clean, comfortable place to sleep with helpful staff at a good rate, and you're exploring the city, this would be an economical and good choice.

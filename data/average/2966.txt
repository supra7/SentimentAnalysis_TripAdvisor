The hotel has a weird entrance. You need to use the elevator to get to the reception. The lobby is very unfriendly and dark at night and the elevators are old. The staff were very nice however and they acknowledged priority club members. Location: The area looks a bit hostile at dark. The surrounding is not very welcoming and you wouldnt feel safe walking around. The closest tube is 5 min walk. Staff and Service: Very nice and polite and very helpful. Room: Dark with old furniture and noisy uncomfortable bed. Food: The breakfast is included in the rate but it's average at its best. Price: I stayed at 110 Euros a night. You can get better hotel which are more central with that rate. anything below 80 Euros a night would be more reasonable for the room you get. Would I stay there again? Possible not. I would try to go to more central hotels.

This is a perfectly adequate, nice little hotel in a good location in Chicago near the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. Its rooms are nice, even if they aren't fancy. Great blankets on the beds. The staff is very helpful, the pool and hot tub are nice, and the restaurants in the building are quite good as well. But it needs to be said that if you stay at this hotel you risk hearing sirens at all hours of the day due to the firehouse next door. We even requested a room change to the side of the building farthest from the firehouse (which the staff granted us as soon as they could), but we still heard sirens. I knew about the firehouse before I booked, thanks to this website. However, it didn't seem to bother most of the reviewers, and some people we talked to at the hotel also didn't seem bothered by it. After I got some earplugs it wasn't much of a problem for me either. But it's something to take into consideration. P.S. I am from New York City, so it's not like I'm not used to city noises.

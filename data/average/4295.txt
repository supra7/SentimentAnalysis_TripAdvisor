My husband and I got an amazing deal for a 1 night stay, so decided to go for the night. The hotel is in a great location and the lobby is very elegant. We did battle to find the check in desk as it is on the opposite side to the parking. Also, there is valet parking only-for a $30 a night fee!! The room was a bit small and the heating system was quite noisy. However it was very clean and presentable. We loved the location of the hotel. The in-house restaurant is very expensive, however, a few blocks away is Cheers, and of course many other restaurants in the are.

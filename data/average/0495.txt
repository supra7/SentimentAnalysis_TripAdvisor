My husband and I stayed here for four nights at the end of our Canadian adventure holiday. Out of all the hotels we stayed in, it would probably be the bottom of our list but that's not to say it was terrible. The location is good, very near the space needle and although we didn't go up the needle, we did go on the Duck tour (highly recommended) which was near the needle. It was about a 15 minute walk to the centre of the downtown area, but if you go down Denny Way towards Westlake Drive it is more picturesque than going any other way. Whole Foods Market is nearby and we had breakfast there twice. We didn't use the buffet breakfast in the hotel as both times we looked in it was very crowded - obviously popular! There was a pool and hot tub which looked clean although we didn't use them either. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives - the room and indeed the whole corridor had a 'sour milk' fragrance going on! Not sure if this is the smell from the cleaning fluids or what. The air conditioning unit in the room was VERY loud so we had to suffer the heat at night as we turned it off. You could also hear the people above moving around above us. Having said this, the bedding and bathroom were very clean. We wouldn't let the above put is off staying here again and indeed talking to the staff just before they left, they said the hotel is always full and very popular with families.

Pluses: Clean hotel overall. Friendly and responsive staff. In a relatively safe and quiet neighborhood, and not too far from Metro or Tram stations. There is a decent breakfast buffet, which is included in the nightly rate. The nightly rate is very affordable. Minuses: The telephone buttons are confusing. I had an extra local call charged because I didn't understand the graphics on the buttons. Internet is available, reliable and fast, but is not free. There is a charge associated with both Wi-Fi and in-Lobby use. Reportedly, wakeup calls are also charged. No clear-cut directions as to what in the TV costs extra, and what is free. There is no restaurant, gym, or pool. The hotel can be a little difficult to find.

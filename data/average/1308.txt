I don't know if its because i have high expectations when it comes to the Marriott but i was didn't like my room at this place. the staff is great don't get me wrong but when it came to the room well... i didn't feel comfortable. i hate it when my bathroom is dirty at home but can you imagine a hotel bathroom where hundreds of people have used it. their showers are tiled and they don't keep this tile clean. also when i went to close my curtains i got a gust of dust. another thing i didnt like was the shuttle is not 24 hours. i needed to be at the airport at 3am and they didn't have a shuttle running. so now is the day after my stay at the Marriott and Im now at the comfort suites in tukwila. 24 hour shuttle, very clean and large room, great staff and they gave us pizza and salad as an afternoon snack and breakfast in the morning for free. i would not recommend the Marriott but i would the comfort suites

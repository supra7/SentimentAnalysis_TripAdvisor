Being our first time in Singapore this was not a bad hotel. It was clean and the service was good. Expect most rooms to be smaller than usual. The American breakfast was OK with little flavor so the next day i asked for cereal which was a big mistake because they do not have fresh milk. The area seemed a little unsafe when we arrived there after 11pm and every time we wanted to get out of the area we had to catch the train which wasn't that inconvenient but you couldn't really walk where you would want to go. After getting to know Singapore a little better i would stay in a busier area such as Bugis. If you are visiting Singapore i would definitely recommend seeing 'Dr Fish' (little fish which nibble at your feet)!

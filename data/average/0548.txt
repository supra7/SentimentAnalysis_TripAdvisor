It's a tale of two towers here, folks. One is actually very new, modern, clean and comfortable. That's the Union St. Tower. Then you have its horrendous sister, Pike Tower, which they actually shouldn't be selling whatsoever. The decor, carpet, furnishings and the like are at least 15 years old (I got some inside information) and a Holiday Inn is going to be more up to date. Cheap, worn beds with even cheaper headboards that creak and pop--there's nothing sweet about sleeping here in the Pike Tower. The Union Tower is recommended and you get what you're paying for. Of course, Starwood isn't going to tell you this; luckily Tripadvisor is here.

The Hyatt Regency Boston is a typical mid-scale business hotel located in an odd building whose immediate neighborhood is less than attractive, but close to many things. Staffers were eager to please. It is on a par with a Sheraton or Hilton, but a solid notch below a Westin or Omni. I would not object to staying there again, but if I am doing the reserving on a future Boston trip, I will seek a better alternative. We booked a larger, extra- cost "corner room". The building is shaped like a piece of pie and "corner" turned out to be the very point of the pie piece. What a weird room with truly useless space! The decor is OK, but nothing special. I'm 6'1" and my feet hung off the end of the King bed, though they did not hang off the end of our prior hotel's King bed and did not hang off the end of our subsequent hotel's queen bed. My conclusion is the King beds are wide but short. The quality of food and breadth of choice at the breakfast buffet were outstanding. The hotel somehow adjoins Boston's old retail heart and theater district. Both went to seed a long time ago. We never felt unsafe, only unimpressed. The hotel has only a tiny entrance at street level and then requires an elevator ride to the lobby on the third floor, which negates the sense of "entrance" you get when you walk into a nice hotel. Hyatt does a good job with a compromised building in a compromised neighborhood. The original architect should be serving a sentence in Design Prison. It is 5 minutes and a world away from Back Bay and Beacon Hill.

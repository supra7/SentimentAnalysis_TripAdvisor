We've stayed at this property a few times now. We like the hotel for it's location. The hotel is walking distance to pike Market and al the shopping in Seattle. The hotel has parking which you have to pay a small fee for and the nightly rate we payed was 99$. The rooms are clean and they have good beds. We've never experienced any problems in our stays.

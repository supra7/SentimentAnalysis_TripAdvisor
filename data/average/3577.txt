2 families 4 adults 4 kids - 2,5,7, & 9 We just returned from our first trip to Disney World and we stayed at WorldQuest for 7 nights. We enjoyed our stay at the resort and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good price and convenient location. We stayed in the 3 bedroom condo with another family and it was plenty of space. The resort seems to be fairly new but don't expect top notch appliances or flat screen TV's. The rooms were clean and we had no problem with noise. The pool was also very nice but nothing special. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I don't think it's a 4 or 5 star resort. We paid about $150/ Night. Divide that by 2 families and that equals a very affordable trip. With all the places to stay in that area, we will be trying another resort for our next trip.

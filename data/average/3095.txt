Quaint little hotel but in oh so wrong a location. Cracks in the wall give testimony to the fact the room quite literally shook everytime a tram went past. Just when you were looking forward to the trams stopping for the night the boom boom boom from the bar next door took over. It was enough to wake the dead, which it might easily have done since there was a huge cemetery literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel! Hotel inside was quite charming, facilities had been modernised yet it was still decorated very traditionally. Continental Breakfast was provided and coffee good. If its a basic value for money hotel you're looking for about 20 mins walk from Rome centre but in a small studenty suburb (San Lorenzo) this might actually suit you quite well.

recently stayed here. The room was nice, small pool, very good maid service,but the floors are super thin and you can hear every footstep above you. One group of young adults above us actually had our ceiling vibrating because of their jumping up and down. We were on the second floor and had shower water from their third floor room come through the ceiling into our bathroom twice! very unsanitary. The staff wiped the floor with towels but it was still a gross unsanitary experience. Received calls continuously from one office employee who said he couldn't sleep at night in the office because the children were making to much noise with their feet on the super thin floors. The beach at this location was very treacherous for young children. Definately not worth the reduced price for what you have to endure.

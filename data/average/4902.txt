The Palmer Hilton House is a wonderful structure with incredible lounges and restaurants. The location is very good for downtown access. It has all the amenities and services you would expect from a Hilton business hotel. My biggest problem with the hotel was the small rooms. I felt like I was in a downtown London hotel. The bathrooms were particularly small, and the overall decor within the room felt dated. I travel a fair amount for business and I'm quite adept at traveling light and minimizing my spread within a hotel room, but I found it difficult to get comfortable even for a 2 night stay. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with this hotel, and I would consider staying there again in the future or even recommending it to friends or colleagues.

Pluses for Inn at the Market - comfy bed, decent sized room with two cozy arm chairs, convenient to stroll Pike Place Market Minuses - when we read "boutique hotel" we expect something special. We were disappointed. Nonexistent concierge service is one of our gripes. Also, for an 8 story "boutique" hotel where you would expect above average service, we were surprised to see the note that we must make our room available by 9:00 AM or we would not be serviced AT ALL! Hey, we're on vacation, would like to sleep later. Food recommendation for breakfast by the front desk staff was awful. We did better with coffe and croissants in Pike Place Market. I'm just glad we chose a less expensive street view room rather than the $325 one.

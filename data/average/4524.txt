I was given a room at the Hyatt Regency for a work event early the next day. Staying in the theater district/downtown on a weekend night isn't exactly conducive to getting a good's night's sleep, but I avoided the temptations and went to bed early. Or at least tried. Few places I've stayed at have been as loud as this place Slamming doors and people walking up and down the hallway were compounded by the fact that there is an atrium that allows noise from several floors to cascade up and down. I clearly heard my neighbor come in at about 2 a.m. and use the bathroom twice, and several co-workers were less than amused by their neighbors late night exploits in bed. You would think a place such as this would better soundproof their walls. Added to this is the $32 parking fee. At least my employer paid for it.

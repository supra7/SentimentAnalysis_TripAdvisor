This may be one of the largest hotels in Boston. And that will contribute to your experience of this hotel. Service is very anonymous, but accurate. Rooms are quite large and especially when you have a room in a higher floor, views are fantastic. But do not go here for a romantic weekend; then I would suggest Copley Square Hotel, where i also stayed for two days. For bussiness the hotel is ok. Although there is no Wifi! You will have to pay additionally for LAN internet... Breakfast buffet is great.

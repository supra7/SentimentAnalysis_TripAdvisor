Stayed here for a night when i was transferring. I usually dont do this hotel since there are alot of better properties a short taxiride away but it had been booked for me so I just walked over and chacked in. Check in chaotic. No queue and it took a fair bit of time for me to get served. the lady serving me was the most clueless lady I have ever come across at a hotel checkin in Singapore. Surprised me... Got a standard room. It was quiet i didnt hear any noise from airplanes etc. I am not a sensitive sleep though. Bed was soso, small black stain on the linnen. Wasked of course but for the price I dont want that. Nothing wrong with the room, enough TV channels, enough lights etc but nothing that stood out either. Aircon hadnt been cleaned since they opened the hotel. Lots of dust around it. Bathroom had some mould in the corners not expected from such a new property. Breakfast adequate, no cheese slicer or decent cheese. My lithmus test for an hotel is the cheese. Those that care have good cheese and pay attentiopn to such a detail, those that just do a cheap breakfast have packaged cheese. This property went with packaged cheese. Check out smooth surprisingly enough after the bad experience at check in. this time I wasnt served by an inidan looking lady but a filippina and to be honest I dont want to publih names but the indian looking lady that checked me in didnt know what she was doing :-) Avoid her if you can since she isnt good at her job. Would i stay here again, not for the price my company paid. Add on the taxi fair and go to the city instead or if youre on a transfer with a morning departure you might as well book a hotel thats close by and save some cash. If your company pays then by all means go there, the sleep is fine, Internet works and the property is ok.

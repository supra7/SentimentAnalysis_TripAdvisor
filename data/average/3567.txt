Our room was $249 plus tax. We read the reviews and thought it was what we were looking for. We wanted a boutique style hotel, smaller establishment, but modern clean and fun. We first were greeted by the valet attendant who didn't seem happy to be working. Once inside, I waited in a small quiet lobby area in front of the check out desk for about 4 minutes before coughing loud enough for the girl to scurry out from the back. She didn't ask whether I've stayed there before, didn't offer any type of upgrade, whether at my expense or not, and didn't mention anything about the wine reception mentioned on travelocity's booking page. Keys were issued, and I'm not sure if she even smiled. It was wierd that our room was inside a Separate key-access lobby area. We had to key access one door to enter into a small foyer type area to find 4 doors, one of them being our hotel. Upon entering our room, my husband immediately said "there's no windows!?" That was surprising and wierd too. I've never experienced that in all my travels. I asked if it bothered him and we sat puzzled and thought it's not that big of deal.but by the time we checked out the next day, we felt as though we slept in a closet, like we were imprisioned. I never asked upon leaving because there was noone at the front desk again. I went back and looked at the travelocity website and there was only one style of room offered. Also, the bathroom was new and sleek but awkward. It was a sliding wooden door next to the bed, so basically it was part of the room- no privacy. The sink was a pedestal style but there was no shelf of any kind to put your blowdryer down, much less a makeup bag or room for even a shaving cream bottle. Once again, awkward and inconvienent. Why didn't she offer us to upgrade? Not sure, considering the place was practically vacant with roughly 20 cars between valet and the self parking lot ($13 a day). I left there feeling extremely ripped off.

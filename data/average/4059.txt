We usually stay at the Sheraton, but wanted to try the Marriott because it was a slightly more convenient location and about $40 less per night, but I will be returning to the Sheraton on my next visit. The lobby of the Marriott is nice with a wall-sized big screen TV in the sports bar. Location is also excellent for Prudential Center, Back Bay and parents visiting their students at Berklee or Northeastern. The decor in the rooms definitely needs an upgrade and hallways and rooms were not super clean. Staff was helpful and friendly. Because it's a non-smoking hotel (good thing) everyone hangs out around the front entrance smoking, which I thought was pretty disgusting. I also don't like when hotels charge you to use the computers in their business centers.

The hotel is very lovely but the staff is quite rude. Everyone from the bellhop to the desk clerk seemed as if they were going out of their way to make things difficult for me. I waited forever at check in with heavy bags and no help getting throught the double doors or up to my room. The worst part was the desk clerk checking out.... tap tap tap on the computer as my car waited out side to pick me up for almost 20 minutes. When I got home I also noticed the 1,000 dollar hold they put on my credit card that took 5 phonecalls, 2 faxes and 1 week to get resolved. I now stay at The Warwck on 4th and Lenora where the rooms are OK..but al least I have some friendly faces after a tiring day at the airport.

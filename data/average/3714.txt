OK location for down town events, but you are forced to valet park. Our first time trying to retrieve our car took 45 minutes. Hotel was full for weddings and sporting events, but 45 minutes to get a car is just not acceptable. For big events, bring on more staff. On Saturday morning, it took 20 minutes to get an elevator down from the 17th floor, because only two banks of 5 were in service. We ended up just adding 90 minutes to our wedding schedule just to make sure we could be places on time. On Sunday morning, only two people working the car valet desk. This time they could not find our keys. We had dropped off around 11 PM the night before which was a busy time, and the valet handed me what turned out to be the parking slip from my keys which he had ripped off. Next morning, no keys. With a line of people starting to que up for cars behind me, I ended up searching their board for my keys and then walking two block to their parking garage and literally walking the floors to find where they had parked my car. Fortunately they found my keys in a corner of the valet desk where they had been tossed the night before. Time to get my car on a Sunday morning? A much improved 25 minutes. We also got panhandled right outside their front door on Saturday morning. Not on the street, but in their interior entry courtyard. So much for security. On the other hand, they were all very polite and friendly.

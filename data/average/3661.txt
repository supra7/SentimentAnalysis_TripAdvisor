I had a recent stay here. The hotel was fine, it did not strike me as a 4 star hotel though. The room was VERY dark and bathroom getting kind of dated. The view was overlooking the area where they do conferences so the natural light was minimal and the most annoying aspect....there are no light switches for the lights besides bathroom and foyer. I had to turn each lamp on and off manually. I know it sounds petty but it was a pain in the rear. In short, for an inter continental pedigree.....I was expecting a little higher end, but more than adequate. I still get annoyed at nice hotels charging for wifi......BUT they do offer self park for free which is a pleasure.

This is an older hotel with small rooms. The walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbors breathing! It was so loud, I was woken up several times throughout the night. I was attending a conference. The food was excellent as was the morning coffee. It got crowded when sessions ended and people needed to get upstairs. The elevators shake when there are more than 5 people! It's renovated and charming, but too old to accommodate modern uses.

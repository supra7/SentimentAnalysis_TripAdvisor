We were going to Vegas for our wedding, and having booked on Priceline, we didn't have a choice in which 5 star hotel we got. We were disappointed when we ended up with the Trump, having read some bad reviews on Tripadvisor. But we went with an open mind, and hoped for the best. I can only reiterate what most people are saying, the rooms are gorgeous, the lack of smoke was great....HOWEVER..the service is severely lacking for a 5 star hotel. From check in, to check out, we had bad experiences everywhere. Front desk rudeness, to the bell desk losing a package that was delivered to us, housekeeping leaving wet towels on our floor, to the concierge forgetting to book the shuttle to the airport for us...it was one thing after another. Needless to say, after 5 days here, we were happy to go home. Will not stay again, no matter what the rate.

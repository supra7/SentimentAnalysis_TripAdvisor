My husband and I chose this resort because of its marketing of great food, great service, and eco-tourism. Do not go to this resort if you are looking for culinary delights--it is about Perkins quality at best. I am so disappointed, that this is the first time I have ever taken steps to review a facility. We arrived late Sat night and had a full 15 hours of traveling behind us. Instead of being given our room keys, we were told to sit and wait for the concierge. The concierge turned out to be nothing more than a time share sell and a little info that they could (but don't) provide in a map. BTW- we paid full price, all-inclusive for this...no discount for the timeshare pitch deals. We finally said "Enough" and requested keys to our room. By the time we got unpacked and settled, there were not many dinner options. We requested a menu at the restaurant and were told buffet only. After eating an awful meal, we learned there were menus available but the server wanted us in his buffet section. The Asian fusion restaurant was OK, but not any better than the sushi we can get here in Wisconsin. We were treated rudely at the Mexican Restaurant. The Grill by the pool had by far the best food and the best service. The buffet was awful. They "French bakery and coffee" was nescafe with some frozen pastries heated up. Not kidding. If you aren't all inclusive, expect to pay a ridiculous amount of money for the food. We had to order breakfast room service one morning because we were leaving for a tour early before the restaurants opened. We ordered an $80 (US) breakfast, and were served 2 lousy scrambled eggs, refried beans, toast, coffee, and juice. It was ridiculous. The facility itself is beautiful, but to make it clear- it is set back into the mangroves. We loved the eco-friendly culture. We were very disappointed with some of the staff and the lousy food--2 or 3 star quality food. 4 star building.

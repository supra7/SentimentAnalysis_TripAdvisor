The Place doesn't look like much from the outside, but looks are decieving. the rms. are nicely decorated and clean. Rooms are great for a family that will be visting area theme parks. Beds and pillows are very, very comfortable!! TV is nice touch. The in rm. fridge is a God send. I love the fridge and toaster oven because we take our stuff to make sand. for our lunches at the parks. Toaster oven helps keep night meal cost down. Just stop by Publix or Target and pick up something to cook. They even have in rm coffee for the parents so we can keep up with the kids. A.C. has worked great each time we have stayed. Hairdryers nice to keep from bringing so much stuff. Free cont. bfk.: cereal, instant grits & oatmeal, boiled eggs, toast, bagles, muffins, oj, coffee... but get ther early to get a table, eating area king of small, but you can always take it back to your rm. . Convient store & a Mcdonalds in front and another rest. too. Nice pool for kids. I believe it is heated. Very friendly and helpful staff. Takes less than 10 min to get to Majic Kingdom gate. We have passes, so we love this hotel and visit often. Lots of near by rest. and mini-golf courses and shopping. Target , Publix, and Walgreens less than 5 min. away. The only down that I could find would be the bathroom size & no tub, but we don't bathe in tubs in a hotel rm,.but it works great after a long day at the parks near by. Rms are a little small but if your visting the parks your not there much anyway. GREAT ROOM FOR THE PRICE!!!!

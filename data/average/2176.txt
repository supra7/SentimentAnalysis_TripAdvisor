We had a nice stay and with the exception of a single staff member the employees were really wonderful to us. Even in that one case they were very nice, they just did not follow through on what they had said they would do and it was a minor thing (we needed a few more hangers and some bowls for cereal). The rooms are plenty big, though you can find bigger. There is not anything right there really but the mall, however it is a easy, quick walk to the strip. Parking only valet and is free though we always tipped the valet. The view is nice in both directions. The reports of the train with the horn blasting that passes on the non-strip side are also true. I am a heavy sleeper so it did not bother me much, but my wife was awoken by it. However my major issue is my concern about some itchy spots I noticed a few days into the stay. I did not think much about it but more appeared. I showed them to a dermatologist friend who thought they might well be bed bugs. I say most likely of course because I did not see any actual bed bugs or I would have let someone know while we were there. Another member of our party in a different room developed a similar thing. I sent an e-mail to customer service about 2 weeks ago, not to threaten or ask for anything, but to let them know they might have a problem. The most suprising thing to me was that I have recieved no reply at all.

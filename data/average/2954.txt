hey there. i stayed here with just my husband last year during bike week. we were kinda doing a second short honeymoon before my second child was born..the hotel has a great location. and for the price we couldnt beat that...not during bike week at least. but if you are looking for a nice hotel with a view and elevator et cetera this isnt the place. the staff was very nice. they accomadated my husband since he is a smoker. they let him smoke in the room as long as the window was open.walking up all them stairs when you are pregnant not fun but its def. good exercise..would i stay there again??yeah but not with my kids. i have two young ones and carrying them up all the steps forget it. but if you are looking for a cheap stay for only two nights and then its your place. the only downfall was because it was bike week you could hear them revving their engines to almost 3am in the morning...the noise factor kinda sucked but minus that the rest of the hotel wasnt bad

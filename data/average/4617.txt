Loved this hotel for it's location, history and elegance. The rooms were appointed in true Fairmont fashion. Fairmont President's Club amenity was a bag of the most amazing salt water taffy. I would say by far the best from Fairmont I have seen to date (great local amenity). Clean and comfy rooms - interesting city views. My love for this property really stopped at the historical aspect. I found the hotel staff with the exception of the bell staff ... to be extremely pretentious. As a tourist, I found the concierge to be unhelpful and judgemental. As the highest tier of their loyalty program, I didn't feel any love from the staff here that I am accustomed to. Rooms were charming yet lacked basic amenities such as tea and coffee. I thought that was a bit strange, as Fairmont prides itself on their teas - strange not to see it represented in the room. For the right price, I would recommend this hotel, but there are many better options in Boston.

Spent a long weekend here for a large family reunion. We're a family of four, our two kids are 14 and 11. On the plus side: the hotel location is great, right in midst of downtown Chicago, plenty of sights, shops, and restaurants just a short walk away. Very kid-friendly, with a Wii hookup and free computer access in the lobby. Lots of common space/seating area in the lobby, which of course, was perfect for family-reunion type gatherings and relaxing. Breakfast buffet was included -- the food isn't anything to write home about, but not something to complain about either. On the "less plus" side: our room was small for the four of us -- two double beds and a sofabed, which was tight even with the sofabed closed. On our first attempt at opening the sofabed, there wasn't enough room to open it all the way, since it bumped into the desk and the desk was attached to the wall and couldn't be moved. We eventually had to rearrange the furniture to reposition the sofabed so that it could be used. Long story short, it made for cramped quarters. Now, we didn't spend much time in the room anyway, but it's sort of a pain in the neck to try and make your way around a weirdly positioned sofabed in the middle of the night on the way to the bathroom. Both the gym and the pool are small, so if that's important to you, you might consider other options. Despite my complaints about the room, we had a wonderful time in Chicago and the location of the hotel and the common lobby areas made for a nice family gathering

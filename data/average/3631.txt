Front desk was excellent. Parking lot a little funky to get into. Went to Courtyard in error. Courtyard is more prominent when pulling in lot, had to go to the back for Fairfield. One small entrance. Bathroom is one with sink outside toilet/tub area so if you like that, this will work for you. Room ok, we were so tired as long as we could sleep. Didn't have a freezer we could put blue ice packs in overnight for early departure which is helpful when driving 15 hour days to keep sodas and food fresh. Overall ok, staff nice, quiet sleep once we got there.

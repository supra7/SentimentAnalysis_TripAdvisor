We stayed at this hotel on the way to a cruise. The room was very clean and the service was excellent. The beds were comfortable and blackout curtains a blessing. This would have been a great stay except for the breakfast. The hotel did not provide a buffet breakfast like other Embassy Suites. Although we were in an Atrium, the food was in one small section. The hot food area provided omelets, pancakes and bacon. Next to that area there was a counter with honeydew melon, grapefruit, yogurt and a small plate a pastries. Drinks were in the area across from this counter.This was very disappointing and left me searching the atrium for other food choices. This breakfast buffet is unlike what we were used to from other Embassy Suites.

I had the opportunity to stay at the Magnolia Hotel in Dallas, TX November 11, 2005. Overall, this is a decent property. However, there were some issues. Valet parking is slow and at times unresponsive. The elevators seems to take a long time. I stayed in one of the signature suites which was nicely appointed. However, the pipes in the bathroom made a lot of noise whenever the shower was turned on. Unfortunately, I left two articles of clothing in my room which I did not notice until I had checked out of the hotel. I called the hotel immediately and was transferred to the lost and found department. I left a very detailed message but my call was never returned. After three attempts, I was eventually able to contact someone in housekeeping and was advised that nothing was found in my room. I know without question that these items were left in the room. Based on the integrity displayed by the housekeeping staff, I would advise you to safe guard your property and don't make the mistake of leaving anything behind.

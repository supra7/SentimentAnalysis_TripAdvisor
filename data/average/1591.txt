As one of the front desk clerks told to a customer: "It isn't made to be functional, it is made to be good loking". Maybe these phrase resume what this Eurostars hotel, located in Passieg the Gracia superb location, is it's best description. It definitely is not a 5 stars hotel. Design of the rooms makes you feel kind of uncomfortable, since the bathroom is practically located within the room. Good looking, not functional. You can't wash your teeth without bumping your head with a silly shelf above the good loking washstands. Of course we didn't know about these bathroom issues, and will look for somewhere else to stay in other ocassion. We had a great terrace on our room and we could relax and have a glass of wine there after a working day. Could feel the Barcelona way of living. This was great. Bed was very comfortable and clean. To honour the good, all of the staff was ver friendly, professional and helpful in any way needed. Breakfast was always well appointed and served with courtesy. The superb locations is the best with a tranquil area to dine around and every other important attraction of the city very near from the hotel. For shoppers this surely is a very good place to stay. Do try the BCN if you have an open mind for modern design.

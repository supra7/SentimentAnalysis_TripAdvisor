"Hotel was good value of money.day receptionist was very nice .He was really a professional guy, but night receptionist was very rude, horrible, disgusting, and totally unprofessional.i am sure he was drunk.he told us to come back before 12.00 pm otherwise i won"t be able to let you guys inn at cost of my own sleep.he was very rude during breakfast and then he asked us to check out before 10; Am.when i ask him that we have been told by day receptionist that check out time is 11;00Am, He said day guy do not know anything, he is my employee . I am the owner and you have to listen me and follow my instruction.We had a really bad experience ever with this guy.

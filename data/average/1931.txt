My husband and I stayed at KBH for 3 days in Nov. as part of a 10 day trip to Maui. Our first room was in the Moloka'i wing and was not acceptable. It looked like it had not had guests for a long time and needed cleaned again-dead bugs on the counters and dust and grime everywhere. It was very disappointing after a 15 hour airplane trip. One call to the front desk and we were moved to the Maui wing to a nice clean room that was a great improvement. The grounds are beautiful and the beach is gorgeous. We are planning a trip back with our kids in June and will return for another short stay at KBH. We were there celebrating our 15th anniversary which I indicated when we made the reservation and on check in but it was not acknowledged. Staff was pleasant but no more than everyplace else on Maui.

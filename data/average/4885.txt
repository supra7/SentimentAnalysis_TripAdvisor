Beautfiul lobby. I give that 5 stars.....otherwise, our check in was terrible, nothing we requested....the rooms are very small AND I had recently heard about the bedbug situation and when I came to this site, the first thing I saw were pictures of bedbug bites. I called to make sure my room didn't have any, I kind of got the run around and am still not sure. Being I called and checked with them specifically, I am going to be way more upset if they lied to me. Concierge was very informative, she also get's 5 stars, the rest, I'd pass on as far as my first day here. I will update if things got any better. Mind you, this was an executive level room. See pictures.

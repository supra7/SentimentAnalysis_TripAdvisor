Stayed at Hilton Downtown for 2 days with family. Room was acceptable. Room service staff and front desk staff were great, however valet parking staff was rude, impolite and inconsiderate. Stay was comfortable except pool has no spa/jacuzzi. After whole day of activity at beach and evening of shopping could not relax in spa. Lack of towels at swimming pool and cold water.

We enjoyed our stay in the family suite. This was a great suite to stay in when traveling with 2 teenagers - everyone had space to spread out. For the most part it was a great hotel experience. We enjoyed the wine at 5 pm every day. We had two negative parts of our experience. The first was that while we were out all day long touring, our room never got cleaned. We left the room at 10 am and returned at 4 pm and the room was never made up or cleaned. It took another hour to get someone to clean our room after calling the front desk. Secondly, someone signed us up for a 5 am wake up call (not us) and we received calls at 5 and 5:15 am. We had gotten to bed late the night before and did not have to be out of the room until 10 am that morning so this was very irritating. When I called the front desk to ask them to stop calling us, I was told that we had put in for the wake up call. We had not!!!! Great hotel and we would stay there again but just a few service issues.

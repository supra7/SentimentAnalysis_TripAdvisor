Relatively clean chain hotel walking distance from Fenway park. It's in need of updating and remolding in the hallways and some rooms, though most of the facilities seemed updated and clean. Service was avg with nothing standing out. A bit pricey due to the location near decent chain restaurants and public transportation.

We were very disappointed with the room (old and the bed was not comfortable at all). Also we enjoy spending time at the beach and this was really not as expected. They had a really small area with cabana's that were impossible to get and stood on a small hill by the hotel. If you want to have a nice, quick breakfast at the hotel - leave an extra 30 min because you will be surprised by the line that is there was there every morning. I would not recommend this hotel to my friends.

We were sceptical about what this place would be like considering the low cost, but were pleasantly surprised. It is great value! Our room was clean and well appointed. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location was great. We also enjoyed dining in the attached restaurant. Overall we would be very happy to stay here again.

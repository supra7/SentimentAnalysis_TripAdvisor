We expected more with the hotel being bayfront and a Hilton. However, the rooms were standard, nothing special. We found some very helpful staff members, but the majority were rude and acted as if simple tasks were inconvenient to them. The housekeeping staff and front desk staff were absolutely amazing, accommodating and top-notch. The bellmen and guest services staff were irritated to be working. The bellmen up front would stand around the counter outside and chat while guests were arriving and departing and needed help with bags. One thing I would recommend is to reserve breakfast when booking the room (not when you arrive because the prices are more than if you do it in advance). Additionally, make sure you arrive early for breakfast (830am or 9am) otherwise you will wait in line (in a large crowd, really) for at least an hour. We left to go around the corner to Starbucks to eat breakfast and apparently, the other impatient people had the same idea because that line was outrageous too. The concierge is good at giving you lists of activities, but that's it. We asked how long it took to get to Horton Plaza (outside of the Gaslamp District) and they said 15 minutes walking. We asked if there was any other means of transportation other than a cab. They told us no, but it's only 15 minutes and it was really close. We walked a good 30 minutes before we arrived. On the way back we got a rickshaw, which the Hilton Concierge failed to inform us about. The spa was amazing, very relaxing and reasonably priced. In fact, the showers in the spa locker rooms were SO MUCH BETTER than the ones in the hotel rooms. Overall, if I had to do it all over again- I would research other hotels for this price before booking. We only stayed here because it was convenient since the wedding we attended was held here and, of course, you can't beat the view.

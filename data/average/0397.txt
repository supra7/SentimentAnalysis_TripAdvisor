This hotel is not a 4 star. Priceline is passing off as a 4 star but it's no better than 3 star. got it for $99/night. it's far from pike place. Parking $40 per day, disgusting. If you're going on the weekend, parking on the street is FREE all day Sunday!! there was a lot up the street for $10. You're probably better off just parking on the street and if you get a ticket it'll probably be less than $40 anyways. lol. you can probably get the sheraton or westin pike place on hotwire for $89 per night.

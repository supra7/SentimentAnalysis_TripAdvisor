4 Stars for: Fitness Facility, Location, Business Office, and lobby area. 3 Stars for the rooms. They are the old style Marriott and need updating as far as design. 2 Stars for Concierge Lounge. The staff up there was not friendly. As a frequent Marriott user, you do get used to the friendly concierge lounge staff. This is first time I did not leave a tip for them. Disappointing. Hotel staff is generally very friendly. Easy to help with luggage, hailing cabs, etc. Location is everything with this hotel. I loved it.

I got a really good deal on this hotel. 115 euro a night or something like that. I had been in the same area of Boston 4 months beforehand staying in the Sheraton so I knew what to expect of the area and I thought the Marriott would be a step up. The Sheraton in Prudential isnt getting amazing reviews on this site but I have to say it far exceeded all my expecttions and this hotel did not. Compared to the Sheraton, the lobby is vey small with very little seating. There isnt a great buzz around there. I t looks less like a hotel and more like just a part of a mall. The rooms were fine. Big Flat Scree TV's were great but the decor was a little outdated. I just preferred my Sheraton room, bit more stylish. I just thought the whole place had more of a buzz really. Would recommend u go there instead.

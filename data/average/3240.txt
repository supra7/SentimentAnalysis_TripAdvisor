The South Loop Hotel is clean and a decent place to stay. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't offer at least a continental breakfast,and the cost was a bit steep considering the location(3 miles from downtown, and not in a safe area for a Mom to be walking with her kiddos). The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful-always greeting us with a smile, but it took security 1/2 hour to break up a drunken party in the room next to ours that had us up at midnight through 2 a.m. (also being awoken again at 3:30 by another intoxicated group at the entrance of the hotel...one was vomiting, one was taking his photo while the others cheered- was not my idea of decent night's sleep).

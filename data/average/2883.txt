My husband & stayed here for a getaway for one night. Upon arrival, the lights on the sign outside the building were not working all the way & all we could see was INN & Suites, so we passed it the first time. The young lady at the front desk was very nice & friendly & check in was fast & easy. Upon arrival to our room, we were checking things out. The gym was extrememly small with only 2 pieces of equipment. The pool was closed so we didn't see it. The carpet in the hall & our room was a little dirty looking & the room had a weird smell but was very clean. The tv was small & the pillows were even small, half the size of a normal pillow & they were so flat. The bed wasn't the most comfortable we had ever slept in, but we did sleep. The internet was fast. I kept waking up all hours of the night because of hearing people running & walking around on the floor above us. They were extremely loud. Checking out was easy & fast also & they were very nice & friendly. We didn't eat breakfast there, so I don't know how good it was. Overall, it was an good stay.

I spent one night here on a quick getaway to do my own historical walking tour. The hotel touts its own history and though nice, I was not particularly impressed overall. The Park Plaza seemed almost as though it was trying to be too many things to too many people...more than one wedding booked (large lighted ,glossy photos and names of couples in lobby detracting from the historic decor), lots of high maintenance vacationers, European travelers, even airline flight crews. Amid the shuffle, I felt a bit overlooked as a lone traveler. At one point, I waited in a long line for the Concierge to ask for a walkable map of the historic African-American sites trail, only to be told hurriedly that they didn't have any but "the trail starts on the other side of the park". The group in front of me in line however, booked a boat tour, made dinner reservations for a family of 4, and got directions from the Concierge. All I wanted was a map. Maybe it would have been better had I not been traveling in the middle of the summer? In any case, the rooms have a nice historic flair (skeleton key doors) and are small but perfectly acceptable. The room was clean but my bed sheet was stained, which was pretty unexpected considering the caliber of the hotel. Overall, I could not have asked for a better location and for the seasoned traveler who needs little direction or attention, it was a reasonable choice.

I have to say that even after reading the reviews here about the bathrooms being so tiny I was still very shocked at the size of the shower. It was just a little bigger than a coffin. I'm not normally a clausterphonbic person but it the shower was ridiculously small. Forget trying to shave your legs! Also the room got very cold (I traveled in the first week of November) and the heater was not automatic and made lots of noise. It was hard to sleep with the heater on. Other than that the hotel served its' purpose. Decent, clean, fun decor, close to lots of things. But nothing special (other than the cool doors) which is why I give it only an Average rating.

My family and I booked 4 rooms and stayed at the hotel for one night. We had a problem with one room where it seemed like the bathroom had not been cleaned. We talked to the front desk and they immediately gave us a upgraded room with a better view. I found it strange that a hotel in this class did not offer free wifi in the rooms but only in the lobby. If you wanted wifi in your room you had to pay $10 per day. The beds were very good and the staff at the front desk were very helpful. The area seemed a bit boring and I have stayed in more interesting parts of downtown. Just a tip about the parking  choose the valet if you want to use your car doing your stay. The hotel was good but I have stayed at better hotels in this class.

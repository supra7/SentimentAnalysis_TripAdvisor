My husband and I have stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago multiple times and appreciate it's reliability--large rooms by big city standards, lovely grand old lobby, perks for Hilton diamond card holders, and close proximity to the Chicago Art Museum (which is in easy walking distance), lots of shopping, and other sites. Recommended, particularly at the price.

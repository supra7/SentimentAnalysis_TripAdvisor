Seattle has such a warm and friendly set of people ... except the reception staff at the Sheraton who were cold and off hand. Unhelful even. Club lounge was great with nice staff, as were the barstaff. Rooms had the usual lovely Sweetsleeper bed which was great. Nothing special - but usual Starwood standard to rooms and cleanliness - just train your reception staff on the hotel service basics for both check in and check out! It was also disappointing that we could not gain Starwood points as we had booked through a travel agent.

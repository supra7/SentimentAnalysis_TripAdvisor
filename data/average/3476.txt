The hotel has no elevator and if you stay on the upper floors you will have to carry your own luggage trough a tiny wood stair case. The room we stayed in was very small and the bathroom as well. We had trouble sleeping because of the noise produced by the traffic. Breakfast was very pour in choices but the quality of the food was good except the coffee (instant coffee). The room was equipped with a mini fridge bat it was empty (no minibar).

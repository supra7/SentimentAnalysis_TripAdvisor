The room was very small; however the furnishings were very nice. The bathroom was large and very elegant, but the commode was straight out of a public bathroom. (weird) The staff was friendly. The location was great. In between Back Bay and Fenway/Kenmore. Two blocks from the Charles River. Was perfect for a morning run. They even provided a joggers map. That was great! It was a fine for one night. Be careful of getting loud nieghbors. The walls are thin and you can hear every word if your neighbors are speaking loudly. Plumbing is kinda loud too. Paid well over $200 for the bottom of the line room. Booked it on Expedia. Expected it to be a lot nicer for the price I paid.

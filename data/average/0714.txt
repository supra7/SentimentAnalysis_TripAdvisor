Overall this is a nice hotel but it is never a good sign when you enter a room and there are complimentary ear plugs on the night stand! My room the first night was at the edge of the hotel closest to the train tracks. Even with the ear plugs you felt the trains rumble through the room constantly all night. To make matters worse, my room (#201) was right next to the room where the cleaning staff prepares their carts. So at 7 am they are talking loud and slamming the door. The next day I asked for a different room (I requested something on the water side but was told there was nothing - yet one of my colleagues got a free upgrade to the water front a few hours later). Since I was hear for business I did not have the option to go elsehwere. Otherwise it is a decent hotel. Decent food (though the web site claims Starbucks in the room yet it is some generic coffee). In my second room the coffee pot in the TV stand did not pull out and the cord which snaked through the back was too short to be able to pour water in the pot so I couldn't use it. Lovely views and staff were nice. The king bed I had was comfortable and the shower/bathroom is nice. I guess because they maybe use compact fluourescent bulbs it is very dim in the room (you know you can put more powerful lights in!). Concierge was helpful. Location is great.

Stayed here Feb. 5 and 6. Some facts for your consideration: An attractive place. Landscaping is beautiful. The four pools are very attractive with the palm trees ,etc. The condo was fine. Hot water WAS a real problem. Walls ARE thin. There is no "oceanfront.' It borders the Florida Bay. There's land on the other side; there is no beach, the water is inaccessible. Be prepared for 'sticker shock' when you get your bill. There is a $19.48 charge per day for parking and a $24 a day "resort fee" added to your bill ( a charge that is not volunteered when you call).

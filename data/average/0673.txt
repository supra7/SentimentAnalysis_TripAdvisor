(1) nite at the Hotel Andra for a Mariner's ballgame. Could NOT believe the size of the bathroom ... tiniest I have ever seen including ones on cruise ships !! Room (suite) was satisfactory but definitely NOT what I would call a suite. Beds were comfortable however except be careful of the frame they are in as it is sharp & easy to run into. Convenient for travel to Safeco Field via the new Central Link. Probably would NOT recommend this hotel to a friend nor would I plan on staying there again. NOT worth the price ... including the very spendy valet parking.

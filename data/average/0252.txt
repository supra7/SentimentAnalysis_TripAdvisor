The Moore is definitely a good value. For a queen room with its own bathroom, the price was under $100 per night. Some of the rooms have shared bathrooms and these are even cheaper. The room was spacious and clean. There was not a lot of street noise but I could definitely hear doors slamming in the hallway (walls are pretty thin). I could easily walk to all of the major sites from the hotel: pike place market, seattle center, downtown shopping, and the ferry terminals. Late at night the area did feel a bit sketchy. It's not full service, so I had to go downstairs and get my own extra blanket. There was no climate control (air conditioning or heating) in my room so I had to open and close windows to be more comfortable. There is no coffee or tea in room, however the hotel just opened a coffee shop next door. I tried the espresso and it was really good! Also the shop has baked goods and muffins for breakfast. I would stay here again... but if you're fussy about certain things then this is not the hotel for you.

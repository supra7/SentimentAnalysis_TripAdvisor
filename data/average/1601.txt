The Hotel has a good 4 star standard. Good breakfast is not included in the price but you can choose between two options. Full buffet breakfast and a light continental one. Service is good and cable internet is included in the room rate. If you don't like the hotel restaurant you have to go downtown to eat, since there is no other restaurant near the hotel.

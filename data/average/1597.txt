I booked the superior room in sept. All I can say is that the designer of this hotel must be a straight man and had never used the rooms himself. Very simple, how can anyone use that tiny basin without wetting the floor/ their feet? The basin was the size of a dinner plate without anywhere to put the soap, any toiletries nor make up. The tiny side stand was 2 feet away on the floor. If you expect to put your contact lenses' case on that stand while putting on your contacts in front of the mirror, good luck! Bathtub was in the description and in the photos when I booked the room but in reality, there's none. It was a twin bedroom. Only 1 bed came with side table..... can this happen to a 5-star hotel? the only window in the bedroom was smaller than the size of a pillow. The open concept shower was the worst with the transparent door design. The shower was at the end of the twin beds, just below the TV. Although both me and my friend are girls, it still couldn't be more awkward. The room service staff didn't speak English. It was quite a struggle to try to get a Caesar salad. I think the whole weekend inside the hotel was a struggle but the location was good enough for me not to leave right away. However, after the weekend, I changed to the hotel Arts, in where I was treated as a true 5-star hotel guest.

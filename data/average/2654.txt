We stayed here for 3 nights while attending the Sony Ericcson tennis tournament. The tournament shuttle had a pick up at a nearby hotel making it a convenient option. We were able to check in early which was nice. Our room was relatively clean. There was a random hair in the tub, but I guess that happens. We ordered room service one night and it was actually quite good! There does not seem to be much in walking distance to the hotel, but we spent most of our time at the tournament. We did take a cab to South Beach for lunch one day - I think it was about 20 minutes. We were in Miami on a very busy weekend (there was also a music festival going on downtown) so we did not get a great rate as others have posted. If you can get a great rate this is a decent option.

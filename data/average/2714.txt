The location of the Pantheon Inn really could not be beat. The hotel room was very clean and orderly. Everything was pretty perfect until the day before we left. They were doing construction on the room next to ours and they had opened the door to our room, I guess thinking that we wouldn't be back for awhile. It was shocking to find that our door was wide open with all of our things in plain view. They immediately cleaned the wood chips off the floor and closed the door, but then had to reopen the door for some more work. The noise was unbearable so we weren't able to take the nap we had hoped for. This was disappointing. Our room was also right below the kitchen area so we could hear people walking up and down the stairs pretty clearly. Sometimes we could smell the public toilet when walking into the hotel. Breakfast was provided but the meat options and juices were not tasty. Croissants were good. I would recommend staying here but just be aware of a few things that might throw you off. I'm sure the construction will be completed by now though and that was probably our biggest issue.

First W stay in the US. We loved W Seoul so thought other are equally good. As noted by many before W Seattle is more concentrated on getting people in for the bar, meetings etc. The lobby is confusing and no signs anywhere to find check in etc. The concierge was good and had a few tips, and I could borrow a brolly for the rain (it does rain every day in Seattle). At check in I was offered a better room as SPG gold. The room may have been on a high floor, but no noise isolaton. Any door that opened and closed in the hallway I could hear all night. Also room service trays etc were left in hallways 24 hours plus. Many staff passed by the trays, glasses etc but didnt touch it. I think this level of hotel all staff should take responsibility to keep it looking nice and clean and help each other. In the room there was no water boiler (I could borrow one though after asking), no coffee cups and no free water (there should be for SPG gold). Amenities are good though and refreshing (Bliss range). Downstairs bar was ok, they have a good happy hour 4-7 with a few bargains on the beers. They closed early as low volume of customers, a frequent problem in the US as staff work for tip and not for hourly pay it seems. A bit annoying for clients staying at the hotel. Overall location and hotel is good and if you get a good rate go for it, but if not perhaps consider the sheraton or westin.

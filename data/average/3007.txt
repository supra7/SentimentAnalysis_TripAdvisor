When we booked for one night in Venice, we were impressed with this hotel online. They were a pleasure to deal with via email ahead of our visit and I wanted a five star experience so I didn't mind the substantial cost of the hotel. The location was wonderful, not too close or too far from the crowds and sites. If you do not have a lot of luggage, take the water bus. It was really very easy to get to the hotel from the stop at the Rialto Bridge. The room was beautiful, although the beds and cold floors were not too comfortable and the bathroom amenities were less than I saw in other hotels in Italy. The view from the junior suite balcony was stunning. What was disappointing was service. Every time we went to the front desk we got a sales pitch for a boat ride around Venice and to Murano. Every...single...time. One of the reasons I book an expensive hotel is to take advantage of concierge services. We were not able to get any reasonable help or answers to our questions. I was particularly frustrated when I asked about booking a gondola ride. I was told - why go on a gondola when you can take the offer to go in a taxi ride? Why take our family on a gondola ride in Venice? Because it's Venice! We ended up having to take our chances with a random gondola provider. If you book at this hotel be ready to book other services on your own, and be ready for the sales pitch. I would not stay here again.

We stayed for our first few days in Maui here. I was slightly disappointed at the size of the room. Then the noise factor outside our lanai. We were right above the walkway that connects all of the hotels there. Anyone walking by talking were heard in our room. And the loud ones were heard through the closed door. The place is a little older than I expected also. It was a good deal to be right at the ocean. But you had to walk in the opposite direction to get out of the hotel & then down to the ocean. Not complaining just stating for anyone else who is considering it. I tried to get a "passport" for my 5 yr old to use while we were there. I was told they would get me one ASAP. I never saw it. They did bring us a roll away that we were barely able to fit into the room so my 2 teenagers didn't have to share the bed in the seperate room. BTW, the bigger bed (Master?) is in the main area of the suite.

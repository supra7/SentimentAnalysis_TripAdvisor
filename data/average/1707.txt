This is a nice hotel that I stayed at to attend a conference that was going on within the hotel. I must say I was shocked when I wanted to order room service at 11:30PM and was told they closed at 10:30PM. AT $224 (incl taxes) for a one night stay I expected more. I agree with many of the other reviews that there's room for improvement. Great location though!

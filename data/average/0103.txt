The location of this hotel makes it....located in a charming little courtyard RIGHT up the block from Pike Place Market, its really a perfect spot for walking around the city. The hotel also has a rooftop deck that is perfect for a bottle of wine with a great view of the harbor. The rooms (as of 2005) really needed an update. For the price I paid, I expected a bit more from the room. Also, if you rent a car, you pretty much HAVE to valet it and its not cheap. Bottom line, great location for action, but ask if the rooms have been updated before you stay!

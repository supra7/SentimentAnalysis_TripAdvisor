Why do so many big name hotels have such a small mentality? They have you overpay for everything... no fridge or microwave, no free internet access... they expect you to love your stay because it's a Crown friggin' Plaza. Well, that's too bad. You simply pay too much for average service. The rooms in it self are pretty alright, the view from our room (facing the library) was great, the bed comfy. I just wish they would step it up.

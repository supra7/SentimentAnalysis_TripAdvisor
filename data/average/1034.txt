A couple hundred dollars a night and no Internet. Rooms were so-so. Mini blinds on the windows not what I expected for a W hotel. Customer service was very bad the first two days and better towards the end. Bought a bottle of champagne from hotel and then told we could not enjoy in downstairs Do not recommend the restaurant/bar downstairs. Foot was below average and we paid $41.00 for two drinks.

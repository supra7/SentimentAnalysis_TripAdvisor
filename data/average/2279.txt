Very nice, very well kept resort. But suggest you do not drive to with own car or rental car as parking is bad. In the notes given at check-in, the resot even suggests that if you want to be sure you are parked near your unit, to leave your car and take a taxi to town. Wow - what a solution! We had unit in the back but had to park in FRONT of resort, NEXT DOOR at Walgreens which is authorized - this is their resolution!

I had a great rate (under $100 a night), which was a superb value. If I had paid a lot more, I might have been disappointed in the absolutely tiny room. The room did have everything I needed (free internet, extremely comfortable bed, large flat-screen tv, iron and ironing board, etc.). The bathroom was well appointed, but it wasn't spotlessly clean. The hallways are also very small, which means that all of the room doors are relatively close to one another. Doors are opening and closing all day and night, of course, and you can hear conversations in the hallway as if they were in your room. Each morning, the housekeeping staff was camped out on the hallway floor folding towels and sheets, etc., and talking very loudly. In summary, it was a great deal, but the room was small and loud.

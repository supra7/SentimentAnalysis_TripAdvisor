Stayed at this Hotel for only two nights. The Chinese resaurant was expensive and food quality poor. Two months after my return to the UK I got hit on my credit card for 300 from the Hotel. How they got my PIN etc I don't know. My attempts to resolve the credit card issue have to date been unsuccessful. Won't be going back.

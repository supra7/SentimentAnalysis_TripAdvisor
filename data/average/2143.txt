The good news was that we booked through priceline and got a good deal on Trump International; otherwise it would have been a total downer. If I rate the hotel compared to all hotels, it gets 3 points, if compared to 5-star hotels, it gets 2. Good things: + Rooms look nice and we thought the decor was well done + No casino + No smoking + Excellent service at check-in: professional and nice, even appropriately funny + Room service was very discrete: we never ran into them, even though we left at different times of the day, and they came every day + Nice outdoor heated pool and hot tub, which we used even though it was rather cold out Bad things: + Having booked and paid on priceline, we were surprised that a $19/night resort fee was slapped on. We inquired with the manager and got an answer that basically amounted to "here is a copy of the form you signed at check-in (they bothered to actually attach the form!), and in it it says that you agree to the fee; you could have chosen to go elsewhere at that time." Right. Here we are with our bags, tired after the flight from New York, we come to the esteemed Trump International, having paid for 3 nights through priceline, we see the small print, and off we go looking for a different hotel. Not funny. + The bed was way too soft; we had to take off a special mattress that was on top of other two mattresses - helped a little + The water in the shower would be too cold for a while, then too hot for a while - while you were freezing - every time + The food in the restaurant was not good (meaning, not bad for the stomach, but just not tasty at all) - overcooked pasta and burger; we were one of two couples in the restaurant at lunch time; one of the forks on the table was dirty - do yourself a favor and walk over to the Wynn + The advertised shuttle bus that runs to the Wynn and to Caesar's wanted to go to the Wynn all the time (we needed Caesar's), so we had to stage a mini revolution for it to do what was promised to us by the concierge + It was dusty, but maybe that's just Vegas: even though they dusted every morning, I could see dust on all surfaces by the end of the night

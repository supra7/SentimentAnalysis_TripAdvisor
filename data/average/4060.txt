We recently stayed at the Marriott Copley Place for a convention. The hotel was nice, clean rooms, friendly staff, wonderful job with serving a meal for a group our size. My only complaint about the hotel was that there was constantly room service left in the hallways. One evening I went into my room around 8pm, when I left the following morning around 8:30 the same trays were still in the hall. Dirty dishes constantly in the hallways is not something you want to see everytime you walk to/from your room.

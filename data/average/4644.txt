I stayed again at the Copley Plaza because of memories of it in grander days. The lobby cafe is gone. The informal bar is gone. The picture of Senator Kennedy is gone. Much more of the hotel is given to meetings. The Club level lounge charges for a glass of wine and provides careful appetizers. The Club level concierges were, however, helpful and competent, and room service was faster than in the old days. Our window on Copley Square was the same size it has always been, but seemed tiny alongside the spectacular 180 degree vista of the Square and of Boston from an inexpensive corner "Junior Suite" at the Westin Copley Place, across the street. The Westin has an informal bar, an uncareful breakfast buffet, and an array of restaurants in the adjoing mall, where we mostly continued to eat while staying at the Copley Plaza. We would stay at the Westin Copley Place next time, perhaps walk across for a formal drink in the Oak Bar and to pat the great dog in the Copley Plaza lobby, but sadly leave the former grande dame to her conventions.

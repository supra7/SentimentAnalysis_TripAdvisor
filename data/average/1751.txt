Upon arrival, parking was a nightmare and we immediately noticed the front and back of the hotel as well as areas of the lobby had scaffolding up and were covered in tarps for future construction. This obstructed views and really took away from the ambiance of the hotel. The rooms were small, they had modern furniture and dcor but the lanai was small and the bathroom was terrible. Without being too critical all I can say was that the room with the toilet and the shower was cramped and dimly lit. You could tell the shower had not been replaced in quite some time and really just looked dingy. The grounds were nice enough, there were tropical birds stationed throughout; parrots, penguins, flamingos, swans and an African Crane. The pool was very basic, nothing special and it was ALWAYS difficult to find chairs poolside. There was a childrens pool, a slide and a swim to grotto bar concealed on both sides by waterfalls (this bar was "swim to", not "swim up" - you had to get out of the water and walk up to the bar). I guess since it looks like they are beginning construction they are going to be doing some updating and it is badly needed. Everything reminded us of visiting grand parents in Florida. It didn't really have that Hawaii feel. I would explore other options before settling on the Hyatt.

Booked my honeymoon at the Hyatt through a travel agent. Day of wedding in Hawaii, went to hotel to check in around 8pm. Told our booked room was not available until tomorrow. Sent to a double bed garden view room instead of our kind ocean view room with their apologies. I cried on my honeymoon in disgust with the room. Next morning no response from manager requesting compensation, called the travel agent, who called and got a one night's stay compensated in the form of hotel credit. Honeymoon package included champagne and picture frame/album, only received champagne on 3rd night after reminding the hotel staff. Aside from service, hotel was beautiful. Swim up pool bar was fun!. Poolside restaurant expensive- $20 cheeseburger. Swan court breakfast buffet good, only ate their because it was part of our room package. Great oceanview room (once in our originally booked room), great linens, soaps/lotions, mmm coconut mango. Overall, would not recommend because they made me cry on my honeymoon

What a disappointment. Its location is really one of the only redeeming qualities about this massive hotel. I was even given a room in the "Starwood Preferred Guest" floor, but it was definitely nothing to write home about. Everything looked and felt outdated. I ordered room service, but the food was bland and lukewarm. Seattle is a great food city - why isn't there decent food in this hotel?

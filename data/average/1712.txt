The decor is nice, if not a bit Spartan. The rooms are fine. I have three main complaints: 1. On the first floor of the hotel are located (1) a Starbucks and (2) a FOX Sports Bar. Guess what? You can't access them from the interior of the building. You actually have to go outside the building and walk a minimum of 50 yards to reach either. What Grade-A moron is responsible for this design? 2. For 2009, the gym is a huge embarrassment. 10 cardio machines and a half-dozen weight machines. This is San Diego, one of the epicenters of health and physical beauty. Another terrible misstep. To make matters worse, one has to pay $15 per day to use the "gym," and an attendant has to unlock the door for you, even if you just left to use the men's room. WTF? 3. Internet access: $13 per day. In this day and age, internet access is one of those no-brainer freebees. It's like charging separately for toilet paper.

My experience there 2 nights were totally a mix!!! Pros: location is good, near RAI metro/ rainway station. The variety of breakfast is good and fresh, waiters were very good in the breakfast hall. The check-out recieption, a lady was very professional, the company forgot to pay for us, the lady in Novotel solved it in a good way. The desk could be customised nice. Cons:the wifi was not working at all, and after several calls, they sent me a 190cm guy standing out side of my room, like "what's up?" , very very unfriendly. I asked for breakfast in room and told them through call, but they did not pick up the card. Bathroom could be better in terms of hair in bath and tower (if we look very carefully). There was only 4 public PCs to use in the hall, we have to queue to use the internet. I also recommend the management team in Novotel to let the receiption staff sit down, they are standing all day long, can be very very tired, and no wonder sometimes they can not deliver top service to guests.

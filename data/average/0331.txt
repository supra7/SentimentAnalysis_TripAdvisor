This hotel room is average in every respect. From the front desk personnel, to the room itself it's all just okay. If you're looking for something special or memorable this is NOT the place for you! (i'd suggest you spend an extra $40 dollars and stay somewhere plush like the Pan Pacific) But if your objective is an affordable, safe, clean hotel room, without the frills, the Executive Hotel Pacific may be just the place for you.

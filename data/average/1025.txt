I booked a room at the W hotel last minute on a weekend to attend a football game. I called the hotel directly and was able to get a decent discount. If you plan on using their valet know that it's pretty pricey($40) and that it's kind of confusing to find. The valet entrance was so small and packed with cars that they told me to park on the sidewalk. It makes it kind of difficult to unpack your car, and then haul your luggage up stairs to get to the lobby. The lobby is pretty small but contemporary and well appointed. Check-in was easy and they upgraded us to a nicer room. The spectacular room was well furnished with a nice view. Nice couch near window. Bathroom was nice but looked a little tired. Cracking tile, dirty grout, and a shower that didn't drain properly. Bath towels were horribly scratchy and old. Bath products were Bliss brand which are very nice. The room had a nice ipod dock, but it did not work. I later found out that you had to have the T.V. on in order for it to work. It would have been nice if they had some directions explaining that in the room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Climate control worked well, except it was run by a sensor so if you left the room when you came back it was hot and stuffy because the system shuts off. Also, no coffee maker which I found interesting especially in a city like Seattle. Overall, a comfortable room but definitely in need of a face lift. As far as the rest of the hotel, there is a bar that is in the lobby that had a D.J. at night time. It was a lot of fun, drinks were good, appetizers were okay. In conclusion, I would recommend the W. It is in a great location. The price is reasonable if you can get a discount. The bar is nice, and the public areas are trendy and cool. However the rooms need renovating. I would have been unhappy had I paid full price for a room. So wonderful, no, but with some help it could be.

This was my first trip to Boston, and I used reviews from several sites to make my decision on where to stay, along with the normal considerations of price and location. The Hyatt did have an awkward entrance, but other than a pause on first entry; it didn't create any problems. As far as location, I didn't feel unsafe at any time and I was traveling with my two college age children. It is very near Boston Common, the Theater District, Filenes Basement, and Chinatown. I define near as a short walk. Faneuil Hall and the Freedom Trail are a short hike, maybe 10 - 15 minutes at a stroll. The T stations are close and you can get anywhere in the city from there. The Hyatt had the best price that I found for the time of my stay. They were willing to guarantee the type of room that I wanted even with a late arrival. The staff was very polite and pleasant. We didn't eat at the hotel, except for one late night room service order. They food was okay, not great but certainly not bad. Prices were comparable to other restaurants in the area. The room was clean and comfortable. Housekeeping was attentive to our needs, by replacing toiletries and not adjusting the room temp we set. I wouldn't mind staying at the Hyatt again, if I return to Boston.

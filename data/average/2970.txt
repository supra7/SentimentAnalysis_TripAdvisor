The rooms were decent size and it was fresh, just what I expected. Missing that there was no minibar or safety box, but it is on the other hand primarily an overnight hotel. Breakfast was okay but so crowded it was! You could be standing in line at the coffee machine for several minutes, and too often it was out of bread and other things.

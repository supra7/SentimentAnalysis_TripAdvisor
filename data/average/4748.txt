We find it hard to believe that this is a 4.5 star property. We often stay at 5 stars and due to pricing, figured we could get better bang for the buck staying at the Omni, which was about $100 - $150 less than the 5 star properties. Unfortunately, we were wrong. Here's a quick summary: The Good -location - very close to the shops of Michigan Ave and lots of excellent restaurants in the area (bars, pizza joints, Italian, you name it) -friendly service - people working here were genuinely pleasant and friendly The Bad -had difficulty finding an outlet to charge my phone in the bedroom area of the suite - when it serves as my alarm, need it close by -TV in bedroom area was an old box....the nice TV was in the suite -cleaning of room wasn't that great from day to day -dated decor -rooms are VERY dark The Ugly -iron kept leaking water -white drapes had brownish red stains -parking is $54 a day....wow...unreal!

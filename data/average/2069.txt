We spent 3 nights here and agree with previous reviews. Accommodation is clean, comfortable and offers everything you are likely to need. Staff are conscientious and helpful and a large supermarket about 50 yds away is a bonus. But at about $550 for 3 nights it is not a bargain. Our only criticism of the accommodation was the view from the rear (we had Room 8) over roofs with waste bags piled up awaiting disposal. The immediate local area is rather run down with the odd beggar or derelict, and the walk down Park Street to the old town is neither attractive nor just a few minutes. But turn left down Park Street and right into Sherbrook and a different world emerges. Try the art gallery and the nearby shops/cafes. Lots of eating places around though we were very disappointed with Pasta & Basta at the junction of Park and Sherbrook.

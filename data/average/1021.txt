I recently stayed at the W. It had been approximately 8 years since I stayed at this property. It is exactly the same - and this is good and bad. The common areas - bar, etc. still seem modern and hip with a very loungy feel. The rooms are a bit worn. I love the set up of the room - especially the large window seat - but it needs a bit of updating. The bed is very comfortable with lots of pillows. The bathroom is very spacious, but is showing wear and tear. The location is perfect and a pleasant walk to all the attractions in Seattle. I was disappointed that valet was not available during my stay. They do not have enough parking spaces to accommodate the guests. I thought the bartenders were attentive and professional. The restaurant is wonderful and convenient when you don't want to leave the property for a meal. Overall, it is a good, convenient place to stay when visiting downtown Seattle. But... it didn't leave me feeling like I would want to stay here every time I visit downtown. Some of the smaller boutique hotels (Hotel Monaco just across the street being one) are also great properties with wonderful amenities.

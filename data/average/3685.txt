The room was average, dark, not very clean, (hair on the bathroom floor), and the housekeeping service was minimal. No extra toilet paper, didn't leave clean drinking glasses, bed not made one day. Yes, the elevator situation is terible! Believe the other reviews. Breakfast was good, valet very friendly & helpful, but the room, well, bleh. Also, my e-mail got hacked while on their free internet.

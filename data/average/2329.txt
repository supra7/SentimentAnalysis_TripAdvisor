I stayed at 3-rios as part of a business trip. As always, I assess whether or not I would bring my wife. The answer is "no!". If you're a family with kids, the hotel offers several pools, wonderful kids club and excellent food. But for a Honeymoon or hard earned fun, the hotel lacks appropriate sophistication. For instance, after 7pm the pool bar closes and you are forced to drink from plastic glasses in a sports bar near the lobby. The greatest asset that Playa has is the ocean. Why not have a smooth cocktail bar serving drinks on the beach. Also, I understand the "over-attentive health & safety policy", but why cant you serve drinks in glass after hours? Unpolished in my opinion. The food is outstanding. Chef is on tip-top form. in 13 nights the menu was varied and exciting. 2 thumbs up. Be aware that this hotel is a 12km taxi trip to the main shopping / Bar area of Playa Del Carmen = $20 one way fare.

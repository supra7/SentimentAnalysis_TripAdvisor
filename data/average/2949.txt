I booked over the net for the "Hogarth Executive Rooms" which showed a white building as the location. Upon arrival we were actually on the other side of the road from the white buildings in the Best Western by Shaftesbury, but the street address was correct??As we had just flown for 24 hours all we wanted to do was freshen up so we went up to our 3rd floor room and tried to access it, but the keycard wouldn't allow it to open. Back down again to reception and it opened this time to a very small but clean room. So small that you couldn't actually use the desk to write as the chair didn't have enough room to pull out to sit in, even if you were really small. Basically the room was well furnished with quality fittings, probably less or smaller furniture would have been better to move around. The bed was only a double size as nothing bigger would fit, but comfy. For location it was great, only 2 minute walk to the Tube railway station. The bathroom was small but very clean and useable. The room was advertised as having a refrigerator but on inspection there was no fridge and as we were only there for 2 days didn't bother about it as we were only there to sleep anyway. Internet access is available by cable only, not wireless.

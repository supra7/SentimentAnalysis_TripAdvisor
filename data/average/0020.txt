My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We paid $300 for the suite with the jetted two-person jacuzzi tub. The hotel has a boutique feel - the rooms are decorated with a lot of stripes and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The room we had was huge but had a lot of empty space which was a little strange. The jacuzzi tub was huge and could definitely accommodate two people and was like a hot-tub. The only thing was that the hotel did not provide any bubble bath etc. which would seem normal when offering such a large tub. Parking was outrageous - $40 a night. We previously paid $19/night at the Residence Inn. We ended up parking for free overnight at a meter spot. Room service was fast but the selection was limited and the food was okay, not great. Overall, I didn't have any problems with Hotel Monaco - it just didn't seem worth the high price.

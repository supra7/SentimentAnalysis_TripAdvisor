I traveled to this Secrets resort about 4 weeks ago. I have traveled to other Secrets resorts (now the Excellence Resorts) and loved the concept. I had been watching and waiting on this resort to open for a few years. This resort is large and has lost the concept of the earlier, more intimate Secrets resorts. I travel often and to quiet a few Caribbean destinations. I have become more resort driven then destination driven. The layout of the resort is one of my least favorite. Many times the restaurants will have a view of the Ocean, at lease a few of them. All the restaurants are in the back with absolutely no view of the ocean. There is a lot of concrete at this resort which makes it less intimate. The pool seating is very dense and its impossible to find any private spot. The beach is beautiful as well as the water nice and smooth. But again, the palapas on the beach are very close together and not private at all. I lounge all day long between the pool and beach area. The beach chairs are fine; however, the pool chairs have bar that digs into your back. They are aware of this problem and are trying out cushions that will lessen the discomfort. The rooms are the A+ at this resort. I stayed in a swim up room and loved it. In a few years when the vegetation matures they will be one of the only private areas at this resort. With so many good reviews on this resort, I regret that I am the negative one. If you are a newer traveler or a younger couple, Im sure this resort will be fine. But if you are a more experience traveler and have stayed at nicer resorts there are much better resorts in this area of Mexico with a nicer overall layout and more privacy.

I just stayed 4 nights at the Hyatt. It was like a trip back to the 1970's. I kept thinking I was going to run into the Brady Bunch while there. The rooms are in serious need of updating and are small. I wouldn't go here for serious romance. The balaconies (if you can call them that) are very small and can barely seat two people. But the grounds are beautiful with sounds of waterfalls and waves. There is a mini fridge and coffee maker. The beds are sort of weird looking being low but not very comfortable either. I woke up with a backache every morning, but that went away after moving around. The bathroom isn't anything to write home about either. Stay away from the snack try, there are sensors on it that detect any snack that is lifted from it - beware. The restaurants are okay with decent selection, although somewhat pricey. There is a $15 resort fee for each night (I've seen worse at other places). Overall I would say if your paying more then $200 a night, you're overpaying. It could be a great place once the place is updated (I was told later this year they will start updating it). But the 70's look with the dark wood paneling, low ceilings with popcorn and all the little shops on the ground floor reminded me of the 70's decade. Oh by the way, when you pull up, park in the self parking lot, if you don't want valet parking. I pulled into the valet lot at first and the guy said valet was "free", meaning they will park you car, but expect a nice tip. No thanks, I can park myself.

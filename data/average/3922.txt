We were impressed when we arrived at this boutique hotel.Ideal position,close to Metro,buses and airport express next to hotel.Central to downtown,old Montreal and very walkable. The refreshing cucumber,mint water and apples in a big spoon at reception ,little nooks with funky couches and an atrium to sit in , a convenience store with most the things you need are great pluses... However, overworked frazzled front desk staff....lack of follow up... Our room key didn't work 3 times,no apology. The A/C was so loud we couldn't watch TV . We opened the window but had no blind to keep the room cool and had to deal with the trucks offloading outside our window day and night . Day 2/4 brought a blind that went down and that was it. We finally had it taken down. Our room wasn't cleaned on the first day as we got back late afternoon and we too tired to go out again for them to clean. The second day I called them to do it at 3pm , day 3 we got back at 4 room not done. There was nowhere to hang towels.I reported it 3 times!!! We were offers to move rooms on the 3rd night but to a smaller room. I complained again to Emily who apologized and said she would speak to the duty manager and would send someone to fix the problems.... This couldnt be done though the maintenance guy did come and had not been informed of all the challenges. The room was to be serviced when we went out for dinner but the cleaner came saying that he was off duty at 5.30.I wanted to scream.... We are very disappointed at the disjointed systems and procedures. There seems to be no efficient management and housekeeping follow up .... Spoilt what could have been a great visit.

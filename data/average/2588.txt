I usually stay in the Travel Inn just a little ways over Euston Road which is a fairly bustling hotel with a nice bar and restaurant area overlookning the street. It was full for this visit and so i opted for this one as location is virtually identical. It was a weird experience from the off. i arrived at about 8.15 pm and couldn't find anyone to book me in, after about 3 or 4 minutes someone turned up and said that as he was the barman he couldn't take bookings. Eventually someone (the hotel manager?) turned up and we proceeded to jhave a starnge converstaion about what I couldn't have or couldn't do. Can i get a meal? No, we only have a bar. Could I have a wake up call? No, we don't do them. Couldn't you just programme the phone? No, there are no phones. Basically don't expect very much in the ways of basics, never mind extras which at 105 a night was a bit poor I thought. The corridor to my room wouldn't really allow for 2 people to pass with ease and the bedrooms are small. I had a window out onto....another window of some sort which was about 2 feet away (ground floor room). It was clean and very white, it felt like being in an antiseptic bubble. To be fair to the hotel (having explored it's website a bit more), it sells itself as a no frills hotel, however it had less frills than I expected. Breakfast was OK but I had to part with an extra fiver. my recommendation is to head for the Premier Travel Inn across Euston Road if you have the opportunity.

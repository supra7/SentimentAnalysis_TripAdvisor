Location less than ideal. Limited walking opptys by the bay. Can walk to gaslamp District, but have to cross busy road. Right next to monstrous convention center, possibly the ugliest building I have ever seen. Lots of expensive extras: parking, exercise room, internet, etc. Can't recommend for anyone paying their own bill. However, they do know how to host a conference, and they certainly have plenty of space. Staff competent.

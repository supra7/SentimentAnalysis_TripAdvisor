Returned August 10, 2011. This is clearly not a five star hotel. The month of August was extremely hot and very, very humid. The mosquitoes were horrible. The place is very large and lots of very young couples honeymooning here. The pools were not refreshing as was the ocean. Perhaps the ocean was a little cooler, but the pools were not refreshing. Reataurants were not air conditioned as we know it. The food was moderate at best and you must be in by 8:00 or the mosquitoes will get you. The shows were outdoors, if you wanted to brave the mosquitoes. Lots of plants and greenery around the buildings, a breading ground for mosquitoes. DO NOT, pay extra for the Preferred Club.... it is truly a joke. The manager Salvatore there at the club is as rude as they come. Not very accommodating. He would upgrade your room for a ''fee''. Who knows what that is? We made the best of it, but never to return. Second time we had bad experience with ''Secrets''.

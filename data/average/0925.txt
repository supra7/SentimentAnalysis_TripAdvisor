This hotel is in a great location in downtown Seattle, just 3 blocks from the convention center, within walking distance to Pike Street Market, and across the street from the monorail station that takes you to the Space Needle, Science Center, and other notable attractions. The hotel lobby looks nice, has a restaurant and cafe that serve food that is overpriced and average. For good eating, you are better off discovering the many restaurants on Pike Street or Pine. Vons was one of my favorites. There is also a nice food court on the 4th floor of the Westlake Complex across the street where the monorail station is. I ate there often. The elevators are a bit scary, they shake and rattle and move quite fast. My room was on the 32nd floor, the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. The views from the room were excellent overlooking downtown Seattle and the bay. The corridors leading to the room are dark. The room itself has had some wear and tear. The "heavenly bed" that they have is comfortable, and there "heavenly shower" has a nice sprayer as well. I couldn't make a cup of coffee in my in-room coffee maker. The coffee machine smelled badly like it needed a proper cleaning. I just ended up buying my coffee at the many Starbucks in the area. The fitness center is a tight squeeze. Each piece of aerobic equipment had its own tv and they had complimentary headphones to use. The indoor pool was freezing, so I only stuck my big toe in there. The hot tub was nice, but full of kids when I was trying to relax. Beware the floor in the pool area, it's very slick. Overall the hotel was okay. I would have expected a bit nicer being a Westin, wear and tear type stuff and it seemed really dark inside. I was in town on business and the company paid the couple hundred dollar per night rate, so I didn't mind as much. For this hotel though, I wouldn't pay more than mid 100s to stay here.

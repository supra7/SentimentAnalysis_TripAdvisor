I had never been to Boston before and I was travelling via train. This was a weekend getaway for my husband and I. First of all this is 3 blocks from the amtrak train station and very centrally located. The hotel was very clean. I stayed in a petite room, it was tight, but we were out and about all day long, so it was perfect for my hubby and me. The reception staff was very short w/ us, not very friendly, and I'm not one that needs to be pampered, but can I get a smile?? The concierge folks were friendly. Only thing was, as soon as we walked into our room, it felt like a sauna!! We turned down the heat, that didn't work, we opened the window, luckily the weather was incredible this weekend so opening the window was an option, I would have been miserable otherwise. Again, we contacted the front desk, nobody ever showed up, but we were never in the room, and the cracked window did the job. The hotel may seem outdated to some, but its a historical landmark, even with the new flatscreen TVs and new insert tub (kind of funny for place of this "caliber", but whatever....it was spotless!!), i think they want to keep the old world look, which is fine, very pretty decorated for Xmas by the way. This hotel is literally one block from Boston Common, main park and beginning of Freedom Trail. You are also 1 block away from the famous Newbury St and all of there high end shopping. Well we weren't there to shop, more to sight see. Theres an expensive, but super yummy dessert restaraunt on the first level, Finale. So overall it was a good experience. If you want a mix of the shopping and sightseeing, great location, plus again 3 blocks from the amtrak trains. And if you've never been, you can honestly walk anywhere, we made it from this hotel to Quincy Market in 20 minutes. All the maps I had made everything seem far, but if you have some good walking shoes, everything is right there.

We loved Seattle and especially the space needle and pike place market. The location of Hotel Max was good and in walking distance to the main attractions. Hotel Max was clean and tidy with a modern arty feel to it and a nice bar next door. We thought it was a little over-priced though for the size of the room (very small) and amenities on offer. Good but not great.

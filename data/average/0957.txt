We read the reviews after we had booked 4 rooms for 2 nights at this motel. We all felt like the location was great, the rooms we clean, parking was good. The check-in staff could have been friendlier but she was efficient. All the rooms were booked at the same time but we didn't get our rooms near enough to each other. The pool isn't heated but was clean and nice. The hot tub is out of order..looks like indefinetly. The beds are double beds not queen like they say but were very comfortable. The breakfast room was very small. The halls were stuffy but the room temperature controls were just fine.Overall the stay was fine. We weren't there to spend a lot of time in our motel and for the price we were all satisfied

The staff were helpful, but there was a few things that did not impress me. First, when we got there the bill I had to pay was $150 more then what the original confirmation email told me it was. It turned out there is a $50 deposit few in case you bang up the room, which was no where to be found in their emails or on their websites. That tied up a good portion of money that I could have used to take my new wife out to dinner with. Second, their breakfast buffet that you have to pay about $20 a person should not include powdered eggs, hashrowns from a box, and extremely ripe fruit. The Hampton Inn provides a much more excellent breakfast and for free - I'm sorry but for $20 a person I shouldn't have to toast my waffle, I should get to put the raw batter into a waffle iron and cook it. The room was nice, the marble fixtures in the bathroom was romantice, but overall I had expected more from such an expensive hotel, not just a little romance and helpful employees.

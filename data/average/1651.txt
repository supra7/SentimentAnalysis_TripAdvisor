If you want to be able to roll out of bed and walk to the convention center in 3 minutes, this is the place. Otherwise, I'm not sure why you want to come here. Got off on the wrong foot at check-in when three bored with their job clerks took their time as the line backed up. Ten minutes later I made it to the counter. This place needs self-serve machines like the ones Hyatt has. Finally got up to my room with the view of the Dole truck depot and the trolley/commuter rail yards. The room is of a decent size, but no fridge. You'll find $4.50 bottles of water, so I suggest a stop at Ralph's to pick up a six pack of Arrowhead for $2.49 plus deposit. Free Internet for $269/night? You must be kidding. They have a $20 version and a $16 version. Bought the $16 version which was fine for email, Facebook and general Web surfing. TV had a surprisingly good selection of stations. Hot water was plentiful and shower pressure was fine. Housekeeping -- way friendlier than the front desk -- was very efficient. Beds, however, were another story. Way too soft for my taste. And the pillows -- I piled up three and my head still sank to the mattress. You'll also want to run the fan all night if you don't want to hear trains and trucks. You can walk through the garage and over the pedestrian bridge to the 12th & Imperial trolley station, about a 10 minute walk. On checkout day there was no bill under the door (though someone did manage to deliver the unwanted USA Today). This necessitated another stop at the front desk. When I mentioned to the disinterested woman that I was surprised not to get a bill under the door, I was told, "They don't fit." So, in summation, stay here only if you must be as close to the convention center as humanly possible.

Well like all review about this hotel, it will take you about 5-10mins walk up a hill from Outram Park MRT station. It's actually closer than what you think. As for the room, very small but you pay what you get and the bed was comfortable and the air condition were cold. We stay here for 2 nights and were offer breakfast at an additional price during check in. However, the rate were different during check out but they are very nice enough to offer us the previous rate. In addition to that the night staff had provided excellent service as a taxi cap took me to a different place and tried to charge me extra and the hotel staff came to the rescue. However, it took them about 10 minutes to find my jacket as I left it at the room after check out. Overall it's a good place to stay for a retreat as there really isn't anything near by.

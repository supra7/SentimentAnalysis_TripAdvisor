I stayed here with my family in July, 2005. The room was very clean, and you could smell the furniture polish. All of the tables had just been freshley wiped. The room seemed like it had just been remodeled with fresh paint and carpet. You can tell that the hotel is older due to the older style elevators, but they worked fine....just smaller than new elevators. My room had a microwave, but did not have extras like notepads, pens. etc. I can do without these. You can rent these rooms by the week, and save major money. The pool was clean, and my kids really enjoyed it. As for the other reviews about a green pool, I asked the hotel about it. They said their pool is ONLY open during the summer months. The only drawback I had was the ice machine. It was usually empty, and I found out later why. I saw families filling their huge ice chests with ice, which of course left none for the rest of us.

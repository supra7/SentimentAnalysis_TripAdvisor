I was in Miami for work and booked at the Hilton Downtown. Upon check-in, I was pleased to hear that I'd been upgraded to a Junior Suite because of being a Diamond Hilton member. To my disappointment, my stay wasn't all I'd hoped for. I had some issues with the sink and toilet in the bathroom, which I asked to have repaired twice. The sink was eventually fixed, but the toilet was broken during my entire stay. I was also disappointed that the rooms have not been updated in quite some time. The television was a mammoth of a thing, clearly from the 1990s. The picture quality was bad and the remote was so worn that all the numbers were rubbed off the buttons! Finally, I was disappointed to find that the kitchen closes at 10pm, even on busy weekend nights. I was there over the Super Bowl weekend (when the hotel was completely sold out) and was extremely frustrated that at 11pm my only option for food was to walk to the Checkers across the street. I would think that when the hotel is expecting a massive group of people, they would extend their dining hours.

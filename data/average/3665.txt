The front line staff were generally unhelpful and haughty. There were a few exceptions but it was mostly a very negative experience. Basic room amenities--conditioner has to be requested. Mini bar restocked on request.. Poor conceirge imput--non existent --despite a request for local maps etc !!! I travel extensively and am mostly loyal to the ICH brand--this is the worst ICH experience I have had.worldwide. Houston was a completely different experience with very pleasant and helpful staff. Perhaps some staff training for those in Dallas at the front desk would be a benefit.. I felt they were doing me a favour letting me stay at their hotel It should not be like this.

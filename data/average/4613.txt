We were there for a wedding (in the hotel itself). The rooms were really nothing special. Even with an event discount, a 2 night stay for 2 was close to $700.00. Parking was not included even though we were guests at the hotel. We liked the location; though if we were not there for the wedding, we would probably stayed at a hotel in a different location

I was unsure about staying here having read other trip advisor reviews, however, was pleasantly surprised. The welcome and service at reception were friendly and efficient. The continental breakfast served was perfectly fine. The hotel is VERY basic, especially the room with wafer thin pillows and duvet, but it was fine for a two night stay - and importantly it was very clean. My room was facing the back and was surprisingly quiet - I got a good night's sleep. I take on board comments about noise, but having stayed in the Novotel further up the street on previous occasions, I can say that a room on the front is very noisy there, and that hotel is twice the price! I ate in my room one night, and went out the next so can't comments about the cafe bar, but its very small and not really welcoming. However, there are lots of other places to eat within a very safe walking distance. Don't knock this hotel, it's cheap for London and it does what it says on the tin. If you want better home comforts then seek the Premier Inn across the road, or the Novotel St Pancras ... but they will cost you more!

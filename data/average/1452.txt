First let me start off by saying dont believe everything negative you read in some of the past reviews! That's the way I felt once I saw this hotel for myself. My room was one with a King bed as other reviews correctly stated the rooms are small but the most important thing to me is cleanliness and the room was very clean with a nice flat screen T.V., toaster oven and fridge. My only complaint is the hall smelled a lil musty but I wasnt sleeping in the hall so no big deal. I got a great deal for 1 night and I was quite satisfied. I saw the pool but in my opinion it was too cold to use it and I really didnt have time. The front desk clerks were very nice & friendly. Breakfast was good with waffles and pancakes. The building looks a lil old on the outside but no big deal. I want to thank the review that stated to look out for the purple building because the hotel is behind this building I think it was called Hoolihan's or something like that. Overall I have to say if you are looking for a great deal this is it! I have paid a lot more for a hotel and gotten less.

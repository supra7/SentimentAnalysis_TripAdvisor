The Lexington O Hotel and Suites is located on Canal Street a 10 minute walk from Bourbon Street and other attractions. My husband and I (mid 30s, late 20s) went for the French Quarter Festival April 10-14 of this year and can't wait to go back for the festivities. For the low price of $85 a night we were able to get a room close enough, but far away enough from the action. The hotel itself has a nice lobby, free continental breakfast and in room refrigerator. The service was very good at the front desk. They were very accomodating when we showed up hours in advance. The location of the hotel is my only hesitation when writing a review. It is a few blocks off of Bourbon and is right on the street car line. If you choose, however, to walk down Canal at night, be weary. There are projects just 2 blocks away and people loitering in the street for no reason at all hours. Other hotels in the area at the time were triple the price so the value was there, but the location is questionable. Also, just plan on walking around NOLA for your exercise as the gym is about the size of a closet! I would stay there again since we don't spend much time in our room. Happy travels!

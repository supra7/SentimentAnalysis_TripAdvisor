I stayed one night in Hotel Re! during the Chinese New Year for S$175, this price is relatively cheap when comparing with other 4-star hotel around the area. Once arrived I found the location was not very good. It was on a small hill and not close to MRT station. It says there is a complimentry shuttle bus but the service was not frequent. Luckily its situated on the edge of Chinatown so its easy to travel by taxi to Robertson/Clarke/Boat Quay , the CBD and also the Marina Bay. For the room, it was very tiny but it doesnt matter for me as long as it was very clean with everything I need. The pressure of the shower was great, I had a nice shower. The pillows were a little bit too soft but still ok. There was also a LCD flat screen TV and free Wifi (though it is slow but better than nothing). The hotel staff was very nice especially the ball boy was very helpful with lifting our luggages and helping us to arrange taxi.

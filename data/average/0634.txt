We stayed at the 6th Avenue Inn for three nights when we were starting a road trip from Seattle to Las Vegas. It's a fairly short walk from the coach station which makes it cheap to get to from the airport and manageable even with a fair amount of luggage. There are also some great bars a few streets away, although it's a schlep to the main part of town (we only walked it a couple of times). The room itself was large and reasonably clean, although the shower was not exactly powerful. My one issue was with the staff - not particularly friendly or helpful, took far too long to check us in (there were two staff on duty, neither of whom paid us any attention for 15 minutes so we were stood like lemons while they both appeared to be checking the computer for a while). No recommendations about local places to go or eat - the small lobby has some leaflets but we were looking for advice about a local restaurant. Ended up walking and finding somewhere great anyway. Fabulous trip and we'll go back to Seattle again - but we're not staying here. Other places in the area offered much better service and nicer rooms for a similar rate.

On check in we were asked if we wished to participate in their "green program", wherein we would forego clean towels and linens in exchange for a $5 voucher at their in-hotel restaurant (seven night stay). Sure, we said. Little did we know that what we signed up for was a total lack of service. Trash not emptied, soap, coffee, toilet paper not replenished. "We don't even enter your room", it was explained. The icing on the cake was that, on check out, we found that $15 worth of vouchers were added to our bill, not subtracted. The front desk explained that the restaurant was not owned by Sheraton, so the hotel was not responsible for that error and could do nothing to correct it. (The restaurant promised to get back to us sometime about it. We're still waiting.) So it seems the Sheraton "green program" allows it to lay off several minimum wage housekeeping staff at no cost at all to the hotel. We're all for conservation, but it appears this policy does nothing but conserve profits for the corporation at the expense of working class jobs, and ultimately, our business. (As an aside, why is it that large hotel chains like Sheraton always find it necessary to charge a substantial fee for in-room Wi-Fi, while budget chains and independents always are able to provide it for free? Just asking.)

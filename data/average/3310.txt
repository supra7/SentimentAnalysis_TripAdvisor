We stayed 3 nights as part of a lastminute.com package. Hotel is situated in a predominantly Turkish suburb, about 30 mins tram ride from Amsterdam. Virtually nowhere to eat out in the vicinity, even on a Saturday evening! Hotel dinner at 17,50  and breakfast 10 with no reduction for children. A very shocking incident: in our room the Pay TV was ON by default, and the kids saw hard-core pornography... before their screams woke up my dozing husband! If you have children, make sure the Pay TV is OFF by default when you check in. The kettle in the room was appreciated; it would've been nice to have a mini fridge too.

Great location,helpful staff.Buffet a little ordinary for the price.Rooms look a little tired and the bathroom was very last century.I had to get my husband to turn the shower on as it required more strength than I had.Bed great and birds in the grounds a highlight.pools great as well.Overall fot the price not really worthwhile.Finally the rooms were very noisy.Not so much from adjoining rooms but more from the hallway.

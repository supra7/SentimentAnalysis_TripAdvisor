Stayed at Parrot Key for a week with friends. The resort is fairly new so everything looks fresh. We had a 2 bedroom townhouse(cottage) which had nice rooms, a decent kitchen and good common areas. We booked a "waterfront" cottage and our first surpirse was to find the waterfront was actually a "channel" and not beachfront. So there was no sand, waves or walking on the beach. The bedrooms are nice but the second bedroom has a very small bathroom! Next, the resort is located in a very busy part of town and shares an entrance with Walgreens. The resort has a done a good job with the landscaping so you are somewhat secluded from the traffic and other noise. The housekeeping was lacking...the trash pick up was infrequent so we put our trash out on the front porch almost daily. There are 4 pools and pool bar but the food at the pool bar was substandard. Room rates are not cheap and the resort charges a "resort fee" on top of your room rate...for what I don't know. There are no special amenities in your room, no special parking facilities... so not sure why the "resort fee". The staff was courteous. All in all, Parrot key was nice but I would really have preferred that "waterfront" experience that I thought I was getting.

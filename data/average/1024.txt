This W has a great, club like atomsphere, good looking people. Tried to get a drink at bar, they didn't have wine glasses, bartender had to leave to get some. Took a while. Called to "whenever, whereever" at 6am, no answer. Called again a few min later, no answer. These are minor, but thought I should mention it. I was only there 1 night.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, the bed is very comfortable and if you keep your windows shut it's fairly quiet until the construction starts across the street, just before 7 am. My husband booked their parking and breakfast package for $215. Breakfast is served until 10.30 and checkout is at noon. The lobby is not really suitable for sitting or visiting other guests, but there is a small library with two computers and two small seating areas that can be used for this. The breakfast was fairly simple with yogurts, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages. There are pre-made waffles for you to toast, along with some other pastries, bagels and toast. You also are allowed one espresso or latte, besides regular coffee or OJ. Vancouver is such a beautiful city, and I thought it was a shame to stay somewhere where you don't have a balcony or view of mountains and water. They do offer you free bikes and if you walk or bike down Richards six blocks you end up in George Wainborn Park. From there you can walk or bike for miles along False Creek - a much better location for a hotel IMO. The pool and hot tub are a long walk outside from the little gym - very cold in the winter if you are wearing your bathing suit. The next time we wore the slippers and robes from our room. So poorly designed!

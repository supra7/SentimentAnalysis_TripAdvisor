Ok, well this is a small motel which runs quite efficently. The staff can speak English, fluently enough. Front desk was friendly and check in fast, rooms on the other hand are very small, everything is packed into on small tight room, but hey, the air conditioner was quiet and worked well enough... icy cold if u like. There are many pillows on the bed and the beds where not too hard either. The decor was modern and neutral, room smelt clean, no smoking here! There is tv with 2 or 3 English speaking channels and a tiny yet very clean, compact bathroom with enough room for a small shower cubicle, toilet and hand basin only!! So no more than 1 person in there at any one time because its not possible. All staff members are happy to offer you advice on where to go and what to do and there are many panflets at reception to choose from on what to do etc. Breakfast is great with lots on offer, sweets, cereals, eggs, juices, perculated coffee, toast etc. Yet small breakfast room and again quite tight and crowded- still good value, so dont let that stop u from staying at Eterno. Very close to Taksim square, taxis, public transport, shops, small night markets and fastfood outlets, but try the kebab shop next door, inexpensive and super-delish!

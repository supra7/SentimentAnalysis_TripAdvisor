My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at the Magnolia. Our night in all did not go the way we expected. Checking into the hotel, the lady at the front desk was rude and unwelcoming. We were untold of hidden charges when reserving a room and when I was confused she was even more rude. I was unhappy with the service at the Magnolia. Finally we get settled into our room and head out for dinner in the town. But we get stuck in the elevator. Not a pleasant feeling at all! After dinner we ordered and paid for a movie on the television and it started in the middle of the movie. It was a horrible night for our first year anniversary. However, rooms were beautiful and orderly. I probaby would never stay at the Magnolia again. Highlight of the night was certainly NOT in the Magnolia, but the Iron Cactus Restaurant behind the hotel.

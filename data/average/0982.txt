I booked this room through Orbitz, then I checked with TripAdvisor to read reviews & I was horrified by what I read. I was expecting the worst - dirty, filthy skid-row motel in a slum somewhere. I pulled into the parking lot of an older but clean & well-maintained building. The lobby was warm & inviting with a fire in the fireplace & hot tea for the guests. I was warmly greeted by the receptionist & there were no problems with the internet pre-paid reservation. I thought "this isn't so bad, but how's the room?!?" I opened the door to a clean & nicely appointed room with a new mini refrigerator, comfortable queen sized bed with clean sheets, older but decent bathroom, nice big TV, etc. I found my room quiet, clean & free of any pests. The motel was within walking distance to the Seattle Center & Space Needle. The area around was typical downtown, not perfect, but I always felt safe. I'd love to talk to some of the other guests who wrote these horrible reviews. We really had opposite experiences here. I can say I recommend this motel asa low cost downtown motel within walking distance of major Seattle sights.

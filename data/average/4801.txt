The first thing I should note about this four-star hotel is that it charges (and charges plenty) for internet connection. This fact alone should lead one to avoid this hotel. That said, the hotel is large and historic. It has generally a good atmosphere, starting with the elegant and bustling lobby. The rooms are generally clean, but they vary. We stayed part of our last visit in a small, odd room with a poor bed and the rest in a larger room with a perfectly acceptable bed. Had we stayed the whole time in the first room, I would probably give the hotel two stars above, but the second room would have gotten a four. So I averaged. While I said the rooms were generally clean, there was a piece of plastic wrapping on the hall floor between our room and the elevator that stayed there for the whole time we were there. It seemed to be no one's job to pick it up, and so no one did. That may be part of the problem of running such a large hotel, but it symbolizes to me that the staff here are not going the extra mile for the guests. I did not think the club floor breakfast was particularly special. We recently stayed in a few hotels in Europe, where the breakfast in similarly priced hotels was much better and more varied. The breakfast here was identical, day after day. And on a crowded weekend, the club floor was really a zoo.

booked this hotel through priceline for one night. As other users have said - it was good for the price I paid - but I wouldn't pay full price. The hotel is located some distance from Pike Market and all the action. It was ok for one night. But it wouldnt have been preferable for longer than that. Was given a corner room overlooking the freeway - but I had no problems whatsoever with noise. Room was very clean, large bathroom, coffee machine. Great room service meal. Staff were very friendly accommodating but i was a little disturbed by the fact that the engineer they sent up to sort out my wireless problems didn't knock and just entered my room with a key. I saw him do this. I'd go back for another night for business or whatever - but it's not really a great hotel for tourists.

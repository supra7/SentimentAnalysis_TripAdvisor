I regularly stay at Marriotts and found the Boston Copley hotel to have the usual Marriott amenities, their signature comfortable beds and clean rooms. We were originally booked into to room 1738. The room was small and while the bathroom was clean, as was expected, it too was on the small side. Having only stayed previously in Cambridge I do not know if the rooms are typical in size to other downtown hotels. Only when retiring for bed did we hear the loud hum of the hotel's air conditioning system - and was enough to request a room change at 11.30 p.m because it was impossible to sleep through. We were eventually moved to another room on level 29 which was better, but I would not say perfect. I don't usually complain about hotels (particularly Marriotts) and very infrequently do I ask for a room change - but this one certainly required it. Otherwise a very typical Marriott and ideally placed for downtown with direct covered links to the two main shopping areas - but the next time in Boston it will be back to Cambridge for me.

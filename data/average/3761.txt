The purpose of our trip was to go to the Dallas Cowboys game (Vs. Eagles, Monday night game)... Pros: - Free shuttle service to/from airport, free shuttle anywhere within 5-mile radius is free - bed & pillows were comfortable - free happy hour from 5PM - 6:30PM - free breakfast buffet (good variety) - bathroom goodies are from Bath & Body works (smell good) - clean hotel overall - friendly staff - enjoyable experience Cons: - A/C is very loud, its a unit next to the window it goes on and off every few seconds, its annoying - there's not much to do in the area, only chain restaurants, 1 nudity bar and couple clubs that look pretty boring If we were to go back, we would most likely stay for 1 night meaning fly in, go to the game, sleep at hotel and fly out next morning back home. We went "Downtown" where the aquarium is located, not much there, reataurants and a couple stores. The shuttle also took us to World Trade center although since we are not vendors we can't shop there, its only for vendors and you buy things in bulk. Perhaps since we didn't have our own car we didn't get to see/do much, maybe that would have made a difference, I can't believe that there is not much to do in Dallas, its a big town..Maybe next time.

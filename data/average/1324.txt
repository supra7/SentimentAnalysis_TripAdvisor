My wife and I stay here quite regularly when we visit Seattle to see a football game. The shuttle from the airport is always on time and operates almost 24 hours a day. The rooms are typical Marriott and always clean and functional. The restaurant is good with some very good items and others quite normal. If there is a large convention in the hotel (which occurs quite regularly on weekends) be careful where your room is(stay away from pool side). The hotel is old but has been remodeled very recently but the noise in the hallways and especially around the pool can be very annoying. Standard complaint is the charge for internet usage.

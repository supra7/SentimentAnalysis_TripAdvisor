There was nothing exceptional or memorable about this hotel. The hotel lobby always looked deserted and the gift shop was always closed or either the doors were open with no one working inside. The sleeping rooms were average, I had problems with the hot water not being hot in the bathroom and the AC not adjusting properly. The hotel restaurant food was below average, limited options along with bad quality are not good combinations. There are several chain and local options for eating in walking distance. There is also a mall nearby, the hotel shuttle will drop you off there.

The service at this Hilton property is horrible....we are here for a convention and finally on the third day had to leave housekeeping a note to ask for more soap. (The one teeny-tiny bar that was here when we had arrived wasn't cutting it.) Also by the third day we had to request more toilet paper as that hadn't been replaced either. The hotel is adjacent to an unattractive industrial area, the view from our room is the hotel pool, Coronado Bridge and hundreds and hundreds of shipping containers. The rooms are also quite small for a more expensive hotel, the bathroom is tiny and the closet practically non-existant. For the convention rate of $269, better service was expected. Better service is expected (and generally experienced) at a lower priced hotel.

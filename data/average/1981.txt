We just returned from a stay at the Outrigger Maui Eldorado. First, the positive. The location is fabulous! The resort is in close proximity to Lahaina Town and Whaler's Village, and is on a beautiful stretch of Kaanapalli Beach. Another plus is the Beach Cabana that has lounge chairs, towels, showers, bathrooms and a full kitchen for all your needs. The grounds of the resort are well kept and very beautiful. Front desk staff, concierge, and the staff in the lobby store were all very friendly and helpful. Now, the negative. Prior to choosing this resort, we did extensive research into the facility, including reading all Trip Advisor reviews. The one thing that other travelers kept repeating was to make sure to request a remodeled/updated room, as the condos are all privately owned. Despite making this request at the time of booking (three months in advance), sending an email to the facility a few weeks prior (I did not receive a response), and again requesting an updated/remodeled room at check-in, we were given an extremely outdated unit (J-102). I understand that Outrigger is just the management company for these condo units, however, I do believe a certain amount of quality control should be implemented. The furniture in our unit was chipped and peeling, the couch had a permanent dampness to it, the carpets were stained and dingy, the walls had scuffs and marks on them, the entertainment center was scuffed and marked, the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable, the curtains were dirty and ripped, there was a hole in one of the bathroom doors, the bathroom mirrors were pitted and tarnished, the kitchen counters had dings and marks, and the main patio doors in the living room didn't quite shut all of the way. Having said all of that, the unit was extremely spacious and open with an amazing view of the golf course and the ocean beyond it. All the unit needs is a little money and some TLC. There is a lot to be said for pride of ownership.

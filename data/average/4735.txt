I was very disappointed with this hotel. I had read such great reviews and gave up a hotel with a pool to stay here under the premise that there would be a fish in the room to entertain my child. I emailed the hotel well in advance and they assured me they'd put one in the room. Upon check in they again told me the fish would be coming. Nothing happened. I called again and was finally told, hours later, that they had no fish, much to my child's disappointment. The reason given was vague - either the fish dies or they ran out. The point is that they never bothered to tell me this - I had to find out after many attempts and I don't like that kind of treatment at what is supposed to be a four star hotel. The room was not that clean, either (hair, dust), and the wallpaper was coming off the walls in spots. If I were to make a choice again, I'd go with a hotel with a pool. There are many other choices.

This was my first stay at this Courtyard. It was pretty much what I expected. Basic room: bed, TV, work area, chair, coffee maker. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel, but I used neither so can not comment on the food or service. The staff was friendly and helpful. There are restaurants and shopping within walking distance, as well as a trail along the lagoon. You are not too far from Old Town San Diego (quick drive) which is a neat place to see. There is a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. This is a great place to stay if you have an early morning flight because it takes less than five minutes to get to the terminal. Hint: If you have a rental car and want to save time in the morning, you can return the rental car the night before departing, take their shuttle to the airport, then call the hotel to pick you up. This saves a lot of time and allows you those precious extra few moments of sleep. The parking is free, which is a big advantage over some other hotels in the area. Overall, this is a no-frills hotel at a decent price and a good location. I would stay here again.

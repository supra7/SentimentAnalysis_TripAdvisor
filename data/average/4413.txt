Stayed here for one night in July 2008. Very mixed view. The rooms are great, and if you have one with a river view, even better. But the common areas are dated, worn, and in need of upgrading. On-site lounge, allegedly voted "Boston's best jazz club," was shut down before 11;30 at night. Also, the neighborhood is horrible. You are right off the highway, but there is no area to walk around in. Bordered on the expressway on one side, railroad tracks on another, an intersection, and an industrial park. So, you can't walk around outside the perimeter fence. The property definitely serves a purpose, but you could probably do better. Good value, sure, but I'm not itching to return.

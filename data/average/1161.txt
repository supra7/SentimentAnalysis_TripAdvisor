I made the mistake of booking a room at Hotel Max for 10 days. I should have gone with another hotel. 10 days was too long. The Hotel Max is good for a 1 or 2 night stay. It's funky and in a good location. The service is good and the attached restaurant is also very good. The rooms are small, the walls thin, and unless you get a room at the back (like I had to request after settling into my first room at midnight) buses will be rolling by your window well into the night. The Hotel Max is a good choice, but for the price, the Fairmont or the W would be a better choice.

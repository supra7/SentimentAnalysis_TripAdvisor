This hotel is very old but clean, quiet, and close to everything. We arrived Friday night and walked everywhere the next two days. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The only downside was the rather expensive parking fee and lack of a small refirgerator in the room for keeping some of the goodies bought at Pike Market. Recommended for a fun weekend.

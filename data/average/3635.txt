I often stay at Choice Hotels in order to build my Choice Privileges Points. This Comfort was OK. I really don't have a problem with the cleanliness, but the details could be watched a little better. Some of the room items are worn, and need replaced. I'm going to look for a different Choice property in Dallas for my next trip.

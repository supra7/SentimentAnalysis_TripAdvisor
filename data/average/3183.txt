We booked this hotel upon recommendations of TripAdvisor. A warm welcome. We got offered (alcoholic) welcome drinks. A free bottle of wine in the room on arrival. The bedroom is nicely decorated but tiny. No room for a chair.The bathroom is very small, especially for tall people. Amenity kits provided in a box on the dresser. There is room for improvement regarding the breakfast offering. Perhaps they could serve Turkish coffee. But what a great location. Within walking distance to Sultanahmet Mosque, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace. When they failed to provide our transfer to the airport, they solved it by paying a taxi for us.

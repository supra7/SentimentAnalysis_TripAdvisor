watch out for hidden charges I found what I thought was a great deal on this hotel and booked with them directly. They were having problems with their reservation system on line, but I was able to email the reservations desk and make the reservation. I had read so many good reviews about the hotel that I was really looking forward to my visit. I actually liked the location as it is close to many other hotels and restaurants and the Potts Point area is lovely and Kings Cross very interesting. My biggest problem was that the website indicated the rooms 'come with high speed internet access'. I discovered that the rooms have access available but the cost was $10/hour, $20 for 4 hours or $30/day. I did complain to the front desk and they said that they were aware that the website said this but that the internet was provided by an outside server and they had no control over the cost. The cost was added to my bill through the hotel, so I wondered about this. I wrote an email to the hotel while I was there reiterating my objection and did not receive a response. This really coloured my impression of the hotel. I didn't mind so much that the room was very tiny as it was in the back of the hotel and pretty quiet, or that 2 lightbulbs were burned out, or even that the sink was leaking all over the floor, as these issues were addressed immediately. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful, in all respects, except for the internet issue. Most hotels do seem to include this free of charge, and I wouldn't have objected if the website did not suggest that it was free. As long as you are prepared for the extra cost and can get a good deal, this is a pretty fair place to stay I reckon, but there are many other hotels in the same area where internet access is free.

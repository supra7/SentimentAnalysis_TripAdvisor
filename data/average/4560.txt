Got a great rate from AAA. First room we got (6th floor) had a chemical smell that would not go away. Mentioned this at front desk and by the time we got back from a concert we had been relocated to the 8th floor. No problem with that room. Room was on the small side as well as the bathroom but OK. Parking is expensive. Centrally located near two T stops made getting around very easy. Conceirge seemed overwhelmed by requests and to answer a simple question had to go over to the front desk. First asked a clerk who didn't know the area (he was from Germany!) but then got good directions. Skipped the food as the prices were high. Didn't like the VERY slow elevators and having to go up and down a floor to get from/to street level. I've seen better.

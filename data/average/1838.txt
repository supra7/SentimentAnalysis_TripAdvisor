We stayed here in November 2007 as part of a Maui Invitational package. This property has some great attributes, including the pool area, the swans, birds, fish on the property, and beach access. However, the property is really showing signs of wear, and I'm not sure when they last renovated the property. I admit a bias toward high end resorts and new properties, and it is with this perspective that I feel this property has been neglected from a renovation standpoint. Example: We stayed at the Ritz last year, and while it was nicer than the Hyatt, it is closed this year for renovations. The rooms are OK, but just OK. The main pool area is crowded with lounge chairs, and low on staff and service. The kids pool is nice for the kids, and our daughter enjoyed it immensely. The luau had some really great performances, but it is poorly organized, with long waits in line for seating, and long waits for the buffet line. This kind of treatment is not kind to guests (particularly young children and their grandparents) and could be avoided by a little planning by the staff. For what we paid, I would rather spend more and stay at a true five star property, like the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.

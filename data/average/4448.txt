Stayed here for a business trip. Location is very good and room was very nice as well. Only disappointment was breakfast. The Hilton Honors breakfast was minimal, fruit and baked goods. All the other Hiltons that I have spent the night offered a full breakfast so that was the only bad part of the stay. Parking is also very expensive.

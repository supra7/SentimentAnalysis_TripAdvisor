This is a nice hotel in many ways. My room was gorgeous clean and quiet. But service was on again, off again. Bar not very friendly. Room service pretty good. Front desk great. Coffee maker only had decaf coffee despite several requests. Maid service was dicey. If you are in your room in the AM you may or may not get your room cleaned. Housekeeping does weird things. I left the robe on the bed. They took it away and didn't replace it. Cleaned room but left used cups and glasses laying about. All in all it's now awful--just odd quirks not up to usual hotel service. The big downside of this hotel is the dual elevator system. You must take an elevator from the entrance to the lobby on the third floor and then a different elevator to your room. The lobby elevator often has long lines and long waits. I was willing to take the stairs but this seems to be impossible. They could easily fix this problem by making stairs accessible. Some would take the stairs, clearing the elevators for those with luggage and those who don't want to walk.

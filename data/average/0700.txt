I found our stay at the edgewater hotel to be an overall disappointment. My first complaint was the price of parking, costing somewhere in the range of $30+/day, which was enough to motivate us to take the train and use public transportation during our short visit. Secondly, the hotel offers wifi, but charges hotel guests about $5/hour and $10/day for use! The cheapest room in the hotel is well over $100/night and yet they feel it's warranted to charge for Wifi!?!? I've stayed in hostels that provide more complimentary services than the Edgewater. We also ordered the pancakes from the breakfast menu and found tem to be very dry, requiring a knife to cut. On to the positives... The Edgewater is conveniently located on the waterfront with a wonderful view of Peugeot Sound. It's a short walk to Pikes place market (about 15 minutes), and the 99 bus picks up in front of the hotel. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. We didn't done in the restraunt suing our stay, but it looked very nice and they have live music on the weekend. My opinion towards hotels is that it's a place for me to sleep while I'm enjoying whatever location I'm visiting. I'd prefer to save some money on lodging, and spend it anywhere else but hiding away in a hotel room. If you don't mind spending a lot of money on a room and plan on spending a lot of time around the hotel, the Edgewater is very comfortable and in a beautiful location. If you just need a clean quite too to sleep in, I'm sure there are better options in downtown Seattle.

We were looking for a simple, safe and comfortable hotel to stay at in Amsterdam. Some friends recommended the RobertRamon hotel, located in the Museum district. This is a small and simple hotel. Our room was small but had almost all we needed, we had to take our own hair dryer though.The beds were surprisingly comfortable. We did not want to spend too much money and this was the perfect choice. The neighborhood is very chic and it is only a couple of blocks away from the Van Gogh and Rijks museums. I almost forgot to mention that the desk workers were very friendly and helpful.

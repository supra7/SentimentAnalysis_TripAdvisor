We stayed at this property for 4 nights in early September. The location is very convenient - a quick walk to Istikal Caddesi and Tunnel. The property is nice and clean and has some modern accents. Breakfast is complimentary and pretty decent, but make sure to get there in time because they'll start cleanning out the area right when it ends (10:30am if I remember correctly). They also offer complimentary Wi-Fi which was a plus. The rooms and hallways are small and tight, but that's typicall of most buildings in Istanbul, particularly in the Pera district. We didn't have any problems with noise, but the hotel does acknowledge that it can get loud at night in the area and offers complmentary ear plugs. The rooms are basic and offers the essentials. Our only complaint is regarding the in-room safe, which is basically useless. It's very small and not attached to anything, so anybody can just carry it away if they were robbing the room (see attached pics). Overall I think the property is a good value for its price point and in a convenient location to set out to and come back from sightseeing. I would say it's a solid 3-star and not a 4-star as they claim. And definitely not a 4-star comparing to the equivalents in the US.

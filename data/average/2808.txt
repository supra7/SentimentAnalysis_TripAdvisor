I was here with my souse for Sugar Bowl 2011. I read reviews before coming to New Orleans and can understand some of the concerns. For this event, things were good at this hotel. I am not sure when there isn't any events. It felt very safe because police were on every corner of most blocks. They said that their self parking ($14) was full. We used the valet parking ($22) which worked, but a guest stated that his vehicle was ticketed from valet parking his car in an authorized space. He said that management was suppose to clear it up but I am not sure. Bourbon St/French Quarter is just short 5 to 10 minute walk a few blocks away. We also walked to and from the Superdome in no time at all. The hotel is old, but it is clean and our room was pretty clean. We did find trash in the ice bucket. We were curious to why our toilet paper was wet and later found out that there was a leak in the ceiling. Maintenance came and then told me they solved the problem but what they did do did not work. They sent up two extra rolls of tissue. If I had a longer stay I would have wanted another room. The breakfast at the hotel is one of the best in the business. Only Drury Inn breakfast compred to it. Basically a full breakfast with hot food(eggs, sausage, grits, cold food,, fruit, cereal, waffles, all beverages.ect... The kitchen in the rooms have stove top, microwave, and mini Fridge. I would recommend the hotel to someone who is not lookinjg for perfection. It is nice especially if you get a good deal for the area. The location is between french quarter and Superdome. It is more quiet than if you stayed in French Quarter.

The north end of the motel is adjacent to two vacant lots with a fence around them, to the south are a number of restaurants that are closed including Bennigan's (which no longer has any locations in AZ). And to the west is the Metro Mall with 2 of 5 anchor's vacant. When I've gone past this location in the past, the sign said "$29," today it is $33. PLUS they want another $5 for WiFi. But after I found out that the closest Motel 6 was $35 and the Best Western would not honor their coupon for $44, I decided to stay. The motel 'still' looks like a 1st class motel, I say still because often a motel in this price range buy a good motel cheap and let it go down hill fast. So far that doesn't seem to be the case for this motel. Pool area was well kept, as was the grass and parking lot. No complaints on the room either. But no extra perks either. Bed, table, TV, room was clean, water was hot, room was warm. Great choices of food across the street, Burger King, Olive Garden and Four Points by Sheraton. If I stay here again will depend on if I need Wi-Fi that night or not. (I'm not going to give my credit card on-line to get Wi-Fi)

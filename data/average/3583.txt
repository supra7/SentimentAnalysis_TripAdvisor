We rented from an owner and the unit was no where near as nice as the one we rented in 2009 from Worldquest. We had to drive to another resort to get the keys. We arrived to find unit dirty,lacking promised welcome pack and many broken bits. (Ex) doors off hinges,shower pole held up with folded cereal box. The odor was disgusting. The next day we recieved a legal letter from Worldquest mgt under door stating we would be prosecuted to full extent of Florida law if we used the ameneties including the pool which we had PAID for already! The property manager Mark was civil but not at all helpful and informed me multiple times that I was not HIS customer. We argued with the other resort where we got the keys, the unit owner's representative and Mr. Smallwood whom we had rented from believing this was his unit. The manager at LBV was nice and apologetic. After wasting most of my son's birthday arguing and looking up our rights etc we finally got moved to another unit who paid thier condo fees. We had to drive to collect the new keys and move everything to another building on our own. Apparently the owner we rented from was delinquent so WE were punished for it. There are too many internal issues between management and owners which should have nothing to do with the guests. Unfortunately the Management seems to be taking the stance that if they hurt the customers the unit owners will stop renting out thier units privately. As it stands I would not recommend anyone rent any unit until this is resolved. it was not a nice way to spend our holiday. In fact with so many other similar places to stay within a mile or two, I seriously don't think I would ever risk staying here again. be sure to confirm the owner of the unit you will be staying in is current on his ameneity fees or you will be in for a nasty surprise.

As a 24 year elite member of Marriott I have been in a lot of Marriott Hotels around the globe. I had never stayed in this hotel, so this is my first impression. I was put on the Concierge level. One very big gripe I have when a hotel has a lot of convention guests like me during this visit, is that they close the Concierge Lounge and all services associated with it from FridY pm until SundY pm. We are business people at a convention. We are paying the rate, but not getting the service we are paying for. I could care less about the fact the wonderful personnel who take care of the Congierge Lounge need a break on weekend. Use it to train others. The least you can do is to open it and allow access to coffee and soda pop and water. Is that too much to ask, cheap hotel owners? Now that that's over, know that the location is superb, particularly for shopping and getting to the Hynes without going out in the elements. The fitness, swimming,spa area has been renovated and is greAt. The rooms are just OK and haven' changed much in the last decade. One of my other peeve is the lack ofnsheets and blankets. You get a comforter which seems to work very well for my spouse, but I have to throw it off as being too hot about 4 times a night. That is why I really stay away when I am alone on trips from Marriott's and got to the lower brands, as they are more comfortable regarding bedding for men who tend to have a very different temperature desire when sleeping.

Stayed here for 3 nights and nothing stands out that was overwhelmingly negative or overwhelmingly positive. The location is good - but be warned, the walk to the waterfront is down a very very steep hill. The room was nice, very comfortable bed, also nice tv and sitting area, refrigerator, everything seemed new and well placed. The water pressure in the shower could be improved, but it was ok. Good service and nice views on the 28th.

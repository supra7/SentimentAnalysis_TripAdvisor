Two nights. Hotel front entrance currently undergoing renovation. Absolute mess outside but little disruption to inner workings after hours as far as I could see, only annoyance was having to enter through side door. I did not buy the old world charm here at all. Old world charm? Try Peninsula HK, or FS Paris, or Bristol etc. This is tacky and run down. Reminds me of Claridges London before renovation. Checkin superb, professional, courteous and knowledgable. Jefferson was front staff on various occasions. This young chap should be commended. Also allowed me to get another room was not happy looking at second floor air con vent. Bed felt clean and quite comfortable. Mattress must be newer than other furnitures in the room (thank God they updated what counts...). Carpet typical patterned affair but just feels worn out... Bathroom clean. In room dining 20 minutes late, nearly missed meeting. Oak Room restaurant was good value. Great service too. If travelling alone you could do much worse than eating here. Great access to shopping with the whole Copley Square complex stone's throw away (of course you could do Westin or Marriott).

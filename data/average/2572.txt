Maybe I was lucky compared to some other guests. I had a room on the 3rd floor, facing the back of the hotel, and it was very, very quiet indeed, and very clean. On the downside, the beds are too soft and spongy to be comfortable, but on the plus side, the aircon worked well, it felt safe, the TV worked well, and everything you need is on your doorstep. To be fair, I did stay mid-week, and I would imagine that doors banging all night long had it been a weekend night may have been a little off-putting. Moral of the story is - the hotel is probably not good for a weekend stay if you want a quiet night, but ideal for the quieter weekday nights, when the hotel seemed to be full of business travellers.

The hotel is reasonably priced and very clean. Good rooms but not very big. You have to pay astronomical amounts for Internet. Only a couple of staff were very efficient , others looked as if they were new in the job Not many good TV channels , but being Indian I found a few Indian channels. Break fast spread was reasonably good but for Dinner, the choices were pretty limited and added to that is there are no good restaurants in the vicinity. You have to travel 4-5 Kilometers to find one. or go to the Dubai Mall. They do have a good lounge bar and happy hours :) A slightly out of place but , Since i had work in the neighborhood this was certainly convenient. Definitlely a NO for a tourist.

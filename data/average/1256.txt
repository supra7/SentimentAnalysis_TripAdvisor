We generally stay at an Embassy Suites before flying on to our destination. We have done this for years and have enjoyed having a suite and the nice complimentary breakfast that is offered. However, recently their rates seem to be too high and they seem to be hosting a lot of conventions - with large numbers of children and/or young adults who appear to have never stayed in a hotel before - they are constantly riding the elevators and running around the halls that overlook the atrium. As a result we are actively looking for other places to stay. The restaurant that is in the hotel is generally quite good and saves having to go out to eat.

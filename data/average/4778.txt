The room I was in was a nice size. Very difficult to navigate the numbering system to the floors but as a compromise there are pictures of very famous entertainers all along the hallyways so you can remember "turn right at Nat King Cole".. or something similar. The room I was in had been upgraded at some point because it had granite in the bathroom and a newer bowl shaped sink. But the age of the hotel still shows through in the tiling in the bathroom. Also I had wallpaper peeling in my room and the part of the showerhead that attaches to the wall was hanging off. Not appreciated for this level of hotel and the rates it commands. I didn't have a view, just some part of the rooftop. Kept the curtains drawn. However I did not have a view of the train tracks, which I heard several complaints about. The tracks are very close to the hotel. This is not the hotel's fault but if you are on that side of the hotel it may disturb you. Seems they run more frequently during the day but it's something worth checking out. For sure if you are on that side of the hotel request a high floor so you are not literally next to the train. There is no shelf space in the bathroom if that is important to you. The sink takes up most of the counter and there is no additional shelving. There is a small glass shelf about the size of a couple of postcards on the wall but that was very loose and unstable in the room I was in. The bathroom door would not remain open so I propped it open with an ottoman and put a towel on top of that and used it for additional space to lay items. In room dining was fast and very nice; usual hotel pricing. About $22 for a full breakfast of meat, potatoes, eggs, juice, tea and toast, including tax and mandatory service charge. I found the service to always be top notch.

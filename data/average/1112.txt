Seasoned business travelers or people looking for usual hotel amenities will probably be disappointed with this supposed 3 1/2 star hotel. I would say that is grossly inflated and it more on par with 2 1/2 star hotels. That said, the location is great for tourists or people who plan to be out all day sightseeing and yet are centrally located and don't need a car. The "hotel" manages to add a bit of fun/ playfulness, if you are on vacation that might be a perk. If you travel with a car prepare on spending about $30 a night to park here. With the price I paid on Hotwire, I was okay with it. But this place feels more like a private room in a hostel, than a hotel. It is kinda a neat "Seattle" and "urban" experience. Especially if you are kinda sheltered and want "an experience" with your lodging. The room is VERY small. but also clean and cute. But don't forget, very small. The front desk clerk seemed a bit unprofessional, but acceptable. The maid walked in on us dressing at 9am, even though we had the "Nope" tag clearly on the door and responded to her knocks. She still walked in. Walked out and then started singing loudly outside the door. If you like this sort of thing, great. The Hotel Max is in a cool older building, that has been revamped with paint and "funky" touches. It can be a neat experience staying here because it's not really like a traditional hotel, but if you want traditional amenities, it isn't that good. The bed was very comfortable. Large TV. Interesting hallways. Hot water.

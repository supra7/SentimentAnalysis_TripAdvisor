Stayed here for 4 nights while attending a conference. You cannot beat the location. It's perfect & close to the T (subway system), restaurants, shopping & some historic sites. From the 2nd floor of the hotel you can connect to 2 different shopping malls. We ladies there for the conference especially liked that. The whole hotel was very clean & the service while checking in was exceptional. However, I must agree that the rooms are very outdated & smaller than I expected. The A/C worked great & everything again was very very clean. The beds were pretty comfortable too. If they would spruce up the room furnishings & make it more modern except of 1990s, the hotel would be perfect. The lobby & other areas of the hotel were very modern. Only the guest rooms were outdated. I would still recommend this hotel though.

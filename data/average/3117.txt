It wasn't as hard to find as said below - a couple elevators from Kowloon station, then follow the signs. I had a pretty bad check-in experience, my bag was lost for almost an hour somewhere in the abyss of the hotel, after our other room's bags were delivered with delay. There is rust in the shower in both rooms we had. Everything else is rather precisely what you would expect as a W guest - which I wanted - including the concierge's local knowledge. We wanted to ask a question from Whatever/Whenever a little after midnight and there was no-one to pick up the phone. The concierge is unavailable here after midnight (!). This W is not particularly near anything, taxis are cheap though and the MTR is very close. In conclusion, I won't stay here again, but if you insist on the W, this is a normal quality W. Not a 5 star hotel. (Plain SPG)

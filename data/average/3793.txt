It was clean, if small. It was noisy at night, but not to where it bothered me. The breakfast was minimal, but hey its free and the room is very inexpensive. The key is location. You're only minutes from anywhere downtown and as we were seeing a Mavs game and Medieval Times, this was a very handy location. We do things all day and all night and come back and crash and get up and do it again. The low price allowed us to do more while we're here. I'll soon forget what the room was like, but I'll always remember our fun trip to Dallas.

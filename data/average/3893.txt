We stayed for 4 nights in a one bedroom executive suite. At first it looked great but when you look better you see it's all a bit worn out. And that's really not what we expected. It's also called a resort (and has a resort fee) but had only some facilities. A small bar for breakfast and a swimming pool. That's it. Next time we're taking another hotel. Good points: - friendly dutch receptionist - the bed was good - the bathroom had a big shower place - the complete kitchen Bad points: - room was dusty - windows in bedroom could not be opened - furniture was damaged - many scratches on the walls

UPS - Excellent room, with big plasma TV, DVD player, FREE OF CHARGE wireless connection, complete kitchen with fridge for a whole family, microwave, coffee machine, washing machine, etc - Excellent Food at Room Service - Nice and efficient Staff, always ready to help - Location near the Exhibition Center, Financial Centre. DOWNS - Bad location for taxi drivers. They dont know where the hotel is and there is NO big signal on the road or top of the building. - Sometimes it is not easy to get a taxi there. But staff is helping a lot and finding one for you in 10 min. - Price a bit higher compared to other reputated hotels in the same area.

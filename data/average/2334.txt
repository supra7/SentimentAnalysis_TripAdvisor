Had high hopes based on all the reviews. The resort has a good potential, but there are a few key things that negate the positives. Some of the points below could have resulted from really low occupancy, as the resort seemed about 70% empty. Here is a recap: Positives: - Newer resort, facilities and rooms look fresh - Good layout with lots of space, large beach - Large pools, enough space for everyone; no need to reserve chairs or palapas (this could be different if the resort were full) - Ecopark and rivers provide some fun activities - Premium drinks - Pizza parlor is a nice option for lunch, pizzas are basic but made well - Staff are friendly enough, seem to be trying but often lack experience / polish that exists at other resorts. Negatives: - Really poor choice of food - very basic breakfast and lunch (far worse than options at similarly priced all-inclusive resorts) - For dinner - only 1-2 restaurants are open, dining options are very basic - One kitchen serves all restaurants and it shows; food at the asian restaurant was very poor - The staff often do not know what restaurants / activities are open; would give contradicting or incorrect information Recommendations: The resort is built well and could really compete with the premium resorts in the area. The owners should "steal" experienced management from well-run resorts (Secrets, Excellence, etc) to make things run better, improve food options (variety and quality), improve service, even if it means charging more. They should also build a bar close to the beach and change the "sports" bar. The developers have a 10 year plan to build 1000 rooms in the space to the north, but unless they improve the food I doubt they will have many returned guests.

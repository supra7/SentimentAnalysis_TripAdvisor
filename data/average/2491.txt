It's clear the hotel was "trendy" but I thought it seemed tired and a bit worn. Room was on the small side and bathroom was also small - no tub. I think I am comparing it to my last stay at the Trump Hotel In Chicago which was WOW! No time for the spa so can't say. On busy street (noisy even early Sunday morning) so stay on an upper floor.

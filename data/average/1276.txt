I arrived from the East Coast and was unable to continue my onward travel same day, so I stayed at this inexpensive airport location. It's so close that the airport shuttle arrives very quickly after contacting the hotel on the free phone. I was a little nervous when I saw that my room was next to the fitness center, but no one was being ambitious enough to exercise; so I had a quiet stay. If you simply need a place to sleep near the airport, this hotel is just fine.

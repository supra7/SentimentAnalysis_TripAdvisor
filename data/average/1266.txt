We had booked a room at the Embassy Suites for $100 near the airport. Would not recommend it. Originally, we didn't plan to ck in til late (around 11pm after riding train back from Vanc), so basically just needed a clean, quiet place to sleep that was close to airport for early flight. But our plans changed and we got back to Seattle early. Embassy would have been fine for our original plans for just a place to sleep, but arriving early, by cab w/o own car, there was nothing nearby, the pool was indoor and packed with young kids, the jacuzzi had foam floating on top that was a good 12 inches thick (I believe this is due to impoper filtration and excessive body oils- yucky), the exercise room was a couple treamills, and a couple other things, but kids were playing on them, so we didn't use the pool/gym area. The pool room had adult hours, but not til 10pm. Internet was only available at an addtl $15 charge, and the business room with 2 computers was cramped and set up so people could watch over your shoulder, I had to wait for a turn in order to do on-line ck in and print out our air boarding passes. The free cook to order breakfast isn't served til 7am on weekends, so with our 7:30am flight we had to leave w/o breakfast. The free airport shuttle was good and the beds were comfortable but small, the rooms felt dark and dingy because the front window looked into an enclosed courtyard type area (which gets very loud during happy hour), the bedroom window looked out at the Mariott Courtyard. I guess if you had your own car to go elsewhere for entertainment, and were staying a while w/ a need for the kitchenette, for the price this might be worth it, but not for a short stay.

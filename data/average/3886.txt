Its as expected, except for the non suite rooms have a shared entrance with the other half of the 2 bed lockoff and if you get a noisy family closing the doors loudly and talking a lot then it can be very annoying. I have stayed at other hotels in orlando with a lower tripadvisor rating that I would consider better for a couple without a family. The pool area had lots of screaming kids too.

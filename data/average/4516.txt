We found this hotel to be overpriced for what you get. Our room was fine and had a partial view of the city. We gave our bags to the Bellhop-- took a full half an hour for him to get them upstairs, despite there being no other guests baggage at check-in when we arrived. We had to call down and ask for the bags to come up again. Beds were comfortable. The food in their downstairs restaurant (Avenue?) was ridiculously overpriced. The menu looked fun and creative, but when we got our breakfast, it was really just very typical hotel food.

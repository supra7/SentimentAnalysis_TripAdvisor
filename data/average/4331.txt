My wife and I stayed here for about a week in June. We got a room with king bed for $100 per night via Priceline, not a bad deal for Boston hotels. It happened to be our one year anniversary, so the front desk gave us a relatively decent room at the end of a hallway, with extra windows I think. It was quiet, good size, and had some views. In general, the furnishings were fine, big closet, bed was fine, etc. The ceiling in the bathroom was crumbling and chipping a little, so we had to make sure our toiletries wouldn't get in the way of the falling debris. And the window shades were coated in some plastic that produced a strong odor when they were in the sun too long. The AC was adequate but not great. It was pretty hot that week. Location of the hotel is excellent, half block from Arlington Green Line stop and the Public Gardens. Easy walk to Newbury Street. Hotel just needs a little more room upkeep but it's fine. Lobby is nice and they have Starbucks coffee and pastries in the morning at the cafe. Also an Au Bon Pain right outside.

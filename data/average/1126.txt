We only stayed here for one night, but I wasn't impressed. Although we did have a great view of the Space Needle and the hotel is centrally located, the rooms and hotel decor were a negative for me!! The hotel decor is ultra modern/trendy....not warm/cozy and inviting. The room size is TINY...didn't even have enough space to open our medium size suit case on the floor. The bathroom is also small with tiny sink and shower stall. We were thankful that among all the modernness we did have a surprisingly comfortable bed. They have a "pillow menu" so that guest are able to choose the right pillow for their comfort....great idea, but we were satisfied with the given pillows in the room and didn't take advantage of this service. After an overcast, rainy day in Seattle I was looking forward to coming back to a cozy place for the evening and I just didn't get that feel. The hallways are black and white with different bold full-length pictures on the doors...yuck! To make matters even worse, the rooms are cooled with a window unit air conditioner that makes a loud, rattling noise while you are trying to relax and sleep. I definitely would not stay here again. Although we did get a great price, I would now choose to pay extra and have a better experience all around! I'm not a hotel snob by any means, but this was just average at very best!

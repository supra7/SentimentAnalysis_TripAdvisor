This did the trick for me, as all I needed was a place to lay my head at the end of the day. It is conveniently located by the Seattle Center, and is easy walking distance to good food and other attractions. There was an issue with the toilet in the room I was in, and the staff promptly fixed it. It's also nice that the rooms have kitchenettes.

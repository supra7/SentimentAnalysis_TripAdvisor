Honestly, one of the most beautiful hotels I've ever seen. However, historical does mean old, so the hotel was not without its problems. There were wires hanging from the ceiling, the elevators had a hard time keeping up with the increased traffic, and the room key kept deactivating in spite of being careful. However, the staff was wonderful from start to finish and were very, very helpful. The rooms were a little on the pricey side, and the extras (food, parking, and internet) were, too. There were very few luxuries included or extra. There is a 50/50 chance that I would stay there again.

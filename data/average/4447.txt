Used HHonors points for our stay, would have been very disappointed to spend real money here. Rooms are oddly shaped and not worthy of Hilton name. Higher floors have excellent views; our first 2 rooms were unacceptable - bad view, stained carpets, taped up window frames. However, front desk made it right and the breakfast staff was excellent, especially Jasoda! Thanks to all who made our trip great!

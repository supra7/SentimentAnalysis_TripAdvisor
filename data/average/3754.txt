We had a reservation for 2 rooms beginning December 31 for 3 nights that we made six or seven weeks in advance. We were in town for a football game and were excited because we were going to take advantage of many of the Downtown activities for New Years Eve. When we arrived at the hotel at 7:30pm, they didn't have our rooms and walked us to a Springhill Suites 6-7 miles away on Loop 12. While they paid for our rooms that night, we didn't get to attend any of the NYE activities because we didn't want to fight the traffic or deal with parking and the NYE drunks. We checked into the hotel again the next morning and our rooms weren't ready. We went out and about and by the time we checked in, there wasn't a king bed room available as we had requested. We also didn't realize till check out, but when they had re-instated our rooms, they put the rate in wrong. The location of the hotel is GREAT as are most of the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. They recommeded several places to go that turned out to be excelled. We used valet during our stay and it seemed to be constantly backed up. When we returned to the hotel the last night there after our football game, we left a leather coat and hat in the car. When we returned home, we realized we didn't have either one. From both our memories and our pictures, the only time it could have been taken was from the car that night. I called the hotel a couple of times and left messages for Lost and Found but never recieved a call back. We suspect the valet didn't lock the door and somebody wandered through the parking lot checking for unlocked cars. We realize we shouldn't have left anything in the car but locking the car should be a basic requirement for valet.

all you need to do is walk across the street, pass through the sheraton hotel, and you're smack dab in the hynes convention center! the hilton is a bit drab and out-dated. one would think that the hilton brand epitomized quality and a smidge of luxury. this one was wrong. the lobby was not much to see. in fact, it seemed like a small, no-brand, hotel lobby. the personnel was comprised of a series of warm bodies. really here-nor-there; no pleasantries. the concierge was a hit-or-miss...mostly a miss. whether calling or going to the lobby to see one, s/he was like "where's waldo?" bummers. the rooms were roomy, but again, outdated. it's as if they need a brighter paint or wall-covering because it seemed drab and dark. the bathroom was below average; in need of an update. in general, the accommodations were drab, but the location and price fit. then again, we got a special rate. had we not, and we paid what the rack rate was, i would've felt ripped off. the location, AGAIN, is great! try to find something else around the neighborhood OR good luck here...

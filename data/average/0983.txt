We booked this hotel many months before our trip but of course didn't look at the reviews until right before we left. After reading some really harsh reviews we were a bit scared. Well most of what we read in the reviews were not our experience. We walked into a clean, well kept front desk area and were helped by a very pleasant young lady who in spite of dealing with some computer glitches always had a smile and was very quick to get our room. Yes, the hotel was dated but you could tell updates were being made and overall it was clean. We didn't use the pool but the area looked very nice. We certainly would have if we would have had the time. The one complaint we would have were the bathrooms. The bathtubs definitely need replacing. It was a great location as we walked to the Space Needle, (although I wouldn't recommend walking after dark, it is still downtown) and the price was right.

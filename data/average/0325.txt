This was my second time staying at this hotel; I travel to WA every few months for business and will not be staying at this hotel again. Not that it was the worst place Ive ever stayed, but as a solo female traveler I didn't feel comfortable. The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up. When I notified an attendent my vehicle had been broken in to and items stolen he just shrugged and walked away. For the cost of the room and parking (nearly $200 for one night) it wasnt worth the hassles and condition of the room.

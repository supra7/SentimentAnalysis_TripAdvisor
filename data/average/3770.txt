I picked Hotel Lawrence, through Hotels.com and got a ridiculously cheap rate. I read some reviews and remained optimistic. It is a very outdated hotel. I'm sure it was great in its prime. I will say the room was so clean, which I greatly appreciated. If you aren't picky and you just want a clean mediocre place you'll be happy. If you want luxurious and fancy you won't be pleased.

Someone put a lot of thought into restoring this place built 100 years ago and squarely in the middle of downtown Seattle. A bit hard to access in traffic. The rooms are very simple with few amentities. Claw foot tub is hard to get into for older folks and didn't seal for a bath, just a shower. Bottom line..OK for one night when you have to be close to the ball park, but not quite comfortable.

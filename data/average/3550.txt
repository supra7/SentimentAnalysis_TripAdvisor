The hotel ambience is pretty clean and the reception desk does a good work. However, for internet access (you don't have free wi-fi) they charge which is quite unusual. Breakfast is good. But if you are catching a early flight and want to have a quick bite at 6:00 AM the complementary Breakfast will not be ready and will test your patience. Don't get surprised by their delay. Better, have it in the airport food court itself. I would recommend this hotel for its ambience. Very well maintained.

My wife and i live 5 hrs. from Key West. We decided to take a couple days off work and head to the Keys. We called ahead for a 2 night stay sight unseen. We were surprised of the pleasant surroundings and landscaping. When we checked in we were told of an additional $25. resort fee they didn't tell us about when we called for prices. We could have stayed other places now for less $$. Staff seemed pleasant, room seemed clean so we decided to stay. We pretty much enjoyed the stay. THE BAD NEWS. When we left we discovered my ipod and head phones were missing from my tote bag. We notified the manager and he claimed people make these claims all the time but seem to find them when they return home. That may be true, however, i know exactly where i put it and never took it out of the bag. Maybe it fell out in the trunk they said. To make a long story shorter it was taken when we went to breakfast on the outside patio. I know it was stolen because i had a tee shirt stuffed in with it. The ipod could have possibly fell out if you tipped the bag upside down and shook it but there is no way the ear phones could have fallen out past the tee shirt. Management could't have cared less. So i recommend locking any valuables in your car even though it's way the heck over in the Walgrens parking lot.

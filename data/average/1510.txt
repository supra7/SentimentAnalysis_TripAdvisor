We just got home from a week at Secretes Maroma. Let me first talk about the positives. The place is immaculate and the staff is genuinely friendly. If you're looking for a quiet get away, this could fill the bill. Each night, there is some type if theme show ( some are better than others). The pool areas are always being serviced by friendly bar staff. Some light food is usually offered by your chair each day. The drinks are good and there are quite a variety of top shelf liquor, but you may want to ask them to add a bit more liquor to many of the "umbrella" drinks. Now the negative: if you are going for the food, you may have to lower your expectations. Breakfast at the World Cafe was by far the best meal of the day with freshly prepared pancakes waffles and eggs. Lunch was just OK, depending on the restaurant. But dinners were the greatest disappointed. Although everything is served very professionally, the food does not simply measure up. These sentiments were shared by my fellow travelers as well. It's a shame because I really wanted this to be different from some of the other all-inclusives we visited. All in all, we made the best of our vacation, despite some non-cooperative weather. If they can get a handle on the food issues, this could be a great spot.

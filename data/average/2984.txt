I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights, we had a good stay apart of one staff member that was unfriendly and unprofessional- Guest relation manager lady Myriam. She was more interested to finish her coffee in the back of the reception than help the guest. I found this very rude, unfriendly and not professional at all. Rest of the reception staff was lovely. Room was very clean, 2 single beds, good size bedroom and bathroom. The breakfast was nice but on the second day was not fresh fruits, tomatoes. The hotel is located 10 minutes walking distance to the seaside, but a bit far away from La Ramblas (use the underground). If you want to go to Park Guell use the bus number 92. I stayed 2 years ago in hotel ( not Holiday Inn) close to Pl.Cataluyna and was much more better, next time i will stay over there.

With only a week to book a hotel room, we found this to be a decent, affordable option when all the B&Bs were full. The Inn is a converted apartment building. The rooms are a bit shabby, but not terrible. I prefer shabby historic charm over a generic hotel any day. Rooms with A/C are more expensive, I believe. Parking is an additional fee. There are muffins and coffee provided in the lobby in the mornings.

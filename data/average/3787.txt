The hotel I am told had been renovated and it looked fine to me. The breakfast was also ok. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold. It was a decent selection for that type of breakfast service and someone was on hand to keep it stocked and tidy. The room was clean and I had no problems with it. The couch in my room which was a suite was a bit outdated but not a problem for me. I did not have a problem with noise either. The MAIN problem was the STALE smell. Obviously there are smokers being allowed to smoke in the nonsmoking rooms and nothing is being done about it. Thist was clear once I stepped off the elevator. This was too bad. Get rid of the smell and people will come. For now, if you are not a smoker and cannot stand the smell....go somewhere else. IT is too strong to ignore.

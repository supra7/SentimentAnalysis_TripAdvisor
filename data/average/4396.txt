Spent a night here on business. Was happy to have a room that was out of the way from the noise and elevators. Checkin was rather slow and the lobby was packed with people waiting for cabs. Room needed a little updating but at least there were no mice (the other trip advisor reviews were scaring me). Window side of suite got cold at times. Really found the automatic-power-off-in-room annoying, since it impeded my ability to keep the laptop up and running while I was out of the room. Wifi for $10/day is a ripoff. Gym was much better than the hotel's website pictures indicate--one side with ~10 precor machines (each machine with an individual television) and the other side with assorted dumbbells and weight machines. This was a very pleasant surprise. In-room breakfast service did not come at the appointed time, nor was it anywhere near the $20 price. A little difficult to catch a cab at times. Great proximity to Harvard Business School, but not much else (and in the winter, there is nothing in walkable distance). Price for the room was absurd for a doubletree, but that may be exploitation due to the time of year (recruiting season for students; they have a captive audience).

Booked an Executive room expecting a bit more... as others have stated the property is showing signs of its age. Strengths are: staff helpfulness and attitude location for major sites ease of access from SEA airport with the new train/tram line stopping nearby Negatives: Dated rooms Exec rooms poorish for the extra cost compared to other Hiltons Evening canapes on top floor lounge a bit mean and not much of them.............. A lovely city Seattle, one of my faves but there are better places to stay for the money unless you get a really good deal!

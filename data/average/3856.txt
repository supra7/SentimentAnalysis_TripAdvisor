Hotel room was small but comfortable. Great location for getting to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. We would recommend the 'Ride the Ducks' tour which goes from near the Space Needle and we found a great bar called 'Athenians' in the market which has a happy hour on food and drink! If you want to go to the top of the Space Needle, book lunch - it's a set menu for $25 and includes the lift ride (which otherwise is about $18).

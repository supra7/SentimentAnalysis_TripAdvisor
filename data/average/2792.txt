It's a Holiday Inn hotel in Hollywood and it does just that. The location is excellent for Hollywood Boulevard, literally a five minute walk but far enough away not to be too bothered by the noise. The road the hotel is on does get busy in the mornings so it's worth asking for one of the quieter rooms at the back or side. The hotel itself is standard fare with reasonably sized rooms, excessively large bathrooms and a gym and pool. The lifts are incredibly slow though and were a constant frustration. The free continental breakfast is good and sorts you out for a few hours, so you cannot complain about that. The staff on reception were competent enough and friendly but they do only recommend one of the tour companies on the boulevard so it is worth shopping around because there are better deals available with other tour companies.

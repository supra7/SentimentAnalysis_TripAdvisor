Excellent location to anything you want to do in the Inner Harbor with just a short walk. Compared to the other hotels in this area, it is one of the cheapest. The room was clean and updated. It was not the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in, but we were not looking to spend time in the hotel itself. The staff was nice despite some of the reviews I have read. The breakfast was nothing special and would not recommend spending money there. Starbucks and movie theater right next to the hotel. James Joyce Irish Pub right across the street was a great place for one last drink at the end of the evening. Parking is a bit expensive but it is the same as most hotels in the area, we valet our car and walked everywhere. We did not move our car the 3 days we were there. I would recommend for the price because the location is worth it.

There are 100's of hotel in Istanbul and I am pretty sure you can find better than this hotel for value/quality. I am not sure why this hotel is rated so high on TA. It makes me think that a lots of friends/family must contribute. Do your own research and don't always trust what your read. We did enjoyed our stay, but feel that we could have done better for the money. Good points - Good location ( Sultanahmet , just behind the blue mosque) - Friendly staff/good email communication - Good Shower (also clean, even if the shower was leaking) - Nice terrace with views (lots of hotel have the same) Average points - Room was adequate put slightly small. - Quite Noisy (you will hear the Mosque everywhere, it's more Hotel noise, like people in corridor, lift door, neighbours etc...) - Breakfast was correct but nothing special....You will get all the usual.

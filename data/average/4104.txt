I have travelled happily many times with Marriott over the years but this has not been one of my best trips. As with so many mediocre hotels, this one looked great from the outside, lobby is fine, elevators refurbished, but the hallways upstairs were painted over, worn out looking and rooms were older too with updated furniture. On to the nickel and diming, $40 for parking. $10 for internet access. $5 for cheap bottled water in the room. $60 to allow us entry to the hotel bar after 8:00pm on new year's eve. Security guards checking guests at the elevators to confiscate beer and wine carried in from the grocery store across the street. Disgrace, and insulting to a Marriott rewards customer of many years, I'm sorry. Other than that, the location is good, just like dozens of high quality hotels on the back bay in Boston, who probably include all of the above for free and dont post dozens of security guards at their entry points. Stay elsewhere if the rate is right.

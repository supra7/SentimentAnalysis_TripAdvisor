We stayed here from 26th to 28th May 2011. Clean and basic. No tea and coffee making facilities, no complementary towels for use on the terrace and pool area. The tinned fruit and uninspiring range of food was not worth the 15 charged for breakfast. The location was ok, 10 minute walk to the yellow line tube. The hotel is in a similar league as a Holiday Inn Express with clean standard amenities, but at twice the price. Outside space was appreciated though small. We would normally opt for boutique properties and the review should be read with that caveat in mind.

A great location just off the Ramblas. Near Liceo Opera House and Cathedral. A little noisy before midnight outside Hotel. Room was ok but a little warm as AC was not very good. Bathroom was clean and efficient. Breakfast a little to be desired but coffee was good. When Kahreem was on duty the service he provided was excellent with a lot of good information as well. The night shift employee on the other hand was terrible. At 7:15 AM he was still asleep at the reception desk and breakfast was not ready at 7:30 two days in a row.

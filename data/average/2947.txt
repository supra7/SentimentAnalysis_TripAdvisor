Traveled down for our wedding aniversary. Everything ok until we got to our room, which was very small, the windows had three (3) different sized curtains on one window, and the other window i kept tripping over them because they were too long. The room was very cold at night, we asked for the heating to be looked at but only got another blanket. We had to go accross the road to the main hotel for breakfast, there was a good choise, but the cooked breakfast was cold on both mornings we stayed. No nightlife around the hotel, and we could hear a lot of traffic noise at night

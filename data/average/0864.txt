I stayed here last weekend just for the night. Really, the decor is not that great for a Westin...felt more like a run down Holiday Inn. I've stayed in really nice Westin's and this one was not up to par. It just felt old, they need to remodel. The noise level also was pretty bad. All I could hear all night was the sound of other guests slamming their doors. The only plus for me is that it was 2 minutes walking distance from Norstroms.

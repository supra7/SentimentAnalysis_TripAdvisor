-- Basic hotel -- feels like it is used a lot -- feels a bit like an airport hotel - Restaurant staff were EXTREMELY friendly - Perhaps a bit too busy at times-- two glasses stayed outside my door for two days -- they were there when I checked in! To their credit, when I let them know -- they were gone in 20 minutes.

I should begin this review by saying that the frontline staff (from front desk, to bell hop, to wait staff) have been wonderful. My displeasure has much more to do with the food and amenities which just aren't up to Renaissance standards. The rooms themselves are very nice -- lots of easily accessible outlets, remodeled and clean bathrooms, linens etc. Complaint 1: the breakfast in either the restaruant or the consierge lounge is really meager. Today the buffet included: scrambled eggs, waffle quarters, bacon/sausage, oatmeal and potatoes, yogurt, pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, sandwich bread for toasting and some pastries. Cheerios or cornflakes. That's it. Seattle is a rather international city. Where is the salmon? Where is the European style cold cuts? Is it not possible to find higher quality bread? (The concierge lounge was worse. The only protein there were hard boiled eggs). I know this sounds like I'm spoiled, but I've stayed at a significant number of Renaissance hotels in the past year: Milan, Zurich, Las Vegas, Bankok, etc. and I found all of their breakfast buffets to be mouth watering. This one reminded me of a tired dining hall. Complaint 2: Amenities in the form of exercise room is the other thing lacking. Actually it isn't lacking so much as it has not kept pace with demand. At 5:20 the other morning every single machine was taken! At 6:30 this morning, -- same thing. There are a total of 7 machines (5 treadmills) one elliptical and a bike or stair stepper. Basically the place was bursting at the seams and the poor AC could not keep up. So it was like exercising in a sauna. I have to give them credit for having really nice machines though -- built in TV in each one. On the good side though ,this hotel has a 2 lane lap pool on the 28th floor! Not a common thing.

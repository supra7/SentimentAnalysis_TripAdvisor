I think the 4 star rating should be reviewed. I have stayed at enough 4 star hotels to know this is not comparable. Where do I start, the room decor was modern, they've done a great job except they left the bed alone. My bed was rock solid and was very uncomfortable. It seemed the walls were paper thin, we heard everything our neighbors were saying. The staff was great until departure day. The front counter staff was a bit stuffy. Customer service with a smile has not been implemented. Room service was overpriced for the quality of food that you get. I'm not sure I would stay at this hotel again.

If you stay at a Motel 6 you get free coffee. Super 8, same. This Hilton, no way. Couldn't believe it, but it's true. No coffee pot in the room, no coffee pot in the lobby. The morning street level (not the lobby, which is one floor up) is a steady stream of bleary-eyed people walking out to the street to find the Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts or McDonald's, and the opposing stream of people coming back to the hotel with a cup or two of ($1.50-$4.00) coffee. C'mon, Hilton, have a heart! A cup of joe would make life just a lot better. Oh, by the way, the walls are pretty thin. The shower was great. Wi-fi daily rates are exorbitant. Check-in and -out were a breeze. The wait for an elevator was never more than a minute. Sheets are SOFT.

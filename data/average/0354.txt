We had a 2-night stay in mid-July 2007 and found the hotel convenient (right across the street from the public library - a Rem Koolhass gem!). In the "free ride" zone, this hotel was just fine. We are 2 NJ teachers who prefer to spend our money on what we see and eat than where we sleep, but we do demand a clean and comfortable hotel. This fit the bill. We liked the free internet on the 2 house computers. Lots of nice restaurants in the immediate area. Convenient to Pioneer Square and within walking distance of (or free bus ride to) the main shopping district and the Monorail to the Space Needle. Nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate!

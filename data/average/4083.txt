Not a bad stay -- simply a typical Marriott experience -- nothing overwhelming about the experience. The hotel's location is one of its strong points, Back Bay, connected to Copley Place, Prudential Center's Marketplace and the Hynes Convention Center. I was there during a cold spell (2 degrees outside) so it was nice not having to walk outside to get places. The room was decent - fairly modern decor with comfortable beds. The hotel, I believe, is or will be, undergoing a room renovation. It needs it, as my room on the 28th floor had a big nasty yellow stain on one of the walls.

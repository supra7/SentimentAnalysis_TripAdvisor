The hotel was easy to find. During check in gave my name to front desk clerk he started to pull of my information but stop to talk on the phone with a customer and started looking up information for the that customer while im standing in front of him it took a least 10 min to check in. Valet guys were so nice ( even tho they had to run a least two blocks to park your car). Breakfast was ok room was nice had a great view on the city. The hotel was near everything so you don't need your car you can walk. Even though I think its over prices it's still a ok hotel if you want to be close to everything.

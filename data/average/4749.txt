Based on others' reviews, I was excited to stay at the Omni on Michigan Avenue, but aside from being safe, clean, and in a good location, it wasn't particularly memorable (except for the loudly-barking dog in a room two doors down; a call to the front desk did nothing to silence the noise.) Our "suite" was tiny and the decor plain; there were few amenities of which to speak. The hotel layout is odd and disjointed (front desk on the third floor, overpriced bar and restaurant on the fourth, bellmen on the first.) While the staff was certainly professional, this property just seemed to lack any personality whatsoever, and in a city with so many other hotels to choose from, I think I will, next time my travels take me to the Windy City.

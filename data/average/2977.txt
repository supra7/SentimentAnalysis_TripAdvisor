The hotel is in inside lane & may not be safe to go out in the late evening. It is surrounded by earlier gowdowns whihc are not getting converted to commercial premises. The rooms were ok but could have been more clean & neat. Staff was extremely friendly & helpful. Surprisingly the breackfast served was with good continental choice of food. Some Indian restaurants are nearby but I did not get the time to try any of them. Overall good but if you plan your travel in advance you can get better one at good price. As a city Barcelona is quite & clean & excellent local seafood varieties can be tested.

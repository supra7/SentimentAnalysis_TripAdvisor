Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel lobby is very small and not many table for breakfast. Breakfast area is one of the smallest I have ever been in. However, the choices were normal and good. Stayed in a King room. The room was Very small and basic. Sheets were a little rough. Overall the hotel was clean yet simple. Quick one night stay...this is the place. More than one night....Maybe look into another option. Pricing was under $100 which is the max. I would pay for that area and this particular hotel. But Again....Very Friendly Staff and Serves the one night business trip purpose.

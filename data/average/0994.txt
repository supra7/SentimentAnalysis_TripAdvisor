Yes, it was close to area attractions. Yes, very good sleep quality and yes, clean rooms (note: limited drawer space) and free wi-fi. However, if you, like me, need coffee first thing in the morning, forget about it, here. I could not believe that a 4-star rated hotel does not provide in-room coffee makers. Thank goodness, my husband went down to the lobby each morning to get me a cup (and, you need to do it by 9 am or else, too bad!). No coffee in Seattle, the home of Starbucks!! For shame. Oh, and, if you are looking to relax, after a full day of sightseeing, and watch some HBO...forget about that, too, Not offered. So, all in all, this small boutique hotel has charm and staff is friendly but next time, I will probably book elsewhere.

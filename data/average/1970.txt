Our group of nine travelers from the East Coast was impressed with the information that the Kaanapali Beach was the 'most Hawaiian' of the Maui hotels. That and the moderate room rates influenced our decision to choose the resort. The rooms are clean and neat, the location ideal and the staff genuinely gracious and friendly. But be advised this is definitely a notch or two below the surrounding hotels. For those traveling great distances for a 'once in a life time' vacation, all nine of us would advise saving your pennies for a more upscale experience. If price is more important than ambience, this family friendly place would be a good choice for you.

We spent four nights at this hotel and it was OK. I agree with the previous review regarding value for money, we too got a deal and had we paid full price, we would have been dissapointed. The hotel was clean, the rooms OK however, it lacks public areas and to us, just had a overall feeling of being 'un-loved'. The positives are it is in a good location, just a short walk to the vaporetto stop, one stop to/from the Lido and 10 mins to/from San Marco. Alternatively, it is approximately a half hour walk to San Marco at a gentle pace. It is close enough to the city however, far enough away to get a good nights sleep (I have stayed by San Marco in the past and it is very noisy!). The breakfast is also very good with a superb selection of hot and cold food, juices and coffee - it really sets you up for the day. If you do not wish to splash out on a water taxi from the airport, the quickest journey to the hotel is via the water bus to the Lido and the vaporetto to Saint Elena. We purchased the 72 hour pass (at the Lido) for 33 euros and it was good value for money. I can't say we found a really good restaurant - the best meal we had was at one of the restaurants by the Rialto on the bank of the Grand Canal. I think this hotel is very probably best suited for families.

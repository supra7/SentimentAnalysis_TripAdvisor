We got off a cruise ship and came to the hotel at 8:30am, not expecting to check in, but to store our luggage and sight-see for a while. The lady clerk told us we could not check in until 2pm. Ok, we stored our luggage and decided to hang out in the lobby because the weather was bad(rainy/cold/windy). Nice lobby, big tv, and sofa. At 2 pm I went to check in and the same clerk told me we couldn't check in until 4pm. No rooms were ready. I mentioned that I had watched numerous people checking out all morning long and asked to speak to the manager. The manager was unavailable 'til 3:30pm. I insisted on checking into a room and another clerk helped us and other people who were in the same situation. We finally got a room. Not a good start. Our room was small,well furnished, clean. The bathroom was clean, no problems. We went to eat an early dinner. There is a streetcar stop almost in front on Canal St. and a bus stop right across the sidestreet. Very convenient. That evening I used the computers in the business for internet. It was high-speed, no cost. The next morning was Sunday and the free breakfast was one of the best I have had in a long time. Scrambled eggs, Italian suasage, biscuits and gravy, potatoes(not hash browns), waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, fresh fruit, etc. Great! We went sightseeing and returned tothe hotel about 4:30pm and our room had not been serviced. Grrrr! My wife went to the front desk and complained. The maid was off duty so we were moved to a 2-room suite, sweet. We still had to move ourselves. No more problems. The next morning I had a normal free breakfast. Biscuits and gravy, potatoes(not hash browns), waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, fresh fruit, etc. Very good. Check out was no problem. It was a different desk staff we had to deal with. This is a nice, clean hotel in a good location, but we will not stay there again because of the staff problems.

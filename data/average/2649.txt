Hilton Miami Downtown is fine if you are a business traveler. Rate are cheap, but breakfast was not included and hotel charges $20 for breakfast buffet. I bit too much for the USA and the quality is mediocre at best. Rooms are spacious, but dated. Hotel could do with a refurbishment. Pool was dirty. Overall, it was ok for the money and acceptable while on a business trip, but if I stayed in the hotel for holidays, it would be very disappointing.

The Palmer House is a great location if you're going to the theatre and for shopping. We stayed one night in April. Main thing I didn't like is that the room was very small. There was no chair to sit in, just a desk chair. At check in, the desk clerk wouldn't look up my husbands Hilton Honors number. Just said she couldn't find it! Mmmm. Every other hotel in the country can find it.

This is a fairly basic place in comparison to many other hotels in the area. The location and views are great, but the interior finishes and general vibe had quite a dated feel. We found the food over priced and not really to our tastes - once again, it felt like we were back in the 1970's. The pool is basic , but cutely whale-shaped. Our room was spacious and clean, with a gorgeous view over the ocean - seeing the whales spout from the lanai was a highlight of our trip. The luhau we attended at the Royal Lahaina, recommended by friendly staff, was great - and kids got in free. This is a pretty and friendly place, but not quite up to par for a really special holiday.

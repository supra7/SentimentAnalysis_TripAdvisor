A nice hotel in many ways and with a great location, but all for naught because it is difficult (or in my case, impossible) to get a quiet room. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is a constant low hum/rumble, apparently from the hotel's heating system, that will make sleep difficult for many (including your's truly). Changed room three times during my five nights, but to no avail. Noise was at different levels in the three rooms: from very loud to extremely loud to just plain loud. I finally gave up trying to find a reasonably quiet room and just slept with pillows over my ears. However, if your hearing is not good or you don't hear low pitched noise, then the hotel's location makes it attractive for tourists. The concierge lounge has beautiful views although the offerings are not particularly generous.

My husband and I recently stayed at the Hyatt. The room look old and outdated. Rooms should definitely be upgraded. The pool area and the grounds is the best part. The staff was nice and helpful. The mandatory daily $25 resort fee, is not so good. Only worth it if you use tennis courts, want a newspaper or need internet access. Overall, the stay was ok, not spectacular.

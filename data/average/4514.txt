The hotel has a great location if you are planning on walking everywhere but parking is a rip off as well as there are no perks. If you are looking to stay at a hotel that "gets the job done," then this is a nice place to stay but it is no way near what I expected for the price I paid for a room. Be careful when eating in the dining room as it is also overrated.

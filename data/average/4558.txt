I am a fan of the Hyatt Regency brand but this property is not among my favorites. Pros include price, great staff, and a very comfortable bed. Cons include location (the area is pretty desolate at night and it was difficult to find both taxis and good, nearby restaurants on the weekend - it is in the financial district so everything shuts down on weekends), rooms that showed wear and tear (particularly in the bathroom), and noise. Truly, this hotel was one of the noisiest I have ever been in - slamming doors and the conversation of people in the hallways was easily heard in both rooms we were in - we ultimately had to change rooms from the 17th floor to the 20th floor due to noise but the change in volume was somewhat minimal. Be sure to ask for a higher floor if noise is an issue for you - frankly, I am not overly sensitive to hotel noise so the need to change rooms was an unfortunate development. In the event I am again in Boston, I would stay again at the Marriot Copely Place (see prior review for this property). It was much more conveniently located with great shopping nearby and despite the number of guests it attracts, was far quieter.

I can't really understand all the very positive reviews of this hotel. There's nothing special about it. Termini is a hotel area with hundreds of hotels. As said by other reviewers it is clean with a nice staff and a good location. So are dozens of three star hotels, but this one has four! A four star hotel does not have the bar driven by another company (making it impossible to put the tabs on the room), does not charge 5 EUR for 1h Wi-Fi, do not have door locks with both physical keys and keycards (which was very hard to produce in the reception). A four star hotel: has a bit of class (sometimes a lot), has high quality beds, pay attention to details and serve drinkable coffe at breakfast - especially in the country of espresso... Go elsewhere if you're looking for four REAL stars.

I realize that this review can be taken as complete speculative, but I still felt it necessary to report. I am 100% certain the I left a wedding band on a TV stand in my room. Noticed it just after check-out. Multiple phones calls and emails later the same afternoon and through the following week (no returned calls or emails) - I had to be overly persistent. The ring "could not be found" - even though they checked the room before it was booked later that night. Again, I am certain where it was placed. The problem I have is that I spoke with multiple people who kept pushing me off to someone else and no one follows up even though they say the will. It's something that can be replaced very easily, but I question the integrity of the housekeeping staff if I have to stay here again.

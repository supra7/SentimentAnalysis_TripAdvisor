While it may be Seattle quirky, it was a little too expensive for what you got, in my opinion. If you're really into style & art - this may, however be the hotel for you. Rooms were TINY. Not even room to open my suitcase on the floor. Bathroom had nice style, but hard to find room to leave toiletries in the bathroom. Bed was nice, however, and the TV was a large LCD. Not a bad place to stay (unless you're a prude - the art work was somewhat risky), but it won't be top of the list the next time I come.

For a three star hotel, this is the best you will find. The beds aren't great, but the rooms are very clean and the hotel is in a good location downtown. The best part of this hotel is the customer service. Everyone there is very friendly and helpful. There are friendlier and more helpful then some of the Sheratons and Marriots I have stayed at. The one criticism I have is the shower had very low water pressure. Otherwise, I would stay here again if I need a good, cheap place to stay.

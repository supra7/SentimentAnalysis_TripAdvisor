The Sixth Avenue Inn was about what i expected for the price, Clean but fairly basic accomodations. The Inn is a bit shabby and in need of a re-model, but it was clean and convenient to downtown Seattle activites. However, the elevators were not working during my stay and we were disappointed that the entire restaurant was closed due to a reunion being held at the Inn. Unfortunately, I forgot some property in the room when I departed. It took several phone calls over three days to Housekeeping voice mail before I received a return call confirming my property was there. The only live person I could contact was the front desk, and they declined to assist me. I'd only stay here again to avoid the exorbitant prices of downtown Seattle accomodations.

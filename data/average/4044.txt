Hard not to like a hotel connected to not one, but two high-end malls with luxury shops, upscale dinning and an easy foot commute to the beautiful Back Bay of Boston. Of course, if room quality or bang-for-your-buck matters then location isn't about to fix any of that now is it? I like the open atrium feel to the lobby and mezzanine level bar/lounge (Champions Sports). Nice feel to it, modern setting that blends the best of a sports bar (TV's, sight-lines, comfort food etc.) without the closed in, loud, man-cave feel of many such places. Service was good, food was below average, drinks were above average. Starbucks is also attached, which works out well too. Pretty impressive look and feel to this area of the hotel. Unfortunately........ Rooms are smallish, bathrooms dangerously so. If I had three legs I could have put one each in the sink, toilet and tub/shower at the same time without pulling a hamstring. Bed was comfortable, TV modern, desk area workable. Like many, I was turned off by the lack of wireless internet in the room and the gross daily charge to be connected by a cable. Bush League. The half-moon shaped landing area's of each floor may look cool but they present a challenge for elevator use; six elevators in two groups of three that are a good 20-25 feet away from each other. You need to hit the button and guess which bank will provide your lift. If you guess wrong you need to hustle over to the opposing set of elevators and hope you make it before the door closes. Easy for young folks, tougher for seniors. If you are staying in this area, I wool choose any number of alternative property's. Taj would be my #1 choice. If you are a Marriott person and/or need malls attached you could do a lot worse than this location.

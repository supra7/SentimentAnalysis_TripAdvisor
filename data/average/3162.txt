In my mind, Novotel hotels should have at least 3-4 stars grading and so when I knew of their price, which is of good value, I booked into this hotel. The location is in fact quite far from the city center and the main train station. However, as we only go out in the morning and come back at night and so this would be a problem for us. The outlook and the lobby is nice and large. Staff are polite and helpful. But the rooms are too small. Just judging from the decor and size of the room, I think it is only 1-2 star. Beds are not comfortable, so does the blankets. Our room faces the park and so we see green field every day. The toilet is clean but they installed a shower in the bath tub so that you have to stand in the bath tub to take the shower. However, there is no curtain, only a glass with half the length of the bath tub so that water is splashed out even when you are very careful. The good side is that the breakfast is almost the best I have ever tried in Western Europe's hotels. There are huge selections - hams, eggs, cereals, bread, sausages, soft drinks. Even boiled eggs they offered two types - all boiled or half boiled. Coffee or cappaccion can be taken from the machines. There are individual sofa seats for people going alone. There are machines in the lobby so that you can check-in and check-out by using the machine without going to the counter for help.

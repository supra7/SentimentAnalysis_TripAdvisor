The hotel is stylish, hip and located in the "fun" district. We stayed in sultanamet for 5 days at the begining of our trip and decided to experience this area on the way home. The reviews mentioned noise so i expected some especially given the location but this was beyond. We came home at midnight and the club below was thumping ( literally). I called the front desk to ask when things shut down, they replied 2:00 am. I stayed awake until 2 patient with an end in site, no such luck. At 2:45 music the same i called again. This was so loud earplugs ( the good wax kind) a scarf wrapped around my head and a pillow could not muffle it. Crazy! By 3:30 things finally quieted enough to sleep. To add insult to injury the hotel began construction work on their mezzanine at 9:00 am sat morning the next day. If you just need a hip staging area to party all night or can sleep through a train wreck this is your spot otherwise unless they double pane those windows i would think twice...

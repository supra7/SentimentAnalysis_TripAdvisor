Did not 'upgrade' for $20, but still had a room with view over railroad yards and bay. Had requested no feathers due to allergies and they had thoughtfully put an air cleaner in the room. Apart from that, typical Hilton, no charm, but efficient. Walk to Gaslight district not too bad, but if you want to be close to restaurants etc, there are better choices

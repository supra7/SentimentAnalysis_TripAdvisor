Booked a room for 3 night via Hotwire.com. Upon arrival, we noticed that our vehicle has to be vallet only and no self parking. So we had to tip the driver when we leave AND come back to the hotel. When we checked in, we were not greeted. Front desk lady wasn't cheerful but looked sad. After driving for almost 6 hours, would be nice to be greeted with a smiling face in stead of a sad depressed face. She offered for an upgrade but we refused. We went to check the room, didn't like the view so we decided to go back downstairs and upgrade to a one bedroom suite. Got the same lady to help us, still no personality! Room were absolutely gorgous, no complaint. We had to pay for a daily resort fee for the stay. Resort fee? Pool is as simple as can be, just because there were palm trees, I don't think a resort fee should be charged. It's not even closed to look like a resort let alone the server just walk around the pool and did not greet or ask any guest if we would like to order anything. Hotel has no casino, only one shop and the restaurant not even 5 star. It is more like a lounge. Pool closed at 8 pm. Don't understand why it closes so early when there isn't anything else to do in this hotel. When we had to leave the hotel and get our car from the vallet parking, we were not greeted. Only got a Thank You when we hand them the tips. Knowing how Trump is and how wealthy and fancy he can be, would be nice if he can provide better training to staff on hospitalily, courteous and a better service. When one stays in a 5 star hotel, we should feel like we are getting a high class service as well but sadly, we didn't experience it. We have been to a 4 star or even 3 star hotel and many provide much better service than the Trump could. Will I stay here again? Definitely NOT. With the amount of money we spent in this hotel, we coulda stayed in Bellagio or other 5 star hotel on the STRIP!

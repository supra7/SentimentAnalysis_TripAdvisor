I only spent one night at the GH Seattle. The hotel location was ok, not in the 'heart' of the tiny city, but good enough to get around to all the touristy areas. The room was good - good space, but the central air/heat was a bit noisy and you have to manually control it, as the thermostat doesn't seem to work or there isn't one. The staff is good and very helpful. I would stay here again and definitely recommend it to others. Clean rooms, good showers - even though I notice the bathroom amenities are below the basics.....just ask for what you need though.

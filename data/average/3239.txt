Accommodations are nice. Fairly new. Clean. Location is quiet. I was able to walk to McCormick Center for a convention without issue. I doubt this is a constant issue, but during my visit their in-room internet was not working. Each room is hard wired. Apparently they had a router issue. I'm sure the problem was fixed after my departure, but I had to go elsewhere to work. The location is quite removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown nightlife. If you want to be closer to the action, head north on Michigan Ave. For me, the quiet was welcome.

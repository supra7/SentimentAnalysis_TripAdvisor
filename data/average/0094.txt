Great location. Staff was very friendly. We stayed in a bi- level room with a pullout couch for the kids. The room decor was outdated and a bit musty. The room faced the street and the noise at night made sleeping difficult-- the rooms just don't seem well insulated from the noise. We checked out early and went to the four seasons instead for just a bit more money. Perhaps the other rooms at the Inn are better. We were disappointed.

Stayed at the Palmer House for 2 nights in June. Staff was very courteous, room was clean, but small. A/c did not work the first night, but repaired the second. I have stayed at the Palmer House quite a few times and requested the honors floor which as $40/night more than the others, but you got a Continental breakfast and snacks at happy hour. It was not worth the additonal money. Fitness Center was good and reasonable for $10 a trip. What really frosted me was a charged for valet parking of $61 at night!! This is an unmitigated rip off, and I should have asked for the charges before hand, but assumed $35 per night. My fault. Even though I was on the honors floor, they charge $20 per day for internet. So when you check in clearly ask for all the incidental charges before you have a stroke when you get your bill.

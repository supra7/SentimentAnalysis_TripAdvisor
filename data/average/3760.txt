Stayed at this hotel on a layover through Dallas. Got a decent (not great) rate. The GOOD: 1. Nice upscale look inside room. 2. Starbucks coffee in room 3. Bach & Body Works products. The BAD: 1. Hotel not listed under curtesy phone at airport. 2. Shuttle took 35min to pick me up 3. At least 20min to the airport. 4. Advertised "free" internet is not. 5. Only one TV worked, One phone worked. 6. Pool Cabana Suite sucks, feels like a motel not a hotel. Overall this place was more like a 2 star, not a three. Would not reccomend. Stick with a national chain.

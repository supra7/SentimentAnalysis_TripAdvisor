After reading many of the wonderful reviews on here, as well as checking out the website, I was really excited for our brief stay in Chicago at this hotel. Unfortunately I was quite disappointed. The room definitely needed to be updated, which was surprising after seeing such modern, hip rooms on the website. When I called to make a reservation I asked if breakfast was included and was told it was. However, we only received two breakfast coupons, worth $10 each, to put toward breakfast which was a la carte so after only ordering four items and racking up nearly $50 on our breakfast tab, we were left covering the rest. On the flip side, the staff was very friendly and the small gym had good equipment. I am from Illinois and travel to Chicago frequently and can say with certainty that you can find much better deals in Chicago.

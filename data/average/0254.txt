Older hotel in a questionable neighborhood, but it is located in a very good spot. Only 2 blocks away from Pike's Market, a few blocks from Westlake Center/Downtown area, and couple blocks from the Sound Transit Link Station and free 99 bus line (for going to Pier 66 cruise terminal). You know you're in a vintage lodging when they still give out actual metal room keys instead of a key card. There was noise from the street people out on the sidewalk, but at least it stopped by midnight or so. Tiniest, slowest elevator ever seen, get used to only using the stairs. Got the queen suite (family didn't want the smaller rooms w/ shared bath) which was surprisingly spacious with a kitchenette which included a microwave and small fridge.

I decided to stay here instead of the Hotel Indigo based on the price, as I got a room for $80. The bay view was nice, but I was not crazy about seeing the loading dock for the cargo ship right next to my room and that was supposed to be an upgraded room. The hotel was nice and as tired as my feed were, the $30 for valet was well worth it. The room itself was very nice and spacious. I did have a problem with the alarm clock which caused me to miss my flight. Food was good and I really liked the atmosphere in the bar. I agree with another reviewer that the check in/out process was not very efficient.

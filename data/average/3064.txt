While its location near to the Blue Mosque and Aya Sophia was handy, this hotel doesn't have much else to offer from all the others. Basic rooms (advertised as a king size bed but it was just a double) and a little small, we expected more for the price and star rating. The included breakfast was terrible - the bread and eggs weren't replenished throughout the morning and there wasn't enough fresh fruit or the like. It's great to offer local food at breakfast but I think international traveller's needs ought to be taken into consideration as well. The reception staff were mixed - either reasonably friendly or else a little hostile. Cigarette smoke was often smelt coming through the crack in the door from the reception level and the first floor was very noisy - the restaurant next door was even doing renovations at midnight!

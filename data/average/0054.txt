Located downtown, a few blocks from Pike's Place Market. Entrance does not have automatic doors, and there's no one to help with bags and luggage in the evening. Front desk staff was friendly and gave us a tourist map. Concierge would only give detailed directions and advice when face-to-face and not when calling from the hotel room phone. Room was spacious and had a great view of the Space Needle. Curtains were old and stained. Bed was fairly comfortable and had nice linens. Temperature control and air conditioning were in good working condition. Bathroom did not have a fan, so all the mirrors were fogged up for a long time after a shower. The shower head was installed low, so tall people would have to bend over to wash their hair. Shampoo, soap, body wash, and lotion were provided. Closet contained functional iron and ironing board. Also had a very small in-room safe. The old TV had some trouble responding to the remote control. The mini-fridge/bar required a key from the front desk, and if you wanted to store your own items, you had to rearrange the items within the bar (even with rearrangement, very little space for your own things). No microwave. Housekeepers came in daily to make the bed and hang up the towels, but other than that, did not do much cleaning. Overall, decor was outdated, and furnishings need some updating. Wireless internet cost $11/day. Complimentary business center with 2 computers and a printer. Restaurant was very pricey ($10 for juice, coffee, and a pastry) and had no bathroom. Touted itself as a higher-end hotel but really needed some more updating and better amenities. You can definitely hear the buses and trucks going by (even above the 10th floor), so if you are a light sleeper, beware. Also, although the room was a non-smoking room, the vents must be connected to a smoking room, because I smelled smoke one morning in the bathroom.

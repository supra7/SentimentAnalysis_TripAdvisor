Ace was a very nice clean place and the staff was absolutley fabulous. The location was great and so was the continental breakfast. The only bad things were that our room had no AC so it was hot and there was a lot of road noise and we used earplugs. All and all it was a nice stay and I would stay again but def not the best ever

We stayed here the night of May 22nd. Got a room via Priceline and was very pleasantly surprised that there was no mention made of it by the booking clerk and we still received a very nice room on the 19th floor of the north tower. The staff couldn't have been better, especially at the concierge desk. The rooms were quiet, the elevators weren't too slow, the location is fabulous. However, the hotel just charges too much. Pay for internet access in the business center when there is free wireless in the lobby (ask for the password from the concierge)? $7 to store your own food in the mini-bar (you can get a free mini-fridge instead by phoning down for one)? We parked in the lot up the street for $22, best you'll do in that area, really. There is a mezzanine walkway from the lot into the hotel. If you park at the Westin itself it'll cost a lot more. I wouldn't stay there again unless I got a great rate, but I cannot fault the service or location. Just the prices. Isn't that always the case?

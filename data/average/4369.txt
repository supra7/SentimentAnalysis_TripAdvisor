My Husband and I recently stayed here for four nights as a mini-honeymoon. I was drawn to the hotel because of its location and we had stayed in the area before. My first impression was the hotel was very modern and clean with a great bar area. The room we had, with a queen was extremely small-but had cute little add ins like late night snack menus and a booklet of stories for bedtime. The bathroom was very small-no tub, both of us couldn't be in it at the same time nor could you fit between the wall and toilet-you had to turn and shimmy over to it. The biggest let down was the noise level from the side street outside. We heard every door close, people talking, trucks reversing-loading and unloading; it was very annoying considering we were on the top floor. With this said, I wouldn't be staying here again. We have leant our lesson with hotel locations and cities. What a letdown!

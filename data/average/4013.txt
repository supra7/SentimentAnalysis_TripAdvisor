We spent the weekend at the Joule, and I would not classify it as a 5 star hotel. The house car was unavailable at most times. We called to reserve, but were told that it was on a first come, first serve basis and that we need to call 15 minutes in advance. When we did call 15 minutes in advance we were then told that the car was booked for the next hour and a half. The staff at night seemed more concerned about the customers at the club than they did about the customers at the hotel. They rushed to open the door for those going to the club, but let it slam in our face. I'm sure that they were their regulars, but 5 star hotels treat everyone like a VIP. I've stayed at many 5 star hotels, and the difference between a five and four star is the service. It is not uncommon at a 5-star hotel to be greeted by name. The staff was not up to 5 star standards. If you are accustomed to the Four Seasons, Fairmont properties, or the Ritz this is not the hotel for you.

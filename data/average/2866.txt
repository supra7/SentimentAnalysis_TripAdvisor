Rooms are really tiny but beautifully decorated The receptionist is loud and will force/try to sell tickets to concerts and turkish dance. The hotel is centrally located and a lot of attractions are at walkable distance. No amenities other than the coffee maker. The staff need to be softspoken and sophesticated. They are a bunch of immature youngsters who keep playing loud music in the reception lounge. Food was avearge. They dont have a seperate restaurant. But the breakfast will be served in the basement which really tiny and congested again.

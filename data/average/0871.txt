I booked my room at the Seattle Westin after having a great experience at the Portland Westin. The two hotels really can't be compared. The Westin Seattle is an over-priced hotel with few amenities. My room, on the 17th floor was adequate. The bathroom was TINY (two people wouldn't fit in there) with a small tub/shower combo. The "heavenly" showerhead had no water pressure, and I had to sqaut down to get my head wet because the shower head was placed so low. The couch in the room had suspicious stains on it, as did the curtains. The walls were scuffed up too. The wall colors were sea-foam green and just seemed tired and worn out. Room service is out-of-control. A breakfast of just oatmeal would have cost me over $14. The small cafe was adequate, but was limited on choice there too. Parking at the Westin is $36/day, which is ridiculous, and they don't offer free wi-fi. Be wary of conferences and events taking place in the ballrooms. A fraternity was holding a winter ball, and their behavior in the lobby was outrageous-- drunkeness, making out, one girl's dress was even rolled up to her waist. I don't think I will stay at the Westin Seattle again, it just didn't meet my expecations.

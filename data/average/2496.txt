Dana Hotel and Spa is very new and is oriented to tech-savvy people who like industrial chic design. The service is great. A good continental breakfast of fresh food is provided. As for the room, the flat screen TV, iPod dock, showerhead on the ceiling and especially the floor-to-ceiling windows are fun. The bed was a bit soft and I didn't like the exposed concrete walls and minimal lighting but these are matters of taste. Also there was traffic noise (on the 17th floor) and from the elevator which our room was near. A glass wall with just a curtain separates the bathroom/shower and the room. The staff leaves the curtain open and also raises the window shades when they make up the room so you have to remember to pull it closed when you return and use the bathroom. We stayed 4 days and I never figured out the TV menu or the elevator security system. Also, oddly, the free wireless internet had some problem with Yahoo - I was never able to check my email although most other websites worked fine. The location was great, I like the rooftop bar, and the 4th night free deal made it a good value since we were staying 4 nights. But I probably will choose more conventional lodging if I'm back in Chicago.

The hotel is very clean staff are very friendly the only problem is the location especially at night it could feel a little intimidating, the tutankhamun restaurant over the road from the hotel was very nice if you like turkish food the 14 and 7 tram take you into amsterdam and take about 20 minutes there are also a couple of buses my advice is to get the train from schipol to central station then get the number 64 bus to slotermeer. it is a good hotel on a budget but the travel costs maybe mean the euros you save staying here might be better spent staying central amsterdam, is the most expensive city i have stayed in, in europe

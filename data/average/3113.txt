Once you get to the rooms its all ok. The most comfortable bed you will sleep in. Great selection of toiletries. However, everything in the lead up and during you stay is just annoying. You que to check-in and the whole process takes forever. The buffet for dinner and breakfast while visually impressive, is cold and lacks flavor. Getting a wine at dinner impossible (not to mention the definition of "a glass" being a third anywhere else in the world) and trying to get the bill like waiting for your water to turn to wine.... the staff are just so slow. I have stayed at the W Hong Kong probably 8 times in the last 4 years - this will be my last.

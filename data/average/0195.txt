We stayed here the night before our Alaskan cruise. The room was bigger than I expected. We also bought the pre-cruise package so we were picked up at the airport and then the next day taken to the pier which was nice as one thing we did not have to worry about planning ourselves. It is a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper, but very quaint and homey feeling. The front desk people are extremely helpful - especially Devin. We would stay here again if we ever needed some place to lie our head before another cruise.

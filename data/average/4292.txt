We were booked into the Park Plaza as part of a package. It's a mastadon of a city hotel -- a pile of fairly small and outdated rooms on top of a pile of restaurants and retail occupying a full city block Imagine a mid-point between the two New York paragons of this style: the luxury Waldorf-Astoria and the package-tourist-and-overnighting-stewardess Hotel Pennsylvania. As such, it does a decent job, but you wouldn't want to spend much time in the rooms or the very busy lobby. We didn't dine at the hotel or use any of its services besides parking, but we did use the gym and want to note that it has the best hotel gym we've seen in years -- the full equivalent in range of equipment to a typical private gym, in a spacious purpose-built space, the kind of thing one tends to expect only in top-tier resort hotel or in a hotel which hosts a regular private gym and has it double-duty for guest accommodation.

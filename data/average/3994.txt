I was there for 3 nights, it's a very clean hotel with nice breakfast, just 3min from Taxim Square, our first room was big but with an air condition machine just outside our window ( no view, no air, noisy), and the toilet, with glass door & window!! a little bit weird! haha, but they changed us room immediately when we asked it!

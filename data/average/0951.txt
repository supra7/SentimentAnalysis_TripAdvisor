We were pleased with the staff and location upon arriving to this Travelodge by the Space Needle. The hotel doesn't have a tub (shower only) and the rooms were small. But a short stay here for budget minded folks who need a place to just sleep and shower was perfect . Couldn't beat the location to several walking restaurant and attractions. The staff were really nice and the rooms were clean and fresh fruits/doughnuts for breakfast kept us happy during this stay. We are looking forward to returning here again for another stay in the summer.

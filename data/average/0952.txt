The hotel was convenient for us. We could walk to the space needle, catch the bus to downtown. We took a tour and they picked us up right at the front door, went to a baseball game and the desk arrranged transportation to and from. the heated pool was nice, breakfast of ok, nothing fantastic but we have had worse. It does need remodeling but it was clean and the price was right. I would stay there again.

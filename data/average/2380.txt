I've actually stayed here twice (some recommendation?), once with my girlfriend (who hated it and was depressed by it, but she has higher standards than I do) and once alone before catching an early flight from Gatwick airport. The hotel is cheap for the location (near Victoria Station) and I found the breakfast quite good for the price of the hotel. The rooms are small and rather 'worn' and the bathroom was shared and very small. But it is convenient for one or two nights and I would stay there again if needed (altho my girlfriend would not).

Overall the hotel is quite good. The rooms have been updated but if you wind up in the 'low-rises' they feel oldish, and seem ti have a strange woody smell. Be warned is a big hotel, and it could be quite a walk to your room. The cookie is indeed delicious, but the rates that they charge for parking are just ridiculous, for one night over $21, that is just not right !

We stayed in the Kings Inn Seattle for two nights in May 2010. The price was reasonable and although small, the room was reasonably comfortable. It is a budget motel with the furnishings and bathroom reflecting this. We were out most of the time so it did not bother us too much. Our room was on the very top floor in the corner and did not appear to be very secure but we had no problems. The reception staff were not very friendly or helpful and the lift was disgusting with filthy carpet inside it. The room itself was clean enough but it is definitely not the kind of accommodation you want to spend the day in. Great location though - we could walk to Pike St Market and around most of the downtown area, and they have on site parking at no charge which is great.

I thought that this would have been a very nice romantic gettaway, and be able to say " "Wow" the Palmer was great!! But the room was small and chilly and Bathroom was freezing..I like the Bed and pillows, but everything else, well nothing to brag on about.. It was okay but I would choose embassy suites over them anytime...Plus 51.00 for Vallet ridiculas!!

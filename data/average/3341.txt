Barcelo Ravel is a cutting edge design, both in the public spaces and the rooms. If you are a modern design junkie, you will probably enjoy it. If you are looking for a traditional 4 or 5 star hotel, this is not for you. The hotel is on a small rambla (linear park), with some small local restaurants nearby. It is a 10-minute walk to the Liceau metro station on the Ramblas, generally not a bad location. Unfortunately, it is also next to the main prostitute area of Barcelona, on the street behind the hotel. I saw a doorman once during my 4-day stay. The only other staff that I saw were one or two staff at the reception desk, who would not even make a recommendation for a local restaurant. The rooftop pool and deck are a narrow sliver along the edge of the roof, the pool no more than a large whirlpool. The rooftop bar was never open during my stay. The rooms were a very interesting design which, as an architect, I generally liked. The bathrooms are completely open to the bedrooms, so if privacy is an issue you should not stay here. There is very little horizontal space for toiletries, laptop, etc. I found the rooms noisy from plastic furniture being moved over the tile floors (please, can you install felt pads on the bottom of the chairs?)

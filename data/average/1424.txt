We stayed for 2 nights between Christmas and New Years and picked Le Crystal because we were looking for a boutique hotel. The staff were fabulous but the "suite" we were in was so cramped my wife and I had to turn sideways to pass each other. Also the King bed took up almost the entire bedroom and gave me a nasty scrape below the knee when I bumped into it's heavy wood frame with it's sharp edges. Positives: Great staff. Good location Negatives: Cramped suite, much too small. High price for what you get. Odd bathroom fixtures are hard to operate. Breaksfast was expensive and not very good - go up the street for many breakfast choices that are much better. Montreal has lots of hotels to choose from - I don't thnik we will return to Le Crystal.

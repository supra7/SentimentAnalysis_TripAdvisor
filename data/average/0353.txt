I was in Seattle for a large conference. Unfortunately, by the time I booked a hotel room all the major hotels near the convention center had no vacancies. The Executive Pacific was the only thing in the vicinity. It was a just a brisk 10-minute walk to the convention center, which I rather enjoyed. Also, on the positive side, there's a good coffee shop (Seattle's Best) right in the hotel. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable. Front desk service was prompt and polite. On the downside, the room was extremely small, not that this fact mattered in my case. The website boasts a 'cardio room,' which is nothing more than three machines (an almost kaput treadmill, bike, and cross-trainer).

Before restorations, Savannah, Ga was dubbed "A beautiful lady with a dirty face". My assessment of The Sterling might be, "a beautiful, older lady in need of a nip and tuck". There for a conference, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel even with its little idiosyncrasies. The entire staff we dealt with were warm and very helpful. I suspect some of the negative folk expected a modern Hilton, Hyatt or Ritz for the comparatively small amount they paid for this experience. This hotel has character; our room needed updating, but it was clean. Yes, it needs some repairs, but overall, if we return to Dallas, we would rather stay at the Sterling, with its unique, old-fashioned ambience than at one of those slick, modern, cookie-cutter styled hotels.

Value + Lake Union views This somewhat aged hotel is in walking distance to nothing, BUT it is a short drive to everything: the zoo, the downtown, the Space Needle parks. The staff are friendly (the lady in the kitchen is a kick), the breakfast is serviceable, and the parking is fabulous. You should request a room in one of the buildings with great views, and you will love waking up to boats and kayakers on Lake Union below. The rooms and linens are clean, utilitarian, with plenty of space.

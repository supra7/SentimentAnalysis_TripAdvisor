We just wanted a cheap stop over place before starting out on our journey to Yellowstone. We arrived quite late in the evening, but the staff were really helpful and, although very basic, the room was clean and comfortable. We stayed just the two nights there and, although there was a bit of traffic noise early in the morning, it wasn't too bad and certainly didn't prevent sleeping. They didn't provide breakfast so it was a bit of a nuisance finding somewhere to go, but the staff gave directions to a really good restaurant within walking distance so it wasn't too bad in the end.

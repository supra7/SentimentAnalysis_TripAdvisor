My friends booked this hotel for my bachelorette party; it was the final destination after a busy evening, a place to drink a bottle of champagne and hang out. The beds are comfortable, although our room had a view of an airshaft. The bathrooms were clean and reasonably appointed. We asked for a roll-away bed in advance but had to wait for one to be delivered, and my friends were under the impression that there would be a DVD player but there was none. In the morning we called the concierge to get the name of a brunch spot, but the first time we called no-one picked up and the second time we called she was surly and not very helpful. I don't know what they paid for our room; if you're coming to Chicago and get a good rate here, it's a comfortable place to rest for an evening, but don't pay expecting great service.

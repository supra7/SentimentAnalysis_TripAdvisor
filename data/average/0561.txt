We took my oldest son and his best friend to Seattle for his birthday. We went to a Mariners game and also to Gameworks. We were close enough to the game that we could have walked, but chose not to. This hotel is right across the street from Gameworks and the boys (11) loved it!! We were close enough to walk to Ivars, shopping, Pike's Market and lots of other fun attractions. The parking seemed expensive, but what else do you expect in downtown Seattle? The boys enjoyed the pool, it's small, but a fun place to cool off. There were a lot of people using the gym the morning we went up there, but still had enough room. The staff wasn't over the top nice, but they were efficient.

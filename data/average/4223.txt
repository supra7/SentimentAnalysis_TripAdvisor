The Park Plaza is located in a great spot to visit downtown Boston but the guest rooms are a disappointment for a 5 star hotel. The rooms have not been updated in many years. Small tube TVs, no wireless, decor, poor lighting and noise from street make this hotel a 3 star hotel in a five star location. Service was excellent but more signs directing where to go with your car outside would help.

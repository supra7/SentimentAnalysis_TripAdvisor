I have just returned from my stay at the Palmer House. I have stayed at many hotels, but this hotel, by far has the rudest bell staff!! They don't greet you or even open the door for you when you arrive at the hotel. I pulled up at the hotel and asked the bellman directions to the garage for self-parking. He mumbled something and made a gesture up and to the left; however, he never offered to unload my luggage. Upon my departure, I was loaded with luggage and the bellman never offered to assist me or even open the door!!! I have no idea why the Palmer House have bellmen...they certainly provided no service!! Also, as a side note--this hotel was recently on the news for having bed bugs!! I loved the location, but will never stay here again for numerous reasons!!

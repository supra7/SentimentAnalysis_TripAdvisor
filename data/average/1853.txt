I must say that reading through the other reviews, I am surprised by all the raves. Let me begin by saying that my new husband and I started our honeymoon on Kauai at the Grand Hyatt Resort and Spa and were blown away by that property. It was absolutely an amazing resort. So, we were disappointed when we arrived at the Hyatt Regency on Maui. I think overall, most of the disappointment was due to the fact that the grounds and the hotel were not nearly as manicured as Kauai. I felt the hotel was really showing its age. Sure, I have seen worse, but coming from somewhere 20 times better made it hard to remember that. It would have helped if we felt the staff was accomodating, but in fact we found them rude and curt. Furthermore, we were only offered rooms by the elevator shafts which were noisy. The cleaning staff also had some sort of work room by the elevators and all we heard all day were carts and doors banging around. The pools were PACKED full of old lounge chairs that were inches apart. The beach was rocky and murky. I did have a very nice lomi lomi massage in the spa and the workout facility looked nice a big, but I gave myself a week off from that. As with almost anything in Hawaii, the food and beverage at the Hyatt were overpriced for their calibur, but that is just something we got used to. Overall the Kaanapali area did not feel very "Hawaii" - many fewer "aloha's" and alot more rudeness. If you are looking to stay in this area, check out the Sheraton - it looked really nice from the outside and their beach area was much better.

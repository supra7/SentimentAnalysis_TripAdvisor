Listed on Priceline as a 4-star hotel but it was more a 3-star. Good downtown crossing location, near shopping and subway. Good views of the Boston skyline. Room was comfortable but needs minor updating and maintenance. The lobby can be a bit tricky to find (need to take elevator to the 3rd fl). Lots of construction going on nearby. At night the homeless can be found sleeping in doorways and under store overhangs around this hotel. The five lane lap pool is on the smaller size. I cannot attest to the restaurant or Internet access.

The hotel is very hip in decor, including the rooms, with pink lights outlining the headboards. The space is minimal for a not-large couple. Plus sizes should look elsewhere, as should anyone who wants to read a book or even look at a map. The only place with enough light to do either is in the WC! Front desk staff was nice but not knowlegeable. The two restaurants they directed us to were mediocre and I think had dropped off cards with maps so they would get referrals. We are here for six nights and but for the fact we are meeting friends here, we would move elsewhere.

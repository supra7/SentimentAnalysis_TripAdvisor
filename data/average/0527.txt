The location of this Sheraton in downtown Seattle is great. It is very convenient to many Seattle attractions and shops. The hotel is a lovely high-rise with, thankfully, many elevators.The gym on the top floor was one of the best I have seen in a hotel. There is also a pool up there. Our room was standard but fine. The problem with this hotel is that it is extremely busy. There is always a long line at the front desk. Apparently there are two cruise lines that work out of this hotel. We found out at 4AM that the acoustics leave a great deal to be desired as nothing going on in the room next door was left to the imagination. That was not fun. We were there for 3 nights and we were quite amused by the gum wrapper on the floor by the elevator that probably stayed longer than we did. The staff was very attentive and the wait for extra towels was quite short. Nice place if you don't mind the crowds and a noisy room.

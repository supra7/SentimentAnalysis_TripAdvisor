The location of the hotel is perfect. It's near great shopping and easy access to subway. We had a premier family suite but the bathroom was very small and old. When we used the hair dryer outside of the bathroom, the power went off in the suite and had to ask the staff to reset. They have a cocktail hour in the lobby which is really nice. The free wireless is also a nice touch.

Like most things in Boston, the price of this hotel is sky-high. The location, however, is first-rate. So much to do and see. Everything is within a half-hour walk (it's always better to see Boston on foot) and then a quick trip on the T if you have to be somewhere quickly. The hotel is quite a site to see and reminds me of a hotel you'd see in the movies but one that isn't practical to stay in. Everything about this hotel is not set up for the modern business traveler. Or the modern family. Or even a couple looking for a romantic getaway. Yes, I know it is "historic" but here is my honest review of some of the issues. 1. Very tiny rooms. Barely enough floor space to lay out two suitcases. 2. No wireless internet in rooms. 3. Bathroom is very tiny and doesn't offer much (if any) privacy. 4. It's not an issue that the TV was not a flatscreen, but the giant box TV took up such a large portion of the room. It truly was cumbersome. 5. There was no "express" checkout. You had to go to the front desk and physically check out. Kind of obnoxious to wait in line when there was nothing I needed to change on my bill.... 6. Lastly, there was a very large prom or graduation group at the hotel on a Thursday night. From about 5PM-3AM, there was no relaxation or convenience for "normal" guests...just tons of teenagers running wild. Beer cans, drink cups all over...partygoers passed out in the elevators and stairwells, screaming & yelling in the hallways, elevators packed to the brim with kids going up & down to their rooms. I didn't call to complain, as I'm sure many other guests did. I was told the next day by my colleagues that the hotel front desk even stopped answering the phone. However, in writing this, I hope that those who read my review will ask ahead of time when making their reservation if there are any large groups staying at the hotel. If there is, expect all peace & quiet to cease to be.

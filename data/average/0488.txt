Reasonably good property. Excellent location within Seattle Center, great connectivity to transit network. Rooms are a little noisy, and elevators/hallways are somewhat dated. Breakfast was decent, service was attentive. I can see where on-site parking can be an issue (is limited to surface & 1 underground deck), though it wasn't for us mid-week. For the money, looked like the best alternative as compared to neighboring properties.

This hotel really is in the middle of Boston. Its right across from the beautiful Boston Commons and a half mile walk in any direction takes you to shops, sidewalk cafes and the beautiful culture and architecture of the city. The hotel is very well known among the residence and is very nice but does have a few issues you'll need to know about. The air conditioning posed a problem right away. It's honestly hit or miss with this. We asked to move rooms twice before being satisfied with the room temperature. The rooms are tastefully decorated and a decent size. Some rooms have huge walk-in closets and some rooms have marble bathrooms. The bathroom is very small, but functional all the same. The room we decided to keep had an exercise bike and two bathrooms. Rooms with two double beds were very narrow, not having stayed in them thats all I can really say. The fitness center contains treadmills, bikes and elypical machines as well as a few strength machines and a set of freeweights. There is no pool. All in all we had a good stay. No problems other than the initial air conditioning concern. I would come back again.

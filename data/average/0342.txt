Friendly, helpful staff welcome you to this older downtown hotel. We booked the cozy Queen which included Valet Parking and continental breakfast. Upon arrival we were given an upgrade. The bathrooms are period, clean and tiny. The closet is also tiny so don't expect to hang a lot of clothing. The air conditioner in our room didn't work that well-but no matter weather had started cooling down in late August. The bed is a little on the soft side but some people like that. The continental breakfast served by very friendly people in the lobby coffee shop was fine-coffee or tea, juice and your choice of pastry. Newspapers were available in the lounge. Try and not get a room near the ancient elevators-they are very noisy. This hotel was great for a two day visit to Seattle. The location is excellent as you can walk to the Public Market, the Space Needle the water front areas and to the major department stores. Seattle is a great city- The Executive Hotel Pacific will serve you very well indeed for a short stay.

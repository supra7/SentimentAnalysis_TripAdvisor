This is a very nice, clean, chic hotel but it being a Marriott/4 stars I was a bit disappointed by the service at times. I was traveling for business as I was attending a conference at the next door conference center, and my wife was accompanying me as she wanted to enjoy/discover downtown LA. The good: rooms have top of line amenities (flat screen HD TV, iPod alarm clocks, etc) really comfortable beds and beautiful bathrooms. Besides the hotel's own restaurant there's plenty of good eateries right on the plaza, so no need to drive around! The valet parking staff were really nice and efficient. The bad: I had booked a king bed room but by the time we arrived (around 5pm on the sunday before the conference) they were fully booked and somehow no king room left besides my reservation. No apologies about it. I was told at the desk we would have 2 queens instead, which is fine by me as we sleep on a queen at home, but once in the room it turns out it was really 2 doubles. A bit tight for my wife and I, so we ended up sleeping in separate beds for the length stay, far from ideal... Apart from that first mishap, the bathtub's plug/drain stopper was not working making it impossible for my wife to relax from the trip in bath on the first night, no big deal but it took 3 requests (each spaced out by a couple of hours) to finally have someone come up and fix it. At checkout, we were rushed through, no one ever asked us how was our stay, I guess they didn't care, I was hoping to be able to voice my disappointment then but I was not given the opportunity so here you go.

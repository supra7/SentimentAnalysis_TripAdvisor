I really love the Eco park but everything else is okay. All of the hotel excursion is the same. The food is good but be careful, alot of people go food poisoning. I think the mix drink cause the added water to it. I got sick 5 days into my vacationing here. I feel uneasy after every meals. After talking with a couple of people , they too realize it. At night, everything is dead. If you want food you have to do room services. The positive side is that the hotel have plenty of outdoor beds and hammocks. The staffs are great and very flexible. There are 2 pools and they are great.

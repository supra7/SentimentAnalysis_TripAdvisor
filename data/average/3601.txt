Spent two nites recently at this property and it's in a convenient location. Just a little north of Northpark Center on 75 and not far from Greenville. Within about 10 minutes of Uptown and downtown without traffic. Fairly simple lodge without any frills. Has a morning breakfast buffett for about $9.95 I believe. Parking lot gets busy in the evening since the property shares a joint parking lot with Marriott's Residence Inn. The property has a pool, spa, and gym; however I didnt use any of those services. I had a first floor room which had an antique am/fm clock radio that looked like it was from the early 80's.. The a/c worked fine as well as the water temp and water pressure. Towels were fairly comfortable/soft for a lodge in the class of a Courtyard.. The one downside was for some reason the remote and tv were not interacting. The remote was working since it was blinking however I had absolutely no response from the TV so it was inconvenient.. And the tv was an older 19" tube tv. Oh, and no vending machine on the property. A simple desktop was in the lobby to access the internet and print. Overall, the staff was friendly.

I booked our stay in this hotel via Priceline bidding and paid 292 dollar for 2 nights which is not bad. We arrived in the afternoon and they gave us a room on the 6th floor. First thing we noticed was that the airconditioning made a lot of noise so after we parked our car in the Common Garage (cheaper and nearby) we called the front-desk and they send someone who switched the airco off with a hidden button. Our stay was OK but the VALET people were not friendly at all. According to the hotel it's allowed to park for 15 minutes during check-in and check-out. They seemed not so happy when you ask for this and they directly tell you that if you're not back within 15 minutes they start charging you. I explained that I will be as fast as possible but that I depend on the front-desk-lines... No excuse... "we will charge you if you're not back in 15 minutes" Location is perfect and there are some nice restaurants nearby.

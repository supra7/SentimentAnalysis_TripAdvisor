The aircon in this perfectly reasonable Holiday Inn Express City-22 Barcelona was switched off because the staff said: "It's winter". It was 20 degrees outside and the sun shone on my room all day. It was a sauna. Reception told me it was 'impossible' to switch on the aircon and I should open the window. It opened maybe six inches and I had to leave the curtains open to get any air at all. That meant no privacy and street noise - and it was still hot. The next day I demanded a fan. They gave me a large fan that made a real racket! Net result: still no sleep. Before you use this hotel find out whether they are on a 'saving electricity campaign'. If they are, steer clear.

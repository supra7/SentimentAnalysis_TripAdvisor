April 10, 2008, this was the last stay of a college trip and wanted to splurge and relax. Booked because of the reviews read, disappointed because it was much less than i expected. the staff nice, but room small and overlooked the alley and a brick wall. Wish the clerk had told me the doubles overlooked the alley, $300. (includes tax and valet parking, one day) is too much, robes and a flat screen are not enough, nor the offers of a goldfish in a bowl. Will stay at another hotel next time.

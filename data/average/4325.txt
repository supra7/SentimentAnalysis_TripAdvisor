After paying $85 a night for this hotel (around $100 with taxes) through Priceline - I went straight to Trip Advisor to read the reviews. Needless to say, I was not estatic about getting the Park Plaza. However, everything worked out fine. We did valet the car for one night paying $40 - but since my husband and I both grew up outside of Boston, we know how expensive this city can be. Check-in was fast and pleasant. Our room was a queen bed - a little small, but comfortable with a nice comforter. The bathroom was really small, but we didn't mind as we've seen even smaller in Europe. There is no hair dryer. The shower had a dual head and nice water pressure. We didn't need to use the air or heat, so can't comment on that. The location is what makes this hotel. Steps from the Boston Commons, as well as Newbury and Boylston Streets - you will be in walking distance of pretty much all Boston has to offer. Great restaurants, fun bars and wonderful shopping. Like the previous post - we are addicted to Dunkin Donuts, as there are none in where we live in San Diego. It is about a 3 block walk to the closest Dunkies, but well worth it. All in all if you do use Priceline and get this hotel for under a $100 then you shouldn't be too disappointed, but I would probably never pay full price. On a side note, a friend and I met the owner of the Plaza at Todd English's Bonfire Grill which is a very good restaurant.

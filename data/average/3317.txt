Cheap  Economy hotel in Tokyo, about 15 minutes from Tokyo Station. Take two subway lines: the Marunouchi line one stop to Otemachi and switch to the Hanzomon line for three stops to Kiyosumi Shirakawa station...hotel is about 15 feet from subway exit B1...cost is 160 yen.Not much in the immediate area of the hotel (go out to dinner elsewhere), but convenience to other areas of Tokyo and the proximity to the subway makes up for this.Rooms are quite small with an even smaller bathroom, but rooms do inlcude a number of features including flat penel television, an air purifier, and a humidifier. Hotel also has free wireless internet access and free continental breakast (modest with few choices). Hotel is clean and relatively new.At 7,200 yen per night (less than $70) for a single, a very good value if you are in Tokyo for something other than a hotel experience. For those looking to pay more (but remain on budget) and stay in a more vibrant neighborhood, consider the Dai Ichi Hotel Annex near Shinbashi Station and walking distance to the Ginza.

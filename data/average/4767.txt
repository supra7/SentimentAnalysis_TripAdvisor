I actually got a great deal on hotwire on this hotel so it was not overpriced for me, but if I had paid a few hundred bucks I would be livid! The omni has lost a little bit of his sparkle, the staff was pleasant, needs to update interior, beds are soft, avoid front of hotels rooms to much noise around weekends, not as stellar as years past but good location to shop.

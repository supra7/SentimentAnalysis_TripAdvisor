Was here on business end of July. The facilities were nice. I had a nice corner suite with decent views down the hill towards waterfront. The suite was quite spacious, albeit a bit older. The tv was a tad dilapidated and unresponsive, but the service was pretty good. It's on a bit of a steep hill... but that's good exercise for you anyway. I say this was an average stay. Nothing to get too worked up about either way.

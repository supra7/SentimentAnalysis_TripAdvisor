I got a pretty good deal on the hotel, so overall I was pleased considering I didn't pay a lot. Good location - just off Michigan Ave and close to many bars and restaurants. The Grand subway stop is located right in front of the hotel, which is an added plus if you're to/from the airport via the train. Hotel staff was friendly. Rooms were clean. If you're planning to take a late night dip in the pool (I.e. in the last hour before the pool closes, just a warning that this seems to be the time that many families take their kids swimming (maybe to tire them out??). The hot tub just isn't quite as relaxing with a bunch of 8 year-olds splashing around beside you. : (

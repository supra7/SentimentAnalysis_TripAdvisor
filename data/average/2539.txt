I have stayed here a number of times over the years as it is very convenient being most handy for Euston, King's Cross and St Pancras as well as for travelling around London. I have found it serves this purpose and is ok if all you need is a clean, fairly comfortable ensuite room for a night at a reasonable (for London) cost. I don't think this hotel aspires to offer more than this. It is not somewhere to look forward to staying in. Rooms can vary widely regarding noise, my last stay was noisy but on other occaisons other rooms were quiter. The airconditioning never seems to work anywhere. The Premier Inn nearby is more expensive but a lot more comfortable and a much nicer hotel alround in my experience.

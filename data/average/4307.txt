We stayed in a standard room at the Park Plaza. It was small, but I expected that. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Our only issue was that our room was very hot. We turned the air conditioning down all the way and it was still miserable. We went out for the evening on the day we arrived, and asked for it to be checked. Nothing happened that night, so after spending a sleepless night, we asked for them to fix it again or change our room. We went out for the day and when we returned it was nice & cool. That only lasted for 24 hours. The next day it was hot again, but we were able to open the window and let cool air in so we were comfortable. I won't stay there again just because of dealing with the temperature in the room.

We ended up here at the last minute, after seeing reviews of a different hotel we had reservations at. We acquired their park and cruise package. The hotel in fact is old and very outdated. We stayed in room 1215...which is an average room. The first thing we did was check the mattress for bedbugs, in doing this, I was at eye level with a gross drape. It had some sort of splattered stain that just did me in. We won't be staying there again, for the price, to me, it's too outdated. The noise was horrid. The staff on the other hand was Great!

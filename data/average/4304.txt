I stayed here for a work conference and was disappointed by the rooms and the service. The lobby is beautiful and the location blocks from the Public Garden can't be beat, but this property is really in need of some upgrades. Starting with the front desk area - the layout is confusing and I stood in line while several new people approached desk clerks from the side. One of the duties of a desk clerk is to pay attention to the people who are waiting and to not allow people to interrupt or cut in line. When I got to my room, my keys did not work. So I had to go back downstairs with all of my luggage, wait in line again, and then trudge back up to my floor. The room itself was small - not unexpected in an older city hotel. That said, the furnishings are outdated, I had to call service at least twice to fix issues, and the air conditioning was loud enough to keep me awake at night. If you are attending an event, you will enjoy the ornate ballrooms. But I would suggest staying somewhere else when you visit Boston.

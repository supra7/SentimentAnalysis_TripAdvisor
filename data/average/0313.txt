This hotel is situated in a business district but sightseeing and shopping are within easy walking distance. It is an older hotel and the lifts in it were certainally very slow (and noisy) during our stay. The room was small and the bathroom tiny, with a door which did not quite shut. There was air conditioning in the room which worked, but rattled. I think the best bit about this hotel was the proximity to places and the safety. A few blocks away the area did not seem to be quite so pleasant,, so we were pleased to have opted for the Executive Pacific for our short stay.

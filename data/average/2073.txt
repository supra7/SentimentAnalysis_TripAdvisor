Dodgy alley I stayed at the Storrier for 4 nights in October. There are good and bad points about the hotel. The good: the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms were a little small, nice and clean. The interior decor is very funky. There are heaps of restaurants, bars and nightlife nearby. The Kings Cross subway station is only a minute walk away.The bad: To get to the hotel you have to walk either along an alley or a past a dodgy street area. It may be called Potts Point, but the other side of the street is Kings Cross. It didn't feel very safe walking to the hotel late at night. The Holiday Inn Potts Point is about 50m away, but it's a very important 50m. It felt a lot safer walking to the Holiday Inn, we would walk to the Holiday Inn and the catch a taxi for the last 50m to the hotel door.

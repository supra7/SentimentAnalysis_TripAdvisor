stayed in this hotel in October with work. Mainley a business hotel and not in the best area if you are travelling for pleasure! As you enter the hotel it is very trendy but computers that are free to use in the lobby were never working. Rooms were the usual nice Novotel standard, nice big windows let in plenty of light though! Bathroom is much in need of being updated! The Novotel UK hotels I have stayed in have amazing showers and this one just soaked the floor and dribbled on me. Its a funky hotel down stairs and compared to alot of the hotels in City very modern! If you can id pay extra and go to the Grand Sofitel!

It's not a bad hotel to be honest. But the receptionists lack the charm and organisational skills you might hope for a property in this price range. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. You just have to get passed check-in.. After I arrived early, I was told my room would not be ready until 12.30pm. FIne. The website said 3pm, so I re-arranged my plans and returned at the appointed hour. I was then told the room would not be ready until 3pm "as you know". I didn't protest and an apology was't on offer. However, I did look inconvenienced, so one of them started to find one. She was impressive: I have never seen anyone rattle off so many different forms of the negative without reference to a thesaurus. Finally, "You're lucky, I've found you one.". Computer said yes.

We came to Boston to visit friends and used points to stay here. We thought this Mariott was totally fine, your average Mariott. The location is what makes this hotel so great. The hotel was bustling with conferences and college football fans and there was a great mall attached. We found the service at the front desk very friendly. Our room was a handicap accessible room so the bathroom was oversized as was part of the bedroom. Overall it was a nice weekend and the hotel worked out perfectly for us.

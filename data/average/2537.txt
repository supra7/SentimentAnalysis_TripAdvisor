I would feel a lot happier about staying in this hotel and other travelodges if they supplied 2 pillows for each guest and your chair in the room was not a plastic bucket chair. We stayed for a night here before using Eurostar the next day, so did not have breakfast. we arrived about 9 pm and it was easy to book in. We left our cases in the room, noting that we needed to ask for 2 more pillows (one each) when we returned form eating out. When we returned we asked for more pillows and was told they had no more but could give us extra towels to use!!! Another guest asked for more pillows and was told the same. Why do they not have enough pillows!!! I notice they say to use the internet in the comfort of your room, which I wonder how comfortable you can be in that chair!!! The room was clean but there was a strange smell. We did not find it too noisy at night as room was at back of travelodge. On the way back we stayed at Premier Inn across the road which was more comfortable and had 2 pillows each!!

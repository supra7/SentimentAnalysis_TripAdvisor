I was scared to stay here after reading the bad reviews. I stayed here 1/14/2012 and it is a good hotel. First off if you have never been to New Orleans I can see where you would say it's in a bad nieghborhood. This hotel is only a few blocks from the french quarter and me and my girlfriend walked it late at night with no problems. As for the hotel being small, the rooms are divided into a sitting area and a sleeping area and it is this reason that makes the rooms look small. If the rooms were not divided it would be an average hotel room size (I know I travel alot and stay in a lot of hotels), As for how clean the rooms are, they are very clean and I believe it is the age of the hotel that puts people off. Remember this hotel has been through many changes and been around for a while. Overall a good hotel with an amazing continental breakfast and friendly service...PS there were families staying in this hotel and no bed bugs or roaches like I had read about...WILL STAY HERE AGAIN.

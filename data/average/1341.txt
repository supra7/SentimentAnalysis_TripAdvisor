We were shuffled to this hotel during the windstorm because the place we had was out of power. The hallways were dirty, needed vacuumed. They jacked up the price by at least $25 cause they knew they had us, so to speak. The room was clean, very basic. They had a great shuttle driver, Jimmy!! they were very accomodating in getting us around in the van. let us stay in our room past the check out time because our flight was delayed. Overall, ok in a pinch.

This is a good place to stay for business travellers; decent service, nice appartments/suites, and particularly if you stay for a longer time period, a place to use a base for more than just a hotel stay. Good restaurants in hotel (2) but little other servieces, no bar area, no lobby service etc. Nice pool and excellent gym, however.

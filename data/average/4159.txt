I have stayed at the Park Plaza four or five times usually when attending a conference held there. My rooms have always been fine. Not big but very adequate and looking out on the street. Once I was even upgraded without request to the floor which had continental breakfast. This past week, I stayed for two nights while attending a conference and was very disappointed for several reasons. The first, is that the room I was given was really cramped. There was not enough room to fit a table if I wanted to order room service meals. The shower stall was so small that I bumped the sides. There was a little appendage to the stall so that the shower curtain would prevent water from hitting the floor. The room looked out on the inside of the hotel and I knew that the hotel was far from full. The TV channel guide was inaccurate and the hotel no longer had pay for view movies. I tried to call room service and twice and got no answer. The directions for making a long distance call were inaccurate and when I finally got room service the directions that they gave were incorrect also. When I checked in I asked if there were any room discounts left for the conference and was told that I would have to call myself to ask. I wasn't really expecting one since I was asking so late but how hard was it for the desk person to call and ask? In the future I will find another place to stay.

I was not happy when I arrived and was told that the internet cost $12.50 (plus tax) in this hotel. I booked using hotels.com, and this wasn't clear from the description. The walls are paper-thin and so you hear a lot of noise at night and in the morning. I'm a heavy sleeper, but still this bothered me. The hotel is an old charming one, but the rooms are a bit stale. Given the high price, I'd expect better room condition and not charging for internet.

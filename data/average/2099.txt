Excellent location on the tram line with Topkapi, Agia Sophia and Galata Bridge within easy walking distance and plenty of shops and eating and drinking places close by. Rooms a bit shabby with plug sockets hanging out and strange smells. Some noise at night as one would expect on a main street in a big city. Breakfast ok with some nice breads. No sign of the roof terrace referred to in older reviews. Breakfast was served in a rather dingy windowless basement.

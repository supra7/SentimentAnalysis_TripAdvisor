I was expecting a 4-5 star hotel, but the rooms were definitely not. The lobby is beautiful, staff is friendly and the hotel bar, Whiskey Park, is amazing. I guess a room is a room, but it needs updating. The bathroom was from the 1970's and the ac/heat unit barely worked. Their rooms come with double beds and they charge extra if you want a queen bed and charge more for a king bed. The doors to the rooms were all cracked and they have an outdated lock system. The room was cheaper than other hotels near by. Not as extravagant as I thought it would be.

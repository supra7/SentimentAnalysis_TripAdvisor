We stayed at the Westin in May of this year and I can say that this hotel could be an awesome place to stay with the help of a make over...The photos that are shown on pics over the web give this Westin Too much credit..... I am not picky at all, I just see the potential in this hotel, and I hope the owners find some spare change to redo the carpets, paint the inside and outside of the building, as well as refurnish the rooms..The shower pressure could also use a boost.... Oh yea, the internet can only be accessed from the lobby unless you shell out $20 ....Not a big deal, but also "Not Kool"! The bed was amazzzzzing though!!!!! It almost made me forget about the other flaws! Great stay if you enjoy getting swallowed up by a super comfotable bed!...

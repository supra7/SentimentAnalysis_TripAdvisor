The owner of the Hotel Dama was very friendly and very helpful. He held our bags and in the morning he walked with us to the bar to help us with breakfast...pastry and coffee. BUT...he did not give us a room at the Hotel Dama. He walked us to the Penelope, and that is where our room was. The room there was very bare...cement floors and beds on wheels...it was not what we expected. And the reception was directly outside and was loud...you could hear the conversations. We were only there one night, so it worked out ok. And the location was great for us as we needed to take the bus to the airport the next day.

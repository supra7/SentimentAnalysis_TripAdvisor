Let's be frank. If you are looking to stay in your room or enjoy the amenities this is not the place for you. As you enter the carpet need to be replaced and it is a old property. Our greeting was great though and the front desk gal was very friendly. We were there for a Husky football game and it was a pleasant mile walk to the stadium. This may sound like a distance but when you are walking with many other fans and through the tailgate parties it is entertaining even in the rain. We also were able to enjoy the shopping at what I think is one of the best malls in the PNW which is and outdoor University Mall. All you have to do is walk across the street. Yes, the rooms are dated, yes, the water is iffy, yes, you may go hmmmm, when you walk in...BUT if you are looking for a great place to shop, go to the UW Campus AND get free parking, this is your place. If you are looking to visit Seattle this would not be for you as you are quite away from the sites. Ask for a room in the back and yes you will be facing a unattractive apartment complex but I was shock that we heard NOTHING from them all night long. I slept better here than in some 4 stars that we normally stay. If you are looking to get out of your room and shop and visit campus this place if for you. If you are looking for a more boutique environment I would recommend the Hotel Deco on the other side of campus which is also a great property.

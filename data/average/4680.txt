The staff is the best feature. They were all very friendly and accomodating. The workout room was small, but clean and well stocked with towels etc. We didn't experience any problems and don't really have any major complaints. If you are traveling with family this is your place, but for a romantic getaway or an upscale hotel this isn't the place for you.

This hotel has good potential without a doubt. From the moment I contact them to make a reservation, the person assisting me was helpful and always wrote a prompt response. The check in was smooth and quick. This trip was to celebrate our first anniversary and we decided to book a corner room because of the view. We weren't disappointed by the room. Everything was perfect except for two little issues with the tv and safe not working at the moment we arrived, but it was fixed in no time. The view was amazing and the location could not be better. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Checking out could have been a lot simpler if not by the only bad experience I had in this hotel. This was the first time I visited Chicago, therefore I was not aware of the procedures they use for extra services. At the moment of arrival I paid my stay and taxes with cash and left a card on file just in case we decided to use any extra service. The person at the front desk never mentioned that they would make a significant charge to my card at the moment that we arrived just to cover the hotel's back. Every hotel manages this type of situations in a different way, but I could have been told about this before checking in and I would have not been as upset when I checked out. The guy who was at the front desk when we checked in was there for check out as well. All he could say when I asked him about when I would get the money back was "It's up to your bank man". Poor customer service from that person, no standards on how to talk to a guest and could have warned me about this from the beginning. Other then that, the stay was good, but will possibly consider a different hotel next time.

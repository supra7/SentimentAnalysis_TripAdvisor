While we enjoyed the great beach location and found the rooms comfortable we didn't think Secrets Maroma quite warranted the reviews it receives. The service was inconsistent and, with the exception of a very good breakfast buffet selection, the food very average. Although we are not big drinkers the drinks were very weak. There are also a fair number of partiers engaged in behaviours not everyone would welcome including loud, bad language. We would recommend the snorkelling offered not at the resort but by Captain Memo, a private sailboat operator who takes small groups out for 3 hour informative and fun trips along the coast. He can be found around 10 a.m. in the morning at a location on the beach to the right of the resort.

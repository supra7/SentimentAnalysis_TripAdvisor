Stayed here for two nights and it was a cute hotel. The rooms were on the smaller size and this hotel overall is not too big but for the price we paid, I don't have too many complains. Customer service is pretty good but the first night we were there, the bed wasn't made and when we got back to the hotel room that night, our key wasn't working. Little mishaps here-and-there but they were resolved promptly.

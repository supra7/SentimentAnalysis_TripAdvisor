Comparing to all the other establishments on the Strip and mind you most haven't got great reviews, this was my first choice. I'd say it's good value for money because it's a suite and the hotel is only 3 years old. However, after been walking up and down the Strip for a whole day, I wish I had picked somewhere 'central' like Paris (much cheaper than Trump I think) or a new hotel called Cosmopolitan. Check-in/out was efficient, staff members were helpful. Room service ....what is it?? Nothing to write home about. I have tasted the yukkiest buffalo wings in my life! We had a room with a city view on a high floor. The bed is something worth mentioning.....It's sooo comfortable and we had good sleep there. The swimming pool was nice but it would have been even nicer if they didn't charge US$50 for the cabana. You can imagine that's the reason why they aren't used. Most of the patrons were young party-goers but generally they behaved themselves. If you love shopping, this is the place to be in as the mega mall is just few steps across the road. I think it's worth 3.5 stars but I won't give it 4.

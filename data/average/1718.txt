It's hard to write anything negative about this hotel, because the personal and the manager were so incredibly kind to make the best out of our stay. They really did their utmost to help us out with any information about Istanbul, taxis or even a change of room. But I have to be honest about the facilities. Only the rooms on the floors 4+ have a great view, the other floors have a view of the parking lot. And please ask for a room away from the restaurant, since this can be noisy during the night, after dinner or before breakfast. Standard rooms are not too big, suites are perfect. Design is beautiful, very classy. Great beds. Location is good, near the big shopping street and close to the old town.

The hotel is in a great location for spending a weekend in Boston. You are right next to the Aquarium, across the street from Faneuil Hall, and a short walk to the North End. While the hotel looks really nice, there are some issues. We spent one night over a recent weekend as a treat for our daughter who is 6. Check-in was a breeze. The room looked really nice...until we stepped onto a giant wet spot on the floor between the 2 beds. Thinking it was just spilled water, we let it go. But when attempting to sleep later that night, we realized that it was a poor attempt to clean up vomit because we could now smell it. By that time, it was really too late for us to do anything about it. Also beware...when showering at 7AM, we had lukewarm water at best and the water is very soft making it really tough to wash the soap off. We were also really looking forward to spending time in the pool, but the pool water and area were quite cool. We could only spend about 20 minutes there before we were all shivering. For the $159/night, it wasn't a bad deal for Boston, but it wasn't the nice stay we were hoping for.

Arrived and discovered a mark on the bedroom wall that looked like someone had spat on it. Asked reception that next morning to have it cleaned, also for extra coat hangers. Got back in the evening- nothing done- same the next day although the coat hangers did appear on the second time of asking. In the end asked cleaners ourselves to do it. Breakfast buffet was a mediocre choice of food and chaotic. Everyday we had to ask for something (spoons, plates, bread etc). Cleaning staff were very friendly and helpful as were pool and gym staff. if only all the staff were like that. Rooms were large and in fairly good condition although don't think about self catering unless you are just heating up a ready meal, there is no equipment. Pool very nice but only 1 umbrella. There are always taxis outside the hotel and Mall of the Emirates is next door so a good location and easy to get around and I guess you get what you pay for.

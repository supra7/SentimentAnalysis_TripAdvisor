We stay at this hotel at least once each year and it has always been a good experience. The rooms are a decent size, the beds are comfortable (although I would prefer queens to doubles in any hotel) and the staff are helpful. The lobby is spacious and comfortable but has this constant electronic "mood" music that some may find annoying (we found it funny - it is like the same song 24/7). The large, treed courtyard of the hotel is covered and contains a pool and 2 hot tubs. The kids love this part of the hotel. One caution: on a busy night, it is better to get a room that does NOT face the pool as the noise can be impossible to tune out, even on the 5th floor. A couple that we were traveling with had a room on a lower floor, and could smell the chlorine a bit. Still, this is one of the highlights of the property from an 8-year-old's perspective. The restaurant was a touch pricey, but the breakfast buffet for the kids was reasonable, and kept them going for most of the day. Adults may want to stick to picking something from the menu. The main reason we ate here was that there was nothing else nearby for a sit-down breakfast. There is a small coffee/gift shop that sell Starbucks coffee, some pastries and sandwiches and drinks for a reasonable price. For dinner, you may want to make the 10 minute drive to Southcentre Mall, and try the Cheesecake Factory, Rainforest Cafe or one of the many other restaurants there. Overall, this hotel had what we were looking for: clean rooms, helpful staff, a place to grab a snack and a pool. It is not a palace, but it is perfectly good for its intended purpose.

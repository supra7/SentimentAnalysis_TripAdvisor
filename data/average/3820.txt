Beware of currency exchange markup... negotiate a set price in USD and the hotel immediately marked-up the rate to an exchange rate of 13.5 Peso/USD which increased my daily rate by 12% (exchange rate was < 12.25 Peso/USD)... rooms are okay, nothing fabulous. Hotel is in a nice part of town but the traffic is terrible and getting anywhere by cab can be frustrating. Beware of the staff looking for tips when really do not deserve a tip... for example, the staff in the lounge on 16 (which is nice) do nothing but expect you to sign a bill and leave a tip. Fair hotel for the Marriott chain but nothing to rave about; staying here in that a favor Marriotts over other chains P.S. it should be noted that the water from the tap is certified to be up to the same standards as that in the USA

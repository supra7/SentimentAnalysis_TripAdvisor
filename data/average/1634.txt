just returned from el dorado maroma. its is a nice resort food good staff ok just not overly friendly like I'm use to,had a few problems , not sure why we were corrected on morning coffee time it was 5 till 9 and on our second cup and the pot was empty 9:10 when he returned and let us know 9:OO AM it ended (small stuff) now big stuff after 3 nights we were bored ask for pool valley ball no because of the bar, (we played last year at a karisma resort and the net was tided to the bar had a great time); nothing against the resort just told them it was not what we wanted and ask to be moved to a another karisma went to Louis with loams said he would check on that give him a couple of hours its 10:00am on a Mon; at 1:00 they said if we go through the exotic travel they would move us at members cost but the meeting wont be till Tue morning at 8:30 am. went to meeting 2 hours later said no thanks ask for our transfer at members cost and was told they cant do that unless we bought. that is not what loams man Louis said also Paola the corsair the day before, so still trying to move we had Louis check on moving us to sea sides and we will take care of up grades our self, 3 hours later still not moved 1:00 Tue and had not heard from loams man Louis so after tequila tasting went back to see Louis he still had no news on our move, at this time not being nice about the whole thing and demanding to be moved now Louis picked up the phone and called someone and we were moved within an hour at no extra cost,we paid the taxi of 50.00 the rest of our money went to sea sides which is a less expensive resort and we toke care of our upgrades when we go there which was not much money the rest of our vacation was stress free an had a blast with pool valley ball and other fun games met lots of friendly people. el drado maroma is a nice resort and many people love it but its not for everyone and if its not for you the resort management or your loams director should not put you off and take care of you they are a represented of el dorados / karisma. we feel they owe use 3 days of our last vacation 2 days of hassle to get moved and the first day we were at the resort by 1:00 in the after noon and did not get a room till 6:30 pm just sat at the pool bar , not sure if they forgot about us?plus we never got our 50 min. couples massage for going to the exotic travel meeting which we were promised i guess we got to the place we didn't care if we received it , if they had to lie cheat and put us off to keep use there we don't ever want to go back that's not the way we do business , we are not complainers but after 15 years of travel most to Mexico this was the most stressful vacation we had and it didn't have to be we are in our later 40 but young at heart. hope this helps someone if you find your self in a resort that's just not you.don't let them put you off make them do it now or call your travel agent we wish we had the first day we ask to be moved .

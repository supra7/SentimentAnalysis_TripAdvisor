On check-in Courtney was most friendly and professional - for the rest of BOTH by stays the staff were unresponsive and dismissive - when reporting that I felt unsafe with a safe that was not secured to the wall as I travel with huge amounts of cash - I was informed that all rooms are provided with PORTABLE SAFES and that this was standard practice - I have a photo of my friend actually walking out of the room with the safe containing all our passports and $3000 in cash just to show how ludicrous this is. The hotel is central but lacks any sort of atmosphere - I stayed in 2 different roomsand checked all the lobbies - each have 2 framed pictures against the wall and above the bed - and both are IDENTICAL - they could at least swop one from the hall with one from each room excetera - just shows no thought given to much else than functionality

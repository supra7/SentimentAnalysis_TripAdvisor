The Westin name seems to carry a top notch reputation ..but in this case it was highly overrated and I was disappointed with my stay. Good location in downtown Seattle, easy to walk around to nearby shopping... otherwise, overpriced for average size room, basic amenties and absolutely no extras! For such a high-end chain, they could stand to be a bit more generous. Computer use cost about 7 dollars for 15 minutes. The cafe in the lounge was open minimal hours, the service there was horrendous and the prices outrageous. What I liked least was the noise! It seemed like they purposely placed guests in adjoining rooms rather than spreading them out in this massive hotel... very disturbing and hard to sleep well. The place (including its elevators) is worn out and needs a massive overhaul. Some rooms have nice views of the city and water... but not sure I would return or recommend to anyone else. I know I would not spend much to stay there again. Neighborhood at night seemed desolate and a bit unnerving to walk around. Reception staff seemed to be tired and not too enthusiastic. Very varied type of guests from families with little kids, to business travelers, sports fans, etc... Do NOT go if you are looking for a quiet, romantic, peaceful, helpful, friendly, accessible, serviced, interesting or unique place. It is run of the mill and way overrated (staff, facilities and guest services).

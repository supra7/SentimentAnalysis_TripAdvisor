I have stayed here a few times before. Never had a problem, and obviously I returned. But when I tried to take a shower before I left for a meeting, the shower didn't work, no water!!!! Do not stay in 5120! Also, paying 21 bucks for parking while staying drives me nuts! And you can hear people in hallway.

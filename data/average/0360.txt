We were in Seattle just one night and opted for location and price over lack of air conditioning -- but our room was quite uncomfortably warm, even with the large screened window and both a ceiling and bureau fan going full speed. Location is prime -- we walked right across the street and had a wonderful tour of the Seattle Library, then walked down the street to the Pike Market and up the street to the Frye Museum. Staff very pleasant. Room was also pretty small for the three of us (adult couple and teenage daughter). Coffee shop in the lobby was good for quick continental breakfast.

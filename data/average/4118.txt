The location is the real draw here. You are just a few minutes easy walk from the most popular sights. The aquarium is next door, and many of the sightseeing boats are docked on Long Wharf. The North End with lots of great restaurants is also an easy walk. This was the best thing about the hotel. Overall the hotel is pretty nice. Rooms have been recently updated, but are standard issue Marriott decor. I swear they use the exact same furniture in every hotel. The bathroom in our particular room was nice enough but tiny. There was no way for two people to be in the bathroom at once, which could be tough for a family. In fact one person would barely have room to move. The entire hotel is being renovated as other reviewers have noted. The lobby itself looked almost done, but there is still a lot of very noisy work going on. Think jackhammers at 8am. Speaking of noise, there is one huge problem with the hotel's design in this regard. This is what would make me not come back. The hotel is built with a center atrium that tends to funnel noise up into the rooms. We were on the 4th floor and while inside the room I could hear clinking china and normal conversation from a meeting on the ground floor. I could only imagine the noise from something like a wedding. Not what I'd want late at night after a busy day of sightseeing. Overall the property is fine, but think carefully about your needs and the sort of schedule you would keep. There are a lot of other hotels around.

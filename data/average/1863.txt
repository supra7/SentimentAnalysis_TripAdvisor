Hello everyone. The only reason I can think of that people are raving about this hotel is that they didn't go to the hyatt in kauai first. Once you have been this hotel is not that great. The pool area of this hotel was so crowded you have to step over people to get to a chair. There was someone elses pills on the floor of our room on checkin and we had a rude checkin person who was not helpful at all. Had to wait one half hour each day for the breakfast buffet(and that was just to get a table). When you have been to they Hyatt in Kauai you have found a piece of heaven. The hyatt maui doesn't even come close in comparison. We visited south maui and that seems to be the place to stay. West Maui is just to crowded for me. I am sure if we had only stayed at the hyatt maui i wouldn't be as critical but if you insist on staying there and going to kauai as well definitely stay at the hyatt maui first before going onto to the kauai hyatt. We will never return to the hyatt maui again but will only stay at the hyatt in kauai. If you have any other questions email me at marshall531@hotmail. com. We just returned home 48 hours ago so the experience is still very fresh in my mind. Thanks for listening.

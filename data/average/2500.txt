I have stayed at three hotels near the Montreal airport: the Aloft, Sheraton and Novotel and Aloft. Aloft is equivalent to the Novotel in terms of the room size, style and soundproofing (minimalist) Quite nice and appealing to me. The Sheraton is more like you would expect a normal hotel room to be like. Where the Aloft fails to impress is on the food side. I arrived early evening and there was nothing in terms of restaurants only a refrigerator in the recption with salad and drinks and a bar with snacks. There is also a smoothy bar (closed at night) which I assume is for breakfast. I actually walked the 200 feet across the road to the Sheraton for food. If you want to eat a meal when you arrive and a nice room skip Aloft and head to Novotel where the food is exceptional. It's worth the drive around he other side of the airport. If you just need a nice room to crash in that is very close to the airport terminal Aloft is fine.

We just stayed three nights at the Westin in DT Seattle. Really a great location but the hotel itself is tired. Carpet in the room stained and worn, shower has very little pressure. The beds are still good, nice view. Three out of four conciere were not very helpful and you could tell they either got some form of kick back from recommended restaurants or had some incentive. I asked about non chain medium priced values near the hotel and she handed me a coupon book and suggested a chain. We found places on our own and had done research previous to arriving but thought there might be some "gems" they could suggest. Parking is another issue, $36 per day for self park ouch! Staff overall was good, I got more help and suggestions from the front desk then the conciere.

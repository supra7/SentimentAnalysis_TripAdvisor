I stayed for four nights in the hotel in late October. I was concerned after reading some of the earlier reviews. On arrival in the hotel the lobby resembled a train station, a conference group were checking in - once we got to reception the staff were very efficient. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean the only issue was the paper thin walls. It would also be a good idea for the hotel to provide tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. The hotel is very central; Michigan Avenue, State Street and the Navy Pier are all within walking distance. I would have no hesitation with recommending this hotel in particular for the magnificent lobby a great place to watch the world go by!! Staff are helpful, bar food limited but good, location excellent. Ceilings in the lobby are magnificent only issue is the lack of sound proofing in the rooms.

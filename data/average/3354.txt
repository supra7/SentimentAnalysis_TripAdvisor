15 minute walk from shinjuku train station Upon getting off the narita express at the Shinjuku station, it took us a while to find the West exitThis is because the design of the train station, upon exiting the turn styles, you'll still have to struggle to find the exit.Unlike the East side exits.Anyway, we found the epson neon sign and walked ahead.it will be 10 minutes walk from there. Too bad we got there at around 10 pm.we found the hotel afterwards, it's not very visible from the main streets until you go around the corner.There's a huge 7-11 downstairs, which is very convenient.at the time of our arrival the staff had retreated to basement, where the hot spring is. they were a bit understaffed. Yet, they were very hard working and we checked in in no time.No keys, just digital locks.upon entry to our room, we were greeted by cigarette smells.... I didn't like it.Turned on the air con at full blast, the smell was gone in no time.Space is tight in Japan, but this was a lot tighter than I expected; the room is about 2 feet larger than the bed in both dimensions.Well, what do you expect for the price and a 3 star categoried hotel.Washroom provided basic stuff.It was, at least, close to the Shinjuku area; yet next time, i'd prefer a hotel at the East side, where all the action are.For this hotel, it's what you get for the price, and nothing more or less.

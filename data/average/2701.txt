I recently stayed at this hotel with a friend to enjoy a relaxing day away while on vacation. I had made a reservation online and had noted my preferences. I had requested an early check in. I arrived about 2pm and was told my room was not available. They took my name and phone number and stated that they would call me when avilable. I understand that its a big city and rooms are sometimes in high demand. I checked my bags at the Front desk and went across the street to Harry Carays. I returned to the hotel at about 345pm and the room was still not available. I waited in the lobby and reapproached the Front desk at 4pm which I believe is either past the check in time or is the check in time. Finally they acknowledged me and got me a room. The Spa ( hot tub ) was out of service. I was told it would be ready in one hour and that never happened. I never ended up being able to enjoy it. The swimming pool liner appeared to be lifting up from the bottom. I thought it probably needed some immidiate service. Anyways, the room itself was modern and clean. The location was pretty good. The best part of this hotel was the price. Certainly not one of my best experiences with a Marriott property. However, the breakfast was good and was available 30 minutes prior than the time advertised. This was much appreciated. Upon checking out, I was never asked how my stay was. I believe that this should be a golden rule of the hospitality industry. Perhaps I am wrong. Overall, I would have to rate this hotel " fair to partly cloudy" in comparison to many other Marriott hotels that I have stayed at.

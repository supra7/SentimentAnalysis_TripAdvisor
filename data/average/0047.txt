The Warwick hotel was in a fabulous location. It was walking distance from the Space Needle and Pike Market. The problem with the hotel is that it looks like it has not been updated in several decades. The decor is very dated, the rooms still have tube televisions, and it has an old feel to it. The hotel is clean, so there are no complaints there. I would recommend staying here if you are on a budget, but otherwise, I would say head elsewhere.

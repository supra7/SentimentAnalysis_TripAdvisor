We stayed at the W Seattle and were thoroughly unimpressed. The hotel staff was excellent and very accomondating. The rooms were nice. However, having stayed at other W hotels, I was hoping for a more fun, happening hotel. The hotel seemed empty most of the weekend we were there. The bar is nice, but pales in comparison to other W hotel bars we have stayed at. Overall, I would not go out of my way to stay here. Don't get me wrong. It is a nice hotel. But.. just not what I had expected.

I was looking forward to stay at this landmark hotel, and certainly the lobby is magnificent, so when i checked in I expected the grandeur to continue into the rooms :-( My room was very very average, no tea or coffee facilities, and old tv, no mini bar, no amenities, only soap no shower gel, no coton buds, just normal things you'll normally find in a hotel of that standard. Next time i'm in chicago i won't come back to palmer house, the Marriott on Magnificent mile was much better value for money, and better appointed.

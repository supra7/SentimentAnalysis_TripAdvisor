Across from University Village (Mall) and near the University of Washington, the Travelodge is probably the most reasonably priced motel in the neighborhood, but we have watched it slowly go downhill the last few years we have stayed there. The rooms are typical in size and furnishings, and are clean for the most part, but, wear and tear is becoming more obvious: there were hooks for pictures on the walls, but one picture was missing. Similar hooks remained in the wall for a bedside lamp, but it had been replaced with a table lamp. The corners of the bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned recently. The pool and hot tub are not open. There are cracks walls. Still the location is great and there is (limited) free parking. The breakfast room is tiny and therefore crowded. The breakfast is very limited. A few annoying things include a charge daily for the safe in the room even if, like us, it is not used. The phone also has to be set up by the front desk for "800 number" calls, something that is not apparent unless you ask after getting continued busy signals. Yet the staff is accommodating and the location is very good.

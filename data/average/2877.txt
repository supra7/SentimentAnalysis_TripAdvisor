I didn't read the reviews before getting a room at the downtown Memphis Downtown Super8 (I chose it because it was $45) , but now that I have, I wonder if we're talking about the same place. My room is clean, no bloodstains, no monsters or anything else unpleasant in the bathroom, the coffee machine, a/c, tv and internet all work (one set of plugs seems not to be), the check-in lass was nice (but I did encounter another who seemed, um, very dim). My only problem was in finding this place, as I came in on Highway 72, thinking it couldn't be that hard to find. I had to follow their instructions to the letter i.e. find I-55 and get on it to find the hotel. I drove through various dodgy looking areas before I did that, and the area around the hotel has provided no threat. I like the old building out the window, and can't hear traffic or train noises. Oh, and the pool looks lovely.

Compared to other, newer hotel properties in the area, the Renaissance is falling behind, without much hope of catching up. Its location, on the edge of downtown, right next to the freeway. If you have a room on that side of the hotel, the noise is easily discernible. The rooms are fine, very much up to Renaissance's standards. However, I won't be back, unless the room deal is too good to pass up. One last note . . . The evening desk jockey is way, way too annoying and discourteous. Witness: After checking in around midnight, I get a call from him at 12:30 a.m., when I'm already in bed, asking about the room. I understand that's what his book tells him he's supposed to do, but 12:30 a.m.? Really?

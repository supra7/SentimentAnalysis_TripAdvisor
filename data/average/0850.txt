I attended a seminar hosted at Westin, and decided to stay there to make things easy. The meeting rooms were great (and the associated food & staff service). However, many things in the hotel look "worn out." My room had stained carpet, the TV audio was marginal (not a big deal) and it was fairly loud at night. It's a great location and the staff were very helpful. I was just a little surprised at how run down the hotel looked.

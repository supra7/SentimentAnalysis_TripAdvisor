The Intercontinental Addison is a pretty hotel in a great location - hard to beat the dining selections available within a mile of the hotel...perhaps hundreds. But we had a number of issues, most especially the temperature. The ballroom hovered around 65 degrees for our two days of meetings, fine for some but cold for others. The exhibit hall never got below 80, which made for uncomfortable days. In both cases, the hotel management told us they would "work on it, but this is usually what it is like in the summer." Look, your hotel is in Texas. Texas gets hot in the summer. If you are going to host conventions and meetings, wouldn't you figure out how to make areas comfortable? The problems weren't limited to the common areas. Of my group's fourteen rooms, only four or five were cool enough for comfort. The A/C kept cranking, but never got really cold air out. That's a problem. That said, the in-hotel Starbucks is a nice touch, and the hotel bar is reasonably comfortable, though lacking a wide selection of finer liquor options. Free parking is also a huge plus. A note on this, too: the free spaces filled up by 9 a.m., leaving only the $10 garage. By 5 p.m., there were plenty of spaces. If free parking is full, consider springing for the $18 valet because the garage isn't come-and-go. If you leave even one time during the day, the valet option just paid for itself. Plus the garage is a bit of a walk, whereas the valet is at the front entrance. I'd stay there again, but not during summer months.

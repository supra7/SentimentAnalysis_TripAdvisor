Close to everything Kennedy as well as several good restaurants and other attractions. The only time we took a cab was to and from the airport - - we were able to walk everywhere else we wanted to go. Positives were historic look, clean rooms, friendly staff, cookies and milk served each night and complimentary breakfast. Areas that could be improved were the fitness room (the tread mills do not turn on easily) and the elevator (only one small one for all guests to share).

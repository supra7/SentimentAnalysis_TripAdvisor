The Monaco is a very nice and comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. The staff is not as "friendly" as some described, though - we found them rather "professionally friendly", some even a bit smug (the concierge and one tall front desk guy). We got a good deal and paid only 180$ per night. But if I had to pay 250-300$ (their regular rates) I would find it too expensive. On the other hand chicago is an expensive city, when it comes to hotels... *Important*: if you book the hotel, make sure to book a room to the street (on a high floor). We had a room to the back, where you have no street noise, but a constant "humming" sound from the ventilation system of the parking garage on the back alley -een on 12th floor and with closed windows. This can really get on your nerves, especially at night. First we thought the sound came from the air condition in our room - until we realized that it was turned off... And don't make long distance calls from the room! For a 2 minute call we paid more than 20$ - a shameless rip off. These 2 things cost the Monaco points. Nevertheless I would recommend the Monaco any time - if you can get the "right" room!

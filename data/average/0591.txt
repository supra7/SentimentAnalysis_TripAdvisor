Stayed at the Sheraton Labor Day long weekend and was pleased all-around. The location is EXCELLENT! I usually stay at the Vintage Park when visiting, but for some reason, the rates were pretty high and I found a very good rate of $169/night through their website for a room in the Union Tower. For that price, I was pretty satisfied. I usually dread sleeping away from home as I own a Presidential Plaza bed, but I gotta say the beds at this hotel were pretty damn comfortable and cozy! Only complaint I had was the room service food - OVERPRICED and GROSS! Also, the valet parking was $35/night, but I knew that before booking, so I decided to fly down instead and drive back up with some friends. The service is satisfactory, but not at all bad. If I could get the same rate of $169/night the next time, I will definitely be returning here on my next visit!

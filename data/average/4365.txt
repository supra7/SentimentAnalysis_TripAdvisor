Stayed here last weekend on a date night - kids were with their grandparents and we had a voucher for Abe and Louie's so figured we'd stay in town. We made the reservation via Priceline and I am so glad we did not pay full price ($300+) First impressions: The lobby needs to be cleaned. The gentleman who checked us in and the valet were both helpful and professional. Our room: Second floor with limited natural light, and small. We had a queen sized bed. It was dark when we arrived so it was nice to look up at the lights from the neighboring tall buildings. It reminded me of some mid town Manhattan hotels that we stayed in. My husband did not sleep well. The air-con kicked on at regular intervals and fair to say it wheezed. The next morning, with the lights supplemented by daylight, we saw how grimy the room was. The dust was so thick on one piece of furniture that my husband was able to write "Clean me" in the dust. When we checked out, I mentioned it to the reservations clerk. He clearly did not care. The location is great. It cost $46 to valet our car overnight. Would I stay there again? Heck, no. I'm so glad we got a cheap rate on Priceline.

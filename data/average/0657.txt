I first wanted to comment on another review given for this hotel. The parking is not free. There is a $10 dollar charge per night if you want to park in their lot. Another comment relating to other reviews given here: if you can get this place for as low as $66 or $80 a night it is well worth it. We ended up paying $180 since it was short notice stay on a weekend and didn't have an easy time finding a hotel with vacancy. The hotel itself is nice for a low to mid range hotel. The staff is helpful and courteous. They even accomidated a middle of the night request for silverware brought to our room. The rooms were quite clean and the furnishings were in good condition and of moderate quality. They have a fitness room, offered to guests free of charge, which i took advantage of. This room had 3 different machines (bike, eliptical, and treadmill). I'm not much for bikes but tried the elliptical and the treadmill. the elliptical didn't seem to work quite right but the treadmill was adequate. All the equipment seemed a bit dated, likely from the 90's. The treadmill was in good solid working condition although I can't state the condition of the other two. I'm not sure if the fact that I am in great need for a new matress in my own bed at home or if the bed i slept in at this hotel were as exceptional as it seemed. I slept like a baby though. This is saying something too because the walls in this hotel were thin and the windows were alluminum. You could hear police sirens at all hours of the day and night. This didn't bother me so much but if you are looking for a bit more luxury try another hotel. The food at the restraunt was delicious. We ate in the lounge and the ambience and atmosphere was very cozy. Really if it weren't for the high cost of the room i would be completely satisfied. I would stay here again if I recieved a better value. It's literally a block away from westlake mall and many other local attractions.

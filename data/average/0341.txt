We spent two nights and three days in Seattle at the Executive Pacific. WE found the rooms small, but clean and comfortable. Considering the downtown location, we thought it was very good value. The hotel is withing reasonable walkign distance to all the downtown attractions, inculding staduims, Pike Place, Pioneer Square and the waterfront. There is lots of shopping close by and plenty of restaurants for any taste. We took advantage of the hotel's valet parking whilw we were there and unfortunately our vehicle was broken into. The staff handled the situation very professionally, making sure the broken glass was vaccuumed out and comping our room. Despite the problem we left well satisfied

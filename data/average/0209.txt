Overall, based on the previous reviews, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was clean, and the walk-in closet and kitchenette were nice bonuses. The staff was ridiculously nice and helpful. However, the location was only so-so--far from downtown, though the neighborhood itself had some nice bars and restaurants and the proximity to the space needle was kind of neat. The continental breakfast was pretty sparse, and the mattress was the opposite of comfortable. The shower was more appropriate for guests under five feet tall. The price was right, so we would stay there again, but it's not the kind of place in which we want to hang out a lot in the room.

The hotel itself was in the heart of downtown, so for the price, it was great. However, i hate to be "nickle and dimed" for everything. The major flaw was the valet parking at $28.00 a day, a daily charge of $9.95 for internet service, and the biggest flaw was the heat. The thermostat would not go below 65 degrees, well some of you might think that is cool enough, but not on the 19th floor. There was no cross air, so it was warm adn stuffy. Also the vent was about 1 foot by 1 foot, so not much area to blow cool out from either. The room became a sauna when showering, so if you styled your hair, it would be ruined from all the moist heat and no fan in the bathroom. also this hotel is rated as a 4 star, which I highly doubt and even the quality linens they advertise were sheets that you could see though, no fitted bottom sheet, so we were fighting the mattress pad all night, and their towels had holes! That is not a 4 star hotel.

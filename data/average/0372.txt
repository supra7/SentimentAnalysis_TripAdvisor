We got a last minute deal at this 4 star hotel, and while the room itself was very nice, we were not very satisfied with our experience. It was a bit of a walk from the downtown core, the hotel parking costs were double that of a 3 1/2 star hotel, and there was an extra charge for wifi in our room. It was a busy weekend, and it took forever to get anywhere in the elevators (there are 6) due to long waits for an elevator, then to multiple stops on each trip. In addition, our car had to be valet-parked offsite as it was "overheight" (it was over 6'2"), and they left it on the street outside the hotel entrance for over 5 hours at night as they were "very busy" and "hadn't had time to take it" over to to other garage. IT only got moved after we brought it to their attention. We won't be going back to this hotel, as we have stayed just as nice rooms in Seattle for the same price with a more suitable slate of options.

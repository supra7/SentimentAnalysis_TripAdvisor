We stayed here for 3 nights in Oct & for the price we payed we got pretty much as we expected, a clean basic room that was more than comfortable for our stay. We got a room facing the railway & it in no way affected our sleep (we even took earplugs after reading reviews & they weren't needed). My only downside was the location, we had to get the subway to get to most places of interest & that proved to be quite confusing on several occasion, however once you get used to it, it does get easier. If you are looking for a basic reasonably priced hotel for a break in NYC this is for you, if your are looking for luxury hotel with all the frills look elsewhere.

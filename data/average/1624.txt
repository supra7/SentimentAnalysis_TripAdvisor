We visited El Dorado Maroma July 27-31, 2011 In all probability, we will not be back. We booked our room at the El Dorado Maroma in June of 2011 by phone using a Travel Agent discount. We contract large blocks of rooms in hotels for conferences and incentive trips and we had really hoped EDM would be a location we could use for incentive trips. We never book properties sight unseen, so this was a fact-finding mission for us. I'm sad to say that we will not be using El Dorado Maroma. As our business relies on us trusting our venues, we had grave concerns about promises made and not kept by Karisma, whether verbally given or in written confirmations. Our issues began before we arrived. I spent hours on the phone one day in June with a "Cheryl Woolward" getting her all of the documentation Karisma requires for a TA discounted stay agreement. After spending most of an afternoon getting through an amazing amount of red tape, "Cheryl" finally told me she had everything they needed. When I received the emailed .pdf confirmation, it included comped ground transportation to the resort from the airport. For the next 3 weeks I received an email a day from KHRreservations telling me that they needed our flight information to schedule our shuttle. I was unable to log in to their system using the link provided, so on July 15th I finally responded to the email with our itinerary and asked for a confirmation. I never heard back from them. On July 26th, my husband, Gary, called the number I had used in June to talk to 'Cheryl'. The woman who answered had a heavy Hispanic accent. She identified herself as "Cheryl Woolward" - but this was not the same voice as the woman I had worked with in June. When we asked if she had received the itinerary, 'new Cheryl' told us that they would not be including the shuttle transportation. The conversation went nowhere. Eventually we were told that we could pay for shuttle vouchers over the phone or could figure out a way to get the resort by ourselves when we got to Cancun. (~argh~) I was ready to cancel the trip - 'new Cheryl's' attitude made me more than a bit apprehensive - and angry. We had paid for the entire stay in advance, though and we couldn't get any kind of refund on our airfare, so we decided to try to make the best of the trip. ______ Wednesday, July 27 - Arrival Day When we arrived we were asked to sit down at the front desk and manually fill out more forms, including an unreadable full page, 3 point text in gray on the back of the form. I told the the clerk, Sheridan, that there was no way that I could read the text. I was met with silence as she handed me a pen. I signed (and prayed.) After checking in, we were given a tour of the property. Tropical Storm Don was off the coast, the wind was whipping and the skies were spitting. I literally laughed out loud when we were taken out to the beach and told 'this is the beach'. We were getting wet, our clothes and hair being whipped around by the wind, but by golly, we learned where the beach was! I only wish we had been given a tour of our room. It was two days before we knew that there was a remote control for the AC or that there was a mini-bar (part of the all-inclusive) in our room. My suggestion to Karisma: Unless asked - skip the property tour and have the bellmen demonstrate all of the important aspects of the room. The first thing most people want to do after spending a day traveling, is to get to their room and freshen up. Knowing where everything is and how it works is much more helpful to your guests than showing them the hurricane coming in on the beach. Thursday, July 28 - Day 2 We were awakened on our first day to the sound of banging pipes. It sounded like someone was trying to remove plumbing from the wall next to the head of our bed. The banging would last for a minute or two and then stop for ten minutes or so. Each time we thought they must be done. Since we are self-employed, we need to work wherever we may be. After traveling on Wednesday, we were behind in our work, so we plowed on, doing our best to ignore the noise. By 10 am, it was impossible to ignore and I had had enough. I walked down to the front lobby and met Ariel sitting behind the desk. I explained the situation to him and asked him to be moved. He checked his computer and told me that a 'honeymoon suite' was available in 742 - three floors above our room, 712. He told me that there would be no charge for the upgrade. I walked back to our room and continued the climb up to 742. I was very winded by the time I reached the top and realized this was not a trek I wanted to make several times a day. I went back down to our room, explained the situation to my husband, Gary, and called Ariel back. Gary asked if there were anything farther away from the noise (which we had determined by now was coming from 801 - and that the noise would be as bad in 742 as it shared the same wall that we did with 801). Eventually Ariel called back and said that they had nothing available that day, but would have 322 available on the next morning, Friday. After talking it over, we decided that we could leave the room for the rest of Thursday if we could move on Friday morning and told Ariel that that would work. Later we were sitting on the beach and Ariel came by to ask if we had moved yet. We reminded him that he had said that 322 wasn't available until the next day. He looked a bit confused. I asked him if he had confirmed that we would be moving into 322. He said, "Yes, sure." As he walked away from us he picked up his Nextel and started speaking into it. I should have known then... Friday, July 29 - Day 3 We were awakened to the banging once again. We believed the annoyance would be short-lived, though, so as I happily packed up our room, Gary walked to the front desk to make the arrangements for our move to 322. Sheridan was now at the front desk and she had no record of our noise complaint nor of a promise of a move. She said that Ariel was working that day but refused to call him. And of course - 322 was no longer available - as she had promised it to someone else. They had not yet moved in, but she had promised it, and she wasn't budging. She told Gary to come back in half an hour and she would do what she could to find another available room away from the noise. Gary ran a few errands and returned, only to be told that the only other rooms available were downgrades - that would be made available to us without refunds. The downgraded rooms are on the first or second floor (many reviews warn against these rooms) and open onto the bar area, not private and not quiet. (We later met another guest on the beach who had been in the front area printing a boarding pass and had witnessed this scene - she was as shocked as we were.) Gary returned to our room and after another hour of trying to work with banging pipes, called down and asked if they could simply halt the construction in 801 until we were gone. Whoever answered told him they would "Try". Needless to say, the banging never did stop during the day. Saturday, Day 4 BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. Same song, different day. If there were public areas to go - a coffee shop or even a lobby that had internet access, we would have gladly moved just to get some work done. The property is VERY small and no such public areas exist. Unfortunately, these events clouded our experience of a property that otherwise has a very friendly and hospitable staff. Saturday night was our last night, so we stopped by the desk to make arrangements for tips to be charged to our credit card (Don't ask why, but we had come to Mexico with no cash...) Sheridan asked if she could do anything else for us. We asked for a 5:45 am wake up call and coffee room service for 6:30 the next morning, as we had a 7 am departure shuttle. Sunday, July 31st - Departure Day At 6:25 the next morning we both woke up with a start - realizing that our wake up call had not come. Coffee and breakfast arrived right on time, but we were so busy rushing to get ready we didn't have time to partake. ::sigh:: ____________________________ THE GOOD LOCATION - amazingly quiet and beautiful beach, right next to the marina. Our afternoons at the beach almost made up for the banging we endured until almost noon each day. THE STAFF - The front desk and reservation office personnel aside - the rest of the staff is wonderfully hospitable and service oriented. Cindy met us every night at Sabores and Kiyoko, greeting us by name. Emilio remembered not only my name, but my drink - and fixed them beautifully each and every time. Linda, Luis and Diego provided attentive and efficient drink service to us on the beach. THE BED - beautifully made up with flowers and towel animals every day; the mattress was thick and firm and was very comfortable. We slept well every night. HOUSEKEEPING - our room, with the exception of the infinity pool, was immaculately kept. GARDENS AND PUBLIC AREAS - The grounds were beautifully kept. SABORES SPECIALTY RESTAURANT - The Mayan trio, the Soprano on Italian night and the Mariachi band were all talented and fun additions to each specialty meal. ___________________ ___________________ THE BAD ___________________ ROOM - aside from the noise, our room was very dark. The infinity pool was not filled (about a foot shy from the top) and therefore didn't spill over creating the infinity effect. I think this also affected the filtering - as the two spouts that should have been pouring water into the pool were never turned on. As a result, we had a large body of stagnant water on our deck. Clouds of green and brown mold occupied parts of the pool and plenty of dead bugs floated on top. All I could think about when looking at it was 'mosquito breeding grounds'. On our last full day, someone came in to clean the pool. When he left, I excitedly put on my bathing suit and spent no time jumping in - and jumped back out again. He had added water and the bugs were gone, but the filter was still not turned on and the mold was still very much present. _____ There was also an unpleasant odor in our room (I found myself saying "What IS THAT SMELL?" each time we entered.) The housekeeper sprayed something pleasant every time the room was serviced - twice a day, but the treatment was short lived and by mid-afternoon the smell was back. The inside shower in our room did not drain. (Maybe this was the problem with the pipes they were trying to fix?) I used the outside shower and enjoyed it until it started raining - which caused water to run off of a wall from the next floor up, jutting out over our shower. The water collected grit along the way and dumped the cold mixture directly onto my head. EEEEEEEeeee... _____________ YMMV - (YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY) or IT IS WHAT IT IS... Karisma advertises "Gourmet Inclusive" - We found the food to be OK, but not spectacular. On several occasions, what was served didn't come close to the description on the menu - a seafood cocktail was described as a mixture of shellfish in a light garlic / olive oil dressing was actually several small (think canned) shrimp in a sea of tomato sauce, topped with a dollop of guacamole. The presentation of the food was almost without exception, well executed. The taste was not always a pleasant surprise. The BBQ chicken served at lunch, for instance was extremely fatty. A tenderloin steak I ordered medium rare came out all but completely raw. TOPLESS BEACH As others have mentioned, the beach is clothing optional. If I had as beautiful a body as those going topless, I'd have shed mine as well. I was hoping to avoid sending people screaming and running from the beach, though, so I my top stayed up. The nudity did not bother us - YMMV. 24 HOUR ROOM SERVICE - We ordered breakfast from the room service menu on our first morning - all 6 options include toast, pastries, juice, coffee and fruit. The pastries and fruit were fresh and unique. Very tasty. The omelets were also well prepared and tasty. The toast was a crouton. Is this a cultural thing? It was as if it had been baked all night long in a very low oven. The menu after breakfast is very limited. Your choices consist of a Chicken Burrito, a Club Sandwich, a Hamburger or a Hot Dog. _______ TIDBITS ________ JET SKIS - who knew? You really should be in pretty good shape to jet ski. I had a terrible time controlling the steering - especially in deeper waters. Had I been warned, I would have chosen a speed boat tour. I was sore for two days after one half hour stint. ROUCH! (Gary had a GREAT time. But he does 75 push-ups every other morning and had NO trouble steering... :o/) ________ PREPARE TO CLIMB - Obviously ADA is a USA law, but I was surprised by how IN-accessible much of this property is. There are no elevators anywhere, but steps do abound. ________ BRING CASH - there is no ATM at the El Dorado Maroma and the front desk will not cash checks or advance cash on a credit card - the cab ride into Playa is a minimum of $25. On our last day we were allowed to charge $175 for gratuities to our credit card. This required me to take notes on my phone of every bartender, server, housekeeper and bellman. It would have been SO much easier to have been able to tip as we went. Related: DON'T EXCHANGE YOUR CASH AT THE AIRPORT The exchange rate at the airport was 9.48 pesos to the dollar. We were told that the exchange rate at most hotels was 10.50-11.35 on that particular day. I don't know if you can exchange cash at El Dorado Maroma - as we had none to exchange. Sheridan had made a point of telling us that they had no cash at the front desk, so my guess is that those hoping to exchange money are in the same situation as those of us looking for an ATM. I did notice others tipping with US Dollars, however, and none were turned down. __________ AVOID THE "GREETERS" IN THE AIRPORT - After getting your luggage and leaving the customs area, just passed the money exchange, before you can get out the door you are met with a horde of people dressed in light blue shirts, tan pants or skirts and tan ties. The signs on both sides say something along the lines of "Information". BEWARE - these folks are there to sign you up for time share tours. We were roped in - we had been told to look for Lomas Travel reps wearing teal shirts and white pants. The pale blue and khaki confused us. Ay-yi-yi. It took several adament 'No's to get away...

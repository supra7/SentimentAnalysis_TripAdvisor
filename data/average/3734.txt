This was my second stay at the Magnolia - several years apart. I remember it being very chic but comfortable with a warm and friendly staff. Well, I was quite a bit less impressed the second time around. Check-in was quick and informative, very friendly staff. Upon entering my room (26th floor corner) I noticed the carpet outside the bathroom was soaked. I called guest services who told me the previous guest had run the water over in the bathroom and the carpet had not dried. When I asked for a new room, they were unable to provide it because they were booked. They brought extra bathmats to put over the wet carpet. Not exactly a great fix, but it was better than nothing. Beyond that problem, there were two light bulbs out, a huge tear in the bed cover and the floor tile and bases were all dirty. It just doesn't seem that they are keeping this place clean. Everything feels really used and banged up. I was put into a suite for my second nights stay and the staff was very friendly and helpful about everything. It really is a shame they aren't keeping it clean and pristine, the way a hotel should be. Breakfast and cookies/milk are fantastic.

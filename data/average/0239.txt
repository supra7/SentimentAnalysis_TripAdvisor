I chose the Mayflower Park carefully on the basis of reviews, for a week's stay in Seattle to visit our son at Uni and to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. We were looking forward to old fashioned charm and good service. Instead, we got a poky room with thin walls between the humming ice machine and the elevator with an air con system that rattled so much we had to turn it off before we went to bed! The bathroom was so small we could hardly turn round with the door closed ( we are both slim!) it was tatty and the shower-or rather the tap in the walll above the bath) was woefully inadequate. Our check in should have warned us. It was stiff, unfriendly and were were obviously just a bit of a nuisance. I had written to the hotel before our stay telling them about our celebrations and asking if they could just put a note on my husband's pillow ( 'The best husband in the world sleeps here') or something similar. They claimed not to have received my e mail and had no knowledge of a similar note added to our booking form and couldn't care less that our room and the lack of attention has spoiled the stay for me even before it started. I commented in a disappointed way rather than complain as I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my husband. But there was no apology-just defensiveness. We were rather begrudgingly given a free drink in the bar as compensation. The bar, however, ( Olivers) is fabulous-best martini ever. The staff here were friendly and delightful and the restaurant was great. The hotel is also very central-right next to the Westlake Centre and transport links. We made the best of the room as it was obvious that there was no point in commenting further and I didn't want to spoil our trip. But we came to the conclusion that The Mayflower does not want to know you unless you have paid top prices for their best rooms. We just felt as if we were there to fill the gap. Very, very disappointing.

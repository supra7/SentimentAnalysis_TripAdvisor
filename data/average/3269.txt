Very central location and 30 second walk to the metro station Sevilla. There is a Starbucks across the street. Efficient check in and friendly helpful staff. Rooms were modern, boutique style. Shower was adequate but body jet were not much use for me as I am a bit short and I ended up with my faced being blasted with water. Good water pressure and big shower. No sound proofing in the room. I was at the end of the second floor and was woken up each morning with the doors banging shut, maids cleaning or traffic outside. Beds were very hard. Too hard for me. Air con was in a timer in my room. It would go off during the night and I would wake up very hot. Switch it on and then it would go off again. I was in a group and this was mentioned by other members of my group who had other rooms. Didn't enjoy breakfast at all. There was adequate selection, but nothing special. Not sure if I will return as there are plenty hotels in the area where the soundproofing would be better.

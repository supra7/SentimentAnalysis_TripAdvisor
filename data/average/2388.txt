i've been to hk a couple of times already, and i will totally not recommend this hotel especially if you're traveling with children or older people due to it's location-unless of course if your purpose of travel is just within the area, then u ought to be in this hotel. the hotel's location is too far from almost everything! even the nearest MTR station that is the only reasonable thing that could get u around the whole of HK would require a lot of your energy to get there. would be nice to do the walking of course, good for everyone's health, but when you're on a strict schedule, especially tourists, who wouldn't wanna miss a second of their time, this is not the place for you! the hotel itself is really good, free internet! i've stayed on another newton hotel that is in kowloon, and they are equally nice. i've no complaints. service is good, people at the reception are accomodating in general, there's just one who got a little frustrated coz she can't explain herself well in english lol which is quite understandable, since i get a little frustrated myself when i don't get the answer to my question, but the hotel in general is good. would not stay in this hotel in my future trips to HK again, as nice as the hotel staffs could be, the place is just not right for me.

These apartments are an old block which has been converted into holiday accommodation the tiles need replacing and the entrance to the lifts were dirty.room was ok for the price old tired furniture leaking fridge en suite bathroom was flooded dont know how fairly clean otherwise very uncomfortable worn out sleeper couch not suitable for an adult.basic Indian breakfast lots of basement parking used our own vehicle so didnt walk to the mall very far out of town the traffic is a nightmare so I would prefer to pay an extra Dhs 100 and get accommodation in Diera/Bur Dubai areas.kitchen cupboards and fridge inside were dirty preferred not to use the kitchen .was disappointed and misled by the net pics will not stay in Barsha area ever again

I stayed at the Sheraton for five days with two children (ages 9 & 10) while visiting Seattle. The room was small-to-average, and the beds were comfy. Staff was pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary in a positive or negative way. The city view was nice, and the pool on the 35th floor had a nice view of some nesting eagles on a nearby building. The pool, however, had a very strong smell of chlorine, and I suspect the chemical balance was off the day we used it. The best part about the stay was the single-serve Starbucks coffee maker in the room, and the easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and public transportation. The worst was feeling nickel-and-dimed on the parking (valet only, approx. $45/day when fees & tips are included), and the internet ($9.95/day for a service that I feel should be free). Also, the television was typcial of the hotels that vend movies these days - impossible to determine current program listings, because the only menu keeps spitting you out at the movies for purchase. While I know these practices are typical of many upscale hotel establishments, I have stayed at many that don't make you feel that their private motto is "whatever the market will bear". This was not one of those.

The exterior of the hotel is old but inside looks like a Westin. The layout of the rooms are a bit odd because of the round structure of the building. I don't understand why you have to put the TV on the side of the bed. My husband was getting a cramp on his neck from watching TV. The bed was excellent as usual. The bathroom is a bit tight. We just stayed here for one night so it was all right. Because my sister-in-law works for Westin, we got Starhot rate, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for it. Great location, but parking is expensive. I think next time I would stay out of downtown since our destination is Portland.

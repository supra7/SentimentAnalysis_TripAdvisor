Booked this room for two week nights while in Boston on business. The room was not nearly as nice as rooms / hotels I've stayed in for half the price. The carpet had some nasty stain on it which had hardened. There was a desk chair in the room if you want to call it that. It was made of fabric, which also was stained and was what I'd consider the kind of chair I'd put in one of my children's room. The mattresses on the bed I slept in felt cheap and had poor support. In what are considered middle of the road rooms, I've typically had the use of a microwave and an in room safe, as well as a free breakfast, but not at this hotel. If this is how it is to stay at a 5 star hotel, thanks anyway, I'll pass.

The staff were very friendly. The rooms were very small. They kept having difficulties such as no wifi, no internet, no tv, and the safe didn't work one night. They were slow to fix these problems. The biggest problem however, is that every Friday and Saturday night the hotel becomes an all-night disco, so it is impossible to sleep here. The location is great. The hotel has no tourist info, not even a map of the local area.

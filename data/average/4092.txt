I usually start by telling everyone that we love Marriotts and stay at these hotels often. Having said that,this one was a bit of a disappointment. We were in town for a concert on the 23rd. We booked two nights and I had always wanted to stay at this property. It was just ok. The reception area seemed outdated. We didn't have any trouble with the elevators,but the hallways felt like I was in a Courtyard Marriott from 1978. The room was just as bad. Clean,nondescript,small bathroom. Clean,nondescript room. Very comfy bed with nice linens. The bed and the view were great. The best part actually! But we paid extra for that nice view. We could see Logan and the River. One morning we watched the sunrise. We ordered room service one night and it was good,the server professional. Both nights we went out,we had to hail our own cab. Not a problem,but bellman standing about......I don't know,thats why I go to a hotel for a getaway!!!!! To have someone else do it for me!!!! I'm paying for it! I wasn't even going to review our stay,it was so underwhelming. Then I read a few others and I agreed with almost everything. Usually I defend Marriott to the hilt,but this time I have to agree, it was just ok. I didn't pay full price,I would never pay full price here,as a matter of fact,I probably won't be staying at this Marriott again. Only book with a big discount.

We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in November. It is situated outside the city center, in a neighborhood being renovated (not far frrm the old olympic village), where some industrial buildings can still be seen. Theres a metro station 5 mins away (count with 15 mins to reach Catalunya station) and 15 mins from the beach. The rooms are typical Holiday Inn standard, comfortable and clean. Staff was professional but a little cold. Breakfast, which was included in the daily rate, was good with variety of pastry, cereals, fresh fruit and eggs. If youre looking for decent accommodation and do not require central location, this hotel offers a good good value for money

I had not been to Kaanapali beach in over 20 years. So for my 4 day stay in March, 2011, I chose the Kaanapali Beach Hotel (KBH). It is located at the northern end of the hotels lining Kaanapali Beach - in between the Sheraton (to the north) and the Kaanapali Alii to the south. The hotel's location is good; easy walking distance to Whaler's Village with shopping and restaurants. Even the Hyatt - which is the last hotel to the south was not a particularly long walk. The hotel grounds are well maintained and there is a bar and a snack/grill place both located by the pool. The pool is adequate but nothing spectacular. When you stay at the KBH you are trading off hotel amenities for a lower room cost. So the pool is merely adequate; the restaurant is adequate; the hotel is clearly an older hotel but still maintained well. Parking for my rental car was $9/day with unlimited in and out. A surprise to me was that the hotel does not provide any chairs or lounges for use at the beach. Instead there is a 3rd party vendor there who charges a rental fee. During my stay the surf was breaking close in to shore, so no body surfing was possible. No wireless and a $10/day charge for internet access in the room via ethernet wire connection. I was happy with the KBH and the trade-off I made. But then other than sleeping and breakfast, I did not spend much time there. I would consider staying there again.

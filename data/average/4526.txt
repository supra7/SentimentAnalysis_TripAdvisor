I got this hotel on Priceline, and I was really excited because it's RIGHT downtown, and a block from Downtown Crossing station. The inside of the hotel is nice enough, although weirdly laid out. The lobby is on the 3rd floor, and you have to take an elevator from the street level to get to it. This wouldn't be so strange, except for the fact that the elevators to the rooms are on the other side of the lobby. If the elevators were all the same, it would be fine. The rooms were nice, pretty large for downtown, and had great views. I could see the state house clearly from my room. The bed was crazy comfortable, I think it was a featherbed. I just wanted to sleep all day. The only problem with the rooms, and this is a big one, is that the walls are VERY thin. We could hear our neighbors talking, watching tv, even coughing in their room. Which made me wonder what they could hear from our room. Definitely a big minus.

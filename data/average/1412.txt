Lindemann's hotel is in the Schoenefeld district of the City and is surrounded by slightly rundown shops and buildings. However within a 10 minute walk is the lively Nollendorf area which is full of bars, cafes and restaurants and a mixed, vibrant crowd. The hotel itself is very modern in style, lots of dark slate, low lighting, monochrome furnishing etc. It is stylish but not overly comfortable, particularly if you want a long, lazy breakfast. My partner and I stayed in a penthouse suite on the 6th floor which had a communal roof terrace but no views. The room was spacious and clean with a large bed, long sofa, two flat screen TVs and a wetroom. However, the shower had very weak water pressure and lost water supply twice mid shower. The hotel bar has a very limited range of drinks and the lights are turned off in the evening to conserve power so it is not the best place for pre-dinner drinks. There was a sole member of staff covering phones, reception and the bar in the evening so service can be slow. We had to wait to check in as the receptionist was on the phone when we arrived, tired and hungry. We arrived back at the hotel at 1ish on Satruday morning and some local youths were hanging around a bus stop outside the hotel. They accused my friends and I of being "rich, middle class" - we are not, we just dress well - and one followed us into the hotel and started to give us grief. There was no security or attempt to remove him from the hotel and it was only the fact that he was outnumbered 4:1 that seemed to deter him from causing trouble. Not a pleasant experience but it is indicative of the immediate envrionment. It's about an hours walk from the hotel to Mitte for shopping and main tourist attractions and about a 10 minute walk to the Ubahn.

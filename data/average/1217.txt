We got this room on priceline for $50.00. We were arriving at 12pm after a long flight so we needed a hotel room just for the night. It was a huge complex. The room itself was nice. Good bed and pillows. Quiet room. Good room service. My only complaint was the staff wasn't very friendly at the desk. There were about 25 people checking in at the same time and only 1 attendent. Also, this place is huge; we literally needed a map to get to the room. We felt like if we needed something we might not find our way back. Overall if you are needing a hotel for a night over after traveling this is a good hotel. Close to the airport. Not sure if I would have paid full price but for the deal we got it was great.

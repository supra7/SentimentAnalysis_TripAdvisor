Got the hotel at a good price through priceline.com. Would not have been happy if hotel was at a rack rate or similar. The location was fantastic though, a block from the Freedom Trail. Parking is very expensive as it is Boston, $32.00 to park it yourself, $41.00 for them to valet. The rooms are small and nothing special. The amenities are nothing special either. It was an average hotel, nothing spectacular but clean and in a great location. Not worthy of 4 stars, more like a 3 star experience.

The hotel was conveniently located near the airport. They had a free airport shuttle, but you could actually walk to the hotel. I'm a Hilton Honors member and was told I was upgraded to a bigger room. I was disappointed to discover that my room overlooked the dumpsters. I couldn't get my a/c to turn on. The bed was comfortable, but the room was nothing special. usually when I get upgraded I stay in a suite, but this was nothing special. The hotel is huge. If you aren't in the main tower, plan to do a lot of walking. It was nice, but nothing to brag about. I laugh because when I checked in the lady said they wanted to be rated a 10 and that I should let them know if they could do anything to make my stay better. Trust me, they aren't a 10. They have a lot of work to do to meet that expectation. The chair is my room was frayed. Start by upgrading your decor. I don't want to see something that is obviously old and worn.

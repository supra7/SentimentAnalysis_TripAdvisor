This hotel is not great, but good. I took the advice of another reviewer and asked for a quiet room with a view. We were given a room on the 20th floor. The room was very clean with a very comfortable king size bed. The bedding included a feather bed and down comforter. The hotel staff was somewhat hit or miss. They would say hello if you acknowledged them first. The exception to this were the doormen. They were excellent and more than willing to give directions or dinning advice. One glitch was the housekeeping staff. One morning, I was having coffee in the room when a maid just walked in. I did not have the do not disturb sign out, but usally they knock before entering. Another afternoon I had to call three times to find out when our room was going to be made up. No one seemed to know what the other was doing? The location of the hotel was very good close to the commons and the Freedom trail. We did not eat at the hotel, but found a Dunkin Donught for AM coffe and quite a few small restaurants with in a short distance of the Hotel. The Beantown Pub on Tremont St. stands out as a very good place for a drink and a sandwhich. It overlooks the burying ground where Paul Revere is buried. I did not notice anything out of the ordinary as far as walking the streeets around the hotel. The mix was one that you would find in most large cities. I did not feel threatened at any time. There was a large police presence and I did not notice any problems. If we would return to Boston, I would consider staying at the Hyatt again.

My wife and I booked a room for four nights on Thanksgiving weekend and I am not suprised that this hotel has sunken in the TA rankings as of late. The location is fine and rooms are quiet enough but we had a few complaints. The biggest problem is that the windows don't open - not even a crack. The recycled air was very dry and made the room a little stuffy. The cleaning service (as mentioned in previous reviews) was not great - bed turndown was inconsistent and parts of the room seemed untouched. There was peeling and scratched wallpaper and the caulking around the bathtub was a little moldy and stained. The reception staff was inconsistent as well. The concierge service wasn't the most professional. Having said all this, I need to say that the rate I recieved from Hotwire was very reasonable. I find it hard to call this hotel substandard because compared with other downtown "four-star" establishments in Chicago, it was no different. However, the higher rates one pays when conventions are in town would have left us disappointed. I don't see any reason to choose this Kimpton over, say, the Hotel Intercontinental.

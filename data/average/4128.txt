We had gotten a pretty good deal for this hotel-$199.00 per night/parking $43/night, and it is very centrally located, but boy is it noisy. construction activities start promptlly at 7:00 am, with the drills and hammers, topped off with the loud ferry boat honking nice and early as well. They gave us a very small room just above the lobby, which is currently undergoing construction. The lobby noise wafts upstairs so that it is basically a part of your room. The bathroom was okay, but also very small, no exhaust fan, low water pressure in shower. The room overlooked the dog park, which was cute, and again, it is right accross the street from the main attractions, the Quincy market, Freedom Trail, etc. The Starbucks was conveniently located in the lower portion of the lobby, and the service there was very good/no long lines to contend with. We ate at Clarke house (?) next door to the hotel and Tia's as well, which I may be spelling wrong, but we had delicious food and very good service at both places. You can bring small children to either of these places, they ahve kids menus. Aquarium is also right across the street, and was very nice but also very crowded and long, long lines-ps we stayed here on Easter break, so LOTS of little kids everywhere!! I saw an ad for a city pass which seemed like a good deal at about $46.00, which incl. a bunch of the main attractions in Boston. We had free tix to the acquarium, so we made out quite well. I would request a high-floor room at the marriot if you decide to stay there, at least till construction is completed! Call before booking! :) Have fun!!

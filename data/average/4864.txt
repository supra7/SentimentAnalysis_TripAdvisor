I had stayed at this hotel previously a few times. The atmosphere is wonderful and historic in the common areas. My room, on the 8th floor, overlooked a fire escape. Only has wired internet at the cost of $20/day...really? The gym is really nice, an extra $10/day. The room itself was comfortable, but the EL going by early in the AM, made it difficult to sleep later. Staff did not seem very interested in service...from the bar to the front desk. Having stayed in 5 different hotels in the past month, this one was the most expensive and the least value for the money.

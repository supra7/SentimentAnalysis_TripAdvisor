Great Location to downtown Seattle. Just around the corner is the monorail to Space Needle and EMP. Loved EMP and so did my family. Walking distance to Pike Market. We were on the 32 floor nice views. Checked in late that evening, hotel staff was very rude especially a manager 1 night and a little prejudice. Price not worth the service look for another hotel in the area.

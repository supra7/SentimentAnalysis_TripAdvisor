First of all the service was excellent. They were down to earth and were always eager to help. The location is walking distance from the wynn. They do offer shuttle service to the wynn and ceasers palace. The hotel itself was nice. The lobby was beautiful. Now for the bad part. The room was nice and the bathroom in itself was awesome. But if you have a room facing the railroad tracks prepare yourself for noise. First off while trying to take a nap I could hear helicopter after helicopter pass by. Next walls were thin and you can hear your neighbor of they move or bang on the wall. Next the room is located above fans below that emit a lot of noise. If someone is taking a shower next door you can hear the water running though the walls. Beautiful hotel but with thin walls and at times too noisy!!

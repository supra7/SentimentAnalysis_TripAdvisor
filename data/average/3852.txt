I just stayed here for Labor Day weekend. The pluses: Nice lobby, clean & nicely decorated rooms, awesome location for walking to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, lots of restaurants, & waterfront. Nice kitchenette & hotel even throws in a few beverages in the fridge for free! The downside: no A/C. It was in the high 70's (if not 80) this weekend, and my room felt like a sweltering sauna, even with ceiling fan & floor fan! I'm very tolerant to heat living in Calif, but come on! My window did face the west with the sun beating on it, so maybe it's better facing the east? Other times of year, it's probably fine with the cool rainy weather. Also, it was VERY loud at night until 3am with party people yelling on the street. I had to put earplugs in & still hard to sleep. Maybe that's better on a non-weekend night? Would I stay here again? Only if they get A/C or during non-summer weather. It's a very cute little place & would've rated higher with A/C.

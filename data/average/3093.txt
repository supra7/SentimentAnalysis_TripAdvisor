This hotel was basically picked as it is close to where my sister lives which was the reason for my visit.... After reading the reviews i was worried and arriving int he dark- still not impressed. On reflection it is cheap. For my 25 a night i got to park my car in a safe area (very rare in London), i was 3 minutes from tube - which was 10 minutes from central London, breakfast and ensuite bathroom. Staff - especially lady who did breakfast were a bit lacking in charm but guys on reception always said hello. Curtains didnt fit window and drains smelt slightly but we had fresh towels everyday and as we were out sight seeing it was more than bareable for a long weekend. Dont expect the ritz!

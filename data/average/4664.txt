I booked this hotel for the king bed suite and separate living room with kitchenette. The room looked exactly like the photos on the website - neutral, modern colors. The friendly front desk ladies were awesome, the cleaning staff and greeters were great, the bed linens and duvet always smelled clean everyday. Some cons: When the A/C was on, very strong smell of cigarette smoke from other rooms would enter our room (although it was advertised as a non-smoking hotel). Two of the 3 elevators smelled like urine. The eggs from the free breakfast were nasty (not real eggs) but the self-service waffles, bagels, muffins, yogurts made up for this. Lastly, the heated indoor pool felt too crowded with more than 12-15 people in it.

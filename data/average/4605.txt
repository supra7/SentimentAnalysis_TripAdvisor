I stayed here for three nights and still love the location. I had a King room with a view of the air conditioners (ok I paid the conference rate). I love the historical aspect of the hotel and I think the other reviews where people gripe about paying for internet are sour grapes. I read the reviews and renewed my President's Club account for the free internet. If you have enough time to write a review I'd want to believe you have enough time to read reviews before you travel. I did have one problem here...my maid on my last night there took two drink glasses from my room that were my personal property. They had a logo that clearly identified them from the hotel and were left alone until my last day. I called the housekeeping supervisor and she even came up to see the room but had little to offer. The next morning at checkout the front desk gave a feeble effort at checking with housekeeping and then offered no resolution. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and wondered what other personal items had been inspected during my stay by housekeeping.

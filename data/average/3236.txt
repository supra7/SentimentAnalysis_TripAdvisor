I got this hotel on Priceline. I've never had a problem with Priceline when booking hotels. I think they're great. I called in the afternoon before my arrival to confirm my reservation and to inform them that I would be a late check in since my flight was arriving late. When I arrived to the hotel at 1am they didn't have my reservation. I had printed my reservation and receipt and had it with me. The front desk employee told me they were updating their system and it may have been that my reservation was canceled. Sure good thing I had my print out. The employee made a new reservation for me and got me a room about an hour later. He tried calling Priceline for me but was unsuccessful at reaching anyone. So I called them myself, I was on hold for a long time. At 3am, when I was already settled in and ready to go to sleep, I got a call from the front desk asking to come back so that they can get a copy off all my info because it could not wait till the morning. After that I went back to the my room and called Priceline again. It was about 3:30am. I called the front desk while talking to Priceline and the guy at the front desk said they had found my reservation. It was filed in the wrong spot. It was pretty annoying. As far as the hotel goes, the lobby is really nice. But it's almost like a facade. Once you go the hallway and rooms it goes down one star. The rooms could be updated. Things look old which make it look dirty. But for the most part it's a clean hotel. The rooms are big along with the bathroom. Also, it's loud. You hear everyone who walks past your door. And we were next to the ice machine room so we got to hear that too. The good thing is is that the bus to downtown is across the street from the hotel.

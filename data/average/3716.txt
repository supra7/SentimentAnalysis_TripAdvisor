Pro's - good location, nice decor, clean rooms, cookies and milk at night, coctail hour, friendly valet. Con's - had to take the stairs every morning (7 flights) because the elevators took too long. When I say took too long, after a 20 minute wait, there were still guests trying to get down. This occurs at peak morning hours and peak after work hours. Restaurant was just ok.

We needed a place to stay for one night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning, and didn't want to pay for ammenities we wouldn't need. Its sits just off the main drag (perpendicular to highway 99). Isn't really attractive (think cinderbrick and 1985 carpet) but it felt safe and that's something given the competitors' reviews. Friendly front desk and breakfast room staff. Very average rooms (low quality mattresses, small bathroom, but furniture in good condition). This place was okay, though not inexpensive, for our purposes. If you're looking for a base from which to visit the greater Seattle area, there must be better choices, as comingi back to this place at the end of each day woud seem a bit of a downer. Warning: unless you are hearing impaired, do not get a room anywhere near the ice machines which are in the stairwell in the center of the building, as they are the loudest we have ever heard (are the motors going out?? honestly!).

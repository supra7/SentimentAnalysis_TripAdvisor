It was very handy, we walked from kings cross with kids and bags, The room was tidy, aircon good, nice shower, Decent eat as much as you wank brekkie, not full english, but still worth the fiver, Helpfull staff, very nice, we was low ground, it was very quiet Kettle, and cups so can do a drink Downside, got there a bit early, and wanted to leave after 12, had to pay 20 to leave bags Hotel bar was shut fri and sat night, when we went back about 10pm Nothing to do in the hotel, and no meals, bar brekkie, but down the eversholt rd, say 100 metres, is a great cafe, very nice, and cheap, looks a bit rough, but worth going in!! Lovery grub, we had tea there both nights!

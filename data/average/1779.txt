just returned from a stay on maui. first part at the fairmont in wailea which is beyond words in its beauty and the room size and decor. Arriving at the Hyatt we paid for ocean front room which looked out over the pool. The balcony was very small, too small for 2 to sit. Below our rooms were the 2 trees the Marlins roost in at 6pm and then they wake at 6am. The noise is very loud, you can not sleep with windows open. But that was ok since also below us was the restaurant that served breakfast. At 4:15 am they start setting the tables so we were awaken to dishes and glasses being set up. No robes. Pool is congested and you need to get up to save a place if you want a quite spot away from all the people. This is our 8th visit to Maui and our first to the Hyatt. We will probably not be back. The lobby and open area is beautiful and the birds are very entertaining, but for the price and what you experience the Fairmont is such a better way to spend your dollars. Also in the bathroom there is one small counter to set up extras you may acquire such as drinks or snacks. 3/4 of the space was taken by a tray filled w/ mini bar food. if you touch it you pay for it. I called and had the whole thing taken away for our stay so we would have some room for our things. The staff was very nice and certainly went out of their way to make your stay great, but it all depends on what kind of stay you want your visit to Maui to be.

My friends and I were really excited to stay at the W during our girls trip, however the hotel didnt meet our expectations. The only thing that was great about the stay was the location. The front staff was friendly, however calling down for any assistance was alittle frustrating. Requesting towels took forever, generally very slow in responding. The rooms were a decent size, the beds were not the most comfortable. The whole parking issue was frustrating, 3 different prices being shown but you end up paying $48 a night. I would recommend this hotel to older couples who prefer a quiet place where not much is going on.

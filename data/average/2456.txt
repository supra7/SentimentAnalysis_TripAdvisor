Decent alternative to staying in downtown Philadelphia, even for tourists. Saves a bit of money and parking is free. It is about a 15-minute drive into the city, and day parking on weekends is cheap, and in some cases free. It is certainly less than parking at downtown hotel lots. As for the hotel, the room was clean with few mystery stains. No hair conditioner though, which was surprising. Some newer hotels offer rooms with two queen beds, and this only had two doubles. Free Internet is nice and the buffet breakfast is not a bad deal either. Service was good too. We found the pool area clean. Nobody checks in there, so if people are not following the rules - as another reviewer noted - you'd have to go to the front desk. Hot tub was just very warm, and pool was refreshing instead of the normal disgusting sauna-like conditions at most indoor hotel pools.

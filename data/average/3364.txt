We were booked into The AmazInn by the the Branson Tourism Center. If this room had not been part of a package we would have checked out the first night. The room had a bad odor that was very strong...almost caustic. The extended continental breakfast must refer only to the length of time served and not the selection as the food was inedible, what there was of it. Ours ended up in the trash can. We ate breakfast elsewhere each day. The location is good but the overall room is just barely average. It is large but the amenities are minimal. One ice machine serves the entire motel and it is far down the complex next to the pool. The sheets on the bed were clean and crisp but the blankets had obviously NOT been changed from the last guests...not the bedspread I'm talking about here...the actual blanket. The bed was fairly comfortable with a pillow top. Housekeeping otherwise was good. We will not return to the AmazInn, nor will we recommend it. FYI: Branson Tourism Center did a great job with our tickets and did not charge any fees. They just really dropped the ball on our lodging.

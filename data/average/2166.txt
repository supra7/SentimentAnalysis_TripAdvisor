Let me say that I chose to stay at this hotel because I had a fabulous time at another trump properly recently at the Trump Soho NY. The reviews on TA are right on about the TRAIN noise. It is no joke. We were " upgraded" when we checked in and stayed in a 1 bed studio room facing the strip. It was suppose to be on the quieter side of the hotel but trust me - the train noise will wake you up at night. I am usually a heavy sleeper and don't mind hall noise etc but if you are a light sleeper do not stay here! Other things that the hotel was lacking: The room was not as clean as it should have been. The bathroom particularly had signs of mold and "pink orange" water scum in all the corners. The carpet was worn and heavily stained ( please get some Resolve on this!) The furnishings ( ie night table had watermarks scratches from glasses being set down etc) were beat up looking. Bath robes were not in the room when we looked and so I called downstairs so someone could bring them up- Front desk reception was like " Did you look in the closet?!" I wanted to honestly say " Are you kidding me?!" Of course I looked I am not a complete idiot! Overall service from front desk was really average. If the concierge was out no one could really give a meal recommendation. Frederic from the concierge was GREAT! They need to pay him more- he was the only one who truly professional and courteous. Overall, first glance of the room is nice but not until you actually use the room like the shower which made me wish I brought shower shoes. The train noise is significant. The pool was nice and relaxing and those poolside waitresses are working hard in all that heat. I would probably never stay here again. This was my first trip to Vegas and had no idea what " off the strip" meant and my concept of a casino hotel vs. non casino hotel.

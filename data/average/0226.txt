Pros: cute neighborhood north of downtown; easy walk to Seattle Center and while not that short, pretty easy walk to downtown; historic hotel; large room , comfortable bed, more like an apartment w/a eat-in kitchen (fridg, microwave, table, no stove). Great shower. Very nice staff. Cons: We rented a suite so that my daughter could sleep on the pullout couch. My daughter is definitely NOT fussy -- she has slept in all kinds of primitive conditions--however, she could not sleep on the couch-- when we opened it up the mattress was extremely thin, flimsy--not something you could sleep on-- also, the sheets we were provided did not fit on the bed. In conclusion, if you stay at the Marqueen and don't need to use a pullout couch (or don't get a suite -- just get a room with a bed) you'll like it a lot--- but if you need a separate sleeping space for another person (child, whatever) rent two rooms or go elsewhere. Another con-- the breakfast needs improvement. Could be easily improved by supplying milk for coffee and warm (not just out of the freezer) croissants. Also, since fresh fruit is readily available in Seattle, adding fruit would be a plus.

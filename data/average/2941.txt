We have just returned from a weekend break staying at Le Fabe. Our room was on the small side but was very clean. The hotel decor made everywhere appear very dark, especially in public areas. I had booked a Charme category room and was somewhat disappointed. We were right opposite the lift and had two fire doors out side the room as well. This meant we could hear the comings and goings of other guests at all times. My biggest criticism would be of the heating/air conditioning. The room was like a sauna, so we opened the window - which of course, let all of the traffic noise in. We put the air-conditioning on and within minutes were lying there with our teeth chattering! Other than that, yes the hotel is in a fabulous location and the staff were absolutely charming

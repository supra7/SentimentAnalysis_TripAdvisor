I needed to go to a conference and I was only staying in Seattle for less than 24 hours. I could not see me paying $200 a night at the hotel where the seminar was held. After reading the reviews, I pretty much knew what I was in for. When I stayed there was no loud construction, but it was a weekend. I did see patient across from me thru the window, but I'm in the medical field and that didn't bother me. I was over the hospital air conditioning unit which was bothersome. The air condition was not all that great but I did open the window for awhile. No hair dryer or coffee pot which is not all that of a big deal, however when you need to wake up at 5:30 I would of liked a little kick start. The location was great. I walked everywhere I needed to....definitely bring your tennis shoes . The hotel across the street, which you need to check in was pleasant and hassle free. This hotel was not the greatest but the reviews were helpful before I checked in and it worked for me.

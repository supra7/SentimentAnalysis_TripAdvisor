We chose this hotel because of the price and the reviews. I wish I could of switched with the last person and stayed at the Sheraton. This place is in serious need of an update. The staff was ok, but nothing above and beyond. The guy who checked us in gave us poor directions to our room and nobody offered to help with luggage. The rooms have thin walls and I was able to enjoy my neighbor brushing his teeth every morning. I wouldn't stay here again.

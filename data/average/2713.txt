Hotel room was as described. Just a few complaints. Unfortunately mini fridge not working. Complained about fridge as my husband had medication which needed to be kept cool. Result was they moved us to another room which was larger. Pillows were far too soft. We ended up having neck and shoulder pain. Breakfast was non existent. Would have been better if they provided tea/coffee facilities in each room.

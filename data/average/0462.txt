An interesting hotel, the lobby is on the 13th floor, the bottom 12 floors being a car park / offices. The rooms were the smallest I have ever been in in USA, I was in an executive room on 27th floor, like a shoebox and very noisy with traffic from I5 almost outside the room window. Surly staff overall, didn't have a "can do" attitude, worst of all I was hit with a credit card charge when I returned home for services I didn't use. I was not impressed. There are much better options than the Hilton Seattle, only go here as a last resort

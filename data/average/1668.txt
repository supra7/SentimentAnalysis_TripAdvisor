This hotel is in a great location, but they do not own any parking. So if you are driving, you'll have to pay $27 a night. The second night of our stay, there was an event going on and there was NO parking available in the garage and I was forced to valet park the car (which was more money) The restaurant stopped serving breakfast at 11am on saturday unless you wanted to pay for the full buffet. There was horrible cell service in our room and you had to basically sit in the window to use your phone. (WiFi was $12) We had paid for a "upgrade" and found ourselves looking over the "Dole" plant and all their trucks - Disappointing. I have stayed in the hilton across the street in the gaslamp and was much happier with their services and room. I will probably not stay in this hilton again unless absolutely necessary.

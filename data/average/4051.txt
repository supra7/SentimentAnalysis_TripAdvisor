The Marriott Copley Place is an average hotel, our first time staying there in 2010 we managed to finagle a concierge level room on valentine's day weekend and had an enormous king corner room with some fabulous views and concierge wine/snack access. This trip we got neither. Booked a king room and wanted the same as before (concierge level, etc) but were informed that it was closed during the weekend (what?? Isn't that a huge PLUS? I mean we were willing to pay more...). Our room was on a lower floor and they had nothing to upgrade us too (oh well) and it was actually quite small, especially the bathroom. The bonus is that the bed is really comfortable and since it's was incredibly (INCREDIBLY) windy outside and cold that weekend we were able to use the elevated walkway to go directly to Copley Plaza if desired. I don't want to say I will or will not stay there again, I think i'll just shop around a bit more next time. And Marriott, please consider having concierge level perks open on the weekends!

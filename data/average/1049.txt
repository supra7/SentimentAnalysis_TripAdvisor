I generally enjoy staying at most W Hotels, but this isn't the case with the Seattle location. The hallways are extremely dark and the rooms need additional lighting fixtures. The rooms have very little noise insulation and you can hear everything. I could even hear my neighbors cell phone vibrating on their bathroom countertop. Great location, free internet in the lobby, pleasant staff, but I think there are more comfortable places in Seattle.

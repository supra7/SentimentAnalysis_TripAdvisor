The Palmer House is a beautiful historic hotel. This is the best thing about the hotel. Otherwise, it is not a pleasant place to stay. It charges for everything....a coffeepot for our room, the fitness center, etc. The rooms are small without a proper reading chair. We could hear our neighbors all the time. The elevators are very slow. And yes, I did complain to the manager on duty who did take care of some of our issues but I would not stay here again. There was just too much hassle. One other point in its favor though is the location...great location for shopping and eating.

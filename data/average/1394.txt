We were lucky: If we had arrived the night before the front desk said that I would've missed out on a parking space! Totally unorganized. The hotel had to start saving spots with chairs, cones, etc for guests that had booked stay-park-fly. We went out for dinner, saved our spot as directed but when we came back the staff themselves had moved our marker because they needed the spot! So arrive with warning. The location is good but unless you want to walk you still need to take a shuttle.

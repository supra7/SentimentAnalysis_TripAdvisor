I stayed here with my wife for 5 nights. We actually live an hour away but my company was having meetings in Seattle so it was much easier to stay at the hotel. It is a short walk to great shopping and many attractions along with a wide variety of eateries. In fact, our group of 40 people (maybe 70 total including husbands and wives) did not have one bad meal and we are pretty selective eaters. The weather was fantastic. Wear walking shoes!!!! If you are not a kid the streets from the hotel are tough on the knees due to the steep downhill incline and tough on the calves coming back uphill. The meeting room we had was very good. Front desk staff were lacking a bit but all the other staff were very helpful.

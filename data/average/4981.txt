Be aware that the Palmer House is undergoing an extensive renovation now. One has to schlep one's bags up two flights of stairs if arriving on the Monroe streeet side. No elevator from that lobby right now. The construction work seems to be well-handled in that it is in closed off areas, and the workers are relatively quiet during the day. However, I did encounter a problem. Returning to my room around 9 pm after dinner out, I readied for bed when a loud rattle started from the heating ducts. I later learned it was a broken pipe causing the racket. I don't know whehter that was related to the construction, but I assume so. I was moved promptly, and the rest of the stay was uneventful. The rooms are nice -- of typical size for a big-city hotel property. The new room was quiet and comfortable. I'd stay here again, but only once the construction is done.

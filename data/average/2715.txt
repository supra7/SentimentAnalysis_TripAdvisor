This hotel was a bit of a disappointment. Its not your typical hotel. They share a building with other businesses so its a bit tricky to find. You see a big door outside, they buzz you in then you have to go up the stairs searching for the lobby which isn't really a lobby just a check in area. We booked a suite which was one large room with a king bed and a pull out sofa. The room did have character and an "old" feel to it with antiques, painted ceilings and shutters on the windows. The floors looked like they need a good cleaning as well as the bedspreads. I asked for blankets so that I could take off the dirty bedspreads and was told they didn't have extra blankets which I was shocked about. So we slept with just sheets. The hotel was quiet even in a busy area near the Pantheon. The staff was friendly. The breakfast wasn't great. They have canned fruit which I won't eat. Woudl be better off offering fresh fruit and the coffee was horrible tasted instant. The other party we were with didn't have hot water in their room for one full day. They wouldn't switch them to another room but did offer then a room they could go and take showers in which was not very convenient. We didn't have trouble with the hot water in our room though. Not sure if I would return to this hotel but did like the location.

The location is unmatchable in this price range. A simple sleeping room is $80 but expect to pay 2x's that anywhere else. It was surprisingly cleaner than most hotels I've seen in the past week but I've been driving up from LA and staying at Travelodge and Days Inn and Motel 6. The quality of the furnishings was high. Sure, it's a little run down in spots but it's just an old building with some of the usual character flaws but none affected the comfort. We were lucky enough also to get a corner room so that made it especially nice to look over at the W and know they are paying $250+/night. It had a full bath, everything worked -- we don't care to watch tv anyway on vacation so have no idea how that worked but if you want to believe all the other comments, feel free. It will mean more room for us when we come back.

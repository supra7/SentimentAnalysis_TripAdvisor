Ugh. We got a deal on priceline but it was still very expensive for one night. The room was large, but my husband and I had the choice of 1 single bed (huh??) or 2 doubles. Not the best when you are celebrating an anniversary. No coffee maker or minibar in the room, and for that price, very disappointing. Little things (soap dish) were broken in the room also. The fitness center closed at 7 pm Saturday, which is exactly when I wanted to go. The place was very clean and the check in staff were nice. Too little, too late.

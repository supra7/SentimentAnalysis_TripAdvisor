The bed was small, listed it as a queen but was a full size bed. The night stands were old and water damaged.I had really thought it would have been better for the kind of upscale hotel it is. The Valet staff were the best. Shuttled us to and from were we needed to go. Still charged us but it was way cheaper than the Taxi service. Loved the location.Could not seem to get the air conditioner to cool the room very well. Wish the staff would have offered us a upgrade. Not sure if I will stay here again

My two teenage boys and my husband recently stayed here for two nights with rooms reserved on Priceline. The price we paid was great, but if I had paid full price I would have been very dissatisfied. The rooms were a bit dated and the bathroom extremely small. The plumbing in my boys' room was not working too well. The bath amenities were very nice. I wonder if it was because we reserved through Priceline that the room was not as nice. Our mattress seemed a bit "tilted" and was a bit uncomfortable. The workout room was expanded since the last time we had been there. Very clean and lots of machines to choose from. The concierge was very helpful with a breakfast suggestion. As most mention, the location is perfect. You can walk around the mall, catch the T or get to where you need to go pretty easily.

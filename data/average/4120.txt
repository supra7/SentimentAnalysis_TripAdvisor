The Marriott Long Wharf has long been one of my favorite hotels. As a Marriott Rewards member for over 20 years, Marriott is always my first choice for quality service and properties. The Long Wharf has undergone renovations and while it looks modern the level of service Marriott has been known for is missing. The people don't seem to go the extra step to make you feel welcome here. The new reception area is quite small and in the middle of the entrance to the restaurant. This make the area very congested. Having used rewards points our room was lovely. A large room on the sixth floor with large windows overlooking the marina. The windows however were filthy! Little hand prints all over. Kind of hard to miss from even the most rushed housekeeper.

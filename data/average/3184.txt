I was somewhat disappointed. The room was tiny and poorly laid out. There was not even one chair. There was a streetlight outside the window and the shade was transparent so I needed to wear eyeshades at night to sleep. The breakfast was a basic cold Turkish breakfast. My wife asked for an egg and that was not possible. On the other hand the staff is very nice and friendly. The location is great. Best of al the terrace and breakfast room have fantastic views of the Bosporus and Mosque. There are probably some other hotels with great views and better rooms.

A nice, modern hotel, right on the Bay and next to the Convention Center and Petco park. This is a lovely building and a morning stroll around the bay is wonderful. Staff were friendly and rooms were fine. However the prices of some extras were rather high. Internet access ($20 per day on some plans), Breakfast Buffet ($24) all seemed on the high side. I must add though that the buffet is available in an inclusive price when booked in advance for about $10 and is extremely extensive. I would rate this hotel higher if the internet were free, the bridge to PETCO park finished, and breakfast buffet available on the day for a more reasonable price.

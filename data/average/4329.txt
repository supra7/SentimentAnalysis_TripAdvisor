Stayed 7/19-7/23 for a conference. Room on 9th floor was small but clean. Carpet was somewhat worn. Bed okay but nothing to write home about. A friend who had checked in the same day told me his 5th floor room had some roaches so he was moved to the 11th floor and had no problem there. No bugs in my room. Hotel has good location and many good restaurants plus subway are nearby. Convenient parking across street. I think if you can get a decent rate on one of the web sites this place would work but would not be anywhere near whatever their rack rate is posted at.

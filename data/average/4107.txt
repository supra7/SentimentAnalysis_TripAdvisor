My companion and I travel to Boston quite frequently and have always stayed at the Marriott primarily due to its location. We were quite disappointed when we planned our most recent trip (4/15) only to find the price for 1 night had nearly doubled in comparison to our previous stays. We were in town for 2 days to see a Red Sox game, hadn't realized it was the weekend of the Boston Marathon. We ended up staying a block down at the Colonnade for 1/2 the price where found excellent service and quiet.

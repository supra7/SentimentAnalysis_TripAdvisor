Booked a two day stay to take in the downtown Seattle attractions. Stayed in the newer Union street tower. Location was excellent- just a short walk to Pike Place, Westlake Center, Seattle Art Museum, and all kinds of shopping. Did not use the pricey valet parking. You can self park around the corner at the Meridian Parking Garage on Pike Street for $26 per day. Hotel room- clean and adequate size for two beds and a small side table. In room safe was handy. Did not have a fridge or microwave. In room WIFI was extra charge- $10.95 per day. Five computers in lobby were fully occupied during busy periods. Free WIFI in lobby only. Pool/fitness center is on the top floor of the the Pike tower- the views were great. Pool itself was satisfactory, Spa was not functioning on one day of the stay. 24 hr Fitness center had a good variety of apparatus. Overall service was satisfactory- front desk was polite, and accommodating. Will stay here again.

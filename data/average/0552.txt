The location was perfect, the initial room price seemed good, but what stood out as 4 star about this hotel were the extra charges. When we called about a DVD player, which we would expect to be standard, we had the option to rent one for $30. At that price we could have just bought one. Complimentary breakfast? Not even continental. The mandatory $40/night valet parking was ridiculous. Although we were warned it would be 7-10 minutes, it ended up being 15-20 before our car was even brought around. The rest averaged out. From our clean but drab room to the comfortable mattress with pillows & duvet that made so much noise when anybody shifted that nobody could sleep. Even the hot tub was barely lukewarm, but at least there was lots of natural light in the pool room.

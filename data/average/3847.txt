The hotel is great for the price, however I wish I could have paid just a bit more to have a place that allowed me to have a good nights sleep. I was woken up by people outside (which I know is not the hotels fault) and the sun came blaring in WAY too early. I also found hair on the bathroom floor (gross). The staff was nice and the amenities were ok. It is in a rather unsafe location but it is good if you plan on walking places. If you're on a budget and do not expect to stay in your room very long, I would suggest this Inn. My piece of advice: Ask for an inside room!

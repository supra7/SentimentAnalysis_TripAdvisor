Stayed at the Marriott Copley for a conference. The rooms were nice and spacious. But there is no wireless access in the hotel accept for the lobby/lounge area. For a conference hotel, this is appalling if you ask me. You have to pay $13 a day for a cable modem connection. The gym was very nice, with updated equipment and fruit for after your workout. But get there early, as it gets crowded quickly. Food was decent in the lounge but with the amount of great restaurants in the connecting malls, I'd say venture out. Daily Grill in the Prudential Mall is great. and a little spot call Cafeteria which is about 3 blocks away had a GREAT breakfast...

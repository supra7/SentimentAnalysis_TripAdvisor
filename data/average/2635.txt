Well we looked at the reviews and knew exactly what to expect. And got it. As mentioned, the parking was a mess. A long jaunt from the lot to the hotel lobby. We ended up valet parking for the few extra bucks and ease of getting our car. The good - hotel bar staff was friendly and served decent cocktails. We ate a few times at the bar (appetizers) and they were fine. Nice atmosphere. The room (paid for an upgrade) was ample and had a great view. We turned the lights out at night and enjoyed a wonderful view. The bad - housekeeping was terrible. Knowing that I read poor reviews here, I tipped $5 the first overnight. Didn't really help. Our coffee was not replenished nor was the sugar or even stirrers. Oh well. The pool was and pool area was in not-so-great condition. It was OK but not what you'd expect. The hotel needs an overhaul. Kinds of shabby but since we had a car and were only there a few day before a cruise - it was not too much of a downer. If you are looking to stay here for any time, find another hotel. There is one right across the street (Marriott) that we visited and it was first class. Probably more but worth it.

Do not stay here if you require anything more than the bare bones basics and a low price for Seattle. I would not want to walk back to the hotel from downtown by myself at night. Pros: Price: less than 100 for Seattle is not bad Cleanliness: ok Location: 3 minute walk to space needle and Jimmy Hendryx museum (recommended!), 15 minute walk to shopping part of downtown, 30 minute walk to Pikes market. Staff: pleasant Pool: It was closed in November but open in summer, call and check if this is important to you Hot tub: Did not try it but it is there Art: 2nd floor hallway art, lol. TV: yes Internet Access: Worked fine Breakfast: Stick with hard boiled egg, bread, fruit and yogurt and avoid the rest Cons: Bed: Super soft, full rather than queen sized, sagged in the middle Bathroom: Low rent 70s style meh Ambiance: None Room: Small, hole in carpet, giant loud HVAC.

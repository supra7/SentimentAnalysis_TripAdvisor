Loved the area of the hotel, enjoyed the people at the hotel very friendly staff especially the doormen. The amount of pillows in the room was awesome and the space of the bedrooms were very nice when traveling with youngsters, gave them plenty of room to roam around the bedroom. However the housekeeping service and check-in was a nightmare!!! We got to the hotel at 6:00 pm on a Saturday night (we had called ahead to let them know we would be arriving late) we didn't get into our room until after 8 pm. The room was supposably not cleaned yet so we were told to wait about 15 minutes and it would be cleaned, 1 1/2 hours later my husband explained to them that we have kids who need to be put to bed and needed a room. They gave us a king room and told us our room would be ready by tomorrow morning. When we entered the king room we decided we would stay here the rest of the trip and ask for a roll away bed for one child. Housekeeping cleaned our room Sunday and then we didn't see them until Wednesday and that was after we spoke with the manager they were very apologetic about the ordeal and had sent a cheese tray to our room Wednesday night after we got in from being out all day. The room looked nice however they hadn't vaccumed. So we called them again and the next day it was inspected by the assistant manager over housekeeping to make sure everything was taken care of. The rest of the stay was great, would think about staying here again.

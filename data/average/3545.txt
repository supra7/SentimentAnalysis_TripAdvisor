First of all, anyone booking at the Holiday Inn Express should not expect the Ritz. Also, during my 2-week stay, I had a rental car and my company paid for the internet. That being said, the value for money at the Holiday Inn is very good. The breakfast is pretty basic (cereal, fruit, yogurt, toast/danishes) but how many other places in Dubai provided a complimentary breakfast? The location is good between and central to most of the attractions and shopping around Dubai. Parking was free and security at the gate prevented anyone other than guests from using the parking garage. When I did need a taxi, the security at the front was able to flag one down for me quickly. Also, the service at the front desk, housekeeping and the restaurant were fantastic. Everyone was quick to please and very welcoming with information and requests. The only other things that I would note is that there is not an ironing board in the room, although the front desk was very quick to send one to my room when requested (within 10-15 minutes). And, the restaurant doesn't actually do room service to the room, but were very nice in covering up the meal and placing it on a tray so that I could bring it up to the room. Lastly, there isn't a pool, but there is a gym. I didn't use it as the location next to Safa Park was perfect for a run, but it looked decent. Overall, good hotel and I'll definitely consider staying here if I return.

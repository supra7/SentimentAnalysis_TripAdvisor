On a positive note, the buildings and rooms looked modern and clean. The room was quiet and the door blocked out the silly music in the hallway. For a tourist, the location is good. It's a couple blocks from the Hollywood and Highland shopping complex and metro stop. A serviceable breakfast was included in the price. The business center included two computers and printer. There's a convenience store and daytime Starbucks across the street. Negatives: Some of the staff appeared immature or inexperienced. When I tried checking in, the two staff members looked overwhelmed although there were only a few people checking out. I was asked to have a seat, which I didn't mind, but was promptly forgotten. When checking out, the desk staff person had a personal laptop and cell phone out. Our car was vandalized as was one other car. We learned there are no security cameras in the garage. I know the hotel is not responsible but it's something to be warned about. Driving into and out of the hotel is hectic with traffic The wi-fi is slow and frequently stops working. Housekeeping skipped our room even though we took the Do Not Disturb sign away and were out by 9:30 AM and were back in the late afternoon. Also at check-in, we were given a half-used bottle of lotion. Not the biggest deal, but it just added to the holes in service. Neutral: Parking is $22 with tax. On par with the area but it's something to take into consideration if you're on a budget.

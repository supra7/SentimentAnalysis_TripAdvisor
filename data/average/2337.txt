This property seems unfinished and way too focused on selling memberships in RCI. There were lots of small children (even in the nice restaurants) and sales personnel everywhere. The beach is a total disappointment (water is not clear and lots of seaweed). The restaurants were great ( no reservations needed) and it was great to not have to mess with towel cards. Overall this property is just average - not up to the Riu Palace Mexico in Playacar where we have stayed in the past. There was not a piano bar or any place to go have a drink in a quiet atmosphere. The primary positive was the food/restaurants. Will not stay here again.

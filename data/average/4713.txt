Arriving at the hotel, the exterior is strikingly ornate and beautiful. The original architecture continues inside with pretty filligree in the elevators and mosaic tile that I believe is original?? There is a unique feel to the guestroom hallways with the frosted glass 'office' doors - they are very private, though. The guestrooms are standard hotel size and comfortable. I frequent Kimpton hotels and this hotel feels like a Kimpton - cool decor and design, good service, nice amenities in an interesting building. I had a late dinner in the restaurant one night when I arrived back to the hotel from a busy day - service and food quality could have been better, but I was tired and just needed a quick salad and glass of wine. Rooms were comfortable - great desk. The location was also good. I would stay here again.

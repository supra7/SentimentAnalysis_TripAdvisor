We got a great deal through Travelocity.ca. Even so, the staff treated us very well and the woman at the desk even upgraded us to a King Bed for free since we were staying more than one night. My favourite part was the fireplace in our room. It was so nice after the chilly days we spent in Seattle. I would not stay in this hotel if I was staying by myself (as a woman) as returning to the hotel at night in the winter is a bit isolated. It isn't far from downtown or the space needle but it is far enough that I would not feel safe. The staff are super super nice. The hotel itself has cute aspects but some parts appear to have passed their glory days. The lobby is lovely. Our room was much better than expected for 60.00 CAD per night. The hallways were tired. Our door keys didn`t work well at all and the fixtures and details are showing their age. One other very uncool aspect of this hotel is that I did not see any evidence of anything eco about this hotel. I didn`t even see the little sign that says to hang your towels up if you don`t want them to change them. There was no recycling bins that I saw. The environment is obviously not a priority for this hotel. Overall, if you get a deal I feel this hotel is going to meet your expectations.

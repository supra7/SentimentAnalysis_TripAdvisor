We've stayed here several times over the years. It looks like they recently remodeled. It must be a popular place because each time we have stayed here, they are full. They have a shuttle to the airport, a great breakfast and are pet friendly. This time we were on the 3rd floor which was nice, however, last time we stayed on the lowest level and that smelled musty.

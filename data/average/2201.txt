Hello Folks, I am a seasoned traveller who would never choose Las Vegas as a destination in the first place, however, two other friends were going and I and my partner needed a fast sun break. Donald Trump and his bad comb over pale in comparison to this ridiculously made supposed 5 star hotel. First the noise levels are completely unacceptable in a hotel that looks rather nice. If you stay on the side not looking at the strip expect to be waken in the morning by a train that promptly blows it's horn starting at 5 am. and then continues every hour on the hour. Particularly appreciated after a long nite of gambling. What I could hear that on the 40th Floor in a 5 Star Hote?? Oh yes, my friend but it doesnt stop there. Donald Trumps architects must have been the cheapest or stupidest he could find. They have this idiotic configuration to the entry way where two suites share a foyer. Looks elegant upon arrival but the doors SLAM like a prison institution sending 6 point shockwaves through the entire suite. And the maids seem oblivious to the lack of Noise proofing as well considering how GD loud they yakked and how often they ran in and out of my neighbours suite slamming the doors with every breath. So if the train doesn't get you the doors will. Then the hotel graciously offered me a move to the other side of the building whereby you feast on a lovely view of the strip. But wait, don't get your hopes up yet. This side was NO BETTER than the other. I heard Sirens going all bloody night long. And of couse that infernal Door Slamming never stopped either. So, if you want fake luxury, a 5 stay hotel built like a Motel 6 ( oh I forgot to mention that this Hotels location is right next to the freeway, and yes, you can here the traffic ) Then by all means....check in to Mr. Trump's latest boondoggle. ( BTW...there was mold in the shower. Yes MOLD. ) Would I choose to stay here again. NO GD WAY MAN!! Even if The Donald changes his hair don't.

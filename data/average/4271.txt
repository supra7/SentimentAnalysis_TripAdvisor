The Park Plaza is right in downtown Boston near everything. Parking at the hotel is very expensive ($40/night) but it's expensive everywhere! The hotel breakfast was also very expensive. We went down the block to a small cafe for a cheaper and tasty breakfast (Au Bon Pain). The hotel is older so the room looked like it could use an update. It's also a small room but very comfortable. We heard lots of sirens all night long due to the downtown location. We used AAA membership which was helpful. Concierge was helpful. Have to pay extra for internet in rooms. That sucked when cheaper hotels gave it for free.

Agree with those who were treated well, but hotel is outdated. REALLY long hallways, longer than the largest Vegas hotels, but also dark and extremely narrow. Standard rooms are TINY. One person can survive a night, but hopeless for two people. Showers are attractive, but poorly planned. If you are under about 5'10" it is hopeless to try and reach the water diverter and you will need to reach it. If you stay, you need to have a waterfront room. The city side rooms face the railroad tracks. They furnish free earplugs, and you might likely need them. The worst thing about the tracks is the trains vibrate the parking lot and set off car alarms ALL NIGHT LONG! To help with this, valet parking is required, at $36 per night, which makes their attendants resonsible for your alarm. The Beattles stayed here, but you will likely be more comfortable elsewhere. Really wanted to like the place with the cute rooms and GREAT location, but was miserable. I stay in hotels between 150 and 175 nights per year and feel well qualified to offer a less than perfect review. Shop by and have a meal in the great restaurant with the superb views, but do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.

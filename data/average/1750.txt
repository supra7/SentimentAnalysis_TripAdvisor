I usually do my homework & book myself but a travel agent was recommended to me so I used her, my requirements were #1a good swimming beach NOT! We've never been to Maui and really were not prepared for the cost of Everything! Even paying for shade!!! REALLY?? The farther north you walk up the beach the better- stay at the Westin or the Sheratin if beach is important. Or better yet walk the other way right next door to the Spa is a Public Park & beach with trees for shade-FREE. The room itself was nice-ocean front,comfortable bed, there was a small fridge (thank-you) for beer and fruit. We were not alone we saw a lot of others bringing in bags of groceries. Normally I would never do this but the cost of food & drink on the property is ridiculous and then the "resort fee"??? Paying for wiFi?? Oh well.

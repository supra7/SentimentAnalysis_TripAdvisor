We booked rooms at the Park Plaza during Christmas. Wonderful location, just minutes away from the T, Charles Street, Newbury St, the Boston Gardens, etc. And the price was great - a welcome relief from the high priced New York Hotel scene. I must say the heat in the rooms was unbearable. Thankfully, we could open our windows. Also, they charge for WiFi - unbelievable in this day. We went to Starbucks down the street to avoid paying $13 a day. As my husband commented, we did not pay a lot for the room, but it sure felt like the airlines at the end of the day.

This hotel is really a mixed bag. It's in a pretty good location, although at the top of a big hill. The Grey Line bus shuttle bus from the airport stops in front, so that's convenient. The staff and service are very good, especially the wake up call with a tray of coffee. I've stayed here three times now, and clearly this place is in need of a renovation. The furniture is worn as are the carpets. But everything worked fine in the room I stayed in. If you can get a good rate, go for it. But there are much better hotels in Seattle. I stayed there mainly for Marriott points and nights and did get a very good rate.

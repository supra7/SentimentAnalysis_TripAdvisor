Stayed there for a business conference and have to say I was less than impressed. Everything was just about average. On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent. Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible. And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor. Finally, despite the name, it's not really downtown per se, but a 5 minute drive from downtown. Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.

Our room, on the 27th floor, was breathtaking, with lovely views over Madrid. Rooms are large, extremely modern with wooden flooring throughout, air-conditioning Excellent range of TV channels on the flat screen. Lighting controls allow you to choose lighting to suit your mood. Bathroom is very comfortable - underfloor heating and multi-jet shower. You are given a delightful spa-box which contains every toiletry and bathroom utensil you could ever need. What let the hotel down for me is that there appeared to be very inadequate soundproofing between rooms - people walking across their floors and opening and shutting their cupboard/bathroom doors were all easily audible, which really spoiled things. This is simply not good enough in a hotel built at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. In addition, the queue for breakfast in the morning on the top floor was half an hour as everyone wants the panoramic views. The hotel should open up additional breakfast facilities. I would just about recommend this hotel to a friend, with the caveat that if they are easily disturbed by noise, they should not come here.

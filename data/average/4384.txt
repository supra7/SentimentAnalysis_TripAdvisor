I stayed here during July, 2011. I had stayed at other hotels in Boston downtown but the first time at this hotel. While our stay was comfortable and affordable (good location), I would not stay here again due to the fact the pool you use is at the YMCA (closed on Sundays). This was disappointing. We were issued breakfast for two coupons which was a nice touch (breakfast buffet will run you approximately $15 each). I would look to other hotels to stay downtown Boston. We took the communitor train to Salem for $10 each. I would actually stay outside Boston and just take the train into the city to spend the day. Highly recommend Fajita & Ritas! :))))

I have stayed in many Hyatts and I have to say this one in Boston was only ok. Don't get me wrong, it is a fine hotel but there were a few important things that were not so great. I'm not a very picky traveller - comfort and location is key. Location of the hotel was great, close to the T train - and all the sites. However, even thought the room was big and clean, the air conditioning was terrible. The room remained at 72 degrees even though we set it to cool down as much as possible. There was only one little vent that blew out a little cool air. That being said, the room was stuffy and we were not able to get a good night's sleep. The majority of the staff was very kind (especially the bellmen and concierge), the check in agent was cold. She made it seem like she was doing us a big favor with an early check-in when we were checking in at 3:00pm. 3:00pm check in isn't that early if you ask me. Anyway, all in all, it was fine. But the rating sure goes down when the room you're in makes you sweat all night from lack of AC.

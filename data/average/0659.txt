We had a lovely stay here a few years ago. Re-visiting this weekend was a bit disappointing. The room was nice - roomy, sofa to relax in, wet bar with coffee maker, small bath with walk-in shower, good closet/dressing space, comfortable bed, reasonably quiet. But everything is just a little frayed around the edges, I'd say. The sink in the wet bar only worked for hot water - no cold. The common areas are worn, carpet dirty, etc. People are friendly. In-house restaurant expensive. ($11 for a small bowl of granola? seriously?) No valet to take our car at 10 p.m. on Sunday when we returned from dinner. There were just a lot of little things that seemed to have suffered since our last stay. We could have stayed at the Pan Pacific for the same price. Although it's slightly less convenient, it's miles better in atmosphere and amenities.

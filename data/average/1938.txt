I know that a lot of hotels idea's of a ''ocean view'' room leave a lot to be desired..... but you expect when you pay more for it to at least be able to see a little blue water. But nope........ could not even see the sand, much less the water. When i complained , they told me to call travelocity, who i booked thru.... and they were of no help at all. Long story short.... no view for me... and i learned never to book thru a travel website again. Other then that, the grounds are beautiful, the rooms average, and breakfast was not that great.... i belive it cost about $30 bucks including tip for the breakfast buffet..... don't fall for it. We were also a little put off when we had a ''do not distrub'' sign up, and the maid walzed in anyway.

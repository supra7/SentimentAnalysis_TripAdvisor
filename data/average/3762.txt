You can probably discount the really negative reviews from 2007, as the Elegante is under new management and is being renovated in mid-2008. The hotel isn't great, but it's not terrible either. The A/Cs are on the wall, not central, so they're rather loud, but the rooms are clean, with good free Internet (about 1700 kbps, not fast, but faster than most U.S. hotels I've been in lately). Clean, carpet, decent decor, small refrigerator and microwave oven. Clean, new bedding and reasonably comfortable beds. This part of Dallas is full of cheap chain restaurants. Not pretty, but convenient to DFW if, like me, you're stuck in bad weather (summer lightning thunderstorms) and having to spend an extra unplanned night in Dallas. The hotel was good about sending shuttles to DFW to pick up folks, and scheduling them back to the airport the next day for another try at getting the heck out of town. There are many, many better hotels in Dallas, but I'd say this one is better than 'average' if you consider the full range of places people could stay. Pool (which I haven't seen yet) is only open until 11 (though that's typical). Weight room is open all night. Food closes at 10, I believe, though there are lots of places nearby.

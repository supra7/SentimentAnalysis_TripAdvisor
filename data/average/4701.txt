We booked this hotel through Priceline and got a good price for 3 nights. Here are the Pros: -Nice small pool and whirlpool -Clean rooms -Friendly staff -Business Center -Great downtown location right off the redline subway Cons: -No extra perks like free breakfast -Rooms are a bit smaller -The major drawback is the sound noise. The hotel hallways and room doors are not insulated at all so you can hear everything from outside your room and noise that travels from one room to the next via the hall. That was the worst part of our stay. -If the noise issue was resolved somehow it would have been much better.

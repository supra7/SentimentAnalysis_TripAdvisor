You get what you pay for with this hotel. The best part is how convenient it is to shops, restaurants and transportation. The cafe across the street is the best to pick up breakfast on your walk to Central Station. We stayed here 3 nights and while the room is not huge, it's comfortable enough with a TV and mini fridge and the room itself is neat and clean. Large enough space for two people.

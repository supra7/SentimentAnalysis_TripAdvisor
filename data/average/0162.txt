I can't dispute the service is great, but it doesn't make up for the room noise. The wall furnace was so loud that I finally turned it off and the condensation from the windows dripped constantly. They did move me the next day but the new room was no better. The condensation on the window was worse at times dripping incessantly. After 7 days I needed some rest and ended up staying at the Travelodge Space Needle, the room was quiet and the bed was just as nice and much less expensive.

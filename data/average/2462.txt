My girlfriend and I stayed at Casa Ticul for three nights. The hotel is a little bit far from Playa del Carmen night spots, which could be either good or bad depending on what you like. I didn't like the location because it was a long walk to restaurants and it was very hot, and also made us feel kinda of unsafe walking at night. The room was confi. No elevator, if you are lazy don't get a third floor room :). Staff was great, very helpful with everything. They are building a bar in the rooftop, right know they serve breakfast there for 3 bucks which is convenient I'm not sure if I would stay there again, I would do some more research first, I saw a lot of nice places closer to the beach and nightlife in Playa

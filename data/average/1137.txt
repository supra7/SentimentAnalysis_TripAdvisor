Great location for the Convention Centre and within easy walking distance of everything else. I asked for a quiet room, was told that all I'd hear was normal street noise - my room was right over all the flagpoles at the front and it was very windy. The heating/air conditioning is provided by a window unit, it was very noisy and didn't do a very good job - it snowed in Seattle the weekend I was there so it was rather cold. The room was small, glad I was on my own as between the desk and the bed there was only room for the chair. The bathroom was small but that didn't really matter, it was clean and everything worked. I did have a large closet with no light - ingenious use of space by putting doors on a double hinge so you could swing the doors out of the way to get light. The coffee maker was full of mouldy water and they came immediately with a brand new machine. Free Wi-Fi that was rather slow but better than having to pay for it. The elevators are very, very slow and you can take the stairs at the end of the corridor out onto the street so if you need to go to the Lobby you have to walk around to the front entrance - a little bizarre. Staff were friendly and helpful. I saw my friends' room on the other side of the hotel and it seemed to have more room, however their closet was about 9" deep - really weird.

The staff was extremely friendly and had personality which is great. However the main problem I had was that the drapes didnt close all the way and the bright yellow lights from outside came into the room all night. I tried to watch the Yoga channel which only went 4 minutes then rewinded itself from the beginng over and over. It seemed like everything had an additional charge I was suprised that the Toilet Paper didnt cost extra. I question the hotel security because as soon as we walked out the door of the hotel 4 bums where in out grill asking us from money and for us to buy them cig's. I dont like people touching my wife and the Hotel should have security making it a safe enviroment for its guests. The bed was comfortable the pillows where great but bathtub and shower looked very cheap like a motel 6 and everytime I walked in my room we where unable to park to unload because the taxi cabs prevented us from being able to unload our car.

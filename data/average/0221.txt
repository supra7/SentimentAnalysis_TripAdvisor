We were only in Seattle for one night, before a cruise, so chose this for convenience. Although it is very close to the Space Needle precinct, it was too far away from downtown to walk comfortably, and staff were only variably helpful re taxis. The rooms were ok, for the price I guess. This was (I think) staff accom for a company, so the rooms are a bit larger than normal, and had a small kitchenette, which could be useful if you were staying a few days. Our first room was at the front, smelled odd, and we couldn't open the windows. The one they (very helpfully) changed us to at the back, was better re smell, with opening windows, facing straight onto a brick wall. But hey, for the price, I guess not bad. And do try the fantastic breakfast place over the road - the one with the queues outside!

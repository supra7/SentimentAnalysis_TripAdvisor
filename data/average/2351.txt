First of all, I am a travel snob. I have been to the cancun/playa del Carmen area about 10 times and have stayed in other all inclusive resorts in the area such Secrets, Dreams, and the Royal (both cancun & Playa). My review here is relative to these other resorts in the same hotel class. I mean really, you can't compare the Sleep Inn to the Ritz. What's good: Small resort set close to the beach. Easy Access to all facilities. Room service is great. My favorite item on the menu: beef skirt sandwich on a baquette. Free Wi-fi. What's bad: Not enough staff. Be prepared to wait in line for everything. From checking in, getting served in a restaurant, to getting drinks at a bar. Also, very few bars - no stools by the bars. Not enough public restrooms. Kids club is a plastic table next to the kiddie pool. Overall, I was really annoyed at how long it takes to get any kind of service in this place. There are a bunch of timeshare salespeople hanging out in the lobby doing nothing- while there is a line 20 people deep at the concierge desk. I wont be coming back to this place. Is it better than the Sleep Inn? Of course! But it's not in the same category as Dreams.....

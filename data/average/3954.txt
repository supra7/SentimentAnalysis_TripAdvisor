I stayed for a week in a one bedroom suite. It is a pleasant hotel but one that also curiously strikes me as both sterile and idiosyncratic. For instance, the owner double parks his super expensive car by the front doors. The tiny lobby is shared with long term apartment tenants. The hotel has a dog, who stays in the lobby and has his own business card. Yet the rooms are cookie cutter drab. The service is competent but not outstanding. The location is somewhat central but the neighbour hood late at night turns shady. I don't understand why this hotel gets such high ratings, except for the fact that it is suitably priced to compensate for its shortcomings, perhaps even as much as a super expensive car would compensate for other inadequacies.

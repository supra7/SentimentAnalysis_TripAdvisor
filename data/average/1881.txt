We stayed for 2 weeks in October 2011 on our honeymoon. It is a very nice, clean and tidy hotel that is reasonably priced for the area. There are lots of free activities and the facilities are pretty comprehensive for a hotel of this size. Straight onto miles of open sand and easy access to lots of places to eat and drink without the need for a car. Having read reviews of this hotel before going we were expecting it to be smaller and the staff to be a lot friendlier, not just when it was time to pay a bill and they wanted a tip. The restaurant receipts have a tip calculator but for a buffet breakfast where the price is included in the room rate I resent being recommended to tip 17-23%, all the server did was bring a coffee pot to the table, clear 2 plates and bring the bill. I know tipping is different in the states to the UK but at a recommended minimum of $4.76/day (for 2 of us) this is big extra on the cost of a hotel. As this was a honeymoon we were informed by our travel agent that we would get a room upgrade and some kind of welcome gift (champagne or similar) but neither of these materialised and when we told any of the staff that it was our honeymoon we received glazed looks that assured us that we were no more special than the other hundreds of guests.

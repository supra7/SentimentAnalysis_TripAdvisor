I stayed at the hotel for one night during business trip. The room is small but has good ammenities. Internet connection is decent, expect 1-2Mbps. One thing I did found was the long lines to check in and check out. Took me 20 minutes waiting to be checked in. I also saw a couple of guests complaining on some charges. I did not had any problems. Bed was too soft for me, no pillow options. Is a good hotel for business right in Reforma, but the location can also be a problem. All manifestants usually use Reforma street. Rooms in the right side of the building do not have a view at all, they face towards a building onlu about 60 ft from you.

My wife and I have stayed at the Shoreham for years and, while the rooms might not be the best, you can't beat the location! Everytime we stay there, it's a running joke as far as what kind of room are we going to get this year! The hotel was built in 1922 and, due to the years of ocean weather, it has certainly seen better days. The floors are so unlevel that, if you set a ball on the floor, it would roll in all directions. Sometimes the bathrooms are a little worn and the beds aren't the best. If you're staying on the 3rd floor, the lack of an elevator makes it difficult to carry your luggage to your room. All this being said, the staff is friendly and you just can't find a better location to stay on the boardwalk. It's right in the middle of everything! How much time are you going to spend in the room anyway? The rooms are inexpensive, so why would you expect 5 star service? The restaurant, Shennanigan's, has great food, too!

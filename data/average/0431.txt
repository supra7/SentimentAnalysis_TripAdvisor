Stayed here because it's where the conference meetings were scheduled. Took Greyline shuttle from airport, less than $20 RT. Meeting rooms were on Ballroom level, and the ground shook with vibrations from cars in parking garage. My 11th floor room was fine, comfortable- and even tho my window faced the highway I left the fan turned on and it drowned out plenty of the noise. Slept well- nice down comforter, friendly staff. Refrig and coffee maker would have been nice but comp. coffee in the morning was nice. I'd stay here again.

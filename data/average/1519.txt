I completely agree with on of the erlier review. "Read the bad rewies and listen" We just came back from Secrets and it was not what we expected at all. The beach is unbelievable and the service is wonderfull, but the grounds are too bad looking, not maintained at all, dry grass, dry palm trees, dry plants all over the resort. The aircondition in the main lobby is never below 80, and is the same inthe restaurants, disco, entertainment room. Guest, workers were sweating all the time. The only place you were able to cool down was in your room or in the water. We walked over to the IBerostar Grand Paraiso and wow! those are grounds and also so spotless, not like at Secrets Maroma. I suggest you listen to the bad reviews.

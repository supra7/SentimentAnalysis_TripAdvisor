My husband I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Seattle Airport. When we walked into the room, the first thing we noticed was how small it was. We booked a King Bed Study with pull-out sofa so this wasn't the smallest room they offered. I wouldn't have wanted to see a smaller one! The bathroom was tiny and didn't have a tub...just a walk-in shower. The front desk staff was not friendly nor helpful when we checked into the hotel. The rooms were clean. As others have mentioned...the planes are LOUD. They did have a very convenient airport shuttle available. I didn't use the shuttle but it was a very short drive to the airport...very convenient location. This hotel was not inexpensive and I definitely expected more. During our trip to the Seattle area, we also spent a night at the Homewood Suites Seattle Airport. What a difference between the two hotels! Yes the Homewood Suites was more expensive but a whole lot quieter, the staff was wonderful, hot breakfast and the rooms were much larger.

Stayed here for a weekend visit to Boston. Got a great rate online. A double room was comfortable enough for my wife and I to share with our teenage son. We had a high room with a great view. The location was fine. Its a very short walk to the Prudential Center and the Back Bay subway station. Its also a block away from Mass Ave where you can find McDonalds, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and a slew of good inexpensive restaurants. The Back Bay Hilton is a fine middle of the road hotel. Clean, and comfortable. My son liked it and you know how picky teenagers are. If he gets accepted to a college in the Boston area this will be our go to hotel when we visit him.

We weren't really fans of this hotel. As many other reviews have mentioned, it was VERY dark. Even the rooms themselves didn't have a ton of light. My husband's comment that "we aren't vampires" summed it up perfectly. The service was good. The location is ok, it was a bit far from some of the shopping destinations we wanted but probably fine for others. Our view was horrible - we looked onto a parkade next door. We were really close to it, if we didn't close the blinds, people could definitely see us changing. The room was tiny and the layout was odd - we felt like we were frequently tripping over things (i.e. chairs, etc.). Internet access was available in the lobby for free which is a definite plus. We got the room on priceline for $105, which was ok but I wouldn't pay more to stay at this hotel again.

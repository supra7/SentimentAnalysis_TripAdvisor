We read some not so great reviews and were leary. However, we travel a lot.....for pleasure.....and have visited 47 states and stayed in a wide variety of accomodations. So when the rubber met the road as they say and we needed to spend the night while a loved one was in the ICU across the street we figured we would give it a try. We have stayed in many better, for less money, and we have stayed in many worse for more money. The bottom line is......the room had 2 double beds which were comfortable but not luxurious....nor were they sagging in the middle...the room is dated and not particularly clean, older carpet, old fixtures in the bathroom...it served our purpose well...hotels in Phila (or many cities) are pricey. This one was moderate, $145 night hospital rate plus $10 parking (good til midnite the next day) they only have 40 rooms so if they made it cheaper they would sell out I fear.....there was a coffee maker in room and a sandwich shop downstairs...only real complaint was a bit dirty and needs updating. We were glad they were there when we needed them......

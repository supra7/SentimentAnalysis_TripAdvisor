Just finished a week at HTR and I'm affraid we won't be back. Although the service was excelent it was at times patchy. The food during the evening was very poor esp. the buffet which on occasions was laughable. Def. not much to do at this resort and the beach is poor. Our room had a slight musty smell at the start of our stay and damp patches were very much evedent in the room when we departed. Remember to take your bug spray...mozzies are a real problem.

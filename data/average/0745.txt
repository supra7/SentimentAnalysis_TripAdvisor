We picked the Edgewater based on its 4-star rating and the downtown waterfront location on Pier 67. It's a property built in 1962 but looks great on the outside and around the public space. We had a waterfront room with views of Elliott Bay and gas fireplace. The room seems to have been renovated, size is fine, and decor resembles a lodge cabin. The bathroom is equipped with modern fixtures that look good at first glance but impractical and poorly conceived. The standing "spa" shower has only half a glass panel, so it's unavoidable that the bathroom floor would get wet no matter how we tried to adjust the shower head to point inward. The "vessel" sink comes with an instruction next to it - noting that the water needs to fill the vessel bowl to about 3/4 full before the draining starts, due to the lack of a overflow so pressure is needed to suck down the water. The vessel looks cute but we'd prefer a conventional sink that works. Look is not everything. The room is fine but having stayed in many hotels in the same class, we consider this property an average 3-star hotel, far from its "luxury" classification. The beds are on the soft side, some of the pillows smell musky so we had to spray some cologne on them to mask the odor. Parking is very expensive at $30+tax and valet only, so tips to valet each time we check in or check out the car. Internet is not free, but they have a business center with computers, free Internet and free printing. Since we always wonder about what it's like to stay at the Edgewater, we do not regret having stayed there, but once is good and we probably would not return. There are many other hotels in the same category with much better accommodations.

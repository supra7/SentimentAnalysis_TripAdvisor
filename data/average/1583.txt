Stayed here for 4 nights, the rooms were clean very small and quite impractical, on the first night we stayed in a room which was adjacent to the road we found it to be very noisy, the room had a bath in the centre of teroom which looked very glam, but after bathing it wouldn't drain the water away and the room had a musty dampness to it, we requested to move as we had come away for a rest and needed to sleep comfortably, the receptionist was quite put out by our request and made sure we were aware of it!. She told us to have our cases packed the next morning an come back in the afternoon at 3pm to make the move, which we did, when we arrived at reception she looked at us with a very puzzled expression and said she assumed we never wanted to move because we had put the clean room sign on the door (our cases were inside ready packed and ready to be moved!!) again she treated us like we were a pain and changed her tone whilst speaking in Spanish. We were eventually moved to a quiet room, and it must have been the worst in the hotel, but I did not hae the energy to complain. Breakfast was disorganised they never seemed to have enough plates and glasses available and you would expect the staff to greet you and ask if you want tea or coffee, they were slow and everything seemed like to much trouble I expected to much I assumed it was 5 star!, The city is beautiful with so much to see still enjoyed the city break wont stay here again. No English tv.

!st let me say we have stayed here several times without incident... but this last stay was horrible... we were there for 2 weeks (normal for us) the 1st 8 nights were ok... then we started seeing mice.. they brought us traps and we actually caught mice... they moved is up to another room thinking that would help... but not... we had mice in that room too.. once again they moved us up... and so far that seemed to help.... the thought of mice in your room running around all over your personal items is disgusting... but I will give the staff kudos.. they were and always have been very accomodating to us... they never hesitated to do what they could to make right the wrong... the hotel is a nice place with alot of nice amenities... if they can get the mice problem under control would be ok.. but for what its worth there seem to be those large "rat boxes" outside of every establishment, Starbucks included.. so maybe the problem is within Boston itself... another good is it is pet friendly...

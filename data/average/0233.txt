Hotel might need to update some rooms. The bathroom in ours was a bit dumpy. Wallpaper peeling off the wall. And there was no place to hang a towel around the sink area. Only towel holders were in the shower which I hate and on the back of the door. We stayed here at the end of a trip to Seattle. At the beginning of the trip we stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8 and it was really nice. New hotels are the way to go. Or updated ones...

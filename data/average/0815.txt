I stayed here for business as the W Seattle was sold out. I've always had great experiences with Westins, so had no doubt that I'd enjoy my stay here. The location is superb, right in the middle of downtown Seattle, and a 15 minute walk to the market. Service was excellent - front desk staff were courteous and friendly. The 3-star rating comes from the hotel appearance and upkeep. The floor on which my room was located was dull and dingy. The room was large, but the furnishing were tired, and although I had a view of the space needle, I was distracted with how dreary the room was. Of course, the bed was comfortable as they always are at Westins. I think that if a hotel calls itself a Westin, you should at least get the same quality of furnishings and ambience. It's a brand - like McDonalds, you expect that consistency no matter where you are.

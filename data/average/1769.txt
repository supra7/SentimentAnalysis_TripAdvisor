We just finished a vacation in Maui, and checked out on July 5th. Hotel room was very nice. Pool was outstanding; enjoyed by both adults and kids. The valet parking was convenient, and the valets were quick, and always willing to assist with directions. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but a little pricey. Try to get a '2 for 1' coupon when you check in. The beach was disappointing as there is only about 12 feet of sand from the water to the plants. If you plan to spend a day on the beach, you will need to travel. We found 2 great beaches (black rock, and airport beach). Both beaches are slightly north of the hotel (not within walking distance) and were great for snorkeling and relaxing. If you have anything valuable, be sure to lock it in the safe (in your room closet).

My husband and I just got back from spending one evening at the Mayflower. It is a very beautifully decorated hotel. We arrived early and they held our bags for us and called us when our room was ready. When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running. Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room. The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size. So if you want to stay specifically in downtown Seattle then I agree the Mayflower is definitely a good location, but if you don't mind staying out a bit, try the Holiday Inn Downtown Everett!! Well worth it!

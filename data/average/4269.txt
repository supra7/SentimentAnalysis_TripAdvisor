My Husband and I stayed at this hotel for a little over a week. We were very unhappy. The bathrooms are tiny. I'm 5'4 at 115 lbs and could barely fit in the shower. The was no coffee maker in the room and the front desk and conceirge were not helpful. Two days in a row the fire alarm went off and everyone had to vacate the building. The first time it was 4am and the second time was around 6pm. The only things that I liked were the beds, which were very comfortable and the location, which was great. The next time I return to Boston, I will not stay here again. You definitly don't get what you pay for.

I had a very good experience at the Denver Magnolia and since this hotel is a renovated National Register Landmark - the old Magnolia Oil Co. building, I was really excited about my stay. Securing a non-smoking room is a high priority for me and when my secretary booked my room, she was assured by the reservations desk that all Dallas hotels are totally non-smoking. When I arrived at the hotel, it took a while to find the front door because the hotel driveway is hidden off of the street. The lobby is small and tries to be chic but doesnt capture the grandeur or historic nature of the building. The original elevators, although charming, are small and slow. I carted my own luggage to my room and to my surprise, one of the maintenance men joined us on the elevator with a large cart loaded with equipment; it was really cramped in there. This class of hotel should have a separate elevator for the hotel maintenance staff. My assigned room was a huge suite with 12 foot ceilings, but the dcor was bland and there were obvious signs of wear. Almost immediately, I noticed a strong, disgusting cigarette smoke smell in the bathroom area. Unfortunately, my schedule was so tight that I didnt have time to run downstairs and try to secure another room. Also, since check-in took so long, I could not take advantage of the complimentary drinks that are served to guests (it closes at 6:30 pm). The bed was not comfortable (too hard) and even on the 11th floor, the shades must be drawn (over the blinds) to avoid the city lights and street noise from keeping you up all night. I did thoroughly enjoy the complimentary hot breakfast that is offered. The only other positive about my stay is that all members of the staff that I encountered were pleasant and helpful.

The best thing about the hotel is probably its location and its proximity to the big attractions in istanbul. I felt the hotel is quite basic and functional, rooms were ok. Was only here for a night due to a mix-up with my primary hotel booking. For the same price, i think there are better hotels in the neighborhood. The internal lift was a bit scary - no doors on it!! With kids be careful.

The Copthorne hotel is a short distance away from Dubai airport. It appears to be a transit hotel for travellers between connecting flights. There's a constant stream of people checking in and out at all hours of the day or night and the dining hall is almost always occupied. For a high-traffic, short-stay hotel, I found it perfectly adequate, The rooms were a surprise. Rooms open off an interminably long corridor. Rooms are small and narrow but quiet and comfortable with a soft bed - all I wanted at the end of a long flight. Amenities were basic - TV, flimsy wardrobe, in-room safe. Bathroom was utilitarian but adequate. The dining hall provided surprisingly good food, although it wouldn't be my first choice for a family night out. Kudos to the staff for keeping the place relatively spic and span, given the high volume of traffic and constant hubub. The lobby area, in the same vein, was utilitarian with guide ropes for queues as an indication of the traffic volume of people checking in/out. There were always people and luggage arriving or departing, so forget about a quiet chat in the lobby area. A nearby shopping mall provides a shuttle service for guests in between flights. Overall, the Copthorne is conveniently located and useful as a short transit stop, but not a good choice for a longer or relaxed stay.

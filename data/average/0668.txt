What a disappointment! We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while visiting Seattle a week ago. It was our first time in Seattle and we picked this hotel based on its location and the reviews that we had read. First off, the rooms are a lot smaller than what we are used to, but it's clean and comfortably decorated. Second of all, they keep charging us for things that we did not consume! We got a charge for a bottle of water that we did not drink. I already found it strange when we went back to the hotel after housekeeping came in the second day, we found an extra bottle of water by our night stand. We didn't think much of it since the seal is still intact, so we just left it where we found it. When we checked out the next morning, there was a charge of almost $4 for that bottle of water. After I explained it to them, they did take it off. As I was going through my credit card statement after we got home, I noticed there was another charge of $5.48 from the hotel. I called and asked and was told that was for a bag of m&ms and a snickers bar, which again we did not have!!!!!! Please beware of your bill and check closely if you do decide to stay at this hotel. One more thing, free wifi is only limited to the lobby area and parking is $49/day.

We are annual pass holders for Disney so we visit Orlando 6 times a year. World Quest is tucked away a quarter mile behind Nickelodean Hotels and it proximity to Disney is Superb! The two bedroom condo was clean, had plenty of room and all the amenities of home. The hotel staff were great and very nice. The pool was gorgeous but not close to us. We were in buikding 5 and it is almost a quarter mile from the pool. They have a nice complimentary breakfast that consist of toast bagels, and pastries. Grounds were emaculate and well kept. The resort is really not for foot traffic so you will need a car if you need to get to the store for anything, other than snacks. The resort is great for singles who like to party and do not need to sleep. The walls are paper thin and we could hear every door open and close above, below, and two rooms down from us. We could clearly here the couple next to us performing through the walls. In addition the resort sit parallel to the 417 highway so we could hear cars all night long; I advise to request a room for the other side of the resort so that you could eliminate the highway noise. There is a $13.00 resort fee and taxes per day. The beds are not for those that need halfway firm mattress to support their back; I way 160 lbs and I sunk into the bed. We booked the AAA offseason rate at $107 per night but it runs above the $170 mark at peak. AAA members were given a nice goody bag. If you are single and can deal with the nightly noise this is your place. If you have a 3 year old that naps during noon and sleeps at night you should strongly consider other options. We will not be back despite the number of nice things we mentioned, even at $50 a night because of the paper thin walls and ceilings; We like it quiet at night.

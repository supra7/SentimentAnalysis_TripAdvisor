We spent one night in Seattle just to see the Space needle, public market and to do some shopping in the center before picking up a rent a car and heading south. We liked the fact that it did not look like a hotel and that it was close to Space needle (little far from the center). But I like walking so it was no problem. We had a room on the first floor which was great considering that we were staying only for 1 night. I also liked that they had coffee and some muffins in the lobby for breakfast. Nice diverse restaurants in the same area.

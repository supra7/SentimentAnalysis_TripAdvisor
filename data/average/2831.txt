The breakfast was good. Hardboiled eggs.. Bread, meats, cheese.. Coffee, tea, OJ.. unlimited. Butter jelly.. cereal and milk.. The bathroom was freshly renovated in room 403, but it smelled a lot, and there was no shower curtain, so the place got soaked every shower. There was a tub, shower, toilet, sink, and mirror. Maid service was good and room was clean. Room had 2 twin beds pushed together. TV service was 31 chan's. mtv, etc.. 5 english. BBC news. Room on 4th floor, no elevator working made it a little difficult to go back to my room as often as I would have liked to. There was a big crack in the wall.

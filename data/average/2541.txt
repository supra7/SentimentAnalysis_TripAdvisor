As with all Travelodges this is a basic room with not many frills. The room was clean and tidy, the tele was fine, it wasn't too hot or cold and the aircon worked when we wanted it to. Breakfast was buffet style and although limited in choice was fine for the price. One day the room wasn't cleaned but we did have the "do not disturb" note on the door until about 11ish. If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a room towards the rear of the hotel as these are much quieter. Note you don't see anything out of the rear windows as there are flats directly opposite.

I stayed at the Park Plaza near Christmastime last year, and was attracted by the special rates offered by Expedia.com as well as the old charm of the hotel. The lobby was beautifully done up, but the rooms were not of a very good standard. The bathroom was very old and gave me the creeps. I am a lot more forgiving towards this hotel because I know it is very old- but the "ancient" heater in the room I was assigned to was faulty and funny sounds were coming from it. Despite the maintenance coming up very promptly to fix it, the sounds were keeping me up on my first night there, so the next day the reception kindly upgraded me to a better room, but I realized apart from the upgrade to a king bed and bigger room, everything else was the same. On the whole, for the price I paid, I thought it was okay, not fantastic in any sense. The location of the hotel is great, and the experience of staying in an old hotel with the old fixtures still in there was definite something to remember.

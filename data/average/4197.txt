This is a well-known old hotel in downtown Boston close to many tourist attractions and easy walking distance to Newbury Street. The hotel is right by the Arlington T station on the Green Line, so very convenient for getting around - just two stops direct to the Prudential Center, for example. It seems to have a typical big city mixed clientelle of tourists, conventioneers and other business types. The entrance lobby is large and quite grand - very similar in many ways to that of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York. The room I had was fairly small and not very light, but was perfectly clean with all the necessary amenities. Unfortunately the hotel does not have free wi fi in the rooms - there is wi-fi in the lobby and you can pay for internet access in your room. The best thing about the hotel was the attached restaurant which had really superb Virginia oysters for a dollar each at the bar.

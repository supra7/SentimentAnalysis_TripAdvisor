Ok - this hotel is a Westin and my expectations were high I know this is an old 70's (or earlier) building, and the lobby was renovated in the last 5 years probably But when I walked into my bedroom I was disappointed with old carpet, stains on the couch. If I had not just driven through a snow storm I would have left the hotel and driven to the Westin in Bellevue. The Bellman told me there is a $30 million dollar reno coming - and in my opinion it should have started 5 years ago. The 5ft Ave Grill was the only food option in the morning for breakfast - but it was cafeteria style and there was only one guy taking orders and working the till and there were about 15 people in line... I was very dissatisfied with that...but the food came quick and was good... Last thing - the view is great - but the surrounding neighbourhood is really sketchy - never walk around alone at night in DT Seattle I would NEVER return to this hotel until after the reno or they drop rates by 50% Oh and the internet was terrible

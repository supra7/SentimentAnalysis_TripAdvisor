Overall the Hotel is Beautiful. The valet is EXTREMLY courteous! BUT.....we were there to celebrate our anniversary and the room was important to our evening..... we didnt know that some rooms are NOT new and are NOT nice or luxurious! We both were VERY disappointed in our room!!! The view was nice but thats it! We booked this Hotel online and NO WHERE did it tell us that the hotel parking was another $40.00...that would have been nice to know in advance!

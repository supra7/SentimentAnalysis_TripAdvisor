I stayed in this hotel 4 nights. as gold hilton hhonors i was upgraded to executive floor and had access to executive lounge. I liked the view from my room, good location. What I didnt like was the staff. They were not friendly at all. Especially in the executive lounge I felt I am not welcome. The beverages and the breakfast was also bad. it cant be compared to what i am used to executive lounges in hilton hotels in europe. valet parking 28usd/night, self parking 25/night...around are other parking lots more cheaper (10usd/night). internet is free in the lobby. good restaurant for reasonable prices good fitness center

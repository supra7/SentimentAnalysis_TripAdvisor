The hotel is undergoing renovations, which is fine and will make for a better hotel, but some of the desk staff were really indifferent to rude. Offering 24 hour coffee in the lobby and wireless internet access in the room was appreciated. The 26 item breakfast didn't allow anything for someone wheat intolerant as I am and I was sorry to have asked if there were an alternative cereal in the stores.. :( Some of the desk staff were okay but for a business making its money in..er..tourism..the attitude of some of the others could well have been improved. Great location though! Being right at the foot of the space needle means the monorail into the city centre is right there as well, so makes for quick trips.

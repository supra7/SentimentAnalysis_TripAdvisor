Stayed here for five nights in March/April 2012. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are not laid out particularly well. But the location is fantastic. It's kind of bare bones by American standards, for example, only soap and shampoo is provided, no conditioner, no bottled water, etc. But for a basic place, it's a-okay, and the wi-fi is pretty fast. One odd thing though is that we found a MUCH better price online than was advertised at the hotel itself (fairly common), but our travel agent, who found the place for us, was also charged a heftier price than what we later found online. Not cool. Get with it, people.

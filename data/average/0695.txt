One of those that just did not hit the mark! Hotel has a quirky decor that belongs to a woodsy-pine lodge. Lots of rooms in set in a long corridor which is also tired and with frayed carpet. Walked by left-over food trays in hallways to access room. Rooms are poorly insulated for sound. Moved from first room because of noisy "passionate" couple. Woken up twice in new room by TV in next room mounted on adjacent wall! Hotel has decent food! But watch the extras - 36 dollar a day parking, 10 dollar i-net access. Best part of hotel - water view rooms. Not worth full price.

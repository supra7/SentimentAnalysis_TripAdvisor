The hotel was very beautiful and old. It was full of history and the staff was very helpful. The hotel is old and tired. The room never got cool even with the air conditioning set to maximum. For the price that you pay for this hotel a few amenities would be nice. We had a 2 year old traveling with us and had to keep his juice cold in the bathroom sink with ice. I have stayed at cheaper hotels and they had a mini fridge. It appears that the more you pay for in a hotel the less you get for your money.

I stayed at the Palmer House on business. I was so disapointed in the size of the room and bathroom. I had a small cosmetic bag and there was litterally no counter space in the bathroom, only a small ledge above the toilet where my things kept falling into. I was not too impressed by the check-in service although a particular bell hop was especially helpful. The concierge was medicore. I am going back on business in May and I am going to try staying somewhere else.

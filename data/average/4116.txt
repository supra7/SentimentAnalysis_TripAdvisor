While the location is ideal for wanting to be able to walk around downtown Boston, go the aquarium, and be near the park, the hotel was undergoing construction which was very disruptive and loud and made entering & exiting the hotel a nightmare. The ONE public restroom near the restaurant always had a line of at least 12 woman waiting to utilize the facilities. The room itself was comfortable, and the view was okay from the window. I did not find the staff very patient or helpful, although they were polite.

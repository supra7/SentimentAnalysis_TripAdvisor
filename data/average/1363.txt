The staff saved this hotel from a totally bad review. They were very friendly, good service and clean comfortable rooms. However, $20 a night for parking??? $15 a day for internet??? I was here for a conference and other participants stayed at hotel near the Hilton, their parking $10. Also, local conference participants who wanted to leave for lunch had to pay $12.95 to leave at lunch and then again when they left for the day!!!! What a rip off!!! So many hotels have free internet now, what's the deal with continuing to charge. Would not stay here again for conference or to catch a flight.

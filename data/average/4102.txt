It was a bittersweet experience at the BMCP.The hotel itself is a sorta of skyscaper close to the Prudential center and our room on 27th floor had a stunning view but the room looks a little bit old and the walls were incredibly thin that you have to put earplugs on if you don't want to listen to every single word said in the nearby room.However the room was very clean and the beds comfortable;plenty of eating places are available because the hotel shares a part of the building with the Prudential mall so you can simply go out from the elevator and find every eating place you like.The real nightmare was the pool/fitness center room:instead of relaxing you can easily losing temper going there because tons of children, accompanied by careless parents, ran around the pool and the jacuzzi diving into both of them simply forcing us to going out.The most disappointing thing is that nobody checked the situation so the rudeness domineered.Anyway I do think that the Radisson was a much better place to stay.

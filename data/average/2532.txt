This was an ideal place for us to stay being close to Euston tube giving great access to all the places we wanted to visit. Check in was fast (used express machine and had room key within a couple of minutes) room was clean and comfortable with no frills, as expected. Everything worked and had tea and coffee so we were happy. We were towards the rear of the building on the 3rd floor so it was quiet. I would ask for this when you book. We didnt eat there at all so cant comment on that but my daughter grabbed a coffee from the machine in reception on the way out. Quite expensive but handy. Check out was a doddle just put key in the box on way out! Would stay here again.

I spent 4 nights at the Crystal positive nice service and people very helpful.very good location negative" as a business traveller the gym opens only at 7 am in the morning too late if you work thats because they have condos owners at upper levels that complained i agree with them but when you book for a gym you should be able like all hotels to have access at 7 am love the room plenty of drawers but the bathroom has a very small area to put your toiletry on the bed are ok but not as comfortable as a real 5 stars hotels (comparing Westin montreal) i was awake in the morning by the bins collection at 5 am probably not coming back there is o better options in montreal but with few changes they could do much better

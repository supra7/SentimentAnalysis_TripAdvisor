Staying here on business it does what is needed, pretty functional and not too expensive. Where the hotel falls down is on the lack of speed on its internet connection and also on teh fact that this, and all the hotels on this area, are right under the flight paths of the jets meaning it can get noisy. Breakfast is changed every morning with two different hot dishes being put out for you to choose from alongside the regular stuff. Rooms are spacious and very clean

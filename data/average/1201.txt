This was the last of three hotels we stayed at on our trip. I was surprised that such a large hotel charged for internet access. Much smaller ones offered it for free. We arrived way early (9am) and thankfully, they let us check in early. The shuttle to the airport was great. It's about a half mile from the Light Link rail from the hotel, so the shuttle was great! The rail takes about a half hour to get to the Universtiy Street stop (near the waterfront).

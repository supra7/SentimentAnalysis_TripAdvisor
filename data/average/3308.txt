Stayed at this hotel for 1 nights (Sept 15 2009) Reserved online. Hotel was easy to find but parking was difficult to find. Also it cost 15 Euros per night to park. I thought that to be excessive. It is far from central amsterdam so not convenient if your purpose is to see the city sites and night life in a short time. Great if you are more leisurely. Strange looking from the outside, so really kind of cool. Very nice decor inside. All of the staff were friendly. Breakfast buffet was extra but very nice with a good selection of typical Dutch breakfast foods. The room itself was a good size, with 2 twin beds. My mother was happy, but I found mine to soft and everytime I rolled over, I rolled off. (I took points off room for that) Finally pulled my mattress to the floor and slept very comfortably. I know that sounds weird but at least it was clean enough that I felt comfortable to do that. The decor was clean and very attractive. The bathroom was spotless and lots of hot water. We couldn't hear any sounds from other rooms. There was AC and the windows opened. The hotel has free internet in the lobby. We travel to Netherlands about once per year, I would absolutely stay there again. The pictures of the rooms that the hotel posts are exactly what I saw and got.

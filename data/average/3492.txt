The layout and the view of the room is not as good as expected. The sea-view suite we got did not look like the one on their official web page (Maybe we got an "inferior" sea view suite.). One of the window was completely blocked by another building, and the arrangement of the other window was not ideal either (please refer to the photos). I need to walk toward the other window in order to see the view. While resting on the sofa or bed, I always saw the window that was blocked. Also, the location of the hotel is not ideal. The steep slope that everyone was complaining about is really steep. One day we hopped on a cab and showed him the name card that the hotel prepared for us, but the driver still could not find the right direction to the hotel. We had to instruct the driver and then got off once we could recognize the street (There were a lot of one-ways in that area).

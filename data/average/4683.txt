This hotel is nothing special, its simple, the rooms are ok but not flashy and some improvement could be made regarding the old furniture, especially the doorsthe room doors are so old and thin you can actually hear people talking and walking whenever they are in the corridor even if they are far away. The air circulating system at this hotel is not good, if the old-looking air/con system is switched off, it is actually difficult to breathe so we tried to stay out of the room as much as possible. There is free-wifi in the rooms which is a plus. All Hilton Garden Inns provide shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and body lotion, but no shower gel.they give you soap The location of this hotel is great, there is a subway stop just outside the door but the hotel is close to everything, so you can walk everywhere too. No noise coming from outside of the hotel. The staff is always smiling and nice, very welcoming and helpful, especially the girls at reception from Montenegro and the guy at the hotel entrance door. The Web Grill restaurant is very nice, we had breakfast there twice and we liked it, the price is ok and the food is good.

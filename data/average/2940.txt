We paid 58 Euros for our room, and it was the best price we booked while traveling in Italy and Spain for rooms with air conditioning and in room bath/shower. This met our objective for economical lodging the night before a flight out of Barajas Airport. However, it was somewhat difficult to reach via Metro when loaded down with suitcases, as it was a 6 to 8 block walk to the hotel. The streets were unclearly marked, we had a bad map, and it was hard to find. There are other hotels in this area that are similarly priced, have more facilities, and nearer the newer restaurants in Barajas. On the plus side, the bathroom in our room was recently remodeled and in excellent shape.

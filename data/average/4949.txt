Stayed in Feb for valentines day, checked in late afternoon, everything smooth. Hotel lobby was ornate and unique. Stayed on 18th floor, room was small and basic, but didn't expect much more from a historic hotel and booking on priceline. Got it for $85 on priceline, would highly recommend it. Valet parking was $51, ramp parking $36. Location was very nice & walking distance to museums & miracle mile. Hotel bar was cool but service a bit slow. Concierge helpful on Fri but nobody on Sat Valentines day at 7:30. Sunday check out was tedious, waited over 20 minutes for elevator! Probably was the floor we on. Valet parking took 10+ minutes but not horrible. Would stay again at this price any time!

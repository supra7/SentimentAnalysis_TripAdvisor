The title of my review says it all. This is a beautiful, grand old hotel. It's very impressive. The rooms were large and very clean. Beautiful marble in the bathroom. Flat screen tvs, internet hook-ups. Lots of charm. And then you go into the lobby and have to deal with a) someone at the front desk or b) someone in the Oak Room Bar. Rude, snotty, sullen and downright nasty about sums it up. Neither my husband nor I could believe that such a beautiful "grand dame" of a hotel has a staff as rude as the conglomeration of thugs at the Fairmont Copley Plaza. Not sure what's going on there but, if not for the staff, this place would be a home run.

Just stayed at the Radisson before and after a trip to Europe. So easy the work with - I arrived at 6:00am and all was ready for me. Very quiet rooms, but the bathrooms could be cleaner. Housekeeping staff needs to look up. Everything at eye level looked great but look up and the fans were filthy and drips and dirt on wall and door frame. Breakfast staff is more suited to the buffet breakfast rather than those of us that would prefer to order off menu. When I got thier attention I was served. Management needs to put some money into supplies for the dining room you had to search the room to find a salt and pepper shaker. They also had no pitchers for extra O.J.

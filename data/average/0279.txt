This "boutique" hotel is different because it is very plain. No a/c, small tvs, and minimalist decor. This is NOT a fancy place, but it is the right price for budget-minded travellers. The biggest problems are: 1. PARKING- The hotel has no parking and no agreement with local garages. You'll wind up parking nearby for about $20/day with limited access to your car, especially after dark. 2. Neighborhood- While it is two blocks from the Pike Place market, the street is a little rundown and a little shady after dark. The street noise might keep you awake at night in the summer. 3. Maintenance- The hot water did not work in our bathroom sink and the elevator is small and noisy. After 9pm, you have to use the elevator All those things being said, you cannot deny the value of this hotel for its location. Just be prepared to get the level of amenities appropriate for your money.

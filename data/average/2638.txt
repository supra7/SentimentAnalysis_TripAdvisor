Came here on business with my husband. He had conferences all day while I did day trips. I planned on just staying at the hotel for a few days since we didn't get a rental car. After coming here I wish we had. During the day it is fine in this area but at 7pm (after dark in Jan) we went across the street to checkers to buy a few cheap meals and just chill in our room after traveling all day. We were asked for money by EVERYONE who was walking by or in the area. I mean some of these people ran across the street to us to ask us! Even the guy at the hotel warned us to only use taxis after dark. No buses or walking around. The other hotel itself: We had a jr suite which is big and comfy but the furniture has seen better days. Scratches all over the tables and the door to the closet was broken off the hinges just laying aggaibt the wall. The bathroom is small and has no fan or heat lamp. The pool is NOT heated as the website states. When I asked about that no one was aware it ever was or that it was supported to be. I also saw online the rooms were to have plush bathrobes. I looked all over and found none. We are on 15 floor and habe ants. Not a big deal but just weird they are on the 15 floor! This places seems to be very clean and the lobby is really nice. Over all not bad but I do not think it is worth the price due to location. Staff very nice and helpful.

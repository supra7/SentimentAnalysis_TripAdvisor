The Edgewater is a really quirky hotel. Strange combination of brushed metal and log exterior. Very keen staff, tiny rooms. great location on the waterside, terrible location on the train track side. Very tidy rooms but they are tiny. Superb bathroom but no storage space. Every good point is really good, every bad point is pretty bad. The staff try really hard and overall the stay was OK. I couldn't give it a terrible review, nor a great one!

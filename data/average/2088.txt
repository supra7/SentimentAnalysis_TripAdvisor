The reception area was clean and the staff were friendly. When we entered the room it felt like we had walked into an oven. During the night we had to open the window (fortunately there were bars on the windows as we faced the main road) just so we could sleep. The beds were very hard and the pillows very thin and uncomfortable. The towels were not replaced every day and looked like they had been re-folded and layed across doona on the bed.. Many times the cups were not cleaned, teabags and milk not replaced On one occasion I asked for milk to be replaced but the staff never returned with it. The next time I spoke to them they were apologetic and if I had not stood at the reception and waited I am not sure if I would have received it at all. I bought my own milk in the end. It was close to public transport but as we often stayed out late I did not feel very safe at times walking back from the station. The breakfast was ok but I thought continental meant you got fruit with your cereal. .Positive experiences, the free Wi Fi and many of the take away food stores stayed open late There was a couple of little supermarkets nearby for supplies needed..

Helpful and courteous staff, who helped put together an itinerary for the 1.5 days I was there. They did try to sell a tour package, but were not too pushy about it. The breakfast is quite nice, with a good assortment of cheeses a part of the spread. However, it's definitely overpriced. I paid 49Euros a night for a room and realised that most hotels which were equally good and in the same area had rates between 25 and 35.

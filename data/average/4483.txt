We booked through Hotwire at a rate of $119/night. When we checked in we were told that we could have a room with one king or a room with 2 double beds. As Hotwire had guaranteed me a room that would sleep 4, I opted for the 2 bed option. The room was OK, but the beds were tiny!!! The hotel was more than happy to offer me a rollaway for $20/night!! I eventually received the rollaway at no charge. Unfortunately, my son had to sleep on the floor. Each bed held one adult, the rollaway 1 child and the other child had to sleep on the floor. If there are more than 2 in your party, I would not recommend this establishment. The indoor pool was OK but very small and there was not enough poolside seating. The rooms were very quiet and the beds comfortable. I would consider returning at a discount rate. There is no way that I would pay rack rate to stay here.

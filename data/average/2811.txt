This hotel is right on Canal Street. Convenient, but you do need to hop on the trolly that stops outside and go down a few blocks to get to Bourbon Street. It's a good location to get away from the noise and hustle that is on Bourbon if that is what you are looking for. There are quite a lot of people that seem to congregate on the side of the street that the hotel is on so if you don't want to be hassled, cross the street or hop on the trolly. The hotel does not have a restaurant but you are able to order food from a restaurant called Duffy's down the street and they will deliver it to you. The food from there is not bad and the portions are good sized. If you opt to try getting a drink or snack out of the vending machines, just plan on losing your money now. For the entire stay of 5 days during Jazz Fest, I don't think they were refilled once. It's easier to just stop at the CVS or Walgreens down the street, stock up on stuff, and keep it in the kitchenette in the room. The rooms were actually pretty big. The beds were very comfortable & the a/c can get pretty cold which is a bit of a relief when it's 80% humidity down there. Be careful in the shower...there are no mats on the shower floor and it is quite possibly the most slippery tub in the world. I should have been wearing swim shoes in there! At least then I wouldn't have fallen over and bruised my hip pretty badly. Funny at the time but the pain of the next 4 days was not. There are odd stains on the walls, floors, etc. so if this stuff makes you queasy, this will not be the place for you. Overall for the price you pay, it's an ok place to stay. I think next time I might just pony up the extra dough and stay in the Quarter though! Lesson learned.

The hotel is in the pleasant embassy quarter in the north east, too far away from the centre to walk, but a relatively easy bus ride away from the Repubblica metro stop. Still, for such a distant location it is an expensive hotel. Upon first view I tended to understand the steep price, because the Principe Torlonia looks great from the outside, and the garden, while not big, is also very nice. The big problem came when entering the room. I should point out that we didn't stay in the main building, so I cannot comment on those rooms. We stayed in one of the special hotel suites in the little, separate building in the garden. While these suites were comfortable enough, the smell of mold and fungi was so strong that one could barely stand it. Ventilation did not solve it, so it must be a persistent problem. For this price this is really unacceptable. So if you decide to stay at this hotel, request that you are in the main building.

I went with the "all inclusive" and enjoyed the food and drinks... the service was outstanding (IMO). When I showed up at the restaurant, the waiter knew what I liked to drink and he would bring it... He knew I loved chocolate and he would always have some unbelievable dessert... I had never been pampered this much. I also liked the internet cafe... I liked my latte and dessert while I was reading my emails. The hotel still is lacking some luster... it still looks a little plain... the pool is nice and the rivers are fun to navigate through but something is missing for me... not sure what. The beach in that area is not the best but there is a little piece where the river meets the ocean that is nice. The entrance to the hotel is like a jungle... very eco-friendly... but it reminds me of mosquitoes... didn't get too many bites but it was February... a little nippy. The rooms are pretty big and I liked having a balcony with a jacuzzi... facing the ocean... I think it's going to be a great place but it needs more time to marinate!

I stayed here for four weekday nights on a business trip because it was the cheapest hotel near downtown Seattle on Hotels.com ($63/night). Pros: -- A 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown. -- Great 24-hour coffee in the lobby and a continental breakfast with good selection including waffles. -- Free wireless internet. Ask if you can get a room close to the router for the strongest signal. -- My king bed was extremely downy, clean, and comfortable, with lots of plump pillows. -- The rooms do look like they've had a low-budget remodel, with new chairs, paint, and finishings. Cons: -- My shower would not get warmer than body temperature even when I cranked it all the way up. Standing shower only, no tub. -- There's a lot of construction going on half a block away on a new condo building. It was only noisy during the day, but it could be annoying. -- The elevators are tinny, creaky death traps. -- Some of the furnishings in the room were crappy: 1/2 halogen lights, 1/2 incandescent, chewed up nightstands, little fake-wood mini fridge. -- The "business center" is 2 computers and a printer on a desk in the lobby. Only one computer prints, and they charge $1 per sheet to print. -- $10 parking lot fee per day. Besides the water temperature thing, it was pretty much what I expected for the price. No reason to stay near the Space Needle if you're a tourist, unless you're in love with it or something. It's a little north of "real" downtown.

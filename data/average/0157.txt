Condition of hotel is as expected for the price paid, so no complaints there but the reception staff here have turned uselessness and not communicating into a new science. Despite having spoken English as my first language for my entire life, I think I had an easier match communicating with hotel staff in Europe. It's as if they go out of their way to misunderstand what you are saying, and when the message finally makes its way across, they're really good at passing the buck to other staff members. Our luggage did not arrive with us on our flight to Seattle, and although that is no fault of the hotel or staff, the front desk staff were less than helpful with facilitating its eventual delivery to the hotel, in one instance telling someone who had phoned for us that we were not staying at the hotel when we in fact were, and when the luggage did finally arrive, we were not notified despite being told quite tersely that we would be. When we asked at the front desk we were told very dismissively that there had been no deliveries, and had we believed that we would have unknowingly left Seattle with our baggage still in the hotel due to the lack of ability on behalf of the hotel staff to communicate with us and each other. If the staff were at least friendly, their incompetence could be excused. Aside from this though, Terry the Concierge was fantastic and was streets ahead of the front desk staff, and the location of the hotel is very convenient, as is the free breakfast on the 32nd floor for the rates that include it. If you can pack some spare time, do so because this hotel has won the award for slowest elevators in history! Perhaps it is set up that way to provide you with more time to deal with the frustration towards the front desk staff before you get to your room...(?)

After a miserable day at Sea-Tac, we thought the Doubletree would be heaven. Well, not quite. The hotel is divided into different wings. The crappy wings are old and the rooms smell musty. The decor and bathroom are straight from the 70's!! ( Liekthe Brady bunch!). Rooms are not particularly posh or large. Ours was kind of dingy, definitely in need of a remodeling. My wife and I stayed only 1 night before flying out of Sea-Tac the next morning. Hotel was fine for our purposes, but I wouldn't have wanted a longer stay there. Beds were very comfortble . Free internet access in the lobby only and open 24 hrs. . Pool and whirlpool were nice, but would prefer 24 hr. access like health club. Room service was typically expensive . We ate at both the lounge and the cafe and food was average at best, but the service VERY GOOD! (Eben the bus boy made sure we were served well) The front desk staff was also very good! The exterior of the buildings in these wings looks like some outdated Polynesian tiki architecture. The room room's AC was working fine and it was pretty quite. No airplane or traffic sounds. The free airport shuttle runs every 15 mins or so and really helped us catch our flight the next morning. So overall you get what you pay for. I got a good night sleep.

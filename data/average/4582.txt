I used a American Express Travel Reward to stay at the hotel. As many other people have noted, the Lobby is a bit annoying, as it is on a seperate level of the hotel, but do not let this distract you. The hotel is very plain and average. They are undergoing a major renovation, which will take months..I would WAIT to book here until that is complete. The Staff were very friendly, but there seemed to be very few of them. The room was very plain, and the bathroom horrible...clean, but very aged. The bed was the only plus about the hotel. Very plush. I would book somewhere else, until they are finished with renovations.

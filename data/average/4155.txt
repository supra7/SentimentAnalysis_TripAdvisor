Stayed for three days, during a business show. The location of the hotel is excellent, if you want to be surrounded by some very nice restaurants. It is about a $10 cab ride to the Boston Convention Center. The hotel offers parking packages so, make sure you get it included in your room fee. You then have to give your car to the valet, as they have to park the car for you, trust me. My room was clean but, the bathroom was tiny. The toilet was wedged in between the tub and the wall. It's a good thing I go to the gym. A large person has no shot so, make sure your room has a full size bathroom. My tub and shower curtain were from the 1950's. In addition, they charge for internet, which really bothers me. Why does a small hotel give you free internet and a fancy one charge you -- money grab. Heat in the room was fine and hot water was plentiful. All in all, a mixed bag.

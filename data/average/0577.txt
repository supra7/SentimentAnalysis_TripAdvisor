My wife and I stayed here on Dec 27th 2008, taking advantage of their Macy's shop and stay package $199/night rate that came with the Macy's $100 gift card. The pros: they upgraded our room to a reasonably high floor, quiet corner room. The room was clean and the sheets were clean. The bed was comfortable. The waitstaff was very friendly. The cons: The sheets were extremely noisy - I roll over often in the night and every time I moved I woke my wife up - I even woke myself up a few times. The worst thing though was the wait-staff attempting to barge into the room at 9:30am on Sunday morning (we had the door lock across, so they did not actually get in). My wife was getting dressed. They said they knocked, but my wife was near the door and did not hear any knock - it really upset and shook her up. The knock however to me that doesn't matter. We like to sleep in - we could have been asleep and they would have walked in and woke us up. No way should anyone be entering any occupied room at 9:30am on a Sunday. Just really poor policy. I really got upset with the manager, and to his credit, he tried to make good - he gave us the parking for free and said he would add another 2500 starpoints to my starwood card. I am not so sure I would stay here again - but I think that if I were to again, I would be sure to put the do not disturb sign outside my door and let the front desk know to keep the waitstaff out until checkout.

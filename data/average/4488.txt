You can't seem to go anywhere in this hotel without having to smell the noxious chemicals they pump into the air to make the place smell better. The hallways and elevators get spritzed along with the rooms and restrooms. It's enough already! I know this is a part of a broader trend in the industry but it's simply over-done at this property. I even caught them spraying in the gym - the place was packed at 6.00 pm and some guy came in and started spraying a nasty blue spray on the carpets - I had to stop my work out. If it hadnt been for all the headache-inducing smells I would have rated this place higher. The staff are friendly and responsive and the rooms are functional and nicely furnished (although no safes). It's still in transition as they remodel in different areas so be prepared for some disruptions and noise.

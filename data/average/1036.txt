My husband and I arrived at the W at 4:40 to check-in (check-in time is 3pm.) There were many people waiting in line ahead of us, and I noticed everyone was being told their rooms were not ready. Luggage was being taken by the desk clerks and assembled near the entrance to the bay of elevators...wouldn't a bell desk be helpful for that?? When it was finally our turn to check-in we were told that our room would be ready in an hour to an hour and a half! This wasn't going to work for us because we had dinner reservations and needed to change. We were told to stand off to the side and they would see what could be done. After about 10 to 15 minutes we were told we could have the keys to our room. We appreciate this, but really didn't expect to have to wait. We have stayed at many hotels in Seattle on Saturday nights, and have never been told our room may not be ready until 6pm!! The corner "Fabulous" room was nice, but had TERRIBLE lighting. We were also dismayed to discover in the morning that there wasn't a coffee pot in the room. We will never stay at the W Seattle again, and look forward to our next Saturday night in Seattle at the Grand Hyatt!

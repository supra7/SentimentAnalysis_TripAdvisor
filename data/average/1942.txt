My husband and I were there this past December until the beginnig of January for six days. I was very surprised when I arrived to the KBH. As soon as you set foot in the lobby you can sense that the hotel is very outdated. For the amount of money we paid (high peak season) I was expecting something a little nicer. We had informed them that we were celebrating our honeymoon. They told us when we checked in that there was a little something waiting for us in our room. I was expecting maybe matching bath robes or rose petals on the bed (something romantic maybe). Instead it was a card, and two plastic, stained champagne flutes and a bottle of cheap champagne in the refrigerator located inside the closet literally outside the bathroom door!!! The KBH is definitely not a place to stay to celebrate this kind of occasion. We requested a newly renovated room and stayed on the 6th floor in the Lanai wing. Our view was the garden, whale pool, and part ocean view. The pool was always very crowded and very difficult to find a place to sit. KBH is a hotel to book for a family vacation. It is definitely a "kid friendly" hotel. They provide ample activities for children to take part in. However, despite its lack of modernization, the hotel is very clean, staff are very friendly and catering. Word of advice if you are making a reservation make sure to request a renovated ocean view room! The breakfast at the Mixed Plate was tasty (but nothing to brag about). The food at the Tiki Terrace ( restaurant on the premises) was excellent. Their pina coladas are pretty good. They have a musical performance daily for a few hours, but it's literally the same performance daily so that can get boring. You'll hear the same songs each night. Overall our stay was pretty good but would have liked something a little more modern so if your looking for something a little more luxurious this is not the place. From a scale between 1 through 10 I would rate this hotel a 6.

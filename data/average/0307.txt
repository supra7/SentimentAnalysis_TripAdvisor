Positives: Location is great, its close to the Pike market, shopping and food options. Staff was very friendly Negatives: This hotel is very old and you can see by the wooden window frames and building structure. Its been updated but its still nothing special. The elevator was a huge problem, we had to wait so long for it and only one of the two elevators worked. The elevator would always take you down to the basement where the cleaning supplies are for no reason. Parking is in the building beside the hotel so you have to walk a little ways to get anywhere. Our toilet bowl was black when we got there (toilet is white). The washrooms are ridiculously small.

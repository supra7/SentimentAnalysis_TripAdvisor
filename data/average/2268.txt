we stayed here for 2 nights from june 30th in room 306. the hotel was very clean and the hotel staff very friendly,the breakfast was fine with plenty to eat and a good choice. the bedroom was ok,a bit minimal just a bed,1 folding chair,tv,2 lamp tables and some open hanging space for clothes,the bathroom was good very clean and a decent shower. our problem was that we had a back room which i had understood to be facing a courtyard,but it faced a really run down apartment block,which was maybe 10 feet away and to be honest was a real slum so that was your view should you look out or venture out onto the what would have been nice but for this balcony,it had to be far by the hotel been or tried to be sheltered by a trellis of fake ivy floor to ceiling,but that was our only downer,so that if we stayed at hotel courious again we would only take a front of hotel room. there was a lot of noise from 8am with the workmen remodelling the building next door,not hotel courious fault,but something else to consider and it looks like it will take a long time to finish. so hotel,staff and room all good just back rooms a definate no.

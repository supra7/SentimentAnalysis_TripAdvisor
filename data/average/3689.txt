The rooms here were very clean, the bath was bigger than the usual and the curtains kept the room quite dark. Our room was on the 21st floor but we could still hear traffic and nearby construction. The hotel has a free shuttle which will take you anywhere in a three mile radius and pick you up which is great but certainly expect to wait about 10-15 minutes for the shuttle to become available and do not expect to be picked up on time. The check in staff were very chirpy and insisted we should ask for anything we needed but when we attempted to get dinner we were ignored for 15 minutes, so we left opting for room service instead. We were told our room service wait would be 25 minutes but had to call after 45 minutes only to be told our wait was another hour! An 18% gratuity is automatically charged. We requested a late check out but were told it would cost $50. Breakfast was free but quite average and apparent there are free cookies but we didn't attend for that.

Stayed at the Hilton Back Bay for a long weekend in April. Nothing spectacular, nothing to complain about. Our room was clean and very spacious. There was about 7 feet in between the end of the bed and desk. The staff seemed very friendly and concierge was very helpful. Close to Prudential, the T and some pretty decent food options. Only thing that was not cool was the $35 a night parking fee. But i do believe that's the average fee for hotel parking in Boston.

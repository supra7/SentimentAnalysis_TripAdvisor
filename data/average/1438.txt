This hotel is a block from the town square where events are frequent, but otherwise a bit out of the way and the area is pretty run-down. Room small but clean, and wi-fi good. Parking in a secure but small area behind the hotel. Decent continental breakfast and friendly and helpful desk attendants (with limited English)

This is a typical Novotel, the only thing amiss is plastic cups in the rooms instead of glasses, however inexpensive. Location is a problem however. It's in south Amsterdam, half an hour's drive from the centre, next to the Zuid station. You can get there direct from Schiphol airport either by train or by car, no need to go to the centre at all. It is supposed to be close to the train station, but it isn't really, not if you've got any luggage. The business district of Zuidas is a 20-minute vigorous walk. The hotel is basically in the middle of nowhere, with just residential streets around it. Not even a shopping centre really close, no next door restaraunts or cafes or anything. Why they built it there I can't understand. If you're there for the business district, try the Crown Plaza, or maybe Hilton or the one across the street from it -- its a much shorter walk.

The room was beautiful and comfortable. The service was great. The pool was fun with amazing people watching opportunities, and I enjoyed the novelty of it being hung over the sidewalk. But after coming back to the hotel entirely exhausted I could not sleep because of the incessant thumping noises coming from cars and clubs alike. Not the hotels fault really. But if you want to sleep there ask for a room away from the street or go to another hotel.

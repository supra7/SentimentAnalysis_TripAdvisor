I grew up in Boston so my family and I stay there for periodic visits. I booked through the hotel website and the "Park and Stay" rate was $159 which stipulated: "Stay with us 2 or more nights this summer and get discounted parking for $10 per night. The rate on this package includes the discounted parking." We were charged the rate PLUS $30 for three night's parking. When I called to complain, the man repeated that the charge would remain, that he was at the front desk ,and could he take down my home number and call back. He never phoned back. The next day, I spoke with a manager and he also could not understand how I could be confused by their wording. What part of INCLUDES THE DISCOUNTED PARKING did they not understand? He agreed and I have since been reimbursed. FYI the parking fee is now $30 per night. We've stayed there numerous times and the hotel housekeepers always do a fine job. The suites are spacious and allow our kids to sleep in the pullout sofabed while my husband and I have the bedroom. As for location, once you step out you pretty much have to cross what feels like highways. The fitness center has new equipment and our kids love the 3-5 feet deep pool, but you can go for a jog right outside along the Charles River on Memorial Drive. As for food outside of the hotel, walk across the bridge over the Charles which turns into River St. You will have crossed into Cambridge, MA and straight down on River St. there's a Whole Foods Supermarket. A 5-minute walk from the hotel and food that's alot better.

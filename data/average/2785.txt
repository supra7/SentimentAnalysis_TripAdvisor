This hotel was a 5 minute walk to the "Walk of Fame". The Hollywood sign is visable on the hill behind the hotel. Hollywood is a place that would be best visited for a day. There is not really enough to do here to stay here. The area is not where the beautiful people live. It is in close proximity to Universal, but if you have been to Universal Florida, you will be dissappointed by that park. I was very annoyed by the 1 washer and 1 dryer inconvenience for the entire hotel and the ridiculous cost to use them. the pool was small, outdoors and cold.

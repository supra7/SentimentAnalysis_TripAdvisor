Wonderful staff, great location, but it was definately the price was high for a standard hotel. The free breakfast was great, actually pretty good quailty for a free buffet. This hotel is in the heart of it all, walking distance to everything. 2 things, please Hyatt...the coffee was bad and the white ginger line of shampoo/conditioner/soap smells horrible!

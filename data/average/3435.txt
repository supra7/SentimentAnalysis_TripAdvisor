Since I have Holiday Inn card, and stayed at Crown Plaza in KL, expected the same kind of service/roorm- big disappointment.. Was not asked if I wanted a ride to the reception when carts passed me by in both directions. Food was extremely expensive & not exceptional for price. Pool- cold water & no one was using. Room OK, not as good as Crown Plaza KL. Was billed twice for ther room & had to call Singapore to get it adjusted. Would rather stay at Ambassador transit hotel at airport or go into town when back in Singapore.

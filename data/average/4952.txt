I was looking forward to my stay at the Palmer House. I got a good pre-paid rate for a king room on the website. I was somewhat disappointed. The room was pint sized. Furnishings, including the TV needed an upgrade. Public areas were better. Location is great, so overall it is a mixed bag. If you don't expect too much, and if you get a good rate, the Palmer House is an OK choice, but if you are expective a five star experience, look elsewhere.

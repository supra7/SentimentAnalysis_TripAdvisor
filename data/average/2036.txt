+ Reasonably cheap + Clean - Very far from the main attractions - In a not-very-nice suburb - Next to a highway (too noisy) We stayed here for two nights as the last days of our trip to Italy. The hotel is situated in a suburb far away from many attractions and it does not look like the safest area in Rome. We are told by the reception, however, that they have never had any problems regarding safety of the guests and it might very well be true since it is very close to the metro station and the path from the station to the hotel is along a highway with a bus terminal in between. The rooms are clean yet very basic, thus one should not expect any luxury. The breakfast is also very basic and mainly comprises packaged cakes and bread. There is WiFi internet in the lobby and the breakfast room and a computer with internet access in the lobby. The hotel is situated next to a highway and the rooms are not 100% sound-proof, so during night you may still suffer from the traffic noise. The metro passes right under the hotel and it makes some noise, as well (from 12:30 AM to 5:30AM there is no metro traffic). All in all, it is among the cheapest options for staying in Rome, yet you may think of spending a bit more and staying near the main attractions in a better area.

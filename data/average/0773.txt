The good: Clean, very comfortable bed, attracts nice people (no weirdos) The not so good: Very small roms (especially for the price), literally could not stand straight on to the basin for a shave. Location is a bit outside the centre up some very steep hills (NB if you are walking). Expensive restaurant (but of course you don't need to eat there. I stayed at this hotel for six days and got a relatively good rate via one of the aggregator websites. I don't know if I got a particularly small room because I wasn't paying full rate - cannot tell because I didn't see the inside of any other standard rooms. Generally I was very pleased and this review would have been a 4 or 5 star one. But hotels like The Sorrento like to tell us that it is the little details that differentiate them. Sadly my whole view of the hotel turned around within the space of a few minutes. I had made a specific point of enquiring about using the complimentary shuttle car the day before I needed it to take me to the train station. I was told explicitly that I needn't worry and I couldn't book it ahead of time, I should call back a few minutes before needing it and there wouldn't be a problem. So the next day I called up half an hour before required to try and book the shuttle only to be told that it wouldn't be available for a few hours as the car along with many others was need for a very high value client activity. So my 850 is for my stay wasn't important enough for one short journey. Up to that point The Sorrento would have featured on my list on a return to Seattle but I'm afraid that one "small" incident knocks them off my list. There are undoubtedly many fans of The Sorrento - I'm not now one of them.

If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the airport with above-average shuttle service and great customer service- this is an excellent choice. The rooms are a bit worn at the edges- bathrooms and furniture need updating (bit of a 70's feel), beds are not the best I've seen in Doubletrees- but better than other hotel chains, and the balconies are scary and tacky. However, the rooms are spacious, the vanity outside the bathroom is great for families, and everything seems clean. If you are looking for a one night hotel before a flight or cruise this would be a fine choice. However, if you are looking for a place for a multiple night stay, prefer modern decor, and are expecting great views- this is not the best selection. If you're a business traveler used to Hilton Honors hotels- check out the Hilton Seattle Airport (a block or two down from the Doubletree). I have stayed there as well and found it to be a better selection for a similar cost.

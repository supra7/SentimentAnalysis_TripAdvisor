Knowing that almost every hotel in Singapore often have good occupancy, so they don't care much wether guest return to stay their hotel again. That's my second time staying at this hotel and there was no impression upon check-in . I requested triple room , but the first day I found the amenities set up for 2 persons and I informed to receptionist before I went out . She agreed to add one more set but when I returned back at the late evening , I found nothing additional. Till, I called for reception again , then I got an additional one. It seemed that there was only acknowledgement without passing the message to their team. The wall in my room was torn and a bit dirty , we just saw in the night before we check-out. The sofa in front of counter was torn and dirty as well. Besides these negative points, we found that Cambodian staffs over there are very friendly & helpful , they could provide more information that we wanted. There is shuttle bus every morning which is convenient to go MRT station .

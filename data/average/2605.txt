We spent one night at the Wyndham Chelsea. It is a newer, small (!) hotel on a quiet NYC side street. We had a standard king-bed room. The 2 queen bed room costs more. The room was among the smallest that we have stayed in, at about 180 SF, including a corner bathroom. With a small desk, soft chair, and closet, there was not room for much else. The bathroom was just OK, with skimpy towels. A coffee making machine was in the closet, but no mini-fridge. Our rear-view rom was quiet, but less than pretty. I got this for $100 through Priceline when the least online was $149, so I was satisfied for one night. I would recomment it, but barely. The service people were very helpful and considerate of our requests.

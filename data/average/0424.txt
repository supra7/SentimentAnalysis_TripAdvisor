it was okay since we got this from priceline. walls are thin since the neighbors next to us complained about the noise our kids were making (and they weren't making that much noise - we have never gotten complaints before). we did go the weekend of bumpershoot so probably not people with kids. a lot of construction going on at the hotel and a new building will be going up nearby soon. view from the pool is awesome. rooms are clean and new. no free internet but easy to pick up other networks. staff was a little stuffy. we asked a few questions about parking and then checked out. the person we asked about parking made a point to make sure the person checking us out had us charged for parking. oh - parking is $30 per night and is about the only option if you have a car. car is not necessary but helpful since most sites are several block walk, but hotel is 2 blocks from the bus lines that are in the free zone.

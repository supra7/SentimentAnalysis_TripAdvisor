Location excellent, atff worked really hard especially conference food/beverage/IT, meertings,. Rooms small and dated (bathroom- think cruise ship) but typical for a city location. What really ruined my weekened was the 3 calls a day I needed to make to security to report my neighbors on the 7th floor who were smoking non stop. Colleagues reported the same on the 8th and 14th floors. Our clothes, towels and linens really smelled bad. The hotel is non smoking and has a fine policy but clearly this not enforced, Worse is that in such an old building, a fire would be a disaster. The hotel needs to be proactive and police their smoking guests!!!!

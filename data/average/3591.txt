Came with a large group and rented 3 condo's. All 3 condo's had maintenance problems. The carpet got flooded in one room, because the plumbing pipe was disconnected. In our room the phones didn't work, the carpets were dirty, and the room had a foul smell of plumbing being backed up. Most importantly, the fire alarms had a short in it and went off for 45 minutes, during our stay. Thirdly, the breakfast was disappointing, I wanted something hot. The children got tired of cold cereal and breads/pastries. Maybe my expectations were to high, but I expected the maintenance of these condo's to be better than that. Nice Rooms, but poorly maintained. Beds were very uncomfortable. On top of that they charge you a lot for basic housekeeping, extra towels, and for Shuttle service other than Disney World.

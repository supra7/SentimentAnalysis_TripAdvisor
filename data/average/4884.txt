Stepping into this hotel is like stepping back into the 1930s. The decor, the atmosphere, the music played overhead and even down the hallways that take you to your room. The rooms are the same way. One of the things about older hotels like this one is that rooms vary greatly in size and decor. It isn't all uniform like newer places. We had very nice and very clean rooms (the hotel itself was very clean). The only signs of aging that I saw were the closet and bathroom doors. We had 2 rooms that were joined by a door-one was a 2 double and 1 was a king. Warning: the large KIng is equal to your standard King anywhere else. The hotel's "standard" is a CLOSET(we happen to walk by one that they were cleaning)! The 2 doubles room, however, was a pretty good size with a sitting area. It seemed quiet as far as not hearing other guests so the walls didn't seem thin. If you book, definitely request a higher up room. We stayed on the 9th floor and we could hear everything outside! FYI there is an L train station literally right outside the hotel so if you stay on a lower floor-bring ear plugs! It goes by often. or request a room on the other side of the building. Great location otherwise-you couldn't do better. There's a CVS and walgreens on the same block for forgotten items, a starbucks in the hotel. It's right in the heart of downtown where everything seems to be in walking distance or a short cab ride away. 8 to 10 min walk to the water tower. We also took an $8 cab ride (that includes tip) to the mall where the lego store is. Countless shops around this area. No free breakfast here, just to let you know and to rent a fridge i think is $30 and a microwave is $40! Also you have to pay to use the fitness center but not the pool.

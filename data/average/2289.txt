Parrot Key Resort is very nice, very new. Was not told that I would have to walk up one flight of many steps to get to second floor and yet another flight of many steps to get to third floor of cottage facing pool area. Found it very expensive for what we had. Also, body of water, i.e., Gulf of Mexico, not in sight. Two pool areas on property.

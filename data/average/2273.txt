We spent 2 nights in the Curious for 88Euro/night breakfast included. The room was very clean, spacious and well equipped, only a safe was missing (and the minibar for all those who like minibars, what we don't). The location is very central, just 50m off the Rambla and the Barri Gotic. Unfortunately, the building structure is so old and not re-done, that when you neighbour goes for a shower, you have the impression he stands on top of your bed, and we had a neighbour enjoying taking showers early in the morning.... Furthermore, the reception staff was not really helpful, nor smiling. Last but not least, if you expect vitamins in form of fresh stuff like fruits on a breakfast buffet, then do not expect it at the Curious. There are only white bread bakeries, sugar-stuffed convenience junk and cold coffee. Overall, good for small budgets, but not really pleasant in all aspects.

I have written many of these reviews and am convinced that readers are not that ambitious to know what are the stellar qualities of a hotel, its services, and location. They are widely published elsewhere, even by the property itself. Let me isolate some concerns i have about this hotel that the hotel itself might consider rectifying to enhance its hospitality: 1. I realize that hotels thrive on groups, but during my recent visit my colleagues and I had to navigate the lobby and breakfast areas that were filled with sports teams and bridal parties. It might be helpful to encourage these groups not to congregate around the elevator or other passable areas. Too, guests should not be permitted to be playing the Wii or even in public areas drinking beer, no less in bottles! Another way that crowds might be ushered along is to have employees clear tables in the breakfast area. The staff seems to be hidden and could be better utillized. 2. While I appreciate the security the hotel has to access higher floors, I have two concerns. First, what made the hotel designers think it was a good idea to have the security card insert so close to the floor. When you have things in your hand and have to do so much negotiation, it becomes quite an adventure. Secondly, unfortunately, security measures are in place on the "lobby" and "ground" floors, but there needs to be more monitoring of the noise and rowdiness on the upper floors. 3. My colleague and I are Platinum members of the Marriott rewards program. Both of us, to the shagrin of our families, spend over one hundred nights at Marriott properties. Many properties acknowledge our loyalty by a welcome word of gratitude and offer us an upgrade. The front desk staff at this property was interested in finding out what brought us to town rather than acknowledging our loyalty. Might be time for staff development about branding and loyalty programs.

After all the negative reviews here, I was quite scared when I "won" this hotel at Priceline for $85 per night for a stay in June. But, I have to admit, I was positively surprised. The lobby is just gorgeous, and worth taking a look at even when not staying at this hotel. The desk staff (Ana) was soooo nice and even let me check in early at 10 am ! She gave me the requested room with two double beds on the 11th floor. The room was quite spacious - that's why I requested a room with two doubles, because I read about those "European rooms" with only one queen or king bed. The bathroom was rather old, but still clean and the double shower heads are just fine. Housekeeping left a lot of toiletries for me and even wrote a "Thank you" note for the tip I left. The beds seemed to be quite old and not that comfortable comparing to a Marriott Revive bed, but still OK. The location is outstanding. Literally steps away from Boston Common, the "T" (subway) and the freedom trail. Copley is reachable within minutes by feet and hey - try the Applebees at Copley Place (Huntington Ave) - staff and food are just great there. All in all, a nice and CLEAN hotel, which is old, but by no means dirty, filthy or anything like that. I think the management does everything they can to keep up this old and huge hotel, and one should not expect the Hyatt or Hilton when coming here. But, the rack rates which are above $200, are too high for this property.

We stayed as a group as a result of exhibiting at the PGA Golf Show. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Location was a taxi ride to the convention center and taxi to the restaurants. All in all a good hotel for exhibitors but I wouldn't necessarily saty if I were not on holiday. The breakfast area was basic and cramped and the pool area was basic. On the plus side food was delivered fast. The rooms were comfortable but basic- great for a family on a budget. I would recommend this hotel but there are tons to choose from in the area.

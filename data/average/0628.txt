We stayed here one night at the end of January on a Saturday night. I chose this hotel because it was relatively cheap ($85/night) and the location seems great for where we needed to be. Note that this is a budget hotel so everything is very basic. Pros: The location is fairly central so we were able to walk everywhere. The employees were all friendly and extremely helpful. They offer free wi-fi; the room comes with a fridge and microwave; and parking is cheap for Seattle standards at $15/day. Cons: Paper thin walls, so thin, we were kept awake by our neighbours talking (not yelling, but talking) 'til the wee hours of the morning (5AM). The water pressure in the shower is not the greatest. I think the windows were NOT double glazed, so there was not much insulation from the noise outside, but this did not really bother us as we are used to city noise (in fact, it seemed quieter than what we are used to living in downtown Vancouver). Would I stay here again? Probably not, especially if I can get a 4* hotel on Priceline for approximately the same price. I actually feel terrible for saying this because the staff were nothing but helpful, friendly, and amazing. Too bad about the paper-thin walls and lack of water pressure - these are possible deal breakers for me because I need my sleep and a hot steamy shower.

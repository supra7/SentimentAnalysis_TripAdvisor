Was traveling in Seattle to visit with family and although most of reviews were unfavorable, I still chose the Univesity Travelodge given the proximity to my family. Generally, my opinion was the hotel is overpriced considering the quality of the accomodations but was still a reasonable alternative when compared to the other hotels in the University area.

We are frequent travelers to Montreal, and we've stayed in lots of hotels in the downtown area. We chose the Hilton Garden Inn Centre-Ville based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. It was pricey, but the reviews made it seem like it's worth it. Unfortunately, it wasn't The good: the hotel is in a good location. The facilities seem relatively new. The bed was comfortable and adjustable. The bad: many have mentioned the shower OR bath issue, so there's no need to repeat here. We weren't given a choice and got a room with a floor, walk-in shower, which wasn't our preference. The gym looks good on the surface, but the equipment is cheap and flimsy, especially the treadmills. Finally, our room wasn't cleaned; they simply forgot to do it. To be fair, we got some apologies from the management and an offer to clean it around 7:30 pm (which means we would have had to leave the room), but it was really too late because we were tired and wanted to rest. In all, we won't be returning to this hotel. Overpriced for what you get.

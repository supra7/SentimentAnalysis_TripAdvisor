I stay here pretty often for work as it is close to my office, although the last few times I've been in Boston, I have stayed at the InterCon. The Hyatt is never going to win an award for it's design, in fact, when you arrive by taxi, you have to go downstairs and then up in the lift to get to reception. Crazy. The Hyatt Boston isn't a flash hotel. But it has great staff, who either really care about people orb who at least just don't have the (bad) attitude that so many staff at other hotels have. The other thing I notice, is that year after year, you see a number of the same staff faces and they are still smiling. That has to be a good thing. The buffet breakfast is nothing to rave about but not bad either. Hyatt - an upgrade to this old dame would be great. In the meantime, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable hotel where the Staffa smile at you, this is a good choice, and judging by the number of children who ere there this time, it appears very family friendly too.

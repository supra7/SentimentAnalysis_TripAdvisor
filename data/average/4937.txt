The lobby was amazing! It looked like a very fancy place. The room was very small, and I paid extra for a queen or king-si zed bed...if that was a queen, it was ridiculously small! Upon check-in I requested a couple of extra towels. He assured me they wouldn't be a problem, but we never got them. The bathroom was fairly big. Clean. The bed was comfortable except my bf's feet hanging off the end. The location put us within walking distance of Millennium Park and Buckingham fountain, but not much else. Overall, the room was nice and clean, but for what I paid for I was disappointed. Next time I'd try another place.

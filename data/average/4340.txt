I too was very concerned about the Park Plaza after reading the reviews. I stayed 9/30 for one nite, and got the room thru Hotwire for $185- an astounding amount, but still cheaper than the other 3 star hotels offerred at regular price. I did call the hotel in advance, and found out that the room Hotwire booked was an 'economy' room- after reading the reviews I knew that meant a closet, so I very nicely asked if I could have a room with two double beds, knowing that room would be somewhat larger. I also added it was my birthday. Checking in was easy, but finding a place to pull the car up was difficult, at best. Again, I was very nice to the front desk clerk, and again asked him to 'work his magic' so we could have 2 dbl beds. The room, to my relief, was fine. Not great, not large, but having 2 beds made a difference. There was hair on the toilet seat, but I was so ecstatic not to be in an economy room, I didn't care. There was a coffee maker in the room and a hair dryer. No counter space in the bathroom to speak of. We slept like rocks, but also brought a small portable fan for 'white' noise because I had read how thin the walls are-- which is true. The hotel has the original Legal Seafoods across the street, and a McCormick and Schmick and Au Bon Pain right in it. Location was fine. We enjoyed the fancy lobby, but obviously the hotel is old. One night, was fine; however, I would'nt want to stay any longer. In sum, it's 3 star, but I think you could do better with a newer 3 star hotel. Based on the other reviews, we got lucky with the room, and being overly nice really does help with the front desk. The other reviews are right- I wouldn't stay here again. Too many other choices.

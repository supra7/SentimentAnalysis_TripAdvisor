We stayed in room 1325 with two double beds for two nights. The room could use some upgrade/maintenance (for example, AC vent looks like it's about to pop out, bath drips onto floor from right corner causing rust,etc) but overall it is clean. The beds were very comfortable but the hallway noise and traffic noise will definitely wake you. Each morning that I stayed, I can hear dump truck like noises coming from down the street below. It's very loud. The breakfast buffet (eggs, sausage or bacon, english muffin, potatoes, etc) was nice. Complimentary milk and cookies/coffee and mgr reception each evening was also enjoyable. But you'll most likely have to use valet parking, which is $22 per night. It was positive stay overall and we would stay there again. Maybe we'll see about a more quiet room next time.

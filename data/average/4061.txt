Priceline, $120 a night, king room on the 24th floor, great view of the south end and harbor islands. Room tidy but undistinguished otherwise. Could use updating, as others have noted. No way would it be worth $300 a night, but I suspect a lot of guests come in on discount. It's a bustling hotel, attached to a busy shopping galleria that at times seems to meld into the hotel's public spaces. No big deal -- gives it an urban and eclectic feel. Can't beat the Back Bay location, plenty to see, do,eat, drink nearby. Staff seemed friendly and helpful, but we didn't really need much assistance. If you can get a decent discount and don't mind a big place, this is a pretty good bet all around.

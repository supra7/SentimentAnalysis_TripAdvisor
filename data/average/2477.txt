the bar on the roof and the restaurant on the ground are fantastic. Unfortunately there is 20 floors of rooms in the middle that have not been sound proofed so if you're like me you will be awake all night with the traffic and noise on the street. Location is OK but I'd defiantely stay some place else next time.

This was business related trip so I had stay within a given budget. While this is not a bad hotel, it was obvious to me that it needs updating. When I arrived to my room I was met with a smell that was just unbearable. I call the front desk and did someone to up with a room purifier, which did correct the issue, but I had to leave for several hours. Of a different note, when you arrive they provide you with those hot cookies that just melt in your mouth, the person at the front desk was nice enough to offer me two them  I was a little disappointed in the location, your located in corner of a major intersection with traffic coming from all directions.

Location was absolutely perfect. We walked everywhere (Space Needle, Pike Place Market etc) What I found even more convenient was that you can take the light rail directly from the Seattle airport to just outside the hotel. Prob about a five minute walk from where you get off the train. Staff were extremely helpful, very friendly and provided much needed info on the city of seattle. Room was basic. Nothing fancy. But very CLEAN which is always important to us when we travel. I gave it 3 stars because that's exactly what we expected and exactly what we got (considering this is a 3 star hotel) although I must say the staff and service were 5 star all the way!

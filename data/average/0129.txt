We stayed two nights at the Ace Hotel in a double room with a shared bathroom. The hotel itself is really good, trendy interior and felt well maintained and clean. After advice from a friend who said the rooms at the front were really noisy from the bar downstairs, at booking I specifically requested rooms at the back. So I was disappointed to arrive and find we were just a couple of rooms back, at the side, still above the bar. The music from the bar did disturb our sleep the first night, but after finding the the earplugs supplied in the room for the second night, it wasn't as much of an issue. The bar closed at 2am and after that it was fairly quiet. I would still recommend this hotel, as the rooms are comfortable with nice touches (bathrobe, brita water filter), and the shared bathrooms were numerous and kept clean. The included breakfast is also worth having (the self serve waffles are good fun).

The Moore Hotel is close to everything that is nice in Seattle, I admit, but forget about sleeping if you stay there... The hotel was built around the Moore Theatre and every second day a rock band is playing there.. it is really noisy as the walls are paper-thin.. The rooms are small and cold, but the staff can give you a heater if you ask for it, so that's okay. Overall: stay there, if you don't want to pay a lot and if you care about the location only. If you have greater expectations, forget it.

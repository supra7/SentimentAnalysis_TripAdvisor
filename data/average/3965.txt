More of an apartment than a hotel (ie no real reception/public bathrooms/common space). I don't mean that in a negative way, it's just it was a bit unusual (literally no external sign indicating that it was a hotel). That said, the stay was fine and it's a reasonable tourist-class option. The location is perfect-- centrally located, but on a quiet street. Price was very good for central Rome. The room was good sized w/ a/c. The bathroom quite large and modern. The staff were pleasant. On the con-side-- bathroom was a bit dusty and not as clean as I would have liked. It wasn't outrageously filthy or anything beyond the pale, but a couple stray hairs in the tub put me off. Again, it wasn't that big a deal, obviously the tub had been cleaned, it likely was just a stray from the air kind of thing. But still, a bit of an 'ew' factor. At the end of the day, pros and cons. Overall, I say a solid average. I wouldn't go there for luxury or a romantic atmosphere. But if I were just interested in having a convenient 'base' to tour from, I'd probably give it another chance.

Stayed for 7 days on a business trip. All arrangements made by employer hence this hotel may not have been my preferred choice (albeit perfectly located for the task at hand). Positive: Good location - right in centre of town (Loup), excellent for public transport, shops, restaurants, bars, seeing Chicago, etc. Clean, comfy rooms (Queen room only really good for 1 unless the stay is only a day or two). Pool fine. Downside: Lots of work going on, unwelcoming facade due to extensive scaffolding, packed with boxers pre World Championship practicing in the corridors and lift lobbys all day (sounded like a Rocky movie), bar expensive, room rate high ($350 per night), daily charge of $11 extra to use gym, spa pool jets hopeless, some lifts out of service. The breakfast buffet didn't look worth the cost so I took breakfast mainly in a Beef & Brandy round the corner in State St, much better and a calm oasis compared with the hotel. The hotel clearly has considerable history, and is working hard to get back to its heyday. The lobby is huge and most impressive, but during my stay was always crowded. I formed the impression that the hotel was being used for all sorts of local business meetings or functions, over and above those actually staying in the rooms. The effect was that the public areas never seemed comfortable. Would I recommend this hotel - yes but only for people wanting a short (and lively) stay in town, not for a quiet relaxed trip, or to take a loved one. Maybe once the boxers are away the place will settle down again. Incidentally, if you are used to watching European football and decide to take in a US soccer game, don't expect too high a standard, Fire v Galaxy was woeful.

The hotel is in a good location as far as proximity to Addison, Downtown, and other areas, but the value is just not there... Let me first tell you, I am a "Marriott Guy". I typically always stay at Marriotts.. This hotel was $129 per night, they charged for breakfast where most other hotels have a better, FREE breakfast, and when I tried looking at the newspaper on the front desk counter Saturday morning just to see if my girlfriend, who was interviewed, was actually in it, I was "reprimanded" by the front desk agent. I told her I was just checking something quick, and she quickly made me feel like a 5 year old by pulling the paper away and telling me it was $1.00. I am not cheap by any means, but guess what, raise the rate $5.00 and have free breakfast and a Saturday newspaper.... As far as the hotel itsself, the rest of the staff was "dallas friendly". The rooms were definitely outdated... I felt like I was trapped in the 80's. Tell you what... Do yourself a favor and stay 2 miles up the street at the Embassy Suites... Same price, free made to order omeletes, and the place is state of the art, with an incredible lobby. My friends were staying there but since I am a loyal "Marriott Guy", I chose this hotel.. I definitely regret my decision.. If you want to stay with Marriott, stay next door at the Residence Inn. They have free breakfast....

I stayed here in the past for a work conference, so I decided to book a room again for a pleasure trip to Chicago because I received a special room rate offer through Amtrak. We stayed 4 nights. Our reservation said we had a room with a king bed, but upon checking in we were switched to a room that they said had a queen bed. Turns out the room we received had just a regular full size bed. Aside from the room being very small, there were very few in-room amenities (no coffee maker, refrigerator, free internet, limitedTV channels and other common hotel room extras). The bathroom was so small that I had to close the bathroom door in order to turn around in it. The hotel itself evokes a ritzy bygone era with an enormous lobby area with a 30 foot high mural painted ceiling.The bar and restaurant are very expensive and the food just so-so. The free wi-fi in the lobby area did not work very well, connection was intermittant and sometimes didn't work at all. The staff seems jaded and with sour/snooty dispositions. However, the location is VERY convenient to walk anywhere in the downtown loop and lakeshore.

I found this hotel on the net (1800hotels.ie) our stay hear was very nice. The room was spotlessly clean, bright and medium size. Even though we were next to the road the noise level was quite low. The Bus Stop is just down the road but the tube station is in Camden Town (15 minuet walk) the only down side to this hotel for us was BREAKFAST. They tell you it is B&B Forget the second B not less you just like Tea / Coffee and toast .If they said nothing about breakfast or give a proper one I would give Corner House Hotel 100%. I would still recommend the hotel

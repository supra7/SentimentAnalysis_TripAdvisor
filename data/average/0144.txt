Spent several days at this hotel recently. My memories will include the often-slow elevators, the average lobby, the lack of a swimming pool and the over-priced and low-quality laundry service. The room itself was average. Clean, functional, etc. but nothing to write home about. There was a constant hum from the traffic on the interstate below but there are surprisingly very few other noises (no sirens, horns, etc.). The staff was friendly and generally attentive. The location was fine as long as one is comfortable walking, has business in the area or is ok with taxis. Multiple shopping venues, including Pikes Street Market, were 10-15 minute walk. Restated, the hotel is not centrally located but it is not on the outskirts either. If you do lodge here and would like an affordable, home-cooked breakfast, head 2.5 blocks west (towards the water on Seneca just past Starbucks) and try "Bernards on Seneca". Don't be put off by the worn tired-looking wooden door and/or the outdated decor. They open early and have made-to-order breakfast items at very reasonable prices (under $10)... one of the best deals in town. To get a great view of the city at a fraction of the cost of the Space Needle, go to to the observation deck of the Columbia Building (5th and Columbia)(about 5 blocks from the Crowne Plaze). Cost is just $5 and the view is significantly better than the Needle and also enables you to see the Needle instead of the view from it. There's a Starbucks too at about the 40th floor so you can enjoy a coffee with a great view if that has appeal.

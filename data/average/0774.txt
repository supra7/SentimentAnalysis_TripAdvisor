We have stayed at the Sorrento several times over the years but must admit this year will probably be the last time. It is showing its age and while I once thought it was a nice somewhat quaint hotel that is no longer the case. The location is so-so: for better and for worse away from busy downtown downtown Seattle (on the edge of Capital Hill or in the midst of 'Pill Hill" - near three major hospitals.) There are relatively few restaurants nearby and the one in the Sorrento (Hunt Club) is fine but a bit too old-fashioned for us (and we are in our early 60's). The rooms are fine but nothing special and that is kind of what I would say about the entire establishment...OK but nothing out of the ordinary (plus or minus.)

This hotel is in Becerril de la Sierra, little vilage near Madrid. We went there for a long weekend in Agust. We have choosen this hotel beacuse of the swimingpool, which was really nice !! However, as you can read on the lifelet in the room, swimingpool is open only for the very end of June till the end of Agust. The bad thing was a room ( nothing like in the pictures on the website ), and a luck of AC / fan in the room. In Agust temperatures are realy high, even in the mountains and you are not able to sleep. After a night, and second complain we were moved to another room, which was one of the new with AC and very nice, clean room. Other than that the breakfast which is included, was quite nice nothing special but OK. This hotel is very popular among older people so be prepared to see them sleeping everywhere in the hotel, and fiting from the earlie hours for a space around swimingpool ( which they don't use later for a most of the day - just having their towels lying on the bed).

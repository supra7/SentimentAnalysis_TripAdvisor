Nice hotel, great for early-morning flights----literally, walk out the front door, across the street, and you're at the airport. No need for a shuttle! Downside is you are in airport-area hell--strip malls, highways, etc. Perfectly acceptable, but you're a good 10+ miles from the "action" of Seattle. On the plus side (and on the non-airport side), and on a clear day, you can twist your head and look to the SE and see Rainier---got some great early-morning pictures by holding my camera out the window! No noise from airport in my room. Don't think my colleague had a noise problem with her airport-side room either.

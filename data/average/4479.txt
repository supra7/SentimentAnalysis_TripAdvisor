As a former reviewer pointed out, the hotel is great but the staff has a LOT to be desired. I booked my room at the Hilton on Priceline for $65 (~$80 with taxes/fees). The hotel is not what I would call easy to get to driving wise, but certainly very easy to get to with public transportation by getting off at the Prudential stop (as a footnote, if you are flying into logan or taking the train into Boston, I do NOT recommend taking the subway directly to the hotel if you have big luggage... the green line of the T is VERY hard to accomodate luggage on as the cars are pretty small... I would suggest a cab). A LOT of things are within walking distance of this hotel, including Fenway Park, Newbury Street (a lot of high-end stores and nice cafes and restaurants), Copley Square, the Prudential Center, Berklee College of Music, and others. And obviously once you're there, you can take the T to just about anything in Boston. Now, on to the staff... I was traveling with my wife and a friend of ours, so when I went to check in, I requested a room with two double beds (knowing that Priceline only guarantees double occupancy, but it doesn't hurt to ask). I was told by Brendan (the man checking us in) that there were no two-double rooms available, but they could put a rollaway bed in our king room for $20 for the night. We agreed, and away to our room we went. After checking in, we walked around Boston a bit to see the sights and came back several hours later. We get back to our room, and still no rollaway bed there. So, I call the front desk to see where it is, turns out they are sold out of them, but there is a two-double room available that we can go right into! Now, obviously someone needs to get their act together and know what is and isn't available, because obviously Brendan didn't have a clue. Overall a great stay and would be pleased to stay here again. Oh, and by the way, if you are a guest at the hotel, parking is $35 per night.

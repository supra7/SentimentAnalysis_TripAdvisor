Hotel situation near Seattle Center, Space needle and opera house. Plenty of restaurants arount and several bus lines provide ground transportation. Room facility is good with microwave, refrigerator, stove, kitchen ware and a closet room. However lots of noise from the roads around including buses, cars and early morning seabirds sound. These sounds wake me up every morning around 5am. Hotel has no lift, so it is a bit difficult for people with lots of luggages. Staffs are mostly friendly and helpful. Although it states that breakfast is available, the breakfast is only coffee, package bar and tasteless fruit. The IDD calls in this hotel is very expansive. It charges more nearly USD8.0 per minute!

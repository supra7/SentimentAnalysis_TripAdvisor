The apartments are in a good location if wanting an apartment close to the airport. There are also many good places to eat in the area and you can walk to the beach. It is some distance from the metro and the larger malls. The place is difficult to find as you have to enter a covered driveway to get to the front door.. I don't know what the challenges are in running the apartments but everyday we had to ask for a second bath towel. The apartment lacked basic kitchen supplies and the stove was dirty. The fridge was pre-set at a low temperature so we couldn't use it. We wanted to iron a few items and we had to go through 3 irons before we found one that worked. The pool is on the top floor and worked well except the pool deck was dirty. When you walked with wet feet, your feet got dirty. The Concierge was very helpful to us and povided a good service.

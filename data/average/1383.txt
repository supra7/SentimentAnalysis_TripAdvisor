The bed was comfy but the tv reception was absolutely horrible. Almost all of the stations were static-y. I also couldn't figure out the sleep number remote as I never felt a change in the softness/firmness. My one interaction with the front desk was very pleasant. I like the location as it was within walking distance of a Denny's and fast food options. I was staying there on the 7/4 and it was just down the street from a park near the lake that had a Firework's show, AWESOME!

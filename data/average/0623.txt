Location is excellent. Very close to everything. Problem is that it is an older hotel refurbished superficially. Carpet was put on rotting, humid hardwood floors and it smells awful. Beds were comfortable, but cleanliness of the bathroom was just average. You pay for the location. Free wireless internet is nice and all staff i interacted with were very helpful and nice.

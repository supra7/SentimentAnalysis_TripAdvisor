The Copley is an historic property that is undergoing major renovations. I am sure it will be a very good property when finished, but for the moment I rank as average. My room was great. I was told I was only the third guest to have stayed there. Though the sleeping rooms are good, the bathrooms are small (historic property). The service is excellent with good attention to detail and attentiveness. The downside is the hallways smell like paint, work is going on in very near proximity to rooms that are being used. The business "center" is open to the lobby so no privacy or real quiet. The Oak room is closed, but the St. James is a nice substitute. Drinks are expensive and short, for the price one expects a better pour. For a night or two of business travel it is fine, would not book a group. Give it 12 -18 months and I imagine it will be back to the Very Good range.

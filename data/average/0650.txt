We had booked before checking TripAdvisor and were worried after reading some of the very negative reviews but were pleasantly surprised when we got there. All staff we met were friendly and helpful, our room was clean, so were the beds and bathroom. There were four of us in the room and there was enough space for our 3-night stay. We had sufficient coffee, tea, iron, hairdryer, towels, soaps, etc. The beds were very soft. It's so close to the major shops (Nordstrom, Macy's, Pacific Place) that one could shop, drop it all off back at the hotel and go back again for more. Good restaurants nearby. The breakfast in the hotel wasn't too bad either and again very friendly staff. I would definitely stay here again and spend my money on food and clothing/cosmetics rather than on a more expensive hotel room.

I like most Hiltons. I usually find they offer very good value, and service. This Hilton, I'm afraid, doesn't meet that standard. The location is terrific. It's an easy walk to the Public Gardens, Trinity Church, several T stations, Fenway and the Berkley College of Music. The hotel is also well kept - clean and well maintained. The build quality of this hotel is very sub par. I have never stayed in a hotel with such thin walls. Every time the person in the next room flushed their toilet or closed the door, it sounded like they were in our room. The service in this hotel is also not up to par. Check-in at the front desk was brusk and very little information was given to us. Although she told us how to access the parking garage, she failed to mention the daily charge of $40 a day. Although she gave us breakfast coupons (one for a two day stay) she didn't tell us where to use them. Is there an execuitve lounge, or are they used in the restaurant? We were charge $60 for internet access for two days. I was told the charges were reversed - as a Gold member I shouldn't be charged at all - but how can you be charged for internet access 4 times over a 2 day stay? As an apology I was offerred a late check out. I could check out at 1pm with no charge! Whooppee! An extra hour! The hotel's lobby and public spaces are very unspectacular and small. This is simply a lackluster Hilton in many ways. And where service could have made up for the deficiencies - it also dissappointed.

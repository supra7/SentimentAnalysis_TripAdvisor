We stayed in a 2 queen suite for a couple of nights. The room as adequate but nothing special more like an oversized room as opposed to a suite. There was no sitting area, just one desk chair and a single chair. The beds were very comfortable apart form the sharp edges on the corners. Our room was quiet even though there seemed to be a party going on down the hall in one of the other suites, glad we weren't next door to them. The decor is starting to look a little tired, almost like they used cheap materials which are now showing their age. The bathroom is the smallest I have ever come across, I could stand in the middle and touch all four walls. On the whole a decent hotel in a central location but not what you would expect for something marketed as a luxury 4star + so as long as you can get a good rate I would stay here again but only for a short break, a week in that bathroom would send me stir crazy.

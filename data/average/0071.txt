The Warwick could be nicer with a few little changes. First off, the staff was very friendly at check in and it is apparent that someone is working with them on customer service. They seem to be trying a little too hard -- in other words, they haven't perfected their customer service persona yet. When we got up to our room, I was pleased with a great view of the space needle but disappointed by the VERY LOUD street noise. (And we were on the 6th floor -- can't imagine how loud it was on the 2nd or 3rd floors) The room itself was generally comfortable but the bathroom was cramped and could have been cleaner. There were some mildew spots in the shower that just needed some bleach applied. It was a potentially really fancy marble shower that could have been really impressive it were cleaner and had a better fixture set up. Parking is a complete night mare in this area and we ended up paying $27 to park at the hotel overnight, which is a real rip-off but you really don't have much of a choice. Also, the parking garage doesn't have an elevator so you should plan on sending the most fit person in your group to park and lug the bags down/up the stairs. I don't feel this room is much of a bargain considering I paid almost $150 for one night on H*tw*re. I probably wouldn't do it again. No major complaints but I wasn't blown away either.

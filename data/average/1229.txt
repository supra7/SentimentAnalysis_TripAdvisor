I've stayed at this convenient hotel many times over the years and this time recommended 3 other colleagues book here as well for our business meeting. The staff are friendly and always available, except when the many flight crews arrive from the airport. This backs up especially later at night. The breakfast is great - buffet or a la carte - something for everyone. The bar and snack bar are quite convenient as well. The only downside to this trip was the 45 minutes for the shuttle to get from the airport to the hotel. I called the hotel twice and each time was assured a bus was on it's way. Only 1 of the 2 buses was running, hence the long waits and standing room only on the bus. Not a very good first impression for me and my colleagues. Also be aware that the airport does operate some night flights and you may hear them if you face the airport across the street. Hopefully, this will be remedied. Otherwise a nice hotel covneient for airport meetings.

This hotel aims to have a contemporary feel. While it's "hip" it isn't supported by friendly staff. Upon arrival we were asked if we wanted a bigger room or a room higher up. We went for bigger room which was not very big at all. We were also on the 6th floor (hotel only has 10 floors) so I'm not sure what view we really could have had. There was a gross substance on one of our pillows (looked like a melted candy bar). Called front desk and they told us it was just detergent. At the end of our four night stay we asked if we could do a later check out. The lady instantaneously said no, even though they tout that option in their phamplet. Red Fin sushi place is really good, and very fresh. Overall not worth the $150/night.

Went with my daughter to visit some colleges and stayed at this Marriott. We took the T (subway) almost everywhere and we were able to get to all colleges very easily. The only problem with that form of transportation was it was almost always packed. The Marriott also was conveniently attached to an indoor mall with an assortment of brand name shops and food options. This also included a Starbucks located on the 2nd floor. The actual hotel was good as well. The rooms were a little dated in design and a little small but we had a fantastic view overlooking the river. We could even see the MIT dome. Finally, the service was good. The people at the front desk were informative and kind, such attributes seemed to be consistent throughout the hotel staff. Only, I never got a paper outside my door. It might have been because I booked it through getaroom.com. In summary, there was nothing special about this hotel nor can I say there was any problems with my stay.

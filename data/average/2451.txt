The staff was wonderful and tried to be helpful. We chose this location partially for the location and things like the pool/spa. Arrived to find the pool/spa were closed for renovations. The staff comp'ed us breakfast after I asked for it as a consolation. We were assigned the 3rd floor, only floor with a suite left. Came back from night activities to find men in respirators walking around renovating the bathrooms. The stench was HORRIFIC. No option given by the staff like a different Marriott to accommodate us, no other suite available in building, didn't have connector or two other rooms available? I can't comfortable recommend the hotel to others - staff was as good as they could be the facility was not. How about staff explain these things on check in and let the guest make their own decision to stay or go elswhere

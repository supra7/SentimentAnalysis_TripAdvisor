I really have mixed feelings on this hotel. The location is not great - you won't be walking to many attractions, either get a car (or bring one) or plan on taking Taxis. Rooms are small but pretty nice. We had an issue with the thermostat in our bathroom - which was tiny and not really up to par with the hotel - but they did fix it within about a half an hour which was nice. I guess I was just expecting more. We booked the hotel last minute as we had to change destinations because of a passport issue (originally going to Montreal) so the price was pretty good for a same-day reservation - but it wasn't Holiday Inn cheap - so I was expecting a little more, particularly from the staff and size of the room. Two different people at the concierge were inept and most of the staff just stood around and watched me and my girlfriend haul our luggage into the hotel, never offered to help or even hold a door. We just got a strange vibe, the staff seemed kind of detached and uninterested - not rude or anything, just somewhat apathetic. Overall, I would stay somewhere else next time in Boston, but I wouldn't say that I'd never go back to this hotel. As a plus, the restaurant in the hotel was actually quite good.

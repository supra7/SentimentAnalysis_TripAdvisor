This hotel really is not in the class of even the Venetian across the way. The rooms are large but the carpets really are stained and dirty. The bathrooms do not have hand towels, there is only one glass, the bathtub is plastic, the hot water sparse and so on. It is close to the Interstate so you pick up that noise, and then throw in the trains that clank by in the middle of the night and expect to wake up if you are a light sleeper. The so-called Business Center only has two computers, no pens, and no paper and is busy with people on Facebook. I've stayed in Hilton Garden's with better Business Centers. The work out room is average at best. For the price, definitely stay elsewhere. If you do stay, be prepared for a 3 or 4 star experience. Trump should be fired for putting his name on this middle of the road place.

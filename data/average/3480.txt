I stayed here whilst on a 2 day course and i found the room basic and small but it did what it said on the tin and was Clean and the shower was lovely. The only negatives i would say is it it quite noisy being on a main road and also the breakfast is beyond basic with cereal and toast being the only option - i thought with a continental breakfast there would have been a choice of cold meats and fruit.

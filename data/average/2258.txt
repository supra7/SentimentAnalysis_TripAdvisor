It amazing but BEWARE. I woulde given this place a 5 out of 5 and here is why I did not. I felt like a test guest, testing out this amazingly gorgeous hotel and all it amenities for the other guests that will soon arrive. They never did. The hotel was empty, which was amazing considering it was my honeymoon, but due to the lack of people, there was lack of food and activities. I felt like a kid that paid full price to get into an amusement park and half the roller coasters were not running. It is WAY overpriced and to go off the resort for the day will cost you about one nights stay. I would call and ask about what is open before you book. If everything were open it woulde been the best hotel I have ever been to. They treated my new wife and I like royalty.

The positives: Pretty good location Lots of restaurants within walking distance Pike Street Market not far. Tall hotel with a good view. We could see the city and a glimpse of Elliott Bay. Nice decore. Adequate service. Excellent rate on Hotwire The negatives: Sheets weren't clean when we checked in. We had to call to have them changed. How gross. Hotel would not provide a receipt showing $0 due for incidentals. I thought that was quite odd. Hotel doesn't do the typical "express checkout" where they deliver a receipt to your room. Very pricey parking. We dumped our rental car, rather than pay $39/day to park. Very pricey on-site restaurants No one there gave good directions, including the concierge Concierge seemed quite put off by any questions Staff were "stuffy"

It is a great location, but we were left wondering what all the hype about "the most hawaiian hotel" meant. All we could figure out is it means old rooms with air conditioning that doesn't work and roaches in the drawer. The whale watching from the balcony was spectacular and the ability to snorkel over to Black Rock was nice. But for $350 per night we expected a bit more out of the room. We are on a multi island tour of Hawaii and this is the third and most expensive place we've stayed. It also was the most run down. We heard that the departure ceremony was fantastic, too bad it's every hour on the hour starting at 8 am. Our flight left at 9 from the airport an hour away. Might make more sense to have a welcome reception when people arrive rather than make them juggle their schedule so you can say goodbye.

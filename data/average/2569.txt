This was only 85 for one night for a family room including breakfast, cheap for London.However be aware that there is a reason for this. The hotel is clean as you would expect and the room had air conditioning which was a god send with 31degree temperatures BUT you would think that the windows were wide open with the noise from outside. Not just the station noise but bus noise and people coming home from pubs. Stayed in another travelodge in the City on previous nights with no noise but no A/C. I guess you cant have it all!!!

stayed at the hotel for two nights, things didnt start well, as our prearranged transfer dropped us off at wrong hotel(not Eurostars fault). on arrival at hotel staff not over friendly or helpfull. did not have our reservation details, and not knowing what type of booking we had put us in first available room the room was right opposite the lifts and the noise was horrendous....hearsd everyones commings and goings the room.....although clean, was not what i would call 5 star or luxury accomodation, the overly designed bathroom was hopless...the sinks splashed everywhere, no shelf to put toiletries the list goes on .. complained about the glass toilet door ( which made so much noise opening that if went to loo at night woke the whole hotel up, and when asked for it to be looked at was told YES ( nobody ever came) this hotel could be great but the staff need a lesson in customer relations barcalona is great city......shame about this imposter of a luxury hotel

This is a PRIME location if you are in town for an event at the convention center. However, if you are just visiting....I can't imagine that there aren't better choices. No mini bar, run-down rooms, no view, bar/restaurant that is connected doesn't offer any wine other than dime store sugar water. Bad lighting! However, it is very clean.

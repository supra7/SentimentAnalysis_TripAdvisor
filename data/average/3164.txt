We stayed at the Novotel which was good but try and get in the city itself. In saying that it is very very convenient to the airport (two stops on the train and only 2.60, trains go at least every 15 minutes, do not pay for a taxi), and easy to get into the city via tram or metro. Breakfast was excellent, as was the lobby with the computers. Room was good, although cleaning service not the best, air con was very dated. Huge hotel but they cope with the people well. Price was high but due to everything else being booked out, the Novotel was a pretty good stay.

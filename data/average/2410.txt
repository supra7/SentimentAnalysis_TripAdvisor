have stayed in residence inns across the nation and this one rates at the bottom of list. rooms and parking are ok but Management, (whoever that is) needs to look around. the whole month there, 1. hot tub with out of order sign and full of dirt. and still is 2. Gas grill supposed to be in yard for usage, Was not. and is not 3. the whole month had to eat in the dimly lit dining room. help would not turn on lights or would say they were broke, but some days they in the day time they would be on. 4. grass was cut one time the whole time we stayed. 5. night time help very unfriendly. 6. passage ways fairly dirty and trash left sitting around. 7. evening food is nothing compared to other residence inns. overall lack of interest by management.

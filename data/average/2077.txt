First of all the good- the vibe and the staff were lovely! Couldn't have been more pleasant ... we loved them! The vibe manages to be hip-chic-spa...super, including the pre loaded ipods in the room! the pool is BEAUTIFUL... the massage I got was great!!! The reasons we wouldn't go back? Well we had a beach front plunge pool suite and were eaten with mosquioes... including inside the room after spraying inside and outside with home and garden 24 hr repellent, because there's standing water draining from the plunge pool and LARGE gaps (like finally stuffed toilet paper in them) in the window sills. This means a plunge pool is unuseable at night.We seriously decided that the garden rooms or the new 'spa' suites would be the way to go- because there was no way for us to sit out at the plunge pool at night... The food is good, but very expensive and you are asked not to bring in outside food or drink .. The pool chairs are really!!!! close together...shade is hard to come by...on a day where the beach isn't great it gets crowded fast...and the beach isn't a swimming sandy beach Finally, the gardener who started watering from the hook up next to our plunge pool at about 6:15 in the morning... coudn't sleep through it... seriously, he hooked up within 20 feet of the foot of our bed... so couldn't skinny dip, leave curtains open for sunrise, etc... I think the difference between everyone loving it and our review may have been the room- it had so much potential for a romantic stay, but the small things really eroded our initially positive view.. Hints? Don't get a plunge pool.... and it really does look ike the pictures!!!

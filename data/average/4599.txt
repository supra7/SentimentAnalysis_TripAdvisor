We stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza to attend a wedding that was held there. We booked two rooms, one for us and one for our son. The reactions were pretty mixed. The good: The staff was excellent. Friendly, efficient and patient, from the front desk staff to the valets. One of the young valets cheerfully walked over to the parking garage in 7 F degree weather to fetch something I had forgotten in the car. They were great and made the stay there better than it otherwise might have been. The not so good: The Fairmont is one of Boston's grand old hotels, and it is showing its age. Much of the building is very dimly lit. Our bathroom door would not stay closed. The shower water was warm, but not hot, and was noticeably cooler by the end of the shower. The heating in one room was fine, but when the fan was on in the other room, it blew hot air all the time and the room temperature was in the 80's. We ate breakfast in the hotel dining room. The food was okay, but only okay. It was also very expensive and service was very, very slow. The Fairmont still charges for wi-fi, a pet peeve of mine when so many other hotels are providing it at no charge. So, three stars instead of higher, but with one last comment - the location is splendid. Copley Square is a great central location for just about anywhere you might want to go in Boston.

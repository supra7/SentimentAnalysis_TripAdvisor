Went to Barca for a big conference and booked this hotel to save tax payers money. Arrived around noon, Jennifer checked me in on the 6th floor (top) without problem. The view from my room is not spactacular but the room is quiet (I only needed that there). Lobby and breakfast area is hot, as well as hallways and in the tiny elevators (3 of them), where there is no air conditioning. The room is comfortable, clean, with great water pressure. Breakfast is served until 10:00 AM, with everything except eggs, bacon, or sausages that boost your cardiovascular risks. The beds are hard, maybe good for your back. No fridge or safety box in the room, so put all the valuables in the safety box with front desk. The staff members are great, especially Jennifer, all of them speak good English. Exchange rate is high at the hotel, I changed my USD in a bank nearby (not La Caixa), where only one staff speaks English, others appeared hated any extra work. The metro is 2 blocks away (Llacuna), which is not in the best neighborhood. But you can walk toward the opposite direction for 3 blocks to another metro station Poblenou though. The beach is not very close, about 20-30 minute walk, I was soaked when I reached the beach. There is a very nice (expensive) restaurant 3 block from Llacuna station, great service, but food is so so. If you turn left from the hotel gate and walk one block, there are several places to eat and a supermarket. People are friendly but they dont speak English. Overall, it is nice to stay in a local hotel and see how locals live.

Stayed here for three nights and the hotel is well located for Copley Square area of the city. We had access to the lounge for complimentary breakfast which was excellent quality and served by a very helpful and courteous young man. The downside was our room, it was small, dated with a tiny bathroom. It felt "grubby" and claustrophobic and is probably a function of the age of the hotel. There is a lot of choice in Boston and the rooms would have to be completely redesigned for me to consider returning

The Palmer House is a historical building with an expansive and majestic lobby / Grand Reception area. Very impressive with a nice (expensive) bar and dining room. However, once you clear the lobby floor, everything else is just an average Hilton Hotel. Don't get me wrong, this is far from a dump. The hotel is clean, safe, and the location is choice. But, for luxury - the rooms are small and plain. You are obviously paying for the location and reception area. My advice, if you can get a better rate in the same area, take it. Be sure to visit this hotel for the lobby, but otherwise... it is average for a luxury hotel.

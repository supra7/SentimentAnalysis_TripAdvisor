Our family comes downtown every year to enjoy all the Christmas festivities for a weekend. We have stayed at the Westin every year past and decided to try the edgewater this year. It's been a mistake since the start. As someone else has stated the beauty begins and ends at the fireplace outside the entrance. We were never greeted at te door, with kids in tow a door held open is always a nice gesture. After check in we walked the long, dark, dank and very stinky hallwall to our room. Gross. We called once in the room about the old musty, stale cigarette smell. Yuck. They promptly moved us to rm 352. Smell was better, but little did we know then that the walls are paper thin! The edgewater provides earplugs for the train, ha! We needed more than one pair, the whole family was up all night from the noise of people normally talking in hall. This room also happened to be above, below or next door to the laundry. So we enjoyed the racket of that early in the as well. We are so disappointed with this hotel. The rooms need some help, from the old carpet you do not wish to walk barefoot on, the 15 inch tube tv in the giant armoire, tiny beds and gross ring stained toilet. Do the fireplaces even turn on? We will not be back, ever. We have enjoyed the restaurant 67 in the past, amazing food...we would expect the same from the hotel.

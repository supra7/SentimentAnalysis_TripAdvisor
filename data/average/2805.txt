This is an interesting hotel in a pretty decent location (4 blocks from the French Quarter, but kind of a skethcy walk if you are alone at night). The hotel staff are friendly, but not as friendly as other hotels I have stayed with. They seem to do as little as possible to keep customers happy (wothout going out of their way). The rooms has fridges and microwaves and the a/c works well (a plus in new Orleans) but the rugs are worn and the bathrooms are very dated (and the amenities could use an upgrade). The bed was bvery comfortable and there was a free breakfast, also a plus. The lobby is very cool with high ceilings and old structual components - maybe a hotel bar in the lobby would attract more people. Free internet was also a plus! Overall, for the price paid, I thought this hotel was well-located and everything the website promised it would be.

We stayed at the Moore a second time after a good stay last year. The location is great. Just a 5 minute walk to Pike Place Market and the shops. Front desk is very friendly and the rooms are clean. The rooms are a little dated, but comfortable and clean. So if you look for a good location for a good price and don't care to have the most modern room, The Moore is a great choice.

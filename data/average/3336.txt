Nice enough hotel with good clean rooms - although very odd shaped rooms due to the shape of the building. Breakfast service very good, bar service in the evenings very slow and very expensive. However... Be aware, this is a very rough area and whilst I was there I had my bag snatched from in front of me whilst sitting in reception as I was about to leave. Barcelona is notorious for petty crime, but hotels such as this, which are not cheap, should have better security on the entrances. It's the old part of town so the thief was gone into the myriad of alleyways within seconds.

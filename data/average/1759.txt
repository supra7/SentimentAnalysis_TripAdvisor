The lobby usually has expansive views of the ocean, but right now construction is blocking that view. Very disappointing. I feel strongly that they should have disclosed this before our reservation was complete. Service is so-so. No one in any area - pool, valet, restaurants, front desk, etc. went out of there way to make the time special. We had to fight to get the valet's attention and beg to get information on hotel restaurants and services. The room is ok, showing signs of wear. The view is great - ocean front. Most days the housekeeper forgets items - tp, wash clothes, soap, etc. Our room is really far from everything - pool, frontdesk, restaurants, etc. I would request the center tower next time (although there's not likely to be one for me). Breakfast buffet is large and the food is good, but the dining room is invested with birds. They are so bold I saw them eat off of a man's plate while he was still eating. This is a huge problem and made us not want to eat the breakfast that was included with our room. We figured out that we could get it to go and eat it from the pavilion. That worked ok but was a hassle. If you don't have kids stick to the adult side of the pool - much calmer. The pool bar serves great drinks. Try a lava flow. Yum! They rent cabanas with an ocean view. Although expensive it's worth it on a day you want to spend the whole day at the pool/beach. And, if you've gotten a bit too much sun these nicely shield you while still being able to see the view. Check with the concierge service early on, provided by Expedia. They have good, knowledgable staff who can help you plan and reserve everything you want - restaurants, adventures, etc. Many restaurants and activities require reservations and the concierge can usually get you discounts. Considering the cost vs benefit of this hotel, I would not recommend it. I think you can do better with a condo or other comparable hotel for a similar price.

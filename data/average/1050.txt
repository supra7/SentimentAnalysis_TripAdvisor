As funky & hip as the Seattle W is...it is NOT worth the money. I booked a room online & requested a king size bed in my reservation. When I got to my room I was given 2 queen size beds. Side note - unless queen size beds in the US are smaller, which I doubt, I would consider these beds double beds at best. When I called down to the front desk to voice my concerns & see if I could get a room as per my booking request, I was curtly told that there were no other rooms available, that I wasn't the only person who was not getting the King Size bed as requested, and that there was nothing he could do. No solutions, options or compensation offered for my dissatisfaction. 10 minutes after checking in to the Hotel, my key card wasn't working in the elevator. When i went to the front desk to get a new card, I observed the same front desk clerk issuing complimentary drinks at the hotel lounge to a few guests who were looking for something to do. REALLY - you're going to offer complimentary drinks to people who are bored but to your guests who are unsatisfied, nothing? I was given a new key card but each time I went in the elevator is took about 5-6 times before it actually worked & let me up the elevator (frustrating & embarrassing). The hotel building itself has incredibly bad insulation/sound proofing & I could hear my neighbours at all hours of the night & day. The room doors weren't properly aligned (or something) & extremely hard to close - you basically had to slam the door to close it. So again, loud noises as everyone around me was slamming their doors. And the final complaint - $15 for internet access? For the nightly rate @ the W, internet should be free! If the Holiday Inn can afford free internet, I'm sure the W can afford it! Overall, extremely poor customer service & loud...not worth the money!

Pretty good overall I was pretty happy with the room, and it was a full service hotel so we had help with our luggage and room service and needed to call the front desk for a favor a few times and they were happy to oblige. The room size was fine for two adults (standard king). We liked the sleep number bed, but we don't exactly think they're all that wonderful. We never heard plane noise because we weren't facing the front of the hotel. The manager told us this, because we asked for a quiet room and they said then choose something that doesn't face the airport! So we picked the top floor (so we wouldn't have neighbors above us) that faced away. I never heard a single plane and I kept the window open all night long. Which brings me to my complaint. Perhaps it was the time of the year (Febuary) but they said the a/c won't cool to a temperature any lower than what it is outside. (Which really wasn't even true because I couldn't get it lower than 75-78 and outside it was 50). This is after they brought an engineer up to look at it and then had us move two doors down thinking our a/c was broken. So they told us that that was just the way the a/c worked but maybe it would be better by the next time we come back. I told them I had been uncomfortable sleeping for days and at check-out they refunded for about 2-3 nights worth of our stay. The manager was very friendly and tried to help as much as possible. So even though I think Radisson's climate control system is nuts, it isn't the manager's fault and they did do everything they could to try to correct it.

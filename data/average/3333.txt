We stayed here for just one night before leaving Barcelona and weren't overly impressed with the area around the hotel as it is a bit shady. The hotel itself is high on design and quirkiness with friendly front desk staff. The room was a decent size but a king bed was two beds made up separately and pushed together. I did get a great nights sleep (not the most romantic) but it could have been all of the red wine. The bathroom does lack privacy and the hotel does feel a bit like something from the Jetsons but it makes for fun photos and the price is decent. Not a bad hotel but would not be my first choice when I return.

Stayed here recently for 2 nights. The location is good (steps from Michigan Ave.), the common areas are historic and beautiful, and the staff is pleasant and courteous. As expected in a hotel of this vintage, my room was small (though nicely furnished), and the bathroom tiny. My window looked out at a tenement about 30 feet away. My major complaint was the paper-thin walls: the guests in the room next to mine had an extended conversation around 2 AM one night, and although I don't think they were speaking particularly loudly, it sounded as though they were in my room. I'd stay here again for the terrific rate I paid through Hotwire, but certainly wouldn't pay rack.

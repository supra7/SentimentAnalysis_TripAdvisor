Don't stay there if you are a light sleeper. The hotel must have been built many years ago. The decor is pretty outdated although the room is clean. I am staying at 19th floor AWAY from the I-5 high way, and I still can here all street noise from the ground level! It's as if there is absolutely no sound insulation from outside! I know they are remodeling now, but I am not sure what they can do about this. The staff was pretty good. But, if you are a light sleeper like myself, avoid this hotel. Decent location though.

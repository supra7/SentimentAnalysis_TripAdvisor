the negatives: -the A/C turns on but does not actually work...(it was too warm in our room and the window only opens a little bit) -when you turn the A/C off it still kind of makes noise...(bring ear plugs) -the clock radio had a connection for your MP3 which was GREAT...but the wire was split so it would constantly turn on/off...so that was kind of a bummer. -the view, sucked...(but we weren't there for the view) -the walls were thin; you could hear your neighbors...(again, bring ear plugs) -the bathroom door did not close - the only way it will close is if you lock it... -there was no fan in the bathroom... -the light wasn't working near the bed but after leaving a note for house keeping they fixed it... the positives: -it was clean -the bed was very cozy -the staff seemed friendly -a coffee shop is connected to the hotel so you can get a fresh cup of joe first thing in the morning -good location

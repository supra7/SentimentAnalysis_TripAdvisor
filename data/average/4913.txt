The hotel is an old one and is very well situated in downtown Chicago. The rooms are nice, but no nicer than a Holiday Inn Express. The largest problem I had with the hotel is the noise. On two separate nights I was awakened by either screaming in the hallways or talking in the adjacent room. The walls are so thin that one could understand entire phone conversations. This also translates in to bathroom use the sound of other people flushing is not pleasant. Overall the hotel is very nice and the lobby is amazing. But the thin walls make me wonder if I will stay there again. I booked it through hot-wire so will not complain about the price.

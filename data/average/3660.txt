I stayed at this hotel for three days on a business trip. The positives: Food was great. I ate all my meals at the conference I was at in the hotel. Very good - excellent actually. The lobby was very pretty. The negatives: The room - I have stayed in nicer at much cheaper hotels. The TV was ancient. No wifi. Furniture was old and tired. The location. Couldn't really walk anywhere. Would be a great place to be trapped for a conference if they made some updates to the rooms. Otherwise, this is a tired, old, and out of date hotel.

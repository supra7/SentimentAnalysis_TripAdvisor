My husband & I honeymooned in Hawaii and spent the final 10 nights at the Hyatt Regency in Kaanapali. Overall we enjoyed the resort and facilities, although it wasn't our favorite location in Maui. Kaanapali was the first mega resort development in America (built in 1960s), so the beach is lined with various hotels, restaurants, shops -- which isn't exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon. If you want "true" Hawaii, then I recommend spending a week in Hana. Back to the hotel though... we had an oceanfront deluxe room in the middle building (in front of the pool). Construction was going on during most of our stay, although they were just finishing everything up for Christmas. We had a lot of fun with the tropical birds in the lobby (especially Luna and R2D2, an African Grey), and the penguins were enjoyable as well. Breakfest buffet was a bit disappointing due to the bombardment of finch birds. I wouldn't be surprised if most guests (unknowingly) eat bird poop every day. Hopefully Hyatt will take care of the bird problem soon. After reading about "Tour of the Stars" in my Frommers guidebook, we decided to partake in activity at the resort. What a joke! I could see the stars better in my binoculars, so be sure to save the $25/pp fee. On a positive note, the Hyatt staff were really nice (especially at the concierge desk and the bartenders at the pool restaurant/bar). All in all, we still had a good time during our stay...although I don't think I'd ever go back to Kaanapali!

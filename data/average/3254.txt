My husband and I just returned from Istanbul and we stayed at the Adamar. I have mixed feelings about the hotel. Some things were so good...and some things were really wrong. Regrettably I have to give the hotel a thumbs down because it comes down to quality of sleep- and I got none! First the positives. The Adamar is in a great location and walkable to Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Cistern, Grand Bazaar, and many other spots. It is very close to some good restaurants. The photos on the website don't lie- the rooftop view is amazing! The breakfast is more than adequate with a wide selection of hot and cold items. The service at the front desk was also great. The staff stored our luggage when we traveled to Cappadocia and booked a daytrip to Ephesus and a dance show for us. The rooms were on the small side, but bigger than a lot of European hotel rooms, and clean. They were simple but fine...UNLESS you really value your sleep! (The negatives) The rooms are LOUD. During the first part of our trip we were on the 2nd floor. The call to prayer never bothered us. It was the horrible street noise with buses and honking at all hours. And the plumbing. We could hear showers and toilets several floors above us. On our return after Cappadocia we stayed on the 5th floor and it was just as loud. You can hear every door open and close all night long. And we aren't light sleepers! Also as several other reviewers have mentioned, even when you request a "family room", you may get two single beds. We did and the only solution was to push the beds together, which wasn't really an option with the design of the room. Also, oddly, on the 2nd floor our shower had a floor to ceiling window in it. Since we were situated over a busy street, it was really a peep show when we showered. The Adamar is in a good location, but there are a bunch of other hotels nearby...and I would say keep looking so you can get some peace and quiet!

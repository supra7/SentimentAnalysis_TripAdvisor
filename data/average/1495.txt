Pros: -Nice property grounds -Service was great in restaurants/bars -Friendly, nice staff -Rooms were nice Cons: -Ocean View room was very far away from the ocean, mis-leading -Service was under par for lobby/concierge for a few requests -Food was hit or miss, great breakfast, Asian restaurant was the best, would not recommend Portofino (Italian) -Spa: paid for deep tissue, it was more like a swedish, the massage therapists didn't even ask you what pressure you prefer, which areas you would like to focus on -Fitness center was small, and crowded at times Basically I'm comparing this resort to Excellence in Playa Mujeres (stayed there Oct '09) and that resort was top notch, so I was a little disappointed with Secrets.

Generally a tad disappointing considering the price that was being paid. Maybe somewhere between a two star and three star hotel. Watch out - sneezing may incur an extra charge. Bugged me that everything was an extra. Left our bags no more than 1.5 hours = $2 charge. Internet charge by two hour blocks and cable connection. All seemed a bit primitive. Had to leave a deposit (even though our rooms were fully paid). Breakfast paid at reception and then had to hand token over in breakfast room. Ok, none of it end-of-the-world stuff but all sort of untrusting and a harking back to the 60s/70s. It did the job but not sure I would go back.

Checked out on a Wednesday morning, by that afternoon someone started using the credit card I had used at the Marriott attempting large charges and accessing my credit report. I was called by the credit card company on Thursday asking about charges which I confirmed were fraudulent and the card was cancelled. I called the hotel, not to accuse them but to alert them that they may have a rogue employee or a security breach. I thought I was doing them a favor, but they just stonewalled and assured me it could not be their fault. Well, even though they put me on hold for five minutes I don't think they had time to investigate the matter and I got the impression that I was considered a nuisance for bringing it up. They asked me what i wanted done; I told them make a note and pass it along to security. That had never occurred to them. It also took them ten minutes just to find the record of my stay so I don't have much faith in their computer skills and they refused to let me speak to anyone in management above desk level. Again, I am not making any accusations against the hotel, but I think their customer skills in handling the situation were considerably less than professional. So this is a five star hotel with one star service.

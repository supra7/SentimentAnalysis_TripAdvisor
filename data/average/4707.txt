We had a nice 4-night stay at this hotel for a mini vacation during the last week of August. The location was convenient and we walked to many things. The room was fairly spacious, clean, everything was in good shape and we had an ok view. It was fairly well equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron, internet service, etc. One thing I forgot to check for when booking was an in-room safe, which they did not have. They did have safe deposit boxes at the front desk and that worked fine for us. We requested a high floor and they followed through by putting us on the top floor. The staff was wonderful. Over all we enjoyed our stay and would return. Our Sun-Wed stay got us a free night, so it was a great deal for this class hotel.

This hotel was average. The rooms smelled very strange. Our stay was 3 nights.The furniture was good with HD TV screens, standard dorm size fridge and toaster oven. Very comfy beds. Upon entry I couldn't help but notice the odd smell in the room. Almost as if they needed to change the carpet or drapery because the smell was imbedded in the room. The bathroom was in need of a paint job/new wall paper and the shower is in need of new fixtures as the ones inside it were moldy and had soap scum on them. On the second of our three night stay the fire alarm kept going off at 1 in the morning. When speaking to the staff they gladly relocated us to a different room without any problems. Again, this room smelled and could be described the same as the first room. The pool did not appear to be very clean either so we did not go in it. As for the breakfast, average food terrible coffee. But, McDonald's is right in front of the hotel so the lackluster food issue could be easily solved. Overall: great beds, nice staff. You get what you pay for, after all, it's not a resort so don't expect it to resemble one.

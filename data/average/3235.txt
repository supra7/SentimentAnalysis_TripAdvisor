The hotel has everything a business traveler needs and was a great value. We had a show at McCormick Place and it worked out really well. Diane at the front desk was a HUGE help for me... i had brought the family along on the trip and she made it easy and convenient for my wife and children to have extra time to get out of the room the last day! Thanks Diane!!

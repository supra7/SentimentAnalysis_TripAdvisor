The room was nice, charming, and large. Unfortunately, there was a family with child a few doors down. The young boy got up early and took advantage of the spacious rooms, running back and forth. From a few doors down we could hear the steps clearly. The only off street parking is by valet for which you pay. We parked on the street in front of the hotel, free over night. However, we had to feed the meter at 8:00a. All in all, we enjoyed the hotel and will probably return.

Very central Location. Reception Staff not very helpful could do with some customer training skills. Door and Conceirge Staff all very helpful and friendly. Rooms adequate small but clean. Night life very sparse as it is based in Theatre District so had to go looking for decent pubs restaurant in hotel ok if a bit overpriced. I would recommend the hotel for it's location.

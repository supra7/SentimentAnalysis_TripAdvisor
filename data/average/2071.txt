This is a hotel apartment, not a typical hotel. It feels like "bed and breakfast" to me (although no breakfast). Basically, because there are only 8 rooms, the manager/owner knows everyone who's staying there. Some people prefer this more "intimate" style but some don't. I was there on personal business (not vacation) and I just needed the convenience, and for that purpose, I found this to be good value stay - free us/canada long distance calls, wireless internet, restaurants downstairs and across street, 24 hour grocery store next door. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone going on a romantic or luxurious getaway. But if you think you'll only be there for the night and are not expecting luxurious 5 or 6-star hotel amenities etc, like I said before, this is a good value hotel. The other downside I could think of is the stairs - but you can always ask someone to help you with the luggage while taking the stairs.

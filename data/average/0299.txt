The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. They were great for helping us find our way around to local attractions and helped us find the shopping and some great restaurants. The hotel rooms have been decorated with a nice modern esthetic, BUT the facilities need some TLC. The bathroom was cramped and the fixtures were very old and had a weird layout. The bed was super comfy. The hotel was in the heart of downtown Seattle and was walking distance to a lot of shopping and attractions. Overall it was nice but needs some upgrades. Oh yeah, parking was an additional $22 per day for self parking. The walls were thin and outside noise was an issue.

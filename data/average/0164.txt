We booked this hotel on Hotwire for a family trip (my husband and 20 month old son). We were not in the right kind of place for a toddler. Starting with the mandatory $37 hotel valet parking, we knew we were probably not in the right kind of hotel. The valets were friendly enough, but considering we had a stroller in the car we needed access to, it was a pain. The hotel lobby and rooms are a-ok, but there is nothing special about them. I will say the bed is cozy and comfy, but the room felt very business-oriented. It has two phones, a desk and many cords for a toddler to yank on! There isn't even a mini fridge in the room. Breakfast in the hotel was disappointing, not to mention the only highchair in the place was broken! We would have been better off heading to Pike Place Market and getting coffee, fresh fruit and baked goods. The hotel is fine, but just not for families with young children. We'll check reviews here more carefully before booking blindly next time!

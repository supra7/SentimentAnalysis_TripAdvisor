If your looking for a hotel at Sea-Tac this is a solid choice. Friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and a free shuttle. If you need public transit into the city the train station is across the street. Rooms look like the have had a fairly recent remodel. Only watch out is 1/2 the rooms face the major street/train station so depending on your sleep schedule this might me an issue.

Nice hotel, but nothing really special. The room decor is hideous. Room is very dark and not enough natural light comes through the window, and there are simply too many colors. It was very hard to get comfortable in a room that I felt like was screaming at me. Pink and white candy striped wallpaper should be outlawed. Too many wall hangings and too many disjointed colors. Purple vases didn't match anything in the room and made me feel like I was at Mardi Gras. The pink, yellow, grey and green floral-and-ivy animal scene patterned chair is ugly, ugly, ugly. A simple wood bed would have been a better choice instead of the sky-blue and gold painted headboard I was given. Room, hotel, and restaurant are very clean. Staff is super friendly and very attentive. Flat screen tv is quite nice. Bathroom has marble counters and fixtures and floor look very clean and fresh. Wine bar from 5-6 is nice, but I was in Seattle for work, so it was hard to get to the hotel during this super-short happy hour that literally lasted exactly one hour. Overall, an average experience, but the W and Fairmont hotels across the street will give a nicer room, in the same location, for comparable prices.

My family had 3 rooms at the Crowne Plaza following an Alaskan cruise. The hotel has unusually large rooms with fantastic views, very comfortable beds, good air conditioning and great showers. However, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone for the foreseeable future due to terrible elevator issues. This is a 34-story hotel with 4 elevators, 3 of which were working during our stay (we were told that they are in the process of replacing all elevators). This, along with the very small lobby, resulted in horrible crowding as guests wait 5 minutes or more for an elevator. To avoid missing a shuttle bus that we booked, we had to leave our rooms 30 minutes before departure time. All elevators going down were completely packed, so we had to ride the elevator up to the top (stopping on every floor), then back down (again stopping on every floor). That's 33 stops to leave the hotel -- and at every stop we'd see frustrated guests who couldn't fit. Many gave up and took the stairs all the way down. Avoid at all costs until the elevators are replaced.

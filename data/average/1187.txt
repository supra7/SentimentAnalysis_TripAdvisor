This is hotel is in a superb location for all the downtown attractions and shopping. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and housekeeping did a great job. I asked for a room on the top floor and I could hardly hear the street noise, which was great for a light sleeper like me. The bed was comfy and the room on the whole was fine. It was on the small side though and if there had been two people sharing, cosy would have been an understatement! The bathroom was even tinier and my friend did comment it was like a London hotel room due to it's size! However, my main area of concern are cleanliness, comfort and location when travelling and so the hotel met my needs perfectly. If you can deal with a small room, then this is a great hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street (well, it's Seattle, of course there is!) for breakfast, much cheaper than the hotel breakfast.

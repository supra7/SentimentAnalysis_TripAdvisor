My friend and I stayed here in July of 2011. Our main reason for staying at this hotel was the location. It's only a few blocks from Michigan Avenue and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. My husband is a Hilton Diamond member and got us a room on points. We booked the room 1 month in advance and specifically asked for 2 queen size beds. To our dismay, the hotel reservation did not make note of our request, so we got a king size bed. I called the front desk and they told me that they cannot help. I was expecting them to offer us an incentive but it seemed like they didn't care much. The rooms are also very small. I noticed that a lot of the guests were young college students and they were pretty rowdy in the lobby and the halls. As part of our stay, we did get two free breakfast certificates to dine at the Weber Grill downstairs. We waiting for 90 minutes and then got seated in an area that smelled like mold. It was gross. I will not stay at this hotel again...probably will choose another Hilton downtown.

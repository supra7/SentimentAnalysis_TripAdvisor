I stayed for one night on a weekend. Check in was fine, nothing to report. We were given a nice room on an upper floor. The room was average - everything was clean and quiet. Other reviews are correct, the towels are older and there are no bathrobes. The beds are comfortable and clean. However, the valet parking fees are very overpriced and the attendants wait and expect a tip. We even found a few of the compartments in the vehicle ajar although we don't keep anything of importance in them (and they are always closed). The hotel is in a good location. Another thing we found a little strange was our experience with the concierge. We went down late on to talk to her about where to go for dinner. She said that there were only a few restaurants in the area and they were all booked up. We had never been to Seattle before but we assumed there were more than "a few" restaurants around and that she couldn't be right. We had to speak to her for a few minutes before she would even make a call to try and get us a table. We ended up getting a 9pm seating and when we got to the restaurant it was 3/4 empty. We both thought that the concierge may have been a little out of date with the happenings of the city and did not have the proper connections to fulfil her role. We also asked about night clubs and after dinner drink bars and she was only able to recommend the stuffy bars more suited for older adults (we are 28-36). Overall, the stay was average, the parking too pricey, and the room a little lacking. This is a 3.5 star at best.

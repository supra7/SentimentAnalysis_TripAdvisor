The staff was very nice and helpful. However, upon arrival, there was hair all over the lid and seat of the toilet. They offered another room, which I turned down at first, but after a 30 minute wait for housekeeping, I decided to take the other room. They kindly upgraded me to a suite, which was nice. I was also surprised at how poorly maintained the elevator floors, and some of the hallway floors were. At first glance, this is a pretty hotel, but look a little further, and it's not living up to its potential.

Ambiance--great. Staff helpfulness--great. Internet facilities---fabulous. Food--super. Room---roomy and modern. It has all the makings of a first tier hotel. But their act is not together. In a two day stay, 3 things got messed up: 1. They blew the wake-up call! Very bad! 2. They do not have phone books in rooms, and only had 3 for "check-out". Of course, other guests had all three. 3. The pay movie did not work the last night (nothing came up), but I got charged anyway, and since they screwed up the wake-up call the last morning, I did not get a chance to correct the bill while on site. What a pain !!

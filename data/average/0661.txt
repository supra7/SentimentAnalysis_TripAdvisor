Hotel Andra is right on the corner of 4th Avenue and Virginia. It's close to downtown and Pike Place. The room was really large with a walk in closet. Shower only but the bathroom was nicely laid out. The drawback is the noise from the street. We stayed on the fifth floor but the windows are poorly insulated, so we heard all the car, bus, and pedestrian traffic. It was really noisy. The front staff as well as the valet's were friendly. Free computer/internet service around the corner from the front desk was easy to use when looking up addresses. Wouldn't stay there again. The hotel restaurant was okay but the service there was terrible. The waitress and hotess were less than welcoming.

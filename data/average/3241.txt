This hotel was convinient as it was a walking distance from Mc Cormick convention centre,Chicago.The rooms were big clean and comfortable. Only thing was that it was a bit secluded from downtown chicago although you can get cab all the time. The room service and resturant needs a lot of improvement as it was not upto mark. They had fixed timings and if you are late then No Food. Well the resturant too was understaffed and does need more employees to take care of a smooth breakfast.All in all it was value for money hotel with not round the clock sevices. I would advise a round the clock cafe and bell desk and room service for improvement in the hotel facility but over alla nice stay though.

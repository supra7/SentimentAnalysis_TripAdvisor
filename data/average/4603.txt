The hotel was simply great (With reservations - ho ho) - Loved the restaurant, earthshakingly good breakfasts, the best Vodka Martinis on Earth. Brilliant staff. The room was a bit weary, there was construction owrk going on on the facade of the hotel all day long and we were advised to keep our curtains shut all day so the workmen wouldn't be peering in. (Groan, such fun to never have a decent view) I think it would be nice if we had been warned about this prior to our stay. (Some chance!) It was very noisy at night, due to some kind of ventilator outside, and my advice is, if your room faces the high rise mirrored building next door - Then get a room change. It's awful. Nothing can take away how much we loved all the staff and how fantastic all the food/drinks and service were. Just try to get the best rooms you can. It ain't cheap. The rooms/bathrooms and corridors we were given (First Floor) are long overdue a lick of paint and paper though. You aren't staying in the fabulous foyer, and in that regard it's like some of the top London hotels. The foyer is magnificent, some of the rooms a bit pants.

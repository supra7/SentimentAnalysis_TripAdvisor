In late July 2010 and all of August JW Marriott and I formed a contract for a block room for SM Town LA 2010. I set up 21 rooms and JW had said they would arrange the rooms to be on the same floor and provide us with 2 double beds since there wil be 78 people arriving for the concert. I called in 5 days prior the check in date and they told me everything was fine and all rooms are ready and early check in was fine as well. Once I got there all our rooms were scattered throughout the hotel. One room was on the 11th floor, 3 rooms on the 12th, 8 rooms on the 16th and 1 room was on the 19th floor. I called our event manager but they never picked up or responded back to me as usual since their schedule is from Monday-Thrus. What was even more annoying was some of the rooms had king beds instead of 2 double beds. Basically if you're doing a block order of 10 or more rooms JW is horrible for the job. The hotel was beautiful but I would have enjoyed it with all my hard work paid off and I could enjoy more time with my group instead of traveling up and down the elevator.

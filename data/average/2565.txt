I never saw a single member of staff whilst I was at the Travelodge Euston, check in and check out was automated. This is a shame because I would have liked a room on a higher floor to get away from the incredible noise from Eversholt Street all night long. The window was open when I arrived so I closed it for security but arriving back after a night out it was open again. It transpired the window was broken and with no staff available I couldn't complain. This also stopped me from sleeping as being on the first floor with a broken window in central London did not make me feel safe. The location is very good and the public transport options are excellent with a range of buses and 3 Underground stations within walking distance. I really only chose to stay here because of a discounted online deal, otherwise I would have probably stayed at the Novotel a few minutes walk away.

We chose this hotel as our base for the weekend celebration of our anniversary in Berlin. The main reason we chose it was a good price and a location close to tube station. The hotel itself is nice, even though some small repairs should have been done, but overall was staying there a nice experience. The staff was pleasant and the service of the hotel bar good. The only problem I find is the location - the Grand City name couldn't be more inapropriate as it is situated in a very tacky neigbourhood. There were a few homeless people on our way to a hotel and once you enter, you feel in a completely different world, but then there is the walk from hotel to tube again and... well thank god I was with my boyfriend because I would have been very scared to walk around that area alone in the dark. If that's not an issue for you, however, pick this hotel and enjoy the prices.

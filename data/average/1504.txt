Spent a week at Secrets Maroma from april 10 to 17th... too expensive for what you get... paid for Preferred Club... rip off... all you get is a better location... you still have to run for the chairs around the pool as there are no reserve area for preferred club... the pool area is very nice, and the beach is really beautiful. A big plus: the chefs coming around the pool with finger foods... that was amazing. The service as well around the pool, thanks to Flor, is also amazing. Paulo, concierge around the pool, will get you whatever you need... with a little tip... of course... My main disappointment was the restaurants... the food was below average.. way below... except for the Italian... not bad if you stick to pasta or fish... the japaneese is good but we were kicked out of there within 1hr10 min from the start for another group... the mexican was awful... the buffet for breakfast was very good with lots of good fruits... The room was very nice and very clean... the patio is nice but the sofa on it is not comfortable if you want to sit there and read a book... All this to say that this hotel at over $3000 a head is way way too expensive..

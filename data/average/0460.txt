The winning point for the Hilton is its location! You can walk to Pikes Market or get a bus.. Walk to get the monorail in the direction of Macys. You can also walk over to the Sheraton( beautiful hotel) and book a Grayline tour or check with the concierge on the Lobby level.. Shopping is close by. From the airport you can get to the Hilton Hotel using the Airporter which can be picked up at the end of baggage, This bus stops and picks up at the Hilton Hotel round trip is $18.00 per person. A few negativesthe hotel rooms are small. The bathroom is too small. I did not like the toilet in with the shower behind a closed door. The lighting in the bathroom is to dim.( I know conservation). The walls are a bit thin. The TV seemed to be programmed not to go too loud. For a Hilton Rooms are bland and dull! Breakfast on the Top floor is average and over-priced. You can get a quick meal at Fergies next door. On a bright side, the room was clean with large flat screen TV, it is clear the rooms have been graded a bit, bed comfortable the staff friendly and helpful. This is Business Hotel with little character. Car Rental Desk located in the hotel great for renting car for a day and return. ToursI would recommend the Duck Tour for children and adults, it is just simply fun! Cost $25.00 per person but must pick up at the Space Needle.( take the Monorail cost $2.00 per person with Senior and Children discounts) Pikes Market is fun and interesting.( there is Pikes Market Tour) We did not take , but wondered around on our own. Boeing Tour is great for learning about how planes are put together. Everert(Boeing Factory) is located about 30 miles outside of Seattle. Tours are between $48- $56 depending on Tour Company. If you have a car you can drive but know that to park a car in a Seattle downtown hotel is very costly.

This is a very nice looking hotel which we got for a reasonable price; however, we were surprised to find that other than a grand lobby, there are no amenities to speak of (no pool, no hot tub) and you have to pay for WIFI. Ridiculous. It is also located by a major highway and although we were on the highest floor we were overwhelmed with noise. Turning on the train-like AC system didn't help. We wondered why there were complimentary ear plugs in the room. I am not kidding; and, I had to use them. This hotel is suited for business travelers I imagine; but, as a family, it was not for us. Thankfully we were there for only one night. We were taking the Clipper the next morning - and, the staff messed up our taxi request. At 7am we were scrambling to find our way and I was not impressed! If you just want a bed, you sleep like a rock, and you get it for a good rate, then it might be for you.

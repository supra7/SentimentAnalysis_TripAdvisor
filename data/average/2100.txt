It is convenently located in the center of the Old Istanbul (right on the tram line). The hotel offers what are necessary for independent budget travelers -- small room/shower, modest breakfast, and free wireless connection. The hotel staffs were generally very helpful during my stay. The cleanness of the room was just adequate. However, I had been bothered by the noise coming from the reception, lobby, and corridor. This kind of complaint can be subjective, but the level of noise is probably high as I am relatively not sensitive to noise.

We stayed here for four nights at a convention. This is a nice, very large, hotel, which as a Marriott it should be. Check-in was efficient and we got a 25th floor room with a view of the Charles River. We asked for a King but got two queens. The size of the room was OK, but hardly spacious, but the bathroom is particularly small, as is the closet. As other reviewers have indicated, internet connection is very expensive/exorbitant. Why not also charge for water, electricity, etc.? We did not try the restaurants, but guest services was rather unresponsive. It should not be necessary to call the front desk manager to ask for the third time for closet hangers. The location is excellent for sightseeing; hotel is joined by a skyway to the Prudential Centre and the Boylston Mall, providing handy access to a good range of shops, if you are interested. There are also some very good restaurants nearby. Try the Atlantic Fish Company at 761 Boylston. The seafood is excellent and they have a fairly good wine list (Wine Spectator award). You will need reservations and it's easily walkable.

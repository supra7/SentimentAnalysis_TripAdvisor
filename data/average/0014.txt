My son and I just stayed a week at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle. The location was great; we were able to walk to WNBA, MLS, and MLB games. There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said "well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there's a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall". Then, I didn't get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there's a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there's just a half hearted effort for these "perks". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine. The room was nice; the food in the restaurant was great. We loved our pet fish (Fred).

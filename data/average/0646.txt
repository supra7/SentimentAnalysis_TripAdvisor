I went to visit a friend in Seattle in mid-September and see a game at Husky Stadium. I chose this place after looking around on various websites for an affordable hotel room in downtown. This place fit that bill. The room was average--a typical midgrade hotel. Very clean. The only real downside was that the walls did not hold sound out from the outside. I heard a lot of noise from other rooms as well as from outside. Fortunately I slept well. The staff was very nice and was willing to hold my bags for me for a few hours after I checked out. There is a restaurant in the hotel; I ate breakfast there and the food was pretty good. This hotel is about 3 blocks from Westlake Center, which is the terminus of both the S Lake Union streetcar and the monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle area). It is about six blocks from the Pike Place market (up and down a hill).

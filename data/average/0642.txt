Avoid Room 325 as its window fronts to the restaurant A/C unit and you'll be listening to it all night. The in-house restaurant itself is good though. It's convenient and comfortable with good traditional fare at a reasonable price. If you need fancy or elegant, then head up the street to the "towers" and get out you wallet.

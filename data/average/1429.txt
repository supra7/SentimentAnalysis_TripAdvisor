Oh Well where do iSTt When i arrived at the hotel , Front Desk People were friendly and check in , was Fast , the lobby is beautiful , I was excited to be Here , .Went up to the room, Expecting a great Room ,for 300 or so$, price oh Well i was just ordinary , in style , modern room , with a cramped feeling to it , Nice bed but in Somewhat Small Room ,and Tiny Living Room , with cheap Furniture , the Kind you find in Target, and a small kitchenette galley ,bathroom is Nice ,and Clean , ok Then i accept it like that ,was too excited to complain in front of friends , it is not better than suite hotels you found on major highways in usa , like the amerisuites , hotel that i previously stayed in california this summer , and paid $ 79 us , per night , with more amenities , like a gift shop , great breakfast and nice lobby entertainment like a late open bar , none here in this hotel , we found a great breakfast place ard corner at cora, crowded bars on crescent street ,next block , we had a blast there ,the hotel is part appartment , and i heard from cleaning lady that it is Time Sharing , hotel , Funny but i was not surpsed about it ,This Hotel even tow , it is beautiful at first , doesnt have a Soul , it really look like any Luxury appartment Building , in any Big Cities , Bt Seriously When i want to go on Vacation , i want to feel like i am on Vacation , Not Renting , Out a Sublet in a Boring Appartment Building with No Extras , Like a Gift Shop , Late Dinner Restaurant , Bar with Nice Music , None you Findng here at Le Crystal , Oh Yes there is A Beautiful Crystal Chandellier , But Sadly it is Not Able to compensate , for the Lack of Amenites ,

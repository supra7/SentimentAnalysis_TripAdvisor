I was a little underwhelmed with this hotel. The price was good, though, so I wasn't expecting the world. I had read reviews saying the hotel was run down. It isn't. It's an older property so isn't brand-spankin' new, but it is certainly not run-down. We stayed in a basic room. It was a basic room. Standard layout. Small bathroom. Excellent bed. The lobby is unimpressive. There are no restaurants in the hotel except a coffee shop. However, there is a great italian place just up the street with the best tiramisu. The staff were very friendly. We came with two dogs, so we're not the most desirable clientele, but the staff were all very accommodating. All-in-all, there was nothing really wrong with this place but I don't think I would stay here again. It was just very average.

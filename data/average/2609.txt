Despite reserving and paying for a double bedded room, was assigned a king bed room at check-in and had to argue with front desk staff to be placed in the correct room type. Rooms are typical NYC small. Bathroom was very tight, with small shower only, no tub. Linens were fine and beds were nice and comfortable. Carpets in room and hallway could have used a good vacuum. On the 15th floor, and street facing, our room was quiet. I would not have wanted to be on one of the lower floors as the restaurant/bar (San Rocco's) next door had loud action/music spilling out onto the front patio until the wee hours. As noted by earlier reviewers, the lobby of this hotel is absolutely miniscule. Don't plan on spending any time there - or meeting anyone there - as there's just no space. Overall, a decent stay, helped greatly by the super location.

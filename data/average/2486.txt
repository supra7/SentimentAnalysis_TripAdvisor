The front door employee on the first floor is extremely nice. One of the employee saw us ran down the stairs. He ran to open the door for us. very very impressive. However, the rest is just average. I don't think it reaches the 4-star level. The bed is really bad. The middle part sinks. When I asked the guest service if there is anything that they can do, she said no and it is just because the bed is too soft. This is ridiculous. The bed is really not even.

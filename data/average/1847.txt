Lots of reviews on this property already so I will provide a quick runthrough of the good, the bad and the ugly. The good: - nice pool, great for kids - tennis courts, and lots of them, too bad not lit at night - golf course next door - good breakfast (free with some packages) - decent rooms - close to some good snorkelling sites - a great hotel gym (kudos to the Hyatt on this one) the bad: - far from the airport, far from the scenic part of the island - not a very nice beach next to the hotel - hard to get chairs at the pool - this is a big resort! - nothing to do a night on site (and I mean NOTHING!)..singles beware, this place is primarily for families - Noisy rooms - if you are a light sleeper, prepare to be woken up at 6am or whenever the first guy on your floor leaves his/her room. the ugly: - 600 bucks a nite for a partial ocean view room?! (during peak season mind you).....for that amount I can stay at the 4 seasons which is nicer. (it was sold out)...... Hope this helps. My 10 year old nieces loved it....I didn't.

Augusta Lucilla Palace Hotel Yes it has just been refitted and is very clean and tidy. The rooms a very small as is the bathroom. However the Buffet breakfast is possibly the worst I have ever had in over thirty years of travel. For this room rate you can do a lot better for your dollar elsewhere. Four star it's not, no room service bar not part of the hotel so no charge back just small things but the value is just not there.

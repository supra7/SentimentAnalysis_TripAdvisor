My wife and I stayed here in April for the second time, and I do hope to return if we somehow travel to Baltimore. I don't have any major issue with the hotel, but also feel strongly that It shouldn't be rated as one of the top hotels in Baltimore. We just had too many small things that seemed inappropriate, from not being able to control the room temperature, to needing to reset their TV after a storm, to having laundry carts trundle through the breakfast area 8 times. The rooms are very nice and comfortable, and the location on the inner harbor is very interesting, especially with the boats that can take you around. I don't have any experience with the other hotels, I just find it hard to believe this is one of the best.

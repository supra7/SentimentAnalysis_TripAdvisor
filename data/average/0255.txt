We stayed at the Moore Hotel for one night at the end of July 2011. The hotel is ideally located just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market right in the center of downtown. The staff is very friendly and helpful so you tend to overlook some of the other shortcomings. The hotel is old, the elevator is old, the rooms are very basic with no coffee maker, no alarm clock, small older TV. There is quite some noise from the street if you open your windows. The bathroom is old with no vanity. Having said all of that, the rooms are very clean and they are non-smoking. The rates at this hotel are great and it is still a good value for the budget traveler.

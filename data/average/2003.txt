I stayed here for 1 day due to work. Pro: 1. TV channels was good. 2. Room was spacious and toilet ok with hot water. 3. Price was cheap, Sg $115/nite. Near an MRT station by walking distance or by taxi. There is petrol station next door so easy to get stuff. 4. Use the internet at business center for Sg $4/30 minutes. It was fast. Cons: 1. Air-conditioner was centralized so cannot turn it off. Feel like sleeping in freezer. Windows cannot open to equilibraite the room. 2. Hotel staff not very friendly and do not enjoy to work there. Overall, I do not recommend this hotel for centralized air conditioner which makes the room unbearable to sleep.

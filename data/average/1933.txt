First, note that there are 3 hotels with Kaanapali Beach in their name. Until we arrived, I thought I had reserved a different one. I would say that this hotel is a solid 3 star rating. Adequate is how I would rate most facets of this hotel. There are no large rooms or suites here. The pool is small and must be crowded when the hotel is close to full. The rooms are clean. The hallways and elevators are run down. The Mixed Grill restaurant is a small buffet with mediocre food. The other, larger, outdoor restaurant facing the stage area has better food. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The location is quite good, being close to The Whalers Village and a short shuttle ride into Lahaina town, which is a lot of fun. They have free outdoor stage entertainment every night from about 6:30 - 9:00pm. Don't pay rack rate for this hotel. It is a good value if you book it at a package price. Considering how very expensive Maui is in every way, one way to save money is to use this hotel on a package rate. See my recommendations for Hula restaurant and the Warren & Annabelle show.

The room was clean. We had requested a refrigerator, which was brought to our room, but was filthy and smelly. The manager came to our room and apologize and had it removed from our room immediately and replaced. She also adjusted our bill, which was a nice bonus. Unfortunately, the pool was overcrowded with early twenty somethings horsing around, which didn't allow for other children to enter the pool for fear of being hurt. Management came and had them get out of the pool for a while so the other children could go in the pool. The morning breakfast was very nice with make your own waffles. We were told we would be able to get breakfast on Sunday morning when we checked out even though breakfast didn't start until 7 and we needed to get something by 6:45. That day the girl working the breakfast knew we needed to eat and get out and on the road, but she made sure nothing was out until 7 and as she was setting up she was talking and joking to her coworker, who advised us she wasn't on the clock yet. The girl setting up refused to refill the hot water for tea, unlock the refrigerater so we could get yogurt or put some fruit out. This is all we wanted. She was rude and lazy and should not be in the hospitality business.

The hotel is in a very nice location down a side street just over a bridge. The decor and style of the hotel is very accurate as per the pics. Venitian yet contemporary. The staff were very friendly and helpfull and we were upgraded to canal view free of charge on arrival. This was nice but I wouldnt recommend paying the extra for what you actually get. Our room was next to the breakfast restaurant so from 6 every morning it was quite noisy, not from the hotel workers more from other gueats using the breakfast room. The room was very large with a tv, unfortunately the tv was small and on the furthest wall from the bed. Another point I found that goes against the hotel slightly is the non availabilty of irons (not good if you wanted to dress smartly for an evening meal and have just travelled with everything in a small suitcase) so please bear that in mind. Apparently the proximity to the opera house makes their insurance premiums too high to provide irons ??!! All in all I got a deal and got three nights for two so the cost of the rooms was very reasonable. I would hesitate to pay the full brochure price as I think maybe that is a little more than the room was worth but the offers that you can find make it extremely good value.

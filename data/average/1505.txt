My husband and I visited the hotel in April. We wanted a quiet and peaceful resort where we could relax. Overall, the resort was beautiful, the beach was amazing and we enjoyed our stay. There were certain areas that could be improved however... 1) The food was average at best, not at all what one would expect from a hotel of this caliber. Food service was horrible. 2) The "entertainment crew" by the pool bordered on obnoxious. They promoted more of a "spring break" atmosphere which we felt negatively impacted the experience. We will look for a different place for our next trip to Mexico.

This hotel is good value for money, but the fact that breakfast is included is neither here nor there and they shouldn't use it as a selling point. Watered down orange juice, cheap bread, awful looking processed cold meats and cheese and cheap coffee. True, you could eat as much as you want, but would anyone want to?!! The room was OK - very nice bathroom although only cheap bars of soap provided. Decent furnishings with enough space to do work on a laptop.

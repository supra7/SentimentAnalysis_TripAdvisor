This hotel was within walking distance of several places which is very nice. I figured I would park the car in the lot I assumed was close and walk to the party I was attending a few blocks away. The lot wouldnt let me pay for longer than a few hours at a time and was very expensive. I could go on and on about my bad parking experience, I will just say if you can take a taxi here that is great...cute little hotel. Otherwise choose another because the money you will save on the hotel you will pay for in parking.

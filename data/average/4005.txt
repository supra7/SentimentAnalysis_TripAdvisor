Its a $100 a night motel so you can't expect too much as far as the rooms and ammenities. What really makes your stay special is the night manager. Wow. He is a special guy. When I finally got here to check in after a horrible drive I was told by Lavon that there might be a problem with my room. Thinking the worst I ask what the problem is and was told that the people above were loud. These volkswagon people he tells me, its worse than senior week. Huh. I am here for the VWs and my husband is coming along in our mk2. I guess he did not hear me because he right on ranting about how loud these people are. Saw some great cars and made some good friends, but I don't think we will stay here next year.

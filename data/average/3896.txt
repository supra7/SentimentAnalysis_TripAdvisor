I booked my room at Point Orlando after reading Trip Advisor reviews. The room was nice, and the base rate seemed reasonable, but the extra $10.00 per day "resort fee" seems unreasonable. Why not just include this fee in the basic rate? The hotel just didn't have a resort feel. The family in the room next to us in which we shared the same foyer chose to leave their door opened a lot which means we saw and smelled more than we cared to. Plus, parking was a nightmare! There are no rear or side entrances so all guests must enter the front. Be ready for a very long walk to and from the entrance to your car which is the last thing you want to do after spending all day at theme parks. We wanted to spend an extra day in Orlando, but didn't wan't to dole out another $90 at Point Orlando. On the morning we checked out we booked a room on Hotwire for $42 at Spring Hill Suites just down the street. We found that hotel much more comfortable with free amenities including free breakfast. Plus they had a room available and let us check in at 10 AM. My next visit to town will not be at The Point Orlando. I'll take my resort fee elsewhere thank you...

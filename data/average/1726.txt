Hyatt Maui is a beautiful and relaxing resort. The ocean view is fantastic! The hotel ground is beautiful, and pools are really great! I really enjoyed every minute of the resort until I had a dinner at Sonz (Swan Court). Sonz is a really nice restaurant. The food was great. However, the attitude of a waiter (man who wore white shirts. He looks like a manager. His clothes are different from that of other waiters) is really bad. He spilled the beer at my table. He did not say anything, and left the table. He is not kind. When we finished our entree, he left the check. Even though our party size is two, he wrote 20% tip on the check and left. I cannot believe the attitude of the manager.

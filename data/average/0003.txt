perfect location in downtown seattle walking dostance to dining , shopping , pretty much any thing in DT . Rooms are very dated , reletively small bathrooms and paper thin walls. could hear when the room next door using their bathroom ! free Coffe in the lobby early in the morning ( 6 to 8 ) was a nice touch. If you become a kimpton memebr (its free ) you can use wifi for free . for the price paid , I've stayed in better hotels in Seattle . a printed list in the washroon tells you what items you can get for free in the hotel ,that lst include shower cap , toothbrush,.... you'll find a toothbrush in your room too , but if you use it you must pay for it , the list in the washroom refers to the toothbrush you should have asked for from the house keeping not the one already put in your room ! that one you should pay for !

The hotel is located just outside of the downtown area but a block or two from the monorail. It is appropriately rated a 2-star hotel. I stayed at the hotel for two nights because I was attending a conference at the convention center. Checking in and checking out was speedy and pleasant. The hotel room was okay, it was a nice size, clean (although I did find a hair on one of the towels). If you need an inexpensive place to stay with basic amenities, this place is fine.

To be honest, I expected more from a Fairmont hotel. While the Fairmont Copley Plaza is situated in a beautiful, historic building, you don't really get much in return for the price you pay to stay in this hotel. The mini-bar prices are absolutely outrageous ($7 for a bottle of water!), and the internet fees are ridiculous ($14/day). Luckily, I am a member of their President's Club so I did not have to pay the daily internet fee. Though the hotel is in a great location and right next an enormous indoor mall, we were given a room with no view, and the furniture was rather old and musty looking. I expected a better room (perhaps with an actual view) for a President's Club member. I would not stay at this hotel again...I would recommend the Bulfinch hotel which is also in downtown Boston, cheaper, and nicer rooms without the outrageous prices!

I read all of the reviews and decided to be open minded. The hotel is still under renovation and the main entrance is currently on Wabash. I was assigned a room on the 19th floor and because of a previous experience with a hotel and a fire alarm situation I asked to be located on a lower floor. My new room was on the 9th floor. I knew before hand that the hotel did not provide a coffee maker (hello, this is 2008!) but was informed that guests could rent one for the duration of their stay. (No Longer true). I brought instant coffee and creamer with me (Yuck). Supposedly a Starbucks is moving in on the first level soon. My room was very small, I mean small! The bathroom door opened up to the toilet. Also my closet door did not close. The view from my window was a iron clad wall and I had to pin my curtains shut to close them all the way. The staff was cordial, especially the bellhop and the Lockwood (hotel restaurant) bartender. The location can't be beat but if you have breathing problems you might consider staying somewhere else because of the taxi congestion and the hotel being situated directly next to/ slightly under the "L".

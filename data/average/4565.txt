We received an incredible deal via Priceline ($75/night) for this property. Located in Downtown Crossing, it is not a terrible place to stay, but not the best either. The entire setup of the hotel is weird itself. All guests must take 2 elevators to get to their accomodations. One elevator to the lobby, then another elevator to the rooms. Check in was okay. We were unable to get a King Size bed, but while the women who was checking us in was going to see if one was available, another gentlemen who was behind the desk chimed in and talked over the women who was checking us in. It was an odd occurance and rude to say the least...and definately didn't make a great impression having just walked in the door. Anyways, we went up to our room on the 11th floor. The rooms are nicely appointed. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean. (Just a warning, the bathroom floors do get VERY slippery when wet!!) We left the hotel for our dinner reservation and came back around 1am. We left our breakfast room service order on the doorknob. In the morning, we received the breakfast late and cold. It definately wasn't worth the $16 for a simple breakfast sandwich. The Hyatt is definately not a horrible place to stay. We were in Boston for the evening and on the spur of the moment got a great deal. If you are looking for impeccable customer service and amenities this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay in a decent part of the city this is a great hotel. By no means would I ever pay full price for this property. There are definately better hotels in the city of Boston in far greater locations. The odd setup and layout of the hotel does not make you feel like you are staying at an upscale property. Our stay was by no means horrible, but not one of the most memorable from the hotel's perspective. All in all, it is a better than average property...but as I stated before there are better places to stay in Boston.

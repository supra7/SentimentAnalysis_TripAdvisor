I found the hotel to be ok for my needs, which was going to visit a client a block away. The place isn't the Hilton, but everything I needed was there, easy access to the highway, close to places to eat, access to malls and shops just a breeze away. I would return if I needed to go back to the client, but sure enough this isn't the place to spend your vaction at.

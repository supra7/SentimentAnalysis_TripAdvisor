We came back early from a home swap and decided to deal with jetlag at a Hilton. We confirmed our reservation two months in advance. When we arrived, we were given a room on the second floor overlooking a roof and a large, noisy, central water cooler and various exhaust vents. I mentioned this to the reception and received shrugged shoulders as a reply. Apparently the hotel was full. That night, we did not sleep well because of the noise from the mechanical unit on the adjacent roof. One would think that with two months notice we might have been given a better room.

The hotel claimed to be minutes from MIT but this was true only if you had your own car. They have a shuttle but it goes to Harvard square and nor MIT. The hotel is inconveniently located. You are totally dependent on their shuttle if you want to explore Boston & Cambridge unless you have a car (parking charges at the hotel & in Boston are steep) or want to take a taxi. The rooms were good, but they charge for internet. They do have free internet in the lobby on their computers. Breakfast was good and HHonors members get a discount!

Stayed there for 1 night in a double full room. I liked reviews here and pictures on the hotel site. But was a bit disappointed by unfriendly staff, our room, which was narrow and had its windows facing the bridge with all its noise. Pillow cases were creased, everything a worn. I won't stay here again.

Location: 3 Cleanliness: 5 Bathroom: 4 Amenities: 3 Room Space: 4 Staff: 3 There is really no point of staying in downtown Miami unless you are visiting for a Miami Heat Game or concert at the American Airlines Arena or Opera. Nightlife and daytime actitivies are non exsistent. I would definately recommend a hotel on miami beach or the south beach area. All with all a nice hotel (although the waittime at the lifts can be quite substansial) and great for visiting Miami with a group like we did but would not stay here again when I would visit Miami.

Just spent 4 nights at this hotel. The location was great for an event that occurred at the Seattle Center, the staff was pleasant,but.......the rooms aren't much. Everything is on the worn side. For the $50-$79 dollar range yeah it works, but above that I might question it. A word of advice...check your sheets to make sure they were changed, mine weren't and I had to go tell them of the fact. Also you might want to bring your own shampoo and lotion because after one night's use they don't like to restock them. On the 3rd evening I had to go ask for some. I wasn't real impressed with this hotel and at a rate of $99 a night next time I will look elsewhere. Oh if you have a car $20 a day to park. Take the bus from the airport a $2 trip.

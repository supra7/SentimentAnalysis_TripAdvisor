My husband and I spent a long time researching and finding the right spot for our much anticipated Hawaii trip. Neither of us had ever been and we decided we wanted to do it right. We decided on the place due to great reviews and the extras...I mean this place has penguins!! (but not while we were there..they were on vacation while the place is under construction) When we arrived at the lobby the exterior was covered in scaffolding/ladders/etc. Not exactly what I expected, but not really a big deal...I didn't come here to look at the exterior all day. When we checked in the woman at the front desk slipped us a paper about the scaffolding which I read later and it said they had some repairs to do. The next day (Sunday) after being out for a while, we got another note on the door saying they'd be doing construction from 9-4 starting that Monday (10/17/11) to Sat through December 2011. I didn't really think this was a big deal either, until we were at the pool that Tuesday, enjoying the sound of waves crashing but then IT started. Sawing, drilling, hammering, etc. Not really why I paid extra money for a higher end place. They tried to help the noise by bringing in musicians to drown out the sound, but didn't really help. When we were in our room all we could hear was construction noise. I understand there is never really a great time to do construction, but this was a total surprise to us and not a cheap vacation. It would be one thing if we knew ahead of time and got a great rate, but this was not the case and I feel someone cheated from my "relaxing" and once in a life time vacation. I would have booked somewhere else. I am sure this place is awesome when there isn't any construction going on, but unfortunetly that will part of my memory of this place forever.

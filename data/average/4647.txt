Fantastic lobby and downhill from there. This is one of those hotels that charges you every chance they get. Another reviewer cited the $7 bottle of water. What he forgot to mention is that it really is $7+tax+a 10% restocking fee". I travel a lot on business and have never heard of a "restocking fee".Cha-ching. You want a coffee pot in your room? You know, like Courtyard's routinley supply. Well that coffee pot's gonna cost you $10 per night. Cha-ching. How about hi-speed internet service? $13.95. Cha-ching. And after all those charges, all you ahve is a small room in a tired old hotel. Give me a new Marriott any day.

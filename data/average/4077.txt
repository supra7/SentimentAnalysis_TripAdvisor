this is an attractive hotel with perfectly acceptable rooms and good service. A few issues kept it from being "above average" for me. The rooms were clean, bed was comfortable but room was poorly laid out and cramped (coffee pot was located in the closet; you could not turn around in the bathroom without shutting the door;) Check in fast and friendly. New fitness center quite nice, but pool tiny and even the two small lap lanes were full of children. Elevators slow as molasses in January - especially if you are here for a conference when large groups of people are all trying to return to their rooms at once... with 9+ elevators you'd think there would be a more efficient way to time them. Excellent location though, literally steps from two adjacent malls and the lively Newbury and Boylston street shops and restaurants. Construction noise was minimal, not an issue.

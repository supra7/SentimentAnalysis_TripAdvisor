We arrived at midnight at the hotel only to be told we had no room, complete with a 3 and 8 year old.They apparently were full up. They had "checked" my credit card the day before and said it had not worked (never not worked before and it worked perfectly at several locations in istanbul the time we were there).They did not send an email or try to contact me to say they would be giving our room away.However they did find us another room in another hotel.This was a tiny room with 2 single beds.Not very good for 2 adults and 2 children(hardly slept) Not in the same place either.The staff were friendly and appologised but if my husband hadn`t been turkish i don`t know what we would have done as the staff on the night of our arrival spoke turkish only.When it came to paying (The full price) my credit card did not work in their machine so we had to pay in turkish lira which worked out more expensive.Read reviews before we set of and lots of people complained that the credit card machine had not worked.My advice is double check the day before you go that your room is still availiable and take erous to pay them.

The hotel staff recommended we book their suite b/c we were traveling on our honeymoon. It featured a nice jacuzzi and large room. It was almost twice the amount of the regular room but we splurged because it was our honeymoon. When we arrived at the hotel we were not greeted warmly, we were asked for our passports and shown our room. The jacuzzi did not work-it was empty b/c they were having problems. This was disappointing but we understood. The next day we were glad to see it filled but the water was cold. We inquired about the temperature and we were promised an answer in the morning but we never received one. This happened every night of our four night stay. We were finally told there was no way to make the water warmer, so we were unable to use the jacuzzi the entire time. We are still unsure about whether this reflects a difference in the way we expect a jacuzzi or if there was just something wrong with it. We expected a jacuzzi with hot water and jets, while the water was cold/room temperature with jets. At check out we brought up the issue again. We were given a slight discount after we uncomfortably pressed the issue. No one ever took responsibility for the jacuzzi issue and we constantly felt as if we were bothering them about it. Had we booked the original room we probably would have tons of positive things to say about this hotel because it was clean, the breakfast was nice, and the location was great. The evening staff was mostly nice, especially the woman. I might recommend this hotel for the regular room, but I would probably not stay there again. The main suite was not worth the extra money and the discount they gave us did not reflect the difference.

Check-in, baggage delivery, and especially the elevators were very, very slow. On the guest suite side of the building, there was an atrium of sorts in the middle and all load noises: room service or attendants knocking on doors, screaming kids, or any other significant noise from the lower floors traveled up through the atrium and therefore we found the hotel to be loud. We also found the TV system and the phone system to be cumbersome to use. For the life of me, I could not figure out how to set the alarm. I ended up requesting a wake-up call, which rang late. Room quality was excellent. Nice space, well designed bath and feather bed was great.

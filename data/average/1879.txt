Great location, average service, old hard mattress with old bedding. The rooms need a facelift. The grounds are beautiful though. We were bothered by smokers above and next to our room despite having a non-smoking room. We called the front desk to confirm that we were in a non-smoking room, they offered no solution to our problem. We could not open our doors due to cigarette smoke. I would not stay here again despite the property's highlights.

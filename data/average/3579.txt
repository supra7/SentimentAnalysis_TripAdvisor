The first time we stayed at Resort Quest, we loved it. We were very disappointed this time. First of all, we had noisy neighbors next to us who sounded like they were moving furniture all night. The dryer took hours to dry one load of clothes. We opted not to have cleaning service or linens replenished on a daily basis. However, someone did come into the condo and took out the trash. Someone took my sons cellphone and made over $1200 in calls to Honduras. The televisions were outdated and security was very lax, unlike our first visit. We love the location and the close proximity to stores and parks, but I don't think I will be staying there the next time.

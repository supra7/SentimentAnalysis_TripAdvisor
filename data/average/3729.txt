The rooms are 'compact' but not bad. Read the reviews before you go and you wont be surprised. Valet does take some time to get your car ($20 parking per day) but if you call 15 minutes before you need your car there is no problem. We had 3 rooms;a handicap accessable suite , a room with two queen beds and a room with one queen bed. The suite had a fully equiped kitchen, nice! The other rooms were nice, but not worth the $$$$. The bottles of water you find in your room will cost you $3.00 each and the little bottle of spray starch next to the iron is $2.49....I dont know what the charge was if you used the iron!! The elevators are slow...but not horrible. The staff at the hotel could not have been nicer! We had some special needs and they went out of their way to help us. I dont know what the other hotels in the area are like, but the wonderful staff at the Magnolia would make me return to this hotel.

Faced with every hotel in downtown Seattle full I had little choice but to book the Doubletree at Seattle Tacoma Airport. It is a big hotel with several wings and if you get a room in the tower it saves a lot of walking. Packed with retired cruise ship passengers, it took time to be checked in. Reception staff though were polite but not that efficient. I was given the wrong vouchers for breakfast (included in the room rate I ourchased). This was quickly rectified by the waitress the next morning who obtained the right vouchers for me. One obvious deficiency is no bottles of drinking water in the room. You are supposed to go to the machine on your floor and pay USD1.75 for a bottle of water, and then the machine fails to deliver the bottle! Reception however retrieved the situation quickly and put two bottles of water in my room. Good service recovery. The restaurant is far too small and at dinner I had to try and get a table at the bar. Food was quite good but service rather slow because of so many guests. Room decor is drab and boring, but overall the hotel was functional and I did get a couple of nights decent sleep.

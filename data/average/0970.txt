I booked this hotel because of a promotion for the third night free, but when I arrived, they said I couldn't use that promotion. We ended up splitting the difference for the third night, but I still feel the promotion was disingenuous. As far as the room, it was average with no problems. Breakfast got quite monotonous day after day. No changes at all. It's about a 10-15 minute drive to the city, which wasn't bad.

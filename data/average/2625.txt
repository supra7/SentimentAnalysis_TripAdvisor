The hotel was clean, and located well. But for 2 people, if we had to stay in the hotel room our entire stay we would have gone mad! Perfect for sleeping- and that's it.( The sheets were really really soft, and the mattress was quite comfy). I had to close our window curtains because I felt like I was going to fall out of the room.The bathroom was quite large, and it did have a nice flat screen tv. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Undecided if I'd stay here again. The price was good though, just so small.

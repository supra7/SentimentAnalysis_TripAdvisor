The pros: Clean and new with modern kitchen and bathrooms and a decent value overall. The cons: Very noisy, you can hear the passing traffic very clearly but worst of all is that you can easily hear the people in adjacent units and also from units above - from people talking down to chairs being dragged around. The walls are very thin and each night we stayed we were disturbed to the point where we had to complain twice. The beds were not comfortable and the bedding was outdated and old looking, like from an old spare room at somebody's house. The pillows were cheap and filled with batting and the spreads were those old 70's looking ones. The sheets didn't fit and constantly popped off - a problem in all three bedrooms. The unit was clean for the most part but one of the rooms did have some remnants from the last occupants. The living room furniture also was worn and looked like it was from a thrift store. The issues with the bedrooms and furniture were surprising since the kitchens and bathrooms were very updated with granite countertops and nice cabinetry. It was very out of place. We paid the extra money for fresh towels each day, which we sometimes got. The bedrooms could also use some ceiling fans since the unit felt very stuffy and dry at night. The staff were very nice and attentive to our complaints and did make an effort to rectify. This resort is in a great location and if they could update the bedding it would be a home run but as it is now, I would not come back. It was just too uncomfortable at night. Also, an easy fix to hearing chairs being dragged around would be to add felt pads to the legs.

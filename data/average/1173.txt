Really liked the Max Hotel, but the room was quite small and we had some problems at check-in. We had called several days ahead and arranged for a late arrival. Upon check in, we were told that our room had been "reassigned" and the king that we had paid for was not available. After 20 minutes of haggling, a king sized room was made available for us and we were allowed to check in. The remainer of the 4 nights stay was OK. The bath is REALLY small. I did not find the desk staff to be very helpful.

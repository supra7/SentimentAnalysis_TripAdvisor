It is a nice hotel at a very good location with everything within a (short) walking distance. Got a room in 20th floor with a very nice view. Was told at check in that valet parking was USD. 22,- pr. night and they charged USD. 32,- and had no interest in changing that. Very arrogant staff in the front desk. And again, with the "big" chains, they will charge you USD. 10,- for WIFI! Not good!

Stayed here one night using Hilton Honors points before flying out the next morning. Only ten minutes from the airport which was nice for an early flight. They told us breakfast didn't start until 6 am, which was the same time our flight left, so we bought pastry to eat before we left for the airport. Walked through the lobby at 4:30 am and breakfast was out. Oh well. Room was small, but included fridge and microwave. Front desk was very helpful with maps of the area, but traffic was terrible. There are probably better airport hotels around there.

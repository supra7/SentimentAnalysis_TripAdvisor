Stayed one night early March with my husband. Read such a variety of things I wasn't sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. After a nice drive from NYC, we found parking easily, checked in early and got a really decent room. Sounds like there are vast differences in furniture, size, etc... depending on what room/floor you're on. We were on 5 with a walk-in shower which we really didn't mind. Hotel gave us wrong tickets for our aquarium package, but corrected the mistake very nicely. I would stay here again as long as I specified a certain room. It's a lovely, historic hotel. LOVED Davio's restaurant around the corner. Went there for dinner and back again for dessert after we saw a show.

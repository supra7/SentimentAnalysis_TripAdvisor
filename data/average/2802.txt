I stayed here for one night whilst waiting for a flight to get back to England. It did absolutely the job it was intended to do and made me think it would be perfectly adequate for short stays whilst in New Orleans or longer stays if you just need a 'base'. The room was fairly large and had a full kitcken facility which was rather novel. The bathroom was small but useable and the beds were comfortable. The internet access was not bad at all and was free as I would expect it to be. The location of this hotel is not perfect. Whilst you are on Canal St, you are still several blocks from the heart of the French Quarter and this is not an area I would like to see a woman walking alone late at night. Having said that, as long as you are with someone else, preferably with at least one man, then there is nothing to really fear. The area is pretty well lit. I found the hotel to be reasonably priced and felt that all in all it 'did a job'. Would I stay here if I was with my wife? No. Would I stay here again if I was with friend? Yes. I would stress though that there are likely better, cheaper, safer options further into the French Quarter which probably renders this hotel unnecessary unless you can't get into the others.

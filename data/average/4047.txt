Just spent three nights at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston. I travel almost daily and usually spend approximately 100 nights each year (Platinum) at a Marriott property. One of the things I like best about Marriott is that it matters not if you are in Baltimore, Birmingham or Boston, there is usually consistency. I did not find the level of consistency I have come to expect at a Marriott. The Copley Marriott is very busy with a combination of vacationing families, convention attendees and business people. However, the location is excellent for shopping, sight seeing, or dinning out. The front desk and bell station seems to be poorly organized and checking into the hotel was difficult. While it was not busy, at check-in, it was understaffed leading to delays. Also, although my profile states a WSJ is the be delievered to my door, this did not happen, evern with reminders. Extra towels were not left in room as requested. At check-in I was told the club longue was closed, however it is open during the evening. Wirless InterNet is available only in lobby or 2nd floor. The staff was very helpful with information, but you have to ask for help. Parking is very expensive ($44.00 USD per day). Better to take a taxie or walk to locations. I would probably stay here again, but a few minor things needs to be improved. Boston harbor is really too far away and buildings block the view from hotel rooms for it to be appreciated. Better to ask for a high room on the river side.

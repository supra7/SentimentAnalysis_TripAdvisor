Took on one of their staycation promotions as a post examinations reward. Location: Good enough for me. A 10min walk to Outram Park MRT Station. Just bear in mind that it's upslope, and you might want to reconsider the walk if you're returning in mid-afternoon. Hotel: Nicely decorated. No complaints Room: One of the nicer ones, at this price. The only real problem I had was with the air conditioning system. It wasn't cool enough, even though we had adjusted the thermostat to 18deg c, and the mode to high. Food: Small portions. Apart from that, good effort in the presentation and taste. I liked the wine bar, with its 1-for-1 promotion throughout the night.

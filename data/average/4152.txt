The hotel was worth the price we paid for our one night stay since we bid for it using hotwire and paid around $135 + tax for the night. But i would certainly pay no more for this hotel than that simply based on the quality of service! It all began when we called the Park Plaza's main number to inquire about what type of room we had be awarded via Hotwire. The first person told us she was only able to help if we were looking to make a reservation but could not view our current reservation. When we asked to be connected to someone that could view this info, she attempted to forward us but them came back to the line saying that nobody was available to help us and that they'd have to call us back. Surprise surprise, we never received a call back. Upon arrival, check in went relatively smoothly but then asked to leave our bags with the bellman who gave us a just as unfriendly attitude as the woman on the phone earlier had. It was as though we were being a terrible inconvenience to both of these staff members by simply asking them to do their job!! The rooms are small and old and the bathrooms aren't much to speak of! The two perks of this hotel were that the bed was quite comfortable and we had a delicious meal at one of the hotel's restaurants (Pairings).

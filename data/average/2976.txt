The hotel is fine. The internet is not free. The breakfast was typical European and there is food nearby. In all honnesty if you are coming to Barcelona to be in the center of activity as a tourist, you will be disappointed because it is not. Everyone is very nice but we stayed for a night to see if we would return in the fall but with the cost of getting to and from the airport - close to 50 euros I am now rethinking putting that expense into a hotel that is closer to the sights of Barcelona. We spent 14 euros to get from the cruise port to the hotel and then 60 to the airport. If we had stayed closer to Ramblas then the cost would have dropped significantly. I would not plan on hauling luggage to the metro for that trip either - too complicated unless you are just bringing a backpack. I had no problems with the hotel but I did have problems with the location as a tourist- wish it had been close enough to walk to some sights because although there are no extras and the outside looks kind of scary when you first see it because of all the grafitti on the building- the staff were nice and the room was fine. I guess it depends on what you are looking for.

I just went to a company meeting at this hotel with about 400 colleagues. This is a Hilton Hotel property in downtown Chicago. This hotel clearly caterers to conferences and if you don't like tons of people milling around the lobby you'll hate it. I saw people sitting on the ground with computers and some even sleeping on lobby furniture. You cannot be a truly 5 star hotel and caterer to large conferences- the luxury feel (no matter how grand the lobby) is lost when 20 somethings are in jeans everywhere and sleeping in the lobby between conference sessions. The lobby is grand from the bygone era, so if you like W style hotels forget it. The staff were helpful and quick. The rooms are small and a little dated. Old big box TVs are still in the rooms, as opposed to flat screens. And yes, there are no coffee makers in the rooms. I just think that is ridiculous- I don't need a $14 pot of coffee from room service. Finally, I may not know my way around Chicago that well but I did not find the location very good. Right around the immediate block of the hotel it almost seemed seedy. You have a lot of other choices in Chicago at all price points- I'd look somewhere else.

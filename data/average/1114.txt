You really don't need anything more than this when staying in downtown Seattle. Hotel Max is close to everything and you can walk to all major spots downtown. Hotel Parking is expensive and will help boost what could have been a very good room rate. We didn't find the rooms or the bathroom to be too small after all we were not holding a ball in the bathroom! The room is just the right size if you are using it just to sleep. I don't recall front desk staff being particularly welcoming, helpful or concerned about us or our dog. Hotel Max is pet friendly for a fee.

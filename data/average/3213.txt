I stayed here while in town for a tradeshow at the McCormick place and while technically in walking distance, you should really get a cab. The rooms are big, but the hotel does need a make over in the not to distant future. There is really nothing close to this hotel, so unless you have a car, be prepared to take a cab. There is a restaurant and bar connected to the hotel and the food was OK in the bar. There is also a deli that is supposed to be open at 7:30 AM but that is a hit and miss. And with no other options close to the hotel, it is very frustrating. If you are in town for a tradeshow at the McCormick, save yourself some frustration and stay downtown.

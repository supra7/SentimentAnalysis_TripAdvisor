The best feature of the Marriott is it's central location close to high end shopping, Fenway Park, and other attractions. So much is within just a short walk and elevated covered walkways connect the hotel to nearby buildings. The rooms are small by Marriott standards, the bathrooms dated but accommodations are functional. Service is friendly, especially doorman, valet parking attendants. This is a large convention and meeting hotel so common areas can feel rather impersonal and busy. We found the casual restaurant acceptable. If you are accustomed to similar menus at many Marriotts, the offerings at this location differ slightly. For lodging a serviceable location, not a destination hotel.

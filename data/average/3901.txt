On the surface, the 'resort' looks very nice. When you get there, it's a little different. The nearest restaurants are at least a quarter of a mile away. There is a little deli in the hotel that serves very minimal fare. Housekeeping was mediocre, a dirty plate was left in my sink for 2 days without housekeeping picking it up. I was there for a class, and one of the managers was very kind to lend us a conference room for an evening to study, she was terrific. The front desk staff was also very kind.

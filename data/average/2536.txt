We stayed at this Travelodge on Sat 10th, as it was about the only place under 100, and my preferred option - PremInn - was in excess of 150. I'll probably pay the difference next time. Small room, uncomfortable mattress, awful pillows, very very basic - much as I suppose was expected really. On the plus side, all staff encountered were pleasant and helpful. It is ideally located if you need to be close to Euston, but considering the PremInn is literally across the road, then its a non-starter really. Sorry, just not my cup of tea

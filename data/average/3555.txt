We've stayed here before. The location is awkard to find at first, but once you know the ins and outs, it's easy to get on or off the freeway. It has a mini space for kitchen, which has a sink, mini fridge and a coffee maker. Tons of counter space for brushing teeth, the toilet/shower is tiny. Nice desk space, couch space to relax, and turnable TV. The only thing that I'm not happy with are the towels. They are worn and has a dark tint to it. Most hotels use bleach to whiten the towels and an added bonus as disinfectant. So, I hope that was a fluke. The check-in person was grumpy, so even though the lobby and food area is welcoming, I hate to go down to that area just to avoid her.

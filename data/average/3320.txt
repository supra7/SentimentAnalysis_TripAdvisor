Firstly I will deal with the good and then the bad. The rooms were comfortable, extremely comfortable beds with plenty of pillows. The whole Hotel was clean and modern, the staff were friendly and the Restaurant gave me tea bags and extra milk each evening (a plus for me). Everyone mentions the Restaurant is expensive ALL Hotels are expensive, but not ALL Hotels have superb food, this one did, the evening meals were exceptional, I did think the breakfast was overpriced BUT as there was a lot of choice if you were to have everything, then it was good value, not everyone is able to eat everything that is on offer and I think that is where the problem is, but I would admit that I have had far better breakfasts for a lot less money. THE BAD: I booked the Hotel before I knew it was in a bad area as far as safety is concerned, so I kept in the Hotel the whole time apart from using a taxi to get to and fro my Business during my stay. On the times I was in the Hotel I felt that I was a prisoner within the Hotel. I had been informed it was in a bad area and that is when I read some reviews, apparently on one review the couple had been warned about going out and to keep to main roads. The Hotel knew that I was a lady on my own yet not one person warned me not to go out on my own at night, neither did they tell me about keeping to main roads. Had I not known I would have ventured out to another venue for a meal for a change, this I was afraid to do. A young couple I met went out and got mugged just around the corner from the Hotel and no-body seemed interested in this, maybe because it happens so frequently, as this couple suggested, maybe they should be interested as this will seriously put people off visiting this Hotel. The lighting in the room could have been a lot better and the lighting in the Restaurant could have been brighter in some places, it was dim almost everywhere, the rooms are also noisy. I doubt if I will go back as would never feel safe.

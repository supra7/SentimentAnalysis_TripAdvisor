OK hotel, though one of the staff wasn't very friendly. He shouted to us when we asked to see our room first before paying. And he sulked all the time we stayed there, even after he had paid the room. The room was clean, though very small. The room had a small TV and a fridge, which was good since we preferred to have the breakfast in our room.The bathroom was a bit cold, but clean. We couldn't help waking up all the time at night, because the emergency vehicles drive by every 10 minutes. Also, the sounds from the narrow staircase woke us up every now and then. All in all, the hotel was OK, because it was cheap and near to the underground station.

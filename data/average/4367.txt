My husband and I stayed a The Copley Hotel for one night. The room was too small for two average-size adults to stay in for more than a day. The bathroom was so small we had to step into the bathtub to make enough room for the door to shut and there was no where to set toiletries. I have read other reviews comparing the room size and price to New York hotels, but let's face it, it's not New York. We have stayed in a number of hotels in the Copley Square area and found many other hotels for the same price or less, with larger rooms and significantly more amenities. Although the staff was very nice, the common areas nicely decorated and the rooms clean, we will not be returning given the other options in the area.

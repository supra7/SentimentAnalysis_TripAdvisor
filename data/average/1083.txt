I've stayed at the W Seattle a few times, and have found that its a matter of style over substance. Yes, its a very "cool" place: most of the staff look like secret service agents with the earpiece and wire; the Bliss soap and shampoo products are trendy, and the beds are wonderful. That said, there is a sense that the hotel has already fallen on hard times. Housekeeping is consistantly poor considering the hotels' class and price (mold/mildew in the shower in all three rooms Ive been in; debris and garbage from previous occupants not cleaned away; used towel still hanging on the bathroom door hook). They have recently removed the coffee makers from all the rooms. They said you can get a free cup in the lobby bar in the morning (which when I did was a thermos of lukewarm old coffee). Room service prices are absurd, and the high speed internet access is $15 a day. For business folks, the chair at the desk in the room is far too low (a pretty basic faux pas at a "business hotel") and you end up having to put several pillows underneath you to put you at a level where you can work comfortably. The W chain tries way too hard but fails to deliver on the basics. For the money, there are better choices, although I guess if seeing people like Bono and the New York Yankees in the hotel bar is a draw, this is a good place.

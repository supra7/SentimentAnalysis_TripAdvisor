Nicely located near the T...steps away from Tufts Hospital and china town. We had a hard time finding restaurants near the hotel. Reception area does not have wifi; not convenient for a business traveler in need of internet while waiting for room availability. Rooms were in need of an upgrade, old bathroom fixtures, old furniture- very run down and depressing. Luckily we were only there for one night.

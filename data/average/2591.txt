We have just spent 3 nights at the Travelodge Euston. I had booked a family room as originally there were three of us travelling although one person later dropped out. I was very apprehensive after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor but in fact it was fine. Upon arrival I asked for a quiet room at the back on a high floor and was told that all the family rooms are either in the front of the hotel or in the basement. We opted for the basement although, having seen comments about it here, I was rather nervous. Reception staff were pleasant and one woman in particular, who seemed to be in charge, was very anxious that we should be happy with the room and went to inspect it herself before we were given it. The room was a good size, looking out on to a little path which I think is private and part of the hotel property and an apartment building opposite. It had a bed and sofa bed (although my daughter said this was a little on the hard side), flat screen TV, coffee/tea, kettle, etc. and a decent bathroom. It was quiet, with only the occasional very distant siren or rumbling of a train disturbing the peace. As far as I can see, the main difference between this hotel room and a more upmarket one is the lack of mini bar, cable TV and telephone (none of which are particularly important to me) and the furnishings being more basic than in, say, a 4 star. Everything was clean and fresh, the room was cleaned every morning and fresh towels and coffee, etc. were provided. All staff members with whom we had any contact were friendly and polite. This is clearly a budget option - but a very pleasant one. Would I stay again? Yes, if I could get the Saver rate. For the full rate, which I think is around 90, then I would look for something a bit more luxurious.

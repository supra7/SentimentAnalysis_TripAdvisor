I have stayed at other DoubleTree Hotels in the eastern part of the US and have never had a bad stay. This hotel was a total disappointment. First thing . . .$16 a night to park!! Are you kidding me? Next was the lack of a microwave or refrigerator in the room. The worst hotel I've ever stayed in still had these amenities. The final straw was no free wireless internet in the rooms. Your choices were to either pay for access in your rooms or go to a "common area" where the wireless service was free. I was traveling on business so wireless internet service would have been a nice thing to have. The room I stayed in was certainly not what I expected when we walked into the lobby. It was old and so-so on the cleanliness. Access to the room was also poor. You either had to walk a mile through the hotel to get to your room or drive around to the back parking lot at which time you had to haul all your luggage up a large flight of stairs. Overall I was not impressed at all with my stay. I have had better stays at Best Western and Holiday Inn Express. I would not recommend this hotel.

This is a great, old Chicago hotel. BUT when I stayed there with my friends and family, we could not believe how bad the service was!!! We paid a lot of money to stay there, so we were very very disappointed with the service. No one answered the phone when we wanted to order room service, our room wasn't ready on time, and we waited in line forever at the check in and concierge. Also, the suites are really outdated and the normal rooms are actually nicer than the suites. After talking to a number of staff members, we finally found someone who was helpful and was able to take a good amount off our bill.

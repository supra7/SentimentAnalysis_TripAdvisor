I should start by saying that I prefer staying here rather than the Sheraton across the street or the Westin or Marriott at Copley. Not necessarily a significantly better property, but better value for your money. You can't beat the location in general. Although the other three hotels mentioned are all connected indoors to the Prudential Center and Copley Place, it is only a very quick stroll across the street to the Sheraton from the lobby of which you can access all of the above. Even on the coldest day, it's not a bad crossing. Convention Center T stop (which is actually on Mass Ave) is closer to this hotel than the others. Parking here is competitively priced, but offers self-parking which can save you a lot of time compared to the valet services of the other hotels. Just watch out as the lot is cramped and prone to scrapes - especially as you're exiting - if you're not careful. Not the hotel's fault - that of the architect. Staff are pleasant but no one stood out except for the host in the Gold/Diamond breakfast space who I think must have been living on Red Bull. Very friendly, helpful, pleasant, hospitable and accommodating, but a bit manic about it :). Front office staff were actually a little more on the ball than my last visits here. There is nothing exciting about the lobby in the least, except for the availability of Starbucks coffee. Rooms are smallish by American standards but well equipped and maintained. Rooms are spotless. Wifi, which was free for Gold/Diamond elites, was fast enough and did not drop a connection. Great views on the higher floors.

This is a business class hotel, not a family friendly one. It had a generally classy appearance. But you have to pay for anything extra, including WiFi! I think the staff is supposed to provide free WiFi to Priority Club Gold Members though (but he did not). My wife said that the room was not very clean. The beds were double beds, so my son's feet were on my back all night. There was no microwave. I had to get a key to use the snack fridge in the room, which only had enough room left for a little container amid all of the hotel snacks. The bathroom soaked up like a sauna room after a shower. There was no indoor pool. The breakfast menu looked like it may have cost about as much as a steak dinner, but I did not look that carefully. We drove down the road and got a donut. The location is in the city part of North Dallas and is somewhat convenient to a lot of things. This is a business class hotel. It is either for the very wealthy or for folks whose business is paying the bill!

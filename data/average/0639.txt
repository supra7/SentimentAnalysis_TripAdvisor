Fast check in. Love the wall of windows in the room. Very comfortable, large room convenient to attractions. Good, secure internet connection. The bed was ok, but not great. Street noise can be a little loud so you may need earplugs if you aren't used to it. Ralph's grocery was just two blocks away for room snacks. The happy hour at the hotel was very romantic in front of the fireplace (with the air conditioning on!). Keep in mind that there is $15 a day car parking fees. The free bus definitely is an experience to see lots of unusual people. We were warned about crime in the area and there were lots of pan handlers close by the hotel as well as lots more in the Pioneer Square area. We did the 3 hour Gray Line segway tour and loved it. Our guide, Marty, was so interesting and the segways were a trip highlight.

Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in February. Found very little to complain about. Greeting at reception was friendly and efficient and not over the top. Room was very clean and comfortable and found that everything worked as it should in the room. Only slight complaint was that it was a small bit noisy as the lift was near our bedroom. Room was kept very neat and tidy everyday that we were there. We didn't eat in the hotel or use the bar. We did use the Starbucks cafe that is in the lobby on occasions and service was good and friendly. The free use of Internet in the lobby was very useful. The hotel is well located being directly opposite from the Prudential Centre and very close to the "T" stop at Convention. Also is within walking distance of Boston Common, etc. There are a lot of good places for eating nearby to the hotel, we really enjoyed the lobster at Steve's Summer Shack just around the corner from the hotel. The hotel is nothing special, but very much caters for the needs of the ordinary holiday maker.

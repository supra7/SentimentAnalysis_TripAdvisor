The quality of service at the bar has decreased significantly in the past several months. Cleanliness no longer. Drinks, place settings, etc. sit at the bar for way too long after someone's left the bar. I had to ask that my place be cleaned 20 mins after I finished eating. Glasses full of coke, wine, or whatever the drink may have been are left on the back of the bar. No wonder there aren't any clean glasses!

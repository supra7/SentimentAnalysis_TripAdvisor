I preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Westin Hotels generally, and for the most part Westins provide reliably good hotel stays. This recent experience, however, was most disappointing. The Westin Seattle is an older property (by Westin standards) north of Seattle city center, although anywhere in downtown can be reached by a short walk. All of the facilities within the hotel are a bit older, especially the infrastructure parts such as the elevators (more on that in a second). I arrived slightly before 12pm and was informed that all of the rooms were still being cleaned, but I could have a wheelchair-acessible room. I readily agreed and went to the designated room on the third floor. I opened the room and looked out the window to discover, with great dismay, that the entire view outside was of a wall. I figured out that the hotel has a four-story tall wall holding the marquis, and because I was on the third floor, I was facing the other side of the wall. So much for the views of this wonderful city. I was glad I was only staying one night. The next morning, I went out for breakfast at about 8:30am. Apparently that was rush hour for the three elevators, as I (and other guests) waited for about ten minutes with no luck. The one elevator we saw was packed and could hold no more passengers. Frustrated, I took the marked stairway down, which led bizarrely to a dirty outside back area of the hotel, and I stumbled my way down to the first floor. The other reviewers are correct, this is a much older property not worthy of the Westin name. The staff was nice enough and the location was great. However, I'd still recommend that folks stay elsewhere.

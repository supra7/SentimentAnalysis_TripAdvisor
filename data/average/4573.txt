We recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency on a rainy weekend in Boston. The hotel is situated extremely close to the theatre district, and is convenient to lots of restaurants and shopping. The room was very large and the bed was fantastic. Our only complaint about the room was during the night there were very loud plumbing sounds from within the walls. The breakfast in the restaurant was extremely tasty (French toast was great), but the service was very spotty. The staff was very courteous, but there were not nearly enough of them. This was a theme with most of the hotel staff. We would consider staying at this hotel again, but will probably consider other hotels in the area next time.

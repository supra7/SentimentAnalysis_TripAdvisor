Found a great rate and enjoyed our stay due to the location, but was quite suprised at the work that was needed on this hotel. I have stayed at other Fairmont properties and this one isn't at the same level. Don't get me wrong it isn't a holiday inn, but if I hadn't found such a good rate at this hotel and had paid $350 a night I would have been extremely disappointed. The rooms were nicely appointed but the hallways were dank and smelled of mildew. The public areas are nice but some need work. The biggest advantage was its proximity to the festivities during the 4th of July. I will stay here again if I can find a decent rate.

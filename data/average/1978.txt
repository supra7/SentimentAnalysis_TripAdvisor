My extended family has been staying here for more than 30 years. We love the location and the facility, in general. Its perfect for families. However, when you check in, INSIST upon inspecting your accommodations thoroughly, first. Not all condos are equal! Some are plainly, deplorable. We had 4 condos between 4 families and three were exceptional (G106, J105 and D106). However, F103 was past it's prime and had lots of problems. We DID inspect it, however, we wish we'd been more thorough. We'll come back, but we will be very selective.

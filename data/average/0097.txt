This hotel delivers no service except for the excellent bell men who bring in your luggage when you check in and bring out your luggage when you check out. They redecorated our market-view suite in dark, somber brown tones. Ugh. The place is clearly coasting on its past laurels. Don't try asking for morning coffee to be brought up to your room. A grumpy person brings it up--in a paper cup.

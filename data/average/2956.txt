We enjoyed our stay at the Shoreham and don't feel as though it deserves the poor reviews it has been given. It is at an excellent location and has a very friendly staff. We were happily suprised to find that each room had a small fridge. The room temperature was so comfortable (even though it was hot outside) that for two of the nights we were there, we turned off the air conditioner and just used the ceiling fan.

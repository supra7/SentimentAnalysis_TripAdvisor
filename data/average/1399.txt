The location was great, right accross the street from the airport. I had an overnight layover so this was perfect for me. When I landed and called for the shuttle it came within 10 minutes with a very nice driver. However at check-in there were only 2 people. The phone was constantly ringing and although there was only one person in front of me it took a while to get greeted and checked in. It annoyed me that the front desk clerk took a call while checking me in. The room I received was 219 on the second floor. The room was clean however I didn't get a sleep number bed and the layout was such that my bed faced the window with a view of air vents or something. The first thing I did was close the drapes. The bathroom toiletries weren't that exciting either. I slept pretty good but I did hear elevator noise. I didn't complain about anything because I only paid $49 via priceline and they probably give this room out to people who pay the least. The shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes and was on time. The only option for breakfast was a buffet at the restaurant so I gave myself plenty of time to get food at the airport.

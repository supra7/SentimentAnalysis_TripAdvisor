We recently spent two nights at Hotel Curious after an 11 day cruise to the Canary Islands. The hotel is in a great location just steps from La Rambla and the metro. The room is a good size as many hotels in Europe tend to have smaller rooms. The front desk is very friendly and helpful with suggestions on good restaurants and local attractions. We found the continental breakfast served in the morning to be a bonus as well. On the negative side, the bed is a cot and a little on the hard side. Also, there is little storage space in the way of drawers or shelves to lay down clothing. The bathroom also has limited shleving for toileteries, etc. It is really a hotel for a very short stay. A word to the wise. I booked the hotel on their web-site and got a very good rate which was non-refundable. Unfortunately, the airline, Air Transat (that's another story) cancelled our flight. So, I had paid for 3 nights but was only able to stay for 2. I did not hear from the manager although the front desk staff told me that non-refundable means that, no exceptions. So, even though it was out of my hands, I was out of pocket for the one night accomodation. All in all, though for the price, it is an adequate hotel.

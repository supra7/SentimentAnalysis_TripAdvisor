I stayed here at this hotel for a business trip last August 2009. There were several incidents which happened during my stay that required customer service personal. On one of the incidents that required fixing an error in my room billing. The customer service rep was rude and very unprofessional during my conversation with her. I spoke to a supervisor who then recitified the situation. Overall this hotel is very nice looking but the customer service reps should get some professional training in dealing with customers, since this is the bread and butter of the business.

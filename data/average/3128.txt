Stayed there for a weekend end of Feb. 09. Have traveled to HK for 20 years. I would NOT recommend this hotel if this is your first trip to Hong Kong. The location is not great. Too far to walk to a star ferry pier, so you need a taxi each time. Plus, you dont feel the vibe of Hong Kong in this newly developed shopping mall in West Kowloon. They advertised a "fabulous room" with a harbour view on the net, but what I got was a PARTIAL HARBOUR VIEW. I felt cheated. The view was mostly ugly appartment blocks, and then, in between two of them, there was a glimpse of Victoria Harbour and the skyline of Central (and that only after upgrading to a different room category). Of course, it is a hip boutique hotel, and if you deeply care about the design of the hangar in your closet, this hotel is for you. Otherwise, try other hotels which are in the midth of things (like the Lankwaifang Hotel, not to be confused with the LKF Hotel) or which have a REAL harbour view, like the good old Intercontinental or the Conrad (upper floors).

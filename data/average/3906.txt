I booked this hotel through American Express and reserved a one bedroom suite with breakfast. After arguing for 3 days that I had breakfast included in my reservation, upon checking out I showed the front desk a copy of my itinerary, stating I was entitled to breakfast. However, they only refunded me one day's breakfast instead of 3 days. I was very disappointed that they did not do the right thing. The bar was only opened one night and I did not see their restaurant.

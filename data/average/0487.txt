Briefly, busy breakfast room, barely clean room - stained carpet, well used furniture, beds not changed when requested, kids jumping off beds in room above, very late, all 4 nights we stayed. But it was reasonbaly priced and you get what you pay for. It served its purpose, but I probably wouldn't stay there on vacation again.

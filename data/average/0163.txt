This hotel charges an arm and a leg for the room and then adds on $36 for parking, overall we paid $215 dollar to stay one night, and that was a major discounted rate. The hotel is very nice, clean, and queit, but did not have any free extras like a pool, breakfast or parking. Overall I would rate the hotel a 5 out of 10 becuase it was a nice room but expensive and didn't add on the extras for free.

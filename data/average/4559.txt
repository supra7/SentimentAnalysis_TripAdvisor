My husband and I stayed here for two nights. Check in was fast and pleasant. The room was clean and decorated nice. It was the bed I had issue with. A feather bed was on top of the pillow-top mattress. Could have been great, but there was not a mattress pad in sight and the feathers from the featherbed poked us through the night. Sanitation - The mattress didn't have a waterproof pad on it either. Seems unsanitary to me and it is often required by health codes. Room service was prompt and the food was warm, fresh, and tasted very good. The price was very good at $159 night from the Hyatt website. Location was perfect, within walking distance to theatres, many restaurants, and Chinatown.

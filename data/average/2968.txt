The rooms are updated and on the small side. Staff was friendly. No washing machines for self service laundry. Breakfast was briskly taken away despite patrons still present in the dinning room. Breakfasst was nothing to write home about. Upon arrival at night realized that the hotel is located in an ugly commercial sector of the city. Quite scary at night. The street level of the hotel is vacant commercial space that is boarded up with storm shutters and full o grafitti. Unacceptable sight. The least they could do is paint over the urban art.. Not a great first impression upon arrival with family. Nothing to sightsee at walking distance. No nightlife either anywhere near. Next time, Willo look for a better location in such a beautiful and vibrant city.

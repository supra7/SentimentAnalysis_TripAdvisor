Hotel looked fab as we pulled up, but although it was huge and immaculately clean, we were disappointed with the service we recieved. The valet service was the only exception to this they were very efficient and friendly. Inside there was no help with luggageno prob for us as we are able bodied but may be difficult for others), and staff were not particularly helpful, perhaps they were having a bad couple of days or were busy. Also there were lots of extra's eg wi fi, parking etc. given the cost of staying here surely some of this could be absorbed, after all you can get free wi fi in travel lodges. but on the whole lovely hotel, which was very close to the shops bars etc and the rooms were a good size with coffee and tea making facilities, I would say by all means go to this but if your expecting the Hilton to be a "cut above" you may be disappointed.

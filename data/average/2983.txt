We are 3 adults and 3 children ( 15,11,7 ) The hotel as whole is good clean hotel every thing around you (supermarket and food ).The breakfast is good enough not too much not too little. The whole staff were queit working hard and polite ( specially the brakfast old lady) . But the problem for me was the unfriendly two ladies front desk who make my check in .They do not nothing about how to speak or deal with customers.They want you only to go your room ang get out of their face as if they pay for your stay.They refuse to put us on two double rooms with sofa bed as we booked and they say that the double room with no sofa bed is good for us( because our children are small enogh to sleep only in one sofa bed!!!) In my booking I asked also for close or connected rooms .But angrily they say no because we have repair work in the hotel so they could not find rooms as our booking. Thank God I have a print of my booking so they agreed to give us the rooms at last after long time.

We stayed at Hyatt Maui for 5 nights in August, we stayed at the Regency Club level with oceanfront view it was wonderful to hear the ocean and watch the sunset from the room. Access to the lounge was great to get a quick drink, breakfast or snacks. Bathroom is uncomfortably small but was nice to have a walk in closet . It is a big resort, busy during checkin times, access to printing boarding pass was great.

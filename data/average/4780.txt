Fantastic entry-way/lounge, but unfortunately, that is the best part of the hotel. Checked in and was told I was being upgraded (and paid for it). Room was just as small as others, with a bonus of a mildew smell in the carpet. I could have changed rooms if I wanted to pay more.....? You read that right. Not what I would expect from a hilton.

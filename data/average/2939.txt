Stayed here two nights, the first was a late arrival around 1 AM, and stayed on for a second night as I was meeting my daughter who was arriving early at T1. So, spent the day in between using the Metro to see some of Madrid. The metro, Barajas, is only one stop from either T4 or T1/2/3 from the airport, about a 10 minute pleasant walk through a suburban Madrid neighborhood, but I only had one small bag. Those with lots of luggage might find it too far. Hotel itself was clean and quiet from street noise despite being a few meters away from a plaza, but you could hear other guests occasionally. A/C was cool and welcome, since there was a heat wave going on. All in all good value for one or two nights.

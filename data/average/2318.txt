The units are large but there is no privacy. We got stuck in until #7 which is right by the road and it was very noisy. You could not even open the windows. There was also no view at all. The staff did not care. Also, although there were 4 TVs, only one of the remotes worked. Again, the staff did not fix this. I will say that the units are brand new so that was nice but it is just not in a good location. Parking was also a struggle. The units are very comfortable but don't pay a lot or you will be disappointed.

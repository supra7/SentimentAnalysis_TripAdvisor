Stayed here in June 09 for 2 nights. Got taxi from the airport and the driver had problems finding this hotel. He had to get out of the cab and wander around various restaurants asking where the hotel was. I think he also called the taxi rank to ask but my Italian is not good and I think thats what he was trying to tell us. Taxis can't park out side the hotel so you have to walk a bit with your bags. Glad we didn't hire a car at this point as it would have been a nightmare with permits etc. Check in at hotel not terribly welcoming. That said the hotel has a great location and everywhere is easily accessible on foot. About 50 steps takes you to the Trevi fountain. Was concerned from reviews on trip advisor about pickpockets in this area but there was a very strong police presence. Walked up to the spanish steps one evening and there were some young people jamming away on a guitar and it was really atmospheric. Wear comfortable walking shoes and ladies don't forget to check out the 2 shoe shops near the Trevi fountain. I especially liked the one facing the fountain. Would I stay here again....maybe.... but I would look around first.

A pleasant hotel located near all the main tourist attractions, perfect is this is what you are after from a trip, though the area is made up of tourists and subsequently overpriced for average establishments. As with most cities the most interesting taste of local life, best eateries and hangouts are located a distance away from this area. We pre-paid our room for 3 nights though on arrival were told they had overbooked for the first night and we would have to stay at the hotel opposite. We were given a voucher for the spa to compensate for the inconvenience. On arrival the room was small but clean and the staff ok, overall the hotel was good for a fist taste of Istanbul but would find alternative accommodation the next time around.

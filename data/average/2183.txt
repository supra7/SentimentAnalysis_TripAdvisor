We just returned from a three night stay in a Studio suite booked through BookIt.com advertised as a "mystery suite" so we learned the hotel's name after booking. This is a very nice hotel, but not a resort as the resort fee would imply. The bathroom is amazing and makes the room. There were several housekeeping issues - the drawer with the safe didn't roll smoothly and the safe couldn't be used, the handle on the ice bucket came off, and there was a used coffee filter packet left in the coffeemaker. We notified the front desk and the issues were addressed; however, after cleaning the coffee pot a plastic bag full of creamers, coffee, etc was left sitting on the counter for the remainder of our stay. Our biggest problem was the quality of Internet service - it kept cutting in and out and wasn't at all dependable. The hotel is at one end of the strip and provides a shuttle to the nearby Wynn and to the Forum Shops at Ceasar's Palace. We didn't use the shuttle so can't comment on the timeliness. We found it very easy to get to the strip and back to the hotel on our own. Overall, very nice hotel for the price we paid ($99/ night) but certainly not a resort hotel if that is what you are looking for.

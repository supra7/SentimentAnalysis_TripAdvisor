The name and exterior entrance is evocative of a slightly more luxurious experience than whats in store for you. Although their user fees, like $0.75 per local phone call, seem to adhere to a luxury tier. Dont get me wrong, the place is clean and nice, has some vending machines on the mezzanine ($2 for a can of pop), and nice TVs in the room but the place was built in 1938 and it shows in some places. Sometimes charming like the tiling in the bathroom and the cast iron tub but other times downright irritating like the radiator that you cant turn off that constantly makes noise (it wasnt until I managed to force open the nearly-painted-shut window that I was finally able to get some sleep) or the bathtub not draining properly (I got a shower, my feet and ankles got a bath). The electrical outlet sparked at me more than once as I was plugging things in  not only a fire and safety hazard but dangerous for your electronics. The staff are fantastic, check in is a breeze. When you check out theres just a guy standing in the lobby  no uniform, no nametag but very polite, helpful, and nicely dressed (in a sweater, not a suit), but part of me cant help but wonder how hard it would be for some grifter to just stand there and con people out of luggage, fees, credit cards, or whatever. If youre going from the train station the walk from the station is a killer as it is uphill the entire way at a significant incline. The toiletries that are supplied are nice, organic, and effective. Overall Im not sure that this place is your best option in Seattle  if youre driving there are much better and cheaper options further out from the downtown core and if youre not you may want to consider staying at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle. In the end a hotel is a place to sleep and that radiator problem makes that problematic at best so while this property has some nice touches it unfortunately fails in a fundamental way. Exceptional service cant make up for a bad nights sleep.

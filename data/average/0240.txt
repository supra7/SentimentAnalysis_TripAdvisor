My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for our 1 yr anniversary. Overall, it was a good experience and I would probably go back there again. There were some things that could have been better. First, the positives: POSITIVES -Hotel is centrally located. You can walk to everything. -If you need to get a cab somewhere, the guys out front are the best. They are very friendly and will help with practically anything. -Clean rooms -one day we didn't even leave the room. Housekeeping called to check if we wanted our room cleaned and just asked that we let them know if we wanted towels or anything. -Good pressure and temp in the shower at any time of day. -Good WiFi. Just call down to the front desk for the password. NEGATIVES -the pillows were way too soft! my neck hurt by the end of the trip and we had too much stuff to travel with to bring my own pillow. this is just my opinion, though. -They got rid of the vending machines. You could either buy a $4 bottle of water in the room (not worth it), or hike it a few blocks to Ralph's market where you can buy the same water for half the price. -We went to eat at Oliver's lounge, attached to the hotel. The menu at the lounge was not the same as the one in the room and we ended up not being able to eat anything there. -no room service except for breakfast. -the bathroom is a little tight. the toliet is practially up against the wall. The negatives weren't a make or break thing for us and it's all just my personal preference. It's a nice hotel, I would just be prepared for these few things.

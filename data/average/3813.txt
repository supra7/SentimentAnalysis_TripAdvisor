We stayed at the Pirates Cove the first week of April 2012. Our room (514) was a little rough around the edges, but we made it work. Everything in the room was older, so it seemed "dirty." We just picked up some cleaner and wiped everything down ourselves and felt fine about the room after that. The room had tile, so this was nice. We didn't have to worry about nasty carpet. Everything worked in the kitchen area, so we were able to cook meals rather than eating out. The pots and pans were minimal, but okay. There were cups, plates and silverware, but we went a bought disposable because there was no dishwasher and we didn't want to spend all week washing dishes. The beds we definately needed to be upgraded, but were clean and after being exhausted from the beach all day were fine. Shower had good pressure, so no complaints there. The pool area was nice enough. The pool is not heated, but we were at the beach most of the time, so it didn't bother us. We loved have a private balcony. We wish the pool would have been lit, so we could have enjoyed the pool area after dark when the beach wasn't available. The A/C in our room also needed updating, but kept the room comfortable, but not cold like we normally would like it. You could tell this place use to be happening, but just needs some TLC now. It was also quiet... we were there over Spring Break and there was no craziness to speak of. If you are expecting 5 stars for $500 for 7 nights, come on, you're an idiot. We would stay again, I think we would just try to have them find us a room that is a little more updated.

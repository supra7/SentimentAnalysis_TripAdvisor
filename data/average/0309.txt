This "classic" property was likely once a happening spot located right in the center of Seattle. Alas, it's small European hotel-sized rooms are showing their age. Despite a few modern conveniences like rain shower heads and older model flat screen TVs the rooms feel tired and worn. The bathroom in my room, 804, was tiny with a sink the same size as an airplane bathroom and the toliet is so close to the wall it is almost unusable. We paid $200 which is a bit much given the age of the place and size of the room. On the positive side the girl at the front desk was happy and helpful as was the doorman.

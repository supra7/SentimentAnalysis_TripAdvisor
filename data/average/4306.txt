I had stayed at the Boston Park Plaza before, so I knew what I was getting. We arrived at the hotel and had a pretty quick check-in, only to arrive at our room to find someone waiting outisde it saying that it was their room, but they couldn't get in. I had worked in a hotel before, so I knew that this could easily happen and we went down to the front desk to explain the situation. The front desk clerk was very apologetic and immediately gave us coupons for the breakfast buffet the next day which was very nice! The standard rooms are small and the bathrooms have little counter space but as this is a 1920s hotel this is to be expected. No frig either. Room was very clean, though and bed was very comfortable. Our friends had a superior room which was just bigger, not really worth the extra money. The public areas are very nice. People complained about the elevators being slow, but again this is a large 1920s hotel, so it is to be expected. The location is great and I love the charm of old hotels! If you are like me, you'll like the Boston Park Plaza.

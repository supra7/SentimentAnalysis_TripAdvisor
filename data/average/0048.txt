Modern room, good large bed, nice view of the hi-rise city from 14th floor. Sliding glass doors to small balcony allowed fresh air in. Odd layout with 'bathroom' having only bath, shower and wc; no mirror or basin. The washbasin and mirrors are in the bedroom. It felt strange shaving, brushing teeth, etc., in the bedroom, and having no mirror in the bathroom. The double room had only one office-style chair, although there was room for more. WiFi was charged; only 2 free terminals in the "business centre" off the lobby. One was out of order. Good location with several excellent restaurants nearby.

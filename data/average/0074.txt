Can't beat the Warwick for cost in Seattle. We were forced to stay here after our power was out for over a week at home. Being a native I know Seattle. The location was great, 3 blocks up from Pike Place, just a 4 or 5 blocks over from the Space Needle. We got the winter special, and got a corner room with a direct view of the needle, and Lake Union to the right, on the 15th floor for $100/night. The hotel was renovated, but there is still plenty left from the original 1984 building. The windows are old, and a bit drafty, the street noise, as in all big cities, is constant. We turned up the heat and did just fine. They offer all the things an expensive hotel does, witha great view, for a great price. We would definately stay there again, I'm not going to pay 200/night + to stay anywhere else in Seattle, when the Warwick is available. The restaurant next door, Assiago, was not worth the money, despite reading a good review we were disappointed. There are many better places to eat nearby.

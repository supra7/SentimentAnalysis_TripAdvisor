The location was a bit rough, but very convenient--under 5 mins to downtown, and close to the highway for easy access. I wouldn't put a dead body in the pool, but the room was clean and the hotel felt safe. We would recommend skipping the shuttle to downtown unless you plan to drink, because parking was much more reasonable than the staff advertised ($1 per hour in the garage we were at). All in all, for the $40 per night we paid, we'd stay here again.

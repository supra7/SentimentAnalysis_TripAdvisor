I spent one night at the hotel on the 16th, I was not pleased with the initial contact with the property. I am not familar with the DFW airport, I had called earlier in the day before my flight to Dallas to confirm that the shuttle would pick me up; the woman said to call when you landed and they would be there in 20 minutes. When I got off the plane I called, I was asked what terminal I was at (D) and then told to go to door LLD49 or something like that, in the courtesy shuttle zone. Anyway the woman yelled this at me, acted like I was troubling her for the call and when I called again because I had been waiting almost an hour she snapped at me again when I asked her if I was in the right place. Anyway after the surly driver, also the shuttle is not operated by the hotel it is operated by a company called RC Express, the shuttle starts at 4.40 A.M. or something and goes every 40-50 minutes. The property has had a few upgrades, the beds are very very comfortable, that was a very nice surprise. There was a fridge and microwave, well stocked bathroom. The hotel is not near anything reasonable to walk to and I don't think their restaurant is operational, so if you are arriving late make sure you have eaten something becase your options will be limited to the vending machine. I can't say anything about the breakfast, it wasn't being served at the time I left. This place is just fine if you need a hot shower, cool air conditioning and a soft bed at a resonable price. The hotel is fairly quiet as well.

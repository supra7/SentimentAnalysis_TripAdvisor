We stood here for two nights and we choose this hotel bcoz the location and low prices. Room was quite okay but the floor was noisy I guess. We got a room which has a view of the George street where I guess lot of rooms which didn't had any view. The place was very convenient its walking distance from Central Station, China Town and near to Darling Harbour. However you need to checkout exactly at 10:30am...overall good place for the price.

This hotel was alright overall, but I've got a couple of complaints. For one, there didn't appear to be any valet parking when we pulled up. We had to park our car to the back of the building in the underground parking garage by ourselves, and then WALK all of our bags (between four of us, we had a TON!) all the way to the elevators and up...THEN, when we get to the 12th floor, we realized that our room number was not even on the sign, so we lugged ALL OF OUR bags ALL THE WAY back to the front desk, and the lady is just casually like "Oh, well that's because you're in the wrong elevator...you need to take that one over there." I mean, you think she could have told us that BEFORE we ventured all the way to the other side of the hotel with our bags?? It was very odd. Maybe all that was a fluke...but they just didn't seem all that concerned with being helpful in any way...and CERTAINLY not going above and beyond. Oh yeah, and the hotel parking spot clear at the other end of the hotel, ended up costing us $22 bucks for ONE night. Not a great deal if you ask me!

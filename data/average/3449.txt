I stayed here for one night just to check out the hotel. Was given a room on the highest floor (9th) facing the swimming pool. You can ask for a room facing the runway if you are into aviation and love watching planes taking off, landing and on the apron. The room is big and modern with frangipani-printed glass bathroom walls. There is a bath, a separate shower and toilet, a sink with a large mirror. I won't call it luxurious but it is definitely modern. The bathroom has a sliding door. The bed was so comfy and big and the dim lighting made me fall asleep. TV channels were rubbish and if you are thinking of watching live football matches in your comfy room, forget it. You have to go to the bar downstairs to watch live premier league games. Didn't try any restaurants in this hotel because they were all full of people eating noisily. This is a good airport hotel if you are in transit. While staying at this hotel, I decided to go to town (Marina Square area), so I tried the train. It took about half an hour at least from Changi to City Hall (you have to change train at Tanah Merah) and the train was packed. It was tiring and a waste of time travelling by train in this case. I would recommend taking the taxi all the way from Changi/outside Crowne Plaza Hotel.

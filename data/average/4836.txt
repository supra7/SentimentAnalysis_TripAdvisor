I have stayed at the Palmer House a few times. The hotel has character, the main lobby is very beautiful, but then it falls off. The rooms are on the small side and it appears that they are renovating the rooms in a phased approach. The upgrades are not the best and the bathroom feels very cramped. Besides that the hotel is in a great spot with in the loop and very convenient to all the sites. This hotel is a work horse and gets the job done.

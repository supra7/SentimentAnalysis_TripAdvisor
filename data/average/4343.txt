My boyfriend and I stayed in the Park Plaza in June for four nights. When you first walk in, the place is absolutely stunning. The check in staff were cold and mechanical. Our room was a queen, the bed was made nicely and the sheets were clean. The bathroom was tiny, but again, clean. Overall, the room was a good size, had a closet and room for two suitcases. The only problems with the room were: the airconditioning (worked occasionally-- and loudly), towels (super-hard and crusty), and the maids (walked in on us every morning at 8AM even with the "do not disturb" sign up! Had to chain the door to keep them out!). However, the location is worth it and there is no other hotel downtown in Boston that offers such a good price. And at $70 a night, what more can you expect. If you want perfection, pay $400 to stay at the Four Seasons across the road.

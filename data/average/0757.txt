I want to make it clear that I am not a picky guest at most hotels, but when I am told I'm getting a 4 star hotel, I hope to see something decent. Don't even think about booking this hotel through priceline if you don't plan to put any money into an upgrade. Here's the deal: They stick you in a room that has a view of the hotel dumpster or on the first floor next to the train tracks with the bell dinging all night. Was the unupgraded room a four star room? Ha, not even a 3 star at best. I'm a local, and one of the only reasons I booked this hotel is for the view. The door didn't even lock. I had to pull the door shut to ensure it locked. To get out of that dump hole, I asked how much an upgrade was and they quoted me $30. This hotel was next to empty during the time I stayed so they could have atleast comped it. Nope. I decided I'd prefer to pay $30 and not look at a dumpster since I already invested $100 into the hotel expecting SOME water view. This time I got a room on the 4th floor with a view of both the city and the water. The view was nice and the bathroom was nice. The room itself was small small small but since I booked a king bed room, I got a balcony. Another important thing to note, only rooms with a king bed have balconies. If you are after two doubles, your not getting a balcony. The views were wonderful of the water, but the hotel itself is not nearly a 4 star hotel. I hardly think it was a 3.5 star. The lobby is beautiful so enjoy it. I hope your stay is better than mine.

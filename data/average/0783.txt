My family of 4 stayed here for spring break, everything was clean and comfy however the building creeps and crackles during windy nights, we weren't warned before we booked and this was not listed on their website, we saw a managers note in our room, however didn't think it would be that bad... it was horrible.. all you can here is creaks and crackles often, in the note on your desk located in your room, they offer ear plugs! lol.. The advice that was given to me was stay on the lower floors! ummm maybe go back to The Sheraton, didn't have this issue!

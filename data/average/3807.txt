The hotel is situated on a very busy road right next to the Bow Church DLR. I was a bit scared that would mean a lot of street noise, but the basement room I had was pretty quiet. Had a perfect complementary WIFI connection all through my stay. My only concern with this hotel -and many others for that matter-is the fact that they really should try and cleanup the stains and cracks on the walls and carpet. It was perfectly clean otherwise, a standard basic small sized room. Public transport is conveniently close by, as is a small supermarket. The breakfast/lounge area is somewhat peculiar.The staff is very friendly so all in all this has been a good stay in a cheap no frills hotel.

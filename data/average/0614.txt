A small, unassuming place, located in the downtown area. Stores, upscale restaurants, coffiee shops, Pike Place Market and other attractions are within walking distance. There's a nice little restaurant on site and the food we had was good (the local constabulary frequent this place so the food and service must be decent). The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are basic and a little dated, but they're clean and the beds comfy. There's some traffic noise at night, altho it didn't keep us awake. We've stayed here more than once and have found the place totally acceptable. We walked everywhere and the buses run nearby. I would recommend it to those who are on a tight budget or who would like to park the car for the time they're in the city.

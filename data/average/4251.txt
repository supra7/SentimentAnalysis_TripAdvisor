I spent two nights at this hote - April 30 and May 1 while attending a conference there. I was upgraded to the Concierge floor, with promises of an enhanced stay. My room was shabby and badly in need of a refurbishment, and was unbearably hot, despite my setting the thermostat at 60! Finally, I opened the window and let in the 78degree weather outside to cool off the place. Coffee pot was broken and spilled coffee all over the table.The Concierge floor did not live up to it's name - the concierge was hardly ever in evidence, food provided was sparse - nothing at all at lunch and only basic continental breakfast and finger food in the evening - and cash bar. Unlike any concierge/club floor I've ever experienced. At least it was relatively quiet up there. The Bell staff/luggage staff lost my suitcase - they'd failed to put the ticket on it and had stacked it with someone else's, so when I came to collect it at check-out they couldn't find it and it took me ten minutes of hunting through everything in the store-room to finally locate it. Instead of an apology the staff were rude and tried to make out that it must have been my fault. How?? I had my ticket, they didn't. I left the hotel feeling sad that it had been let go so badly and very angry at the way I'd been treated.

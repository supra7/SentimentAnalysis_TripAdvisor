Location was perfect - could walk easily to Seattle Center & Monorail/bus lines. Breakfast was great for teens - all you can eat & a wide variety of food. Room was DIRTY. Dirty, wet washcloth hanging over the shower curtain, dust in the corners of the room & windowsill was dirty. Beds were clean. Room had wallpaper missing & had been patched (not well) with more wallpaper so it looked a bit odd. Baseboards were coming off the wall in parts of the room. Room 405. Had a hard time sleeping, noisy teens running through the hallways after midnight. Elevator by breakfast room looked like it was being repaired & needed paint, but another guest mentioned it had been like that the last time he came. First desk staff person was AWESOME. We arrived early & she gave a parking pass to keep the car there while we went sightseeing. When we came back to check in, the next gal was RUDE!

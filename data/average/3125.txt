I attended a team meeting which was held at the W. The hotel had recently opened and was really very impressive. My room, a Spectacular Room, looked great and had all the amenities needed to make for a comfortable stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful. I loved the plentiful Bliss toiletries. The view certainly wasn't the most impressive outlook available in Hong Kong but it was still lovely. Breakfasts were delicious and the variety on offer at the breakfast buffet was impressive. The meeting rooms and meeting room catering were also top notch. The only disappointing aspect of my stay was the lackluster service. I found the staff quite disinterested and aloof (at check-out they didn't ask whether I'd enjoyed my stay) and I just didn't feel anyone wanted to go out of their way to help. Perhaps this was teething problems as the hotel had newly opened but it did take a little bit of the shine off the overall experience.

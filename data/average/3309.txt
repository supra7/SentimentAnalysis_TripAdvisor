Receptionist let us check in 2 hours early, room was nice and big, air conitioner worked, windows opened even though we kept them closed. Beds were sooooo comfy, bathroom was lovely and very clean, could have done with a double bed rather than two singles, you get a kettle in the room and powered milk but had to buy our own carton of milk each morning as there's no fridge. You get the 14 tram into dam square or 21 bus. It takes about 15 mins but we didn't mind cos you save loads on hotel price. Apart from checking in and out we only went to reception once and the blonde receptionist wasnt friendly at all, never smiled and practically ignored us, but apart from that we had a nice stay.

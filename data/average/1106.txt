This is a sexy hotel somewhat similar to the Ace but less authentically cool. My room here was tiny with an even tinier bathroom (the smallest I have encountered off an airplane). Most people staying at the same time as us appeared to be in their twenties and thirties and the restaurant was enjoyable with a great deals at happy hour. The front desk called several times to tell us we were being too loud, something that rarely happens at hotels. The location is less desirable than some and most rooms overlook a boring parking lot. The 24hr room service is extremely limited and takes about an hour to arrive. At one point our shower stopped working and we called the front desk who responded about an hour later and made the necessary adjustments. They provide lots of attractively packaged in room items with hefty price tags. If you want something like, say, a razor, call down to the front desk and they should have free ones using the option available in room cost me nearly $20! However, the lobby is glossy, modern and really just too swanky.... it couldn't make a better first impression!

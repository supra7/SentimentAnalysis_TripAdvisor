I stayed in a Chairmans suite at this property for one night. The room was great, but the service was not on par with other JW properties. I arrived about 30 minutes after the published check-in time, waited in line for 15+ minutes, but the room was not ready. I was instructed to wait nearby and they would call my cell phone when it was ready (was told 15 minutes). After a 40 minute with no call I returned to desk and was given a key immediately so I guess the call was forgotten. The suite was very well furnished however the coffee table was wobbly and seemed cheap. While there was a full size fridge with ice maker in the kitchen, the icemaker did not work. Also, there was no glassware, or dishes or even a wine opener in the kitchen. The master bathroom was the highlight of this room. The biggest jetted tub I have seen in a hotel room ever (bath salts provided)! It also had a large glass shower that miraculously did not leak all over the floor. Room service was fast and of high quality. The breakfast at LA Market was decent but nothing special. Valet service was good but you must know to drop off at front door but pick up at subterranean level P2 which was only made known to me after waiting around the front for 5 minutes. Finally, upon checkout my bill was incorrect and it took 10-15 minutes of the clerk walking away to a back room to resolve the issue. All in all this is a nice new property in LA. Freeway access is decent and the design of the hotel is clean, modern and approachable. There are a variety of dining/entertainment options nearby. However, being such a large property there are shortages in terms of service but I would not hesitate to stay there again.

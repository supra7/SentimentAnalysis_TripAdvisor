The hotel is decent, and rates were fairly priced, but our overall impression was that the accomodations were average and the hotel wasn't quite as aethetically pleasing as we expected it would be. The exterior of the bulding looked very industrial. And while lounging at the pool, you can watch the cranes unload trailers at the shipyard. The interior was bright and modern. The staff at check in and the valets were friendly and very customer service oriented. Rooms were nice, would be better for a business trip than a night on the town, which is why we were there. Our view of the Coronado bridge was unpleasantly complimented by the docks. Upon arrival, we watched the banana boat unload. There is no mini-bar and no robes, but the bed was very comforable. With the exception of one spaced out server, the folks at Fox Sports Grill were a lot of fun and took great care of us. The staff at Odysea bar were just boring. I would recommend this place for a business traveler. For us, there are many sexier places to stay downtown.

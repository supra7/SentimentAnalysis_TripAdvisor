I stayed a couple of nights last week during my stay in Maui, and I couldn't help but be disappointed. The hotel in itself I suppose isn't that bad, but when compared to its website - which is what set our expectactions so highly - it was a large disappointment. We found the room to be generally decent, though the bathroom was tiny and aged. The building we stayed in was aged in general, which was surprising. I found the staff to be friendly at an acceptable level, but not exactly willing to go the extra distance to help you out. My friend and I found this to be the case on two or three occasions. One example was when we tried to book the hotel. I phoned and was given one rate, but on the website I was given a lower rate. I wanted to pay using my American Express card, but those are only taken by phone and not on the web. When I phoned to explain this, they would not do the booking for me over the phone and give me the web rate, which was rather frustrating. The website lists several awards and recognitions but I've got to say, I can't really see why. There are many hotels in the area which outshine this one (as I realized once I got there). I can only assume it might be because it's family friendly, but as I was travelling without children, this in no way was helpful to me.

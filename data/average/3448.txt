Being based in the airport, it's very handy. It's public decor is very dark and the passageways to the rooms very dimly lit. The room was very modern, clean and the shower simply divine after a week of damp squib efforts in other hotels. Arrived 45 minutes before the restaurant closed to find them virtually set up for breakfast. So just ordered one course of steak (quick to cook, being British I don't like to be awkward). Unfortunately it was so overcooked it had to be returned (something I've only done twice in my life). For the price charged it was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. I was also 'rushed' to pay the bill before I got my food as they were 'closing the till'. I won't be eating there again. Overall the hotel was standard airport material. Nothing exceptional and slightly pricey

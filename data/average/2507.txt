I stayed at this hotel to be close to the airport and regretted not paying the extra $90 to stay at the Marriott attached to the airport. The computers availabe to check-in for my flight were very difficult to read (terrible color contrast) and after spending 10 minutes navigating my way through these "un"-user friendly terminals, failed to produce a copy of my boarding pass as they must have been out of paper. I retired to my room only to find that it had been decorated straight out of "Warsaw Pact-era chic" of gray walls and industrial blue carpeting, with the entry area swathed in a version that appeared straight out of Wal-mart (except the blue color). The lighting was either bright or non-existent and my bed was made so that the top sheet didn't even enclose the mattress and I had to re-make it so my feet did not stick out the bottom. While being located adjacent to the airport, there are no signs indicating how to return and given potential traffic tie-ups in this very congested city, you do not want to leave anything to chance. Needless to say it took us over 20 minutes to get to the terminal - our bad, next time we'll ditch the car and take the shuttle (hopefully they won't get lost). Despite teh bad environment, the staff were both helpful and friendly and did their best to overcome the sub-par rooms and other amenities. Our check-in was friendly and accommodating and looked up our Starwood accounts without any prompting and the bartender was very outgoing and helpful. She also provided some helpful recommendations.

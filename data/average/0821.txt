I used to stay at the Westin 10 years ago for work so when the opportunity came up to visit Seattle personally I immediately recommended staying at the Westin. Well, the hotel is basically the same as it was 10 years ago and this is not a good thing. It needs rennovation to be up to Westin standards. The restaurant used to be a Roy's but now is something else but was never open for breakfast. That option was an overpriced cafe. I would choose somewhere else next time.

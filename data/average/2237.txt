So I decided to stay here memorial day weekend. When I get there the checkout took forever. They had plenty of people working up front but it was very slow and it didnt seem like they were trying to hurry things up. I get to my room finally and as I expected it is pretty nice. I am not the greatest reviewer so ill make it quick, The tv in my bathroom didnt work. The $15 a day charge is a joke. No other hotel charges this. I had to take a taxi everywhere I wanted to go and that adds up. Its better to stay at a hotel that is on the strip. It will come out to the same price and I believe you will get a nicer room (for example the wynn or venetian) I personally loved the bed. It is very soft so if you dont like that its not for you. My biggest problem with this hotel was the bathtub. I turned on the water and noticed these black spots on the tub. I look closer and its human hair. It was disgusting. I could not believe what I saw. The rest of the room seemed clean to me besides that. The staff was friendly and no complaints there There is no Casino, so again you have to take a taxi whenever you feel like playing. Its about $8 each way. The taxi line is horrible. You will be waiting a bit to get a taxi because not many show up and the trump employees are verrrrrry slow at moving them along. I ended up just walking into the street and picking one up that way. I didnt feel like waiitng 45 minutes for a taxi. The room service food is very average especially for what they charge. There is a $5 fee per meal and 18% gratuity is added. Would I stay here agian? NEVER! Ill be staying at the Wynn (I spent most my time there). Wynn is about $150 more for 2 nights VS the trump and I have never had any problems there.

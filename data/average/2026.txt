The best we could find for the money. Small room but big enough for 2 people. Quiet room with good air conditioning, curtains and bathroom facilities. No tea or coffee in rooms. 'Breakfast' the most appalling I have ever experienced - breakfast room cramped, smelly and noisy with no windows, a few scraps of bread, butter, peanut butter and jam, sad-looking blobs of scrambled egg in a tin, sachets of porridge for you to add hot water to, hot water seemingly hidden behind door so left people scrabbling to get to it. The bins were overflowing with plastic bowls and sachets from previous guests breakfasts. Most of the food had disappeared by the time we got there at 10am (probably for the best) so if you really do want to eat there, get there early! It's fine if you are only staying for one night as a stop over.

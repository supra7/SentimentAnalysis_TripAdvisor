This turned out to be quite a little gem of a hotel, minutes from Termini station, and not much farther to most of the major sites. We came here with a group getting ready to go on a cruise, and the front desk staff could not have been friendlier and more helpful to us - especially when it turned out a couple of us had lost our luggage. The staff not only repeatedly called for us to speak to the local baggage agents in Italian, they also called when we hadn't asked, just trying to get further updates for us each day when we had come back from touring (our bags eventually showed up on our third day, and the staff took them straight up to our room to keep them secure). The rooms were a little small - especially the singles, but the bathrooms were a good size, and ours even had whirlpool jets in the tub. Breakfast was fabulous - lattes, cappucinos, pastries, breads, meats, cereals, yoghurts, etc, and the gal running the breakfast room made sure we always had full coffee or orange juice. The front desk staff were also fabulous with passing on tourist information - we asked about tours, grocery stores, restaurants, train schedules, directions, etc., and with each request the guys went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed - including a bottle of wine when we'd run out after the wine stores had closed. There is free internet access computers in the lobby, or you could take a hotel laptop to your room if you preferred, at no charge. We even had 2 sodas from our 'mini-bar', and it cost just 4 Euros total for both - that was less than buying one at the carts on the street!! Our room overlooked the front entrance and the side of the Opera House, and we didn't have any trouble with noise - and actually enjoyed the afternoon music rehearsal we could hear on one day. The hotel was charming, centrally located, and the service was absolutely 5 star!!!

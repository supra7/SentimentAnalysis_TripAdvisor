We picked this hotel because it was close to the theatre disctrict. There was alot of construction going on in the streets so it was hard to find with the directions we had. It was very noisy from the construction going on as well. We were put off that the only refrigerator that was in the room was the minibar one and couldn't be used. We did order one up to the room and it was only $15. Although they ended up bringing up two so we had to send one back. The pub food was ok but they were out of almost everything when we went there around 10pm even though they serve food there until midnight. The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious although I felt the decor was a bit tacky and could use some updating. Nothing to really complain or rave about...it was just ok.

This is DEFINITELY not a four star hotel, as it was advertised on last minute.com. It is however, clean, and the staff are fantastic! It's an art deco hotel, which means that the rooms are tiny. It is a decent half hour walk from the Rocks and Circular Quay. Central Station is literally over the road and Paddy's Markets are not far away.

I stayed here with my sister and mom for a short vacation. The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are a bit small but from what I gather that is quite common in the downtown area. It was nice to be able to walk everywhere and there are some really good restraunts in the downtown area. The only problem I had was with the check in staff. Our flight arrived very early and we got to the hotel around 11am. We knew our rooms probably weren't going to be ready but we stopped by to drop our luggage off. When we arrived they took our phone number and said they'd call when the rooms were ready. We went out for the day and decided to check back at about 2:30 just to see if they were close to being done. There was a different girl at the counter, who very bluntly said that she had our number and she would call us when the rooms are ready. She seemed very put out that we would be checking on the rooms when clearly she was planning on calling us. So, we went down the street and had a coffee, waiting for the call. We were very tired at this point having gotten up before 6am to catch our flight and were purley killing time waiting for the call. At 3:30pm I finally walked back to the hotel and asked what time check in was. The girl then says 3:00pm at which point I then asked if our rooms were ready. She says yes. Later when we were finally getting checked in my mom asked why we never recieved a phone call, and the girl just says "oh well your rooms just got finished". Clearly check in is 3pm and she just never called us on time. We all had the distinct feeling that our rooms were ready much earlier but that they were trying to make a point, since every morning the cleaning staff was knocking at our door between 8:30 and 9:00am. Other than that we had a great trip and the hotel was nice, I just thought their customer service should have been better.

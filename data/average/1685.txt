The hotel is large with an air of sophistication. The check in was very quick and friendly, accomodating an early check in. Very nice. The rooms were clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable. The grounds are immaculately kept, with great outdoor balconies overlooking the harbour. The meeting room was large & comfortable. The service during the 3 day meetings was second to none. It is short walking distance to the gaslamp district, everything is right at your fingertips. Definately a good place to stay if you are on an expense account. Of course you are paying for the location. Everthing within the hotel is very expensive and actually, my feeling, slightly out of line for my taste. One would figure that if you shell out that much money for a room, they wouldn't charge $4.95 per bottle of water and $6.00/hr for internet. Even in the business centre, you had to pay for internet. Particularly when the location is right beside the convention centre and there are probably a significant amount of business people staying there. I found the food and drinks expensive as well. It's a short walk to the gaslamp for a break from the prices & a step up in the food. It turned me off, even being on an expense account.

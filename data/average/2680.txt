The hotel itself was great. Rooms were clean and the staff was nice except for the front desk clerk who double-charged me and my friend's credit cards. When we tried to get answers, he waved his hands in our face and dismissed us and told us to talk to someone else in the morning. But other than that, not a bad place to stay.

This hotel is in a great location but so overpriced, $450 for a double. I was traveling for work and paid the discount rate of $269 which was still way too much for this place. The rooms were old, nothing was updated. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant was about $18 per person and everything was swimming in butter. This was the crappiest Marriott I have ever stayed in. Your best bet is to stay across the river. It is about 2 miles from Copley Plaza. We moved there on our 3rd night and stayed at the Eliot Hotel. Beautiful hotel, I would receommend it.

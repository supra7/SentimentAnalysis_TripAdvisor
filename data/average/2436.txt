We stayed here Tuesday night for a slight early on Wednesday. We didn't get to the hotel until after 11 but check in was easy. I am a Marriott silver elite member and the woman who checked me in said they had a "game" and I could pick one of three envelopes. The one I picked had 10,000 Marriott bonus points which was great, though a week later I have yet to see them credited to my account. Hotel is definitley a little dated/shabby but seemed clean and the staff was friendly. The indoor pool looked decent. We got a fairly good rate $99 which is pretty good for an airport hotel in the summer time. You CAN leave your car in the hotel parking lot while you are traveling at no additional cost, though there is no security, we were gone 5 days and came back to our SUV just as we left it. We hit breakfast before we left for the airport, nothing special, cereal, thawed bagels, frozen Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and a waffle maker. Not as good as Residence Inn breakfasts. Airport shuttle was super easy to use, it leaves every half hour. Upon returning from our trip we called the Inn from the hotel courtesey kiosk and waited just 15 mintues until the very friendly shuttle driver picked us up, offered us some water and dropped us off right outside our car. Decent hotel, for the rate and convenience I would stay there again.

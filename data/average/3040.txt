We stayed here two nights before a cruise in November. Tiny rooms even by European standards but very clean. Extremely poor lighting in rooms and bathrooms even with good vision. Excellent location . Its close to everything. Front desk staff were close to rude. They just dont want to be bothered. Breakfast was good. If I stayed here again it would be for the location. Also I would bring a portable light. LCD lighting for shaving just doesnt cut it.

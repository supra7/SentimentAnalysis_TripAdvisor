Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Fairmont Copley Plaza!. We were pleased that our room was ready well in advance of normal check in time and the beds/pillows heavenly! Our room's view was awful but were offered an upgrade (at a higher cost) if we wanted. Hotel's location was amazing and we were minutes from shopping, restaurants and so much of the rich history that this beautiful city has to offer. Conceirge and front desk staff were great but we were very disappointed with the service in the Oak Room Restaurant on-site. We repeatedly had to flag our waiter down for service, fill our own wine glasses and he even brought me the wrong meal. Mistakes happen of course but then he started to argue with me even though the other 5 people at the table heard me order! Meal took way too long but the evening was luckily salvaged by having martini's overlooking the city at the Top of the Hub in the Prudential Tower. We would definitely return to this hotel but skip the restaurant for sure.

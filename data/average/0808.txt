We checked into this hotel after our Alaskan cruise. We were using SPG points which at Marriott means pretty royal treatment. No so here. The front desk staff person did give us free wi-fi since we were staying for only one night which was very helpful, but its hard for me to understand why they charge for it in your room but its free in the lobby....go figure. Our room was not ready when we arrived and although they gave us a key to use the business center (our laptop was in our luggage which had been checked by the bellman since our room wasn't ready)....the internet access in the business center was also not free. This is just plain tacky...especially for their loyal SPG members. At Marriott....if you are gold status you get complimentary breakfast....not so here. When I check with the SPG desk I was told that although they know that Marriott does do that, Weston does not. When we got to our room, which was very nice, clean, beautiful view and very satisfactory the bellman brought our luggage up but when I asked for an extra luggage rack, he told me that was not available and we would have to use the coffee table or the safe in the closet to put our second bag on. When we looked for the mini fridge to chill our water, there was a note that said if you used the mini fridge for your own stuff you would be charged $6.00 per day...unbelievable and finally there was a note saying if you would give up having your room cleaned they would give you a small credit...don't remember how much, but I just thought "This is a first class hotel" The bed was comfortable and the staff at the front desk were very friendly.

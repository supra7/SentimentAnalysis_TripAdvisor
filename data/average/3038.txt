We stayed at Augusta Lucilla for three nights, at the end of november, the place has a good location close to the train station, a few blocks from there, its very clean, theres people around anytime and small convinience stores and but the furniture is a kind of old, the mattress are old, very uncomfortable and very used, hot water is not available all the time, the buffett isn't good (poor), also tv guide channels. If you look better you can find a better place for the same money. Its a 3 stars, not a 4 stars quality. This is my personal opinion about it.

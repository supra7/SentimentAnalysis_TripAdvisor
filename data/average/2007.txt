We stayed in Hotel Windsor from 11 oct 08 to 14 oct 08. The hotel is a comfortable 3 star hotel which offers the basic conveniences. It is a no frills hotel, which means you have to lug your baggage up to your room. The breakfast buffet was was not too inviting with limited choice available. The rooms, though comfortable were a little smaller than our expectations. Another drawback is that it is located away from the city centre so you have to make that extra effort to reach certain places. On the positive side, the staff is very pleasant and helpful. A unique experience was that there were no mineral water bottles in the room and on asking we were told that in Singapore everyone drinks tap water. Overall a comfortable stay.

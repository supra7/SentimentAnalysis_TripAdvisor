A good location in regard to public transportation and a minimalistic design that does its best to confirm all prejudices concerning modern interior architecture: i.e. appearance first, function last. Small room (be careful not to tear down the TV with your shoulder when you pass between the beautiful sculptured wall and the bed; shower with no door or screen; wc with transparent, plastic, untight sliding shutters and a vent-fan that sounds like a small aeroplane; washbasin with a shelf the size of a hardcover book for all the toilet articles of 2 persons (your wife would love it, along with the single alogen spot light directly overhead that turns her face into a zombie's at make-up time). More: wardrobe with no shelves, the capacity of a standard gym locker (in a double rum); noisy aircond blowing directly on the bed (small room, remeber); window opening at the level of the neighbour's courtyard (dare to leave it open?) and only a few meters from its wall. Want more? OK: indifferent breakfast with industrial bread briquets (in a city gifted with marvelous bread); orange juice to be enjoyed in flimsy plastic airplane-style mugs and a queue to the Nescafe machine (in a 4 stars hotel). The imposing espresso bar machine is off, too much work. To this can be added that the hotel is placed wall-to-wall with a fire station, and on the fast route to one of Rome's largest Hospitals, which is likely to entertain you at all hours, day and night. Still, if ambitious modern design is your dream, this is a good place for you, as you can always relax on the very fine terrace and share the small jacuzzi bathtub on the roof with your fellow guests.

Seattle has lots of terrific 4-star Hotel choices. The Warwick just isn't one. The rooms all have balconies (11 inches of standing space for a late-night cigarette), nice sheets and marble baths. Those are the pros. The hotel is also conveniently located downtown. On the down side, the hotel is astonishingly dirty, worn and tired. I'm not a princess, but the abundant food/liquor/coffee/barf stains on the furniture and carpet throughout the common areas are overwhelming. The walls themselves are grimy, in the elevator, in the halls and to some degree in the rooms. The service staff exemplifies this same description: worn and tired. They are all nice enough, but they have little reason to be especially enthusiastic about the product their representing. For some reason it has been given a 4 star rating by SOME entity that clearly has never been there. It is completely sub-par at that level of expectation, but to its credit, if you're a tourist in Seattle, on a budget, looking for convenience and an 11 inch balcony, then bring your anti-bacterial wipes and stay at the Warwick.

The hotel is directly located across the street from the SEA-TAC Airport. Got a great deal for the room and loved the comfort of the beds. However, compared to the other hotels on the same strip, the parking costs are outrageous. North of $20 daily for self parking (but you get in/out privileges). It is a quite a generous walk from the self parking garage, though the long meeting room hallways, past the restaurant/bar, through the main lobby, past the front desk, and down another hall to the elevators. They really want to encourage the more expensive valet option (how much you ask? well beyond the self parking daily charge). When I asked if there was anything that could be done to help lower the self parking charges since the competition sitting next door only charged half the Hilton's price, they suggested the airport parking. I would strongly suggest seeking a different hotel in the local vicinity since the Hilton is one of the more expensive properties on the strip facing the airport. Parking costs are the one thing that didn't make the stay worth it for me.

At the airport we were lucky that the shuttle bus drove by just when we arrived, so we didnt had to wait at all. (That was shortly after we realized why we didnt like Seattle airport on our former visit, al that hassle going up, use a skywalk, going down, no good signs etc.) It was a short drive to the hotel. Check-in went smooth, but somewhat unfriendly. We also didnt get an upgrade for our Diamond HHonors membership, slightly disappointing. Our room was a standard King with an easy chair with ottoman, working desk with chair and a good quality King bed. Remarkable was that the closet where we thought would be a minibar was locked, so there was no refrigerator available. The coffee set produced great coffee. The bathroom was clean. There were two free bottles of water and some chocolates in our room. Our room had a view on the inner courtyard, a lovely green area and very quiet. When we were just in our room we could hear noise from other people (mostly children) in the hall, passing our room. We were worried, also because we were very tired after our flights from Europe, but we didnt hear anything later in the evening and had a good night sleep. The breakfast the next morning was outstanding, there were many items to choose from (even very good red salmon) and a cook to prepare the eggs and so on. We only found the waitresses not too friendly; one even picked our breakfast vouchers without saying anything and looking distressed because we wouldnt pay for it. There was no need, as we always leave a good tip on the table when we have a free breakfast with vouchers. When we left the doorman was very forthcoming, the friendliest person we met during our stay. We didnt have to wait long before the shuttle bus drove us to the car rentals at the airport. Although some things were not too optimal, we would have no hesitation to make a reservation in this hotel again the next time.

This was my first stay at the Palmer House and thought I was getting a great deal online but found I got only what I paid for. The lobby and common areas are very upscale and fancy. The room I was in however, not quite so posh. The room was very small, which wasn't an issue, though for the record, a full size bed is really not meant for two people. Unless those two people enjoy sleeping perfectly straight with their arms at their sides. The carpet and wallpaper looked pretty dingy. And even with some nice, new furniture, etc, the hotel rooms had more of an "old hotel" feel than an "historic hotel" feel. I also had to call room service twice for a wine key, and finally got one over 20 minutes later. In the morning, the wait for the elevator down took 15 minutes, so if you have a train to catch, make sure you leave some extra time to get out of the hotel! If I had paid full price for my stay, I would have been a bit unhappy. Luxury rates for not such luxurious rooms.

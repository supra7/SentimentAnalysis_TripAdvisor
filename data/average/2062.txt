The men at front are very nice and kind. Both Mr.Litu & Mr. Reza gave us a very very warm welcome & great service. The room is Beautiful but a little bit small. Anyway it's new & clean. Overall we're very happy, especially with the guys who we mention about. If we have next trip to visit Roma again, we'll choose this hotel. Thanks for your good service Mr.Litu & Mr. Reza. Hope to see both of you again. Please take care.

A great bargain for Downtown Seattle. It's old, but clean and a little noisy. The location is great. Staff is friendlly. We were able to leave our car in the parking lot for hours after we checked out, which was a real nice bonus. If you just need a place to sleep for the night at a bargain price, this is it. If you want more amenities, go elsewhere. We will stay there again.

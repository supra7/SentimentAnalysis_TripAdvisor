We live in the suburbs of Chicago and decided to take a "family vacation weekend" in the city. As with most weekends anywhere, especially in Chicago, it can be hit or miss on finding a nice, last minute hotel room to accommodate a family. Fortunately, Hampton Suites had a suite available. We were pleasantly surprised with the suite and amenities - full kitchen, spacious enough to accomodate a family of 4, indoor pool, free continental breakfast and extremely clean. The staff were top-notch and professional. If you are looking for a hotel centralized in the Near North area of the city, the location is as good as any. Unfortunately, the BIG drawback that everyone needs to take into consideration is the hotel's proximity to the fire station. The station is literally 50 steps from the lobby of the hotel. Our kids are two of the soundest sleepers this side of the moon. They were both awakened at various times throughout the night. It should be noted that this fire station is one of the most active in the entire city of Chicago, which doesn't lend itself to quiet, uninterrupted sleep. Our best recommendation is to ask for a hotel room on the southeast portion of the hotel as the fire station sits across the street from the northwest corner of the hotel.

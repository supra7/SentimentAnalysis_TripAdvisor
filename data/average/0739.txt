I stayed at the Edgewater on Monday May 31st (last day of Memorial Day weekend) for just one night with my spouse and two children ages 11 and 8. Like many of the reviewers I also obtained my reservation via Priceline, I paid $75 on Priceline + taxes of $18.65 for a total of $93.65 for one night. I agree that the valet parking is too much for one night and we left the car on the street for Monday (holiday) and fed the 2 hr meter at 8am Tuesday. Parking on the street was very easy for us and if that was unavailable there is a parking garage just across the street. We loved the location; we took walks along the waterfront and took a free bus to Safeco field and an $8.00 cab ride back to the hotel. The hotel also has four bicycles for use. The bikes are free to use and a bike lock is provided. The hotel is clean, and the views from the lobby and restaurant are fantastic. We did not have a view from our room and paid another $20?? for two beds. I would stay again but I would also prefer a hotel with a pool for my children. It overall seems like a 3 star hotel with a five star view.

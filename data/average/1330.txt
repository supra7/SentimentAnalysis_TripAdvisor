We chose the Quality Inn for it's proximity to the airport and the Park and Fly package. We were not disappointed with either of those aspects. It is only 5-10 minutes from the airport - depending on traffic and the package was a decent price. The car was safe and parking is just on the south side of the lobby so is quite visible. The airport shuttle was free - but make sure you sign up when you check in, as they use a van and it does have limited space. Pick up from the airport was easy - they come when you call from the courtesy phone. We found the front desk staff very helpful and friendly - even at 4:00 am! The staff at the breakfast were also very friendly. The main drawback to this hotel is its age. It is clearly an older building and in some places it really shows. The hallway carpets were not pretty. The a/c - athough it worked, it was quite loud. There are NO elevators at all. So if you have trouble with stairs make sure you ask for a room in the 200s - that is actually their main floor. When we arrived for our first night, we were on the second floor and could really hear the people walking in the room above us. On our return, we were on the 3rd floor, so that was not a problem. The room was large, although very dated (read harvest gold decorations). It was clean and it was nice to have the fridge and micro. I also liked that the sink was outside of the bathroom. There were enough towels for all 4 of us - but the bath towels are quite small and thin. The shower was not good - even with it on, half of the water was still coming out of the faucet so the stream was not strong. Toiletries were provided. The breakfast was good. Lots of variety and lots of seating. We would at least consider staying here again, but it would not be a sure thing.

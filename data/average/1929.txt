I was leary about choosing this hotel for my vacation after reading other reviews. I'm pleased to stay we did enjoy our stay at the KBH and would choose again. Great location, good amenities, large and clean room. Comfortable, conveniently located and I did enjoy the Hawaiian culture that this resort brings. I would definitely stay here again. A solid 3-star hotel.

Needs Soundproofing On my way back home, I took a bump and landed myself for an overnight stay at this hotel. Not bad for a Radisson and I did expect worse; however, the constant noise of airplanes landing was very annoying. This hotel needs to somehow figure out a way to soundproof the rooms because from the looks of it, it rests right underneath one of the landing patterns. Other than that, everything else was average.

Love the view. Love the location. Love the staff. But, I hate just about everything else about this hotel!! For one thing they charge $9.99 per day for wifi - PER DEVICE! The thing that irritates me most though is the "go green" get 5 bucks for not having the maid clean your room deal. How blatantly transparent can these corporate idiots be? They must think we customers are morons. First, anyone staying at the Seattle Westin has to have enough money that five bucks isnt going to put him/her in a pinch. Second, maids need to work too. Third, how is not having a hotel pay someone to cleanup your room a green issue? Its just plain old corporate greed people. My advice  give the Westin a pass until Starwood pulls their head out  if you know what I mean. Cheue

The hotel is well located, staff are nice , must plug my laptop to the network cable and be charged for 20 dollars per day !!! Otherwise the rooms are nice and clean. Check your breakfast bill , you must sign it ! One day they charged 8 dollars then the next morning for the same bkfst 15 dollars ... They tell you they have wifi in the lobby and restaurant , never can access it ! Elevators pretty slow or in maintenance...

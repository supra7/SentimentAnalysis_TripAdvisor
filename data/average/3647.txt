The property is located conveniently; Safe area; Rooms show their age; Pillows had nothing in them = neck pain Sheets gave us allergies. Bed was decent. Walls are paper thin. You can listen in on the next door conversation. The toilet flush was so weak.....it needed two flushes to get out a few sheets of toilet paper. So, you can imagine how many flushes were needed for one day!! The concierge lacks knowledge to provide recommendations for restaurants. He sent our group (of 8 people) to Chamberlain's fishmarket....when we clearly mentioned that 2 in our group were vegetarian. He swore that the restaurant had vegetarian dishes. Of course, the restaurant had nothing for the veggies and so the group split to two restaurants. No thanks to the concierge. This made for some very uncomfortable times during a big meeting. I would suggest that the concierge say "I dont know" if they dont know what they are talking about. Of course, our group was also to blame for listening to the concierge. Otherwise, nothing special about this property. Internet access is $10 per day. Which sucks....but this is common in full service properties.

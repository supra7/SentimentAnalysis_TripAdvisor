The Good As far as I could tell the construction work is now over and they have certainly made a great job of the reception and lobby area. Despite the constant throng of arrivals and departures the team out front do a great job marshalling the press of traffic, parking and retrieving cars, getting cabs and keeping everything moving smoothly. The location for enjoying Seattles shopping and dining is unsurpassed. Check in was friendly and efficient and the only mention of Priceline was, Your room has been pre-paid by Priceline. We really liked our room, it was a decent size for a city centre, the dcor was minimalist cool without sacrificing functionality and everywhere was clean. The bathroom was a good size, well fitted, supplied with nice toiletries and again clean. The Bad We were lucky, arriving in a comparative lull, and only waited while one person was checked in in front of us. Throughout our four night stay, every evening as we went out to dinner there was a snake of people wound to and fro round the lobby, wearily waiting in line to check in. Some of them looked as if they had been there for hours! Possibly connected to the above the extensive seating area of to one side of the lobby was always packed with people trying to sleep on the couches and armchairs with luggage strewn around them; it was reminiscent of a refugee clearing centre. You pay for the great team working out front. Valet parking is now an eye watering $35 per day. The Ugly We went into the bar one evening for a pre-dinner cocktail. Two mojitos and two vodka tonics plus a small tip came to an incredible $50.

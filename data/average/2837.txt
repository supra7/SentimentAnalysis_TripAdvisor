A five minute walk from the Central Station in Rome and you arrive at Via Moderna to find Suite Dreams is the first floor of a large building. Good 24 hr access. Quiet road even on New Years Eve! English/American speaking young lady gave us a brief welcome on the 29th, however she seldom raised her head whenever we returned. The rest of the desk staff we saw were very welcoming and helpful. Double Exec room was clean, modern, newly renovated, minimalistic. Bathroom small but good quality sanitaryware. No hairdryer but you can borrow. Extra pillows no problem. Only 2 individual sachets of shower gel per day! Needed to ask for more every day. Shower temperature variable especially in morning but manageable. Can be slippery, no handles. Bed was very hard but sheer exhaustion from sightseeing meant we slept well. Corridor had reception desk, computer for guests use, books and seats. The breakfast room had an amazing chandelier. Very clean room, nicely laid out. Good coffee machine & choice of teabags. Minimal breakfast, sufficient if poor choice e.g. cereal, cornflakes only; bread, only stale square white bread beside toaster. Over 3 mornings only, needed to ask for food and cutlery trays to be refilled and even for milk to be put out. However, although this may seem to be complaining, we felt that the only problem with Suite Dreams is that the staff are not trained properly.

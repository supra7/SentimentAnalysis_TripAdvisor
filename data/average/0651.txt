As a Seattle native, I was pleased to bid and win Sixth Avenue Inn on Priceline. The motel is just that, a motel, right in the middle of Downtown Seattle. I think I remember it from the Seattle World's Fair in 1962! It's a bit dated and our bathroom didn't have any shelf space, but IMO, you can overlook that type of thing because of the amazing safe location. You'll think you've returned to the 60's when you drive up (easy access to I-5, which is also very important), but the location is unbeatable --- and no long waits for elevators or walks through endless lobbies). Poof and you're out the door on your way to Pike Place Market, Belltown, Downtown, monorail. Pro football and baseball venues are a 15 min bus ride south. If exploring Downtown Seattle is your goal, and you want to PLAY with your dollars instead of paying for a high rise with a view, try this motel.

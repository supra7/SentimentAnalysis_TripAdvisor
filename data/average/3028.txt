Found on Tripadvisor 2 days before the business trip, Castle Hotel was ony 3 min from my customer, but it was a real surprise to find such a good hotel in such part of Rome. Very good and modern accomodation, with swimming pool. Very close to the GRA, but quiet at the same time. Only cons: wifi does not work in the rooms, and breakfast nothing more than standard

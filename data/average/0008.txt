Small cramped rooms, lackluster service, great location add up to 3 stars. There for a business meeting I found the restaurants unaccommodating. I guess they're hip, but the idea of sitting on an ottoman and eating off a low table just didn't appeal to me. Waiter didn't offer any other options as the restaurant was short staffed on a sunday night.

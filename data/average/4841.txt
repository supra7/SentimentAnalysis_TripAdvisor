We stayed at this hotel while attending a convention, sad to say the hallway we were staying in was undergoing a renovation so there were many loud sounds coming thru in the middle of the day and the smell was not great either.. The rooms were a little too small for our taste as well. The location was excellent close to everything you need to see in Chicago, I guess that was our trade off. We will probably stay at a different hotel during our next visit to the windy city. Do take the time to look at the lobby area...beautiful!

We stayed there as a family for almost week while visiting Dubai. I had initially chosen this hotel because of the Radisson Brand and the standards that I know from other Radisson Hotels. However I must admit that I was a bit disappointed, as the standards here are much lower than what I have been used to at other radisson, probably because it is a residence? Not sure... The 1bedroom apartment we had was quite spacious, no doubt about that, however there were obvious signs of wear and tear in the room, a testimony that some refurbishing is definitely needed. We were also quite surpised to see that the kitchen was not as well appointed as described on the homepage (e.g. there was no microwave oven and no dishwasher! -- at least in the 1 bedroom apartment as we were told when I mentioned that to the staff). On the positive side, the staff is VERY helpful and the location is excellent, close to the beach and Jumeirah walk and the Dubai Mall where there is a Waitrose supermarket. The hotel is situated on a busy street though which you can hear (but get used to quite fast. Also note that this is due to the fact that the door to the balcony are not soundproofed, meaning that you are more likely to be bother by the noise if you take a sudio rather than a 1 bedroom apartment where the windows in the bedroom are much better isolated). I wouldnt rule out coming back to this hotel, but it will not be my first choice. Peobably another residence in the same area.

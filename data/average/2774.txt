If you want to explore Hollywood then finding a decent hotel at good value can be tricky. This one ticks those two boxes well enough, as you are a few minutes walk - across busy roads - from Hollywood Blvd. It does should "budget" in some areas though (specifically breakfast) so don't expect the sort of luxury you'd get at the nearby W or Rooseveldt, but provided you are aware of this you shouldn't be in for any surprises. The staff were excellent and very helpful and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Not much else you can ask for provided you are not chasing a five-star stay.

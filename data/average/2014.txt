The hotel is only 5 minutes from Lavender MRT station which is pretty convenient and can be easily located. There is a 7-11 convenience store right beside the hotel. Another hotel branch (Fragrance Hotel Lavender) is just located 2 blocks away. Rooms were okay except that there was no shower curtain in the toilet. So be prepared to get almost the whole toilet wet when you are showering. However, we found that the staff's customer service quality can be further improved. We generally found that the staff are not courteous enough and are times quite rude. I believe the guests would feel more comfortable when the staff smile more and not always with long sour face. Breakfast selection was minimal. The staff appeared slow and couldn't handle few tables in a time. I was thinking there were not so many people (about 12) during that day, preparation of breakfast was rather simple (american breakfast or hong kong instant noodle), and yet they couldn't manage their guests. We were told to wait since we were not rushing to the airport.

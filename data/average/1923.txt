We were disappointed in our stay at the KBH. It was not awful, but would not go back again. The room was clean, but small things like no exhaust fan in the bathroom or only one mirror in the room were inconvenient. The common areas and the elevators were bland and shabby. The staff was inconsistent- some very helpful, others not. We ate dinner on our first night at the restaurant and it was horrible. Location was very good and access to the beach was great. The Sheraton next door was not that much more expensive and much, much nicer.

Location is good. Easy access to Tuscolana train station, to travel to airport, or Metro Re di Roma, to travel to main train station. Staff very friendly and helpful. But...the room is a little small. It's decent and clean but I personally wouldn't rate the room for 4 star. It would be something between 3 and 4. Breakfast choices were poor. I guess this place is okay but I would try search some more next time I'm back to Rome.

The hotel has a very nice design and look to it. My husband and I went for a conference at the hotel. Our room didn't have as many cable channels so being alone in the room at night while he was at a meeting, I didn't enjoy the choices. Also the bed was horrible. We had a king sized bed and both of us slept horribly. Our over 20 year old mattress at home was nicer! The workout room on the top floor was really nice with good equipment. I ate at their restaurant for breakfast which was good and not too expensive. They didn't have a shuttle bus to or from the airport, but luckily for us we had a friend drive us.

Had better experience on prior stays. Rooms in need of updating. Expected a nicer room for the price($199) at almost double the cost of the majority of airport hotels in the area. Was given a ground floor room adjacent to the parking lot even though there were numerous other options available. Noise from the parking lot was an issue throughout the night. Service has always been very good. The pool is very nice, especially for families. Overall was disappointed for the money spent and will try different hotels in the area on next visit. The staff was attentive to issues but in this price range I expect it to be right the first time.

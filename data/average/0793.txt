Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Westin. Accolades to the friendly and helpful staff but disappointed in the small bathroom and the condition of the room which needs much refurbishing (carpets, furniture, beds and linens) Management said they will work on this in 2012. The view from the large windows from the 27th floor were breathtaking and the location is very convenient. I would recommend this to families and groups.

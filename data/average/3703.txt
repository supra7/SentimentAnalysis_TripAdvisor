This is an historic landmark in downtown Dallas, but if you choose to stay here, be sure to allow yourself an average of 20 mins to retreive you car from the valet. On Sunday, your wait maybe between 45 & 60 mins. The wifi is free and very good, but if you need to use "their" PC's and printer, take your credit card so you can pay the insane charges for them. I felt like I was in a foreign country. I stay all over the US and I have not seen these kind of charges in years.

Terrible beds, I was reading some other comments and is a nice, clean small hotel, very friendly staff, however the beds, I did stay for a month and my back, neck was killing me every morning, very hard to sleep, you can feel the springs coming up from the bed when your in bed or just touching with your hand. Internet another problem, the WIFI, sucks, hard if you bring your laptop with you. Thats the only thing that I felt was not right for the price, pay $600.00 pesos for a hard bed it is not a great deal, otherwise if I see the rest is the only thing that helps the hotel, the manager, sometimes I felt that was to friendly at the times, to much drinking with clients, that I felt was right; but the rest of the staff was nice and friendly always with respect.

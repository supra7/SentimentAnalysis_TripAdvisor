Stayed at the El Dorado from 2/2-7 with my daughter and myself. We stayed in a garden studio (J111). We found the grounds very nice and hotel staff most accommodating. The unit we were assigned needs some updating and maintenance, ie peeling wall paper, worn cabinets, etc. Stayed in Wailea last year in a condo complex (which was far better than this condo) for similar cost per night (but quite a bit more this year) so opted to try the El Dorado. It is okay for a okay price. Maybe other units are maintained better.

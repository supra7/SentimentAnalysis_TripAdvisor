We stayed for 5 nights in November. The Hyatt was fine for the discounted price we paid on Hotwire. However the hotel does not have its own car park and the parking fee of $26.00 per day (or$36.00 per day for valet parking) adds a substantial extra to the cost. The pool/gym area was very nice. Overall everything was fine at this hotel, nothing was outstanding.

Just completed a 3 day stay at the Dana Hotel and Spa. Got a great rate on a cozy king on quikbook.com. It has some great amenities, but the hotel has some major annoyances that keep me from rating it higher. Here is my pros and cons list: Pro: Great location, central to almost everything and close to the L. Bathrobes and slippers in the rooms. Very clean and very good housekeeping services, including turndown service. Very comfortable bed and nice linens and pillows.. Good TV. Reasonably price mini bar. Rainfall shower. Modern decor Con: Glass shower wall looking into main area is a cool concept but doesn't work so well in practice when your partner uses the bathroom in the middle of the night and the light from the bathroom illuminates the entire room! Testy AC: Called about the room being hot and they sent someone up right away. He explained that the green AC system senses when we are not there and shuts itself off. It did cool down after a while, but caused us to get up in the middle of the night to do jumping jacks to get the system working again. Absent Concierge: Did not once see the concierge at his desk the entire time we were there. Shared Closet, bathroom sliding door: Can't go into the bathroom if your partner is getting stuff out of the closet. No dresser - Closet is the only place to store clothes. TV located on the side of the bed taking up a lot of room on the desk and resulting in a sore neck. - Why don't they mount it on the wall across from the bed?

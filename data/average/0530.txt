In need of a hotel room when most were booked in the city because a Manchester United vs. Seattle Sounders game was happening in town, I booked directly through the phone to get a King size room for $220. Pros: the room was very large and included a pullout couch (although I was told on the phone that none of the rooms had sleeper sofas), the view was incredible of the city, the location was perfect, and the front desk personnel were nice. Cons: the room was old and the bathroom was subpar, the hot tub by the pool was not hot, the room was humid, after waiting 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to help us check our bags, and the bedding was musty. Conclusion: I have since heard that there is another tower in the Sheraton that has nice, renovated rooms. If that is the case, I would ask which tower you would be in before booking. Additionally, in my humble opinion, this is a 3 star hotel at best and not worthy of 4 stars or the amount I paid.

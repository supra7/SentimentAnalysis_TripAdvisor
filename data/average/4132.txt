As a 20 year anniversary get-away, we booked a night at the Long Wharf and made the reservation a month ago. We told the reservation clerk it was our anniversary and we wanted a king room with a nice view (and were willing to pay more for the upgraded room). Upon check-in (around 8 pm), we were told they didn't have any more king rooms - or rooms with a view. The desk clerk was apologetic - and they did upgrade us to a "larger" room - however, it was a very ordinary handicap-accessible room with two full size beds (not even queens!). They also comp'd us the breakfast buffet in the morning. I know they don't guarantee rooms requested - but you would think they would attempt to honor a special occasion. The buffet was good (price would have been $35 for two) - and you can't beat the location. Parking at the garage next door cost us $70 for 26 hours of parking. An excellent weekend in Boston none-the-less! I would recommend the Long Wharf based on the location and a clean bed for the night. But don't set expectations too high.

I booked 4 rooms for a group of friends. I had requested that all the rooms be close together and have king beds and was told that there shouldn't be an issue. When we arrived the front desk had difficulty finding the reservation and said that they had not held the rooms as promised. First they tried to tell me I had clearly made a mistake and I was at fault until I reproduced the email from the manager indicating my request would be honored. At that time they simply said well it's impossible now so here are your double bed rooms. Other than the front desk staff being very rude I would have to say the hotel is nice. The rooms are clean and spacious, but the double beds are very small. The location is great for site seeing. Easy to get to the Airport bus and the subway stations.

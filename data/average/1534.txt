First, let me start of by saying that we stayed at Secrets Capri last year and selected Maroma this year to try something new and becuase it had the Secrets label with it - we felt that this would be a wise choice. Our trip was booked with Apple Vacations through our Agent. (5 days, 4 nights) We booked separate Private transfers (USA Transfers) via the intenet and they met us promply at the airport and we were on our way within 10 minutes of departing the terminal building - and yes the road into the resort is as bumpy and as bad as everyone has indicated - We arrived and was greeted by one of the doorman at the hotel and were told that all the check-in desks were busy and he directed us over to an area by the lobby bar and were told to wait there that someone would come over to get us checked in when there was a clerk available - this is where we fell into the "Black Hole" of Maroma Check-in. No cool towels or champagne offered. We sat for a while and even struck up a conversation with the cocktail waitress that was supposed to be serving the champagne - problem was - there was no champage glasses on her tray - so I took it upon myself to get my our own drinks at the bar - after waiting for approximately 20 minutes and seeing other people that arrived after me being taken care of , I positioned myself right at the check-in tables and waitied until I saw an opening - after about another 10 minutes - I sat down and this is where another issue surfaced - seems like the hotel and Apple Vacations somehow got our arrival date wrong and Maroma had me arriving 5 days prior to the day I arrived - that took about 1/2 hour to shake out - now I would assume that when someone who has a room reservation does not show say within 2 days after they are suppposed to have arrived - shouldn't someone have called Apple to ask - "Where are they"? - didn't happen - so we now were sitting at the desk playing Lets make a Deal for a room - back and forth - offered an upgrade to Preferred but told you can have the Preferred Building but none of the perks that come with the Preferred status - "What's the point"? We do belong to the Preferred Resorts Club that was supposed to allow me certain upgrades upon check-in but was told "Only if you booked through Preferred Properties" - long story short - we ended up with our original booked Swim Out room in Bldg 23 - No Anniversary Banner on the door - that's understandable becuase we were supposed to have arrived and already left. Room was OK - clean but with some issues - the Ipod clock radio did not work - Refridgeator was warm - we brought these issues to the attention of the Bldg concierge - he told us there was no way he could replace the clock radio/ipod - we brought our own set of speakers for the ipod and within a day was able to get some extra hangers and two extra pillows - after he was handed our registration paperwork did he then know it was our Anniversary and the banner was put on the door - no other extras just the banner - I did notice througout the week that new arrivals were getting the banner/fruit bowl/flower arrangement and champagne - One small issue was the TV - didn't have any problerms with it - didn't report it as broke but came back from the pool to get some batteries and my door was open and a hotel employee (Repair person) was standing in front of the TV with the remote - he looked at me and said - I'm here fixing the TV - I told him - I have no problem with the TV - he left within a few minutes - after he departed I checked the safe and the room to see if anything had been messed with - no issues other than the TV was now only providing about 11 channels where before it was fixed I think I got about 40 - so whatever he did - he screwed something up - I really didn't care becuase I only watched it in the morning to get the Florida local news and that channel was still there. Swim out pool is a great idea if your like really COLD water - I did not even go in it - my wife did as did the people in the room next to us who both stated- "this is the coldest pool I have ever been in" - I think it's over rated but that's my opinion - One suggestion I would pass on - if you do book a swim out choose the side of the resort that gets mosly sun during the day and that is the side that butts up against the Catolinia property - if you were facing the beach from the main building that would be the left side of the resort - the right side gets some sun in the morning but by noon - no sun - only shade Mosquitio's - yes they are there - they bite - suggest brining your own spray/lotion - the strong stuff - one night could not sit out on the patio because they were everywhere - Pools are nice - again the infinity pool is not heated - and it's cold and I do agree with one of the previous trip reports that it is difficult to pull yourself out of the pool if you are over 40 and lacking with upper body strength - you have to find the in/out steps at each end - there is no in/out on the side areas of any pool - I did see people float in on one of the pool mats and literally roll off to get back to their lounge chair - Pool areas are clean, neat - people need to pick up after themselves - the pool staff and pleasant and friendly - Bars/Drinks - Excellent - beer/drinks/water all readily available our favorite place was the Lobby Bar - good people watching Restaurants - Tried the Japanese/Italian and one night the World Cafe Buffet (Halloween Night) - all good - no complaints World Cafe for breakfast has anything you could possibly want for breakfast - we did Room Service for some sweet rolls/coffee in the early morning and all was OK - no issues - Beach - the best - water was clean - liked walking down past the other resorts to the left of the resort - never did venture over to the right side - heard about some dogs and there didn't seem to be anything out that way Overall - other than the check-in issue and some minor issues with the room - I would grade this resort right now as Average/ Above Average - I did notice that on the day were checking out while waiting at the lobby bar for our ride ,3 couples arrived and were directed over to the lobby bar area to "wait" - within 10 minutes a clerk from the Check-in actually came over to them with their paperwork and checked them in right there - So, maybe someone at Maroma is starting to listen and read the complaints about the check-in issues???? All in all we do prefer Capri, but if Maroma fixes some of their "new resort" issues - it can only get better. Next years trip could be either back to Capri, possibly the Valentin Maya or LeBlanc in Cancun

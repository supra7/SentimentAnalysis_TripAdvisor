The location of this place is one of the best things about it, Three blocks to Mag Mile, walking distance to restaurants and if you want something for in your room Whole Foods is around the corner. The room itself has fairly basic decor but with full length windows and a glass floor to ceiling shower. The ceiling does have this unfinished look that makes you wonder if its a decorating choice or if they ran out of sheet rock and plaster. Be aware though since it is downtown the rooms can be kind of noisy at night and the window treatments do not block the noise. The beds are made of that memory foam stuff which personally I hate but it was Ok for a 1 nite stay. Don't understand the comments about the staff they seemed very helpful when I came in and when I saw them assisting others. Remember your not buying the place its a short term rental for business or pleasure ... the key is it is a good location and reasonably priced! Valet your car at about $38 which is average for downtown Chicago.

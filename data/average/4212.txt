I've stayed here a number of times on business, and every time I remember why I prefer other hotels in the area (our corporate rate is better at the Park Plaza--that's the only reason I keep coming back). I can't remember a recent stay at any other hotel in this price range where the bathroom amenities included shampoo but no conditioner. And I'm really irked by hotels that still charge for wireless. $12.95 a day--really? So if you're looking for a really special experience, or even a hotel that doesn't make you say "They don't even give you *that*?"--then look elsewhere. (On my last stay, someone had set the in-room clock alarm to go off at 2:30 and 6:30 a.m., which of course I didn't notice until it interrupted my sleep twice. I don't blame the hotel for this, but jeez, people, have a heart!)

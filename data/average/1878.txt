Hotel is older and doesn't offer amenities like Marriott or Sheraton, but grounds kept tidy and room seemed updated. Most hotels along Kaanapali have little or no beach. There's plenty of beach and close walk down beach to black rocks for great snorkeling. We got a garden view room which was really a view of the condos next door and construction items from next door. However we were on an upper floor so if we sat on the balcony, we did get a partial ocean view.

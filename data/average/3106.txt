I stayed here for one night enroute from macau back home. The hotel is 5 mins by taxi from the kowloon ferry terminal. It is also nicely connected via express train to the airport. The hotel check in lobby is a bit small and can get a bit crowded. The rooms are nice and fancy like what a W is. I got upgraded to a corner room with partial ocean views. The views that are not ocean actually look into other peoples apartments across a square. The gym is very nice, with a sorts of equipment and even a punching bag. The rooftop pool has great view and the food decent. Breakfast was goos, with excellent variety. The resturant does try to be creative with food choices. However, the hotel is currently under renovations and if you intend to stay in the room during the day you might find the noise irritating.

This hotel is close to Universal's bunch of themeparks. Disney is about 20-25 minutes drive by car, but easy to find. Hotelroom entrace is somewhat funky; you share an entrance door with your neighbours. In the small hall, there is a second entrance to your own room. One night, our neighbours locked the first door by accident from the inside. Since we came in pretty late, they had to be woken up by staff by telephone. They should be able to remove the fixed lock on this first door to avoid these kind of mistakes; given the reaction of the staff when I approach reception, this lockout happens quite frequently. The hotel charges a resort fee, and you can upgrade to full maid service. Be sure to know if you need this; their information is a bit flaky on what to expect within the normal resort fee; towels are changed, although they don't state it like that. Read between the lines or ask clarification before deciding which level of service you need. The internet connection in the room is wired; wireless is available in the lobby and around the pool, it is free and I never experienced a problem with it. I didn't ease breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. The gym is tiny, but features all necesarry equipment and I usually was alone in the gym. The bed is comfortable although a bit short. I am not a tall person but most days I woke up with my feet dangling out of the end of the bed. For the price of the hotel, it is an OK stay. There is better, and there is worst in this area filled with hotels.

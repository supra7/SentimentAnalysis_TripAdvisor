We were there for a family wedding at the hotel. They canceled all the reservations under one name when one couple with that last name canceled. So three couples were left with no reservations. The parents of the groom had reservations for a two room suite which they did not have when they checked in. The bride and groom could not get into their room after the wedding. The keys would not work. Took three trips to the front desk before security came up to help. The concierge was rude and unhelpful when needing to print our boarding passes. However, the housekeeping staff was so friendly and accommodating. They did a great job and were always asking if we needed anything if we ran into them in the hall. By the way, if you have an event there, don't book through the event! Save $70.00 plus per night by booking online. Plus you can get parking discounts online that were not offered to the guests who booked through the event people. Our room was across the hall from the housekeeping storage closet and apparently the mechanical room for the elevators. We heard banging and noise all night and talking and banging early in the morning. Not a great night's sleep!

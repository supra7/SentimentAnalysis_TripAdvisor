Overall, I liked our stay at the Hotel Vintage Park, but there were some disappointments. First of all there is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a restaurant next to the hotel that only does dinner (possibly lunch, but I didn't check). I have found I like having a restaurant in the hotel for breakfast. Their only option was room service and I'm not that wealthy! The room was nicely appointed, and we had fun with the leopard print robes. The concierge service was nice and a woman helped us get reservations to the Waterfront Grille - an EXCELLENT restaurant. But I digress.... There was NO view from our room, in fact we looked at a brick wall with a mural painted on it. Not that I need a view - I'd just assume walk around and see the city. It is moderately convenient to most of the tourist destinations. Luckily we were up for some walking. We only had the option of valet parking, so this added to our expense. There was nothing over the top about this hotel - I would not necessarily recommend this hotel. There's probably something else in Seattle that's a little nicer for the money you spend at the Hotel Vintage Park.

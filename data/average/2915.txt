This hotel was in a great location, just off of Michigan Ave where all the shops are. However, we were given a room near the elevators and they are so noisy! If you want to sleep in, don't stay here. I have never stayed at a hotel where I can hear all the water pipes in neighboring rooms and the elevator passing every floor. Otherwise, some of the staff members are very friendly and helpful with directions.

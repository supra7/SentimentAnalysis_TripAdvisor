I had bid on Priceline for a hotel and Edgewater is the hotel that came back. We had a city view, queen size bed. All the previous reviews about the room being small are correct. The room was well appointed but small indeed. In this economy room, there is no dresser for clothes, and no mini frig. The bathroom is nice but again small. The glass shower wall is high but it's a 3/4 length to the opposing wall so expect some water to get on the floor. There are a few trains that will pass but more annoying than them is the ding-ding-ding noise from the rr gate crossing bell. Overall, if the room was larger, I'd return.

This hotel was in a great location and the room was a nice size but this may have been the loudest hotel I have ever been in. At 6am on a Sunday someone was singing opera, at 8 the cleaning service was in the hall clanking around, and the heating was loud. Both Saturday and Sunday the cleaning staff were in the halls talking loudly at the crack of dawn. When I go to a hotel I want to relax and enjoy myself -- not wake up earlier than I do for work because there is so much noise in the hall!!

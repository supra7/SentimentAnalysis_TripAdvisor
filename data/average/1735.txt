Checking in with a confirmation # thru an agent? Good luck, considered "no good" at this front desk. Aloha, my backside. Cool your heels, bec you're already persona non grata. "Sleep in"? Not past 7:30 am, won't get a pool chair or a snippet of grass on which to sit in the sun. Simple expectation for counters/sinks/toilets to be wiped down in your room? You're high maint! That won't happen here, even after you get a Mgr and Head of Housekeeping involved. Expect friendliness when you call the front desk? Expect this (and I quote): "Is it quick? We have a long line in front of you." (Day 1, our 1st phone call.) Hoping for an oz of R&R? Don't get room 103- elevators, ice maker, and a doc office to boot. Dregs! Hoping to drink your I-picked-a-crappy-hotel blues away? Don't hit Japengo: they close at 9:45 pm, their waitresses are surly and evasive, and the prices are a joke. Wanna sleep off your irritation in your $525/night room? Sweet! Expect stained carpet, popcorn ceilings, parking lot views, and more. Dan Sorenson at the concierge and Stephen from the bell stand are perhaps two of maybe 5 total kind, knowledgeable, hospitable staff. The rest need a serious kick in the behind. Zero protocol, zero response time, disincentives for service abound. Get thee/me to the Four Seasons Wailea or Fairmont Kea Lani stat- counting down the minutes till we leave this hellhole.

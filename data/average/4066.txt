The location is awesome - convenient to Newbury Street, Fenway Park, and connected to a shopping at Copley Plaza. Starbucks in the lobby is good for our morning coffee fix. The room was very small though. Barely enough room for the two full size beds (which is hard with 2 kids and 2 adults) and not much room to move around.

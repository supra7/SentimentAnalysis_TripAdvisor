The hotel was clean and central to shopping, restaurants,etc. there was a restaurant on the main floor but unfortunately it was reserved that night for a wedding. Just across the street was a great restaurant that served these little shrimp fritters called beignets and really good corn bread, so moist. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but one thing that wasn't good about it was that we had to park our car in the covered parking area and walk in the alley to get back to the hotel lobby. It seemed inconvenient, they did have valet parking but it cost $25.

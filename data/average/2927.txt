We're from Chicago, and found The Avenue on Hotwire. Had we paid the full price ($140/night, as opposed to $75/night on Hotwire), we would have been very disappointed. A lot of little things added up to make The Avenue less than the 4-star hotel that it's rated. Bathroom fixtures were loose and the shower was poor. The toilet reminded us of a public restroom stool. The baseboards, furniture and doors were scuffed and dirty. The room did a poor job of muffling the city noise, even at 25 stories. On the other hand, they do a lot of things right. The bedding was fantastic. The staff and service were quite good. The Sky Lounge was impressive, feels exclusive (in the good way) and reasonably priced. For people who want to explore the Mag Mile and the Gold Coast, you can't beat the location. We discovered that breakfast the the adjacent Elephant and Castle restaurant was exactly the same as breakfast served from room service, but at half the price. As a recent conversion from a mid-range hotel in Chicago, The Avenue is trying to be a 4-star hotel and has the potential to be a 4-star hotel, but as of this visit, it was not.

Having just returned from this hotel after spending a week there, I am delighted to get back to my own bed. Whilst the hotel has been modernised in a boutique style it certainly does not offer a boutique experience or comfort. Booked a double bedroom and was assigned a zip & link queen bed. So as soon as you got into it, the beds separated in the middle resulting in a v configuration that you had to roll out off every 10 minutes, so not for sleeping let alone anything else! Service on the front desk was good from all staff save one male who gave the impression he was doing you a favour e.g. asked for a Spa pricelist in Turkish Lira two separate times and all was interested in doing was sending me down there to talk to the staff who were not actually in the Spa. Consequently I did not use these services and hey their loss if they do not want my money. On Friday night we were given sleep eyemasks with ear plugs in the afternoon. And yes the hotel and surrounding area was noisy with revellers but that did not bother us given the beds! Also knowing it was a city centre urban hotel. This is not for those who need peace and quiet though. Breakfast was the same for the seven days with no variations whatsoever. The hotel bar is adjoining and a club environment at weekends which on a Saturday at 2300 we could not get access as it was full, so again we took our money elsewhere. This hotel has one thing in its favour - that being its location however, there are lots of hotels in this same location so why not give them a try.

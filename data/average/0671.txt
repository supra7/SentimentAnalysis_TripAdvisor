Good bed with comfortable linens. Large room with desk, large tv, sofa, coffee table, and huge closet. Low light in the bathroom. Enjoyed the huge mirror in the room. Overall very good experience. When I walked in, never greeted by front desk, which wasn't very professional; they were always talking to each other. The air conditioning/heating system was VERY loud. You had to pay for wifi/internet access, which seems very antiquated and stingy. And you had to fight a little for the hot water. There was a pathetic business center. And they lost my breakfast room service reservation that I stuck to my door the night before, which was very inconvenient as I was in a rush. Even considering that, of my three-night stay, I would much prefer to stay there than anywhere else in Seattle. I enjoyed my experience, every though I thought I deserved a bit more respect, professionalism, and service from a boutique hotel. I would stay there again over a Sheraton or Hilton.

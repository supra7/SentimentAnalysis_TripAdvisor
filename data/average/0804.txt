This hotel is a little dated, which means smaller rooms with less placement planning . I would still recommend that you stay here at least once, and probably twice. On my next visit I plan on asking them to reserve a room for the first two nights on one side of the tower and for the next few nights on a different side or different tower This is because the cylindrical towers offer large semicircular windows offering expansive views of the city. Its tough to provide a more detailed review, because of the combination of standard Westin features, like dual showerheads, heavenly beds, and brilliant location of outlets with lamps for laptop and other charging needs, with issues like slightly worn towels, a goofy bathroom door that nearly forces you to close it to maneuver, and lots of crevices that confound the cleaning ladies (I dropped a tissue and knelt to pick it up, and realized that there were large crumbs under/beside the bed hidden by the overlapping comforter and frame). Still, you should stay here at least once. Forty-six floors up you can see the city and waterfront and take spectacular photos. The location offers a great base for excursions to Pike Place Market and several good restaurants. Also, its a little closer to the Space Needle than some other top-tier lodging options. The staff was friendly, the Wi-fi connection I the lobby was slow, and there are numerous pros and a few cons that I could expound upon, but why? You should stay here at least once, end of story.

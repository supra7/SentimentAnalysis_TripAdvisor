This was quite a good airport hotel, but didn't come close to my previous three nights' stay at the Pan Pacific Singapore. I chose it as I was picking my children up from the airport late at night, then flying out with them the next morning. This hotel's greatest asset is its proximity to the airport, as it is located at the end of the arrivals lounge in Terminal 3. There is a quick monorail service between T3 and the other terminals. The rooms were quite large, but this is a hotel with dollar signs as its driving force, so even though I had booked and confirmed that I required adjoining rooms with a KS bed and twin beds, all they could give me was adjoining rooms with two KS beds. As my teens did not want to sleep with each other, one ended up with me. The other options were a $60-a-night rollaway or an extra $120 a night for a separate room. I was told that the majority of their rooms have KS beds, and that generally twin beds are not available, so be warned. Service otherwise was okay - bit slow on check-in and check-out, but okay. Noise level was okay - not much noise from outside despite overlooking the runway. There was more noise internally from the swimming pool and other guests along the corridors. Facilities in the rooms were reasonable, but there was no price list for the minibar so I didn't see that as an option. Drinks in the hotel lounge were seriously expensive, but for food at least you were a short walk into the terminal with various dining options in the public areas there. All up, I recommend this only if you need an airport hotel. I don't recommend it if you are staying in Singapore for a few days.

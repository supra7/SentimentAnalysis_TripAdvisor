Parrot Key website says: King Bed in Master Suite and Queen Bed in Second and Third Bedroom! Well...our Adult Family had to sleep in Full-Sized Beds....hard when you are tall, etc. No "Ceiling Fan" in the THird Floor Bedroom.....the rest of us had to "Freeze" to keep the Third Floor Bedroom Cool! You would save on "energy bills" if their was a fan in all of the bedrooms. Pool towel situation is unbelieveable! Towels do not absorb and you are forever having to call the Front Desk for new ones! Too many cottages/hotel rooms for Housekeeping. Housekeeping arrived after 2:00 everyday and the Front Desk never told us. Stay with a National Hotel Chain and gain your points for future travel! Plus...you would have a "shuttle service" to Downtown.

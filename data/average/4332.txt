We stayed at the Boston Park Plaza for a Memorial Day getaway to see the Red Sox. The hotel is in a wonderful location...right in the middle of everything, with a T stop right down the block. It was easy to walk to most locations, and when we didn't feel like walking, it was a quick jump on the T. When you arrive, the hotel looks really nice and the lobby is wonderful. We took the elevator up to our room on the 9th floor, and when we walked in, we were surprised at how small it was. While we didn't plan on spending much time in the room, it was tiny (if you've ever been to Europe, you'll know what I'm talking about). The bed was okay, but a little hard. Everything seemed clean. The bathroom was crazy...the shower was a tiny rectangle...maybe 12 inches wide. Neither my husband nor I could stand in it and shower without turning sideways, and we're not big people. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom, so the little room gets steamed up pretty fast. Service was good though, and it was clean. The only thing was since we were near the elevators, you could hear them coming up and down. May bother some people, but we were tired at night, so we slept through it. Overall, it did what we wanted it to...provided a clean place to sleep that was near everything. If you don't want to spend a ton of money and aren't looking for luxury, then this hotel will be fine.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom bungalo with four smallish courtyard pools in the center. It is not conveniently located to the downtown action. Rooms were clean, but try to get ice and the hours of operation to get it are limited. When booking (we had 4 people), they neglected to inform us that there is 1 very long stairway to the living area and 1st bedroom and then another very long stairway that leads to the 2nd and no alarm clock in the 2nd bedroom for them to use. Also taxi's were very pricey to go downtown, for 4 people $20.00 each way. We stayed 4 days so the taxi price at the end was very high. The pools are very nice but there were children screaming in 3 of them so we had to use the pool farthest away. I think they should allow one pool for children and designate 1 at least have 2 or 3 for adults only. I realize it was Fantesy Fest weekend but for a 4 night stay it cost a total of $1,762. Also they have a small refrig with coffee and cups but no sink to rinse things out or put the ice in after it melts, and no water so the people staying upstairs in the 2nd bedroom if they awoke eary had to go all the way back upstairs to their room to the bathroom to fill the coffee pot. I believe for a place this pricey they should have a sink if they provide a refrigerator. Had a good time in Key West despite some of the hardships of the hotel. Would stay closer to the downtown area next time and save the $ on the taxi's. Also they charge an extra $24.00 a day tagged onto your room for use of their pools and parking.

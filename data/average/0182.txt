Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle for 3 nights during the Easter Weekend. The hotel is located about 5 or 6 mins walk to the main shopping area. The room was clean and had a 37 inch flat screen tv, there is also a radio alarm clock with cd player. The only negative point is that I could hear everything that was going on in the room next door due to the paper thin walls and there was no fridge in the room to keep drinks cool. If you are flying in to Seattle try the Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus which drops off at the Crowne Plaza for only $17 return. It's alot cheaper than a cab.

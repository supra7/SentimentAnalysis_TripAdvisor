Upon arriving at the front desk....we were told our reservation was not in the system...after about a :15 minute wait that issue was resolved and we were given a room with a better view to make up for the issue....upon arrival at our room the housekeeping was not completed...sheets were off the bed and piled on the floor and chairs....upon calling the front desk they said to stay where we were and they would 'run' keys to a new room up to us....after 15 minutes and no new keys we went to the front desk....we would consider this to be 'three strikes'...and we relayed our experience to a manager named 'Kelvin' who assured us he would rectify the issues. He called our room within 5 minutes and offered to not charge us their $20 per day resort fee in lieu of the issues...which we accepted and thought this was a nice gesture for the issues....until we checked out and were told there we no notes on our account and the resort fees were charged!! (the desk agent took them off...but more hassle). The rooms and amenities were very nice...if we did not have to deal with operations and management...the entire experience would have been better. It is a shame to have a nice product and have people and processes fail so badly.

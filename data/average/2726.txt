I stayed here a couple of weeks ago - choosing it as it was a good value alternative to my usual NY hotel (The Pod Hotel). The room I had was fine and the noise from the Manhattan Bridge/trains very close by did not cause me any problems - I slept fine most nights. I did get accused of smoking in my room by one of the maids (I am a non smoker) which was a bit irritating - presumably just because I had left a window open for ventilation. The real problem with the hotel was the location - it is of course in Chinatown and therefore there were few of the standard NY locations anywhere nearby. No branches of regular chains like Starbucks, Duane Reade, Walgreens and no diners anywhere which meant I had to travel up town to find one each morning. So it is a good value hotel but you will feel like you are in Beijing rather than New York.

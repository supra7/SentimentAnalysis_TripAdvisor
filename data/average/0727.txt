I just can't feel as enthusiastic about this iconic hotel. The location can't be beat, if you're lucky enough to have a water view. But the rooms, mountain lodge style, are extremely dark if the sun isn't shining. This IS Seattle. The bathroom, also small, had no towel bars, the closet was a 2' bar, and there was a very old 19" TV. Have stayed here before and other rooms (facing the water) are better, but we will stay somewhere else next time.

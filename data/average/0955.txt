The Travelodge does 'what it says on the tin.' Its a basic no frills hotel/motel that provides accomodation in a good location with easy access to the I-5 and a classic 24hr boozer/diner just down the street. The shuttle bus for Safeco Field was a good deal as well. The room has a shag carpet 70s-80s feel to it, likely because thats when it was built or last upgraded, but so what. The bathroom was in good condition and the bed was comfortable enough. If you're looking for something more - pay for it.

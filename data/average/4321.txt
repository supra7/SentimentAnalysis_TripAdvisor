I stayed here for one night and the experience was average. The hotel has a nice classic appearance from the outside and in the lobby. I knew the hotel was old so the room didn't bother me too much. The room was on the small side, the linens and bedding were somewhat new, but the bathroom was tiny and needed a renovation badly. The only issue I had was the temperature. The heater in my room didn't work and the maintenance guy finally got it to work after three visits. The front desk was very accomodating and offered to change my room even after they fixed the problem.

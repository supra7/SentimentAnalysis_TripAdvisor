I booked a room at this hotel through Hotwire and was very apprehensive after reading the reviews on this site. Well, the hotel really isn't that bad! I didn't have any of the problems that people have listed here. First of all, the staff had absolutely no difficulty with checking in someone who had prepaid. I was in my room within minutes. The room was at least average, possibily even above average. The size was nice, with an efficiency kitchen (including a full refrigerator). The room was quite clean and had no odor whatsoever. And there were no stains on the carpet. Everything looked reasonably new. Look, if I were judging this as a five-star hotel, I might have to raise some complaints. There were little cracks in the sink by the drain. There was a small area of chipped paint on the wall in the bathroom. The TV is small, maybe about 21 inches. But that's all I'd have to gripe about. This place doesn't pretend to be a five-star hotel (and doesn't charge like one, either). For what it is, it's at least acceptable. I'd have no problems staying here again.

Stayed here for 4 days while attending a conference at the convention center. Just adequate as far as a hotel is concerned. The rooms are well kept, beds are comfortable. However, they are small. Not too small for 2 adults, but a little more cozy than I would have preferred. Same thing could be said about the bathroom. Clean facilities, just small. Pros: Clean, close to everything. If you need a no frills stay when attending a function at the convention center, this place is perfect (1 block away). Pretty central to everything, walking was never too far. The restaurant inside was good for lunch and dinner, excellent meals (very generous portions). Easy to schedule car service to get back to the airport. Cons: No free wireless service. You must purchase wireless access from Waypoint and the cost of ~$10 per day. That was annoying considering I was on business. The gym, if you can call it a gym, is terrible. It was a converted room with 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical and 1 set of dumbbells. Only 2 people could be in there at the same time. Breakfast buffet was poor; few choices and it costs way too much (~$10). Bottom line, while it had its downsides, The Roosevelt is a good place to stay. Seems to be right in the center of everything, short walks to everything I wanted to see/do. Clean rooms. I would stay there again if I had too, but would try to get someplace else first.

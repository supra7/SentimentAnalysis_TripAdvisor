The hotel and rooms were fine, they were clean and had a modern feel. In a really good location to explore Dubai. Breakfast was ok, had the same selection every day but that was fine. There is a 24 hour supermarket 2 mins away which was really friendly and good value. Only down side to the hotel is the separate times for men and women to use the swimming pool. We did speak to a manager who said the hotel are looking for a way to change that. If this was changed I would definitely stay again, the location is great and as ling as you use the public taxis rather than the hotel cars, you don't get charged a lot for getting round.

We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and cannot fault it for location -its a short walk to all the main shops,the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. The room was spotlessly clean which was great-other people have commented on the decor which being honest wouldnt be to my taste either but this is definitely a good place to lay the head while enjoying the highlights of Seattle. This was the most reasonably priced hotel I could find in Seattle despite extensive research so would recommend it on that basis.

We stay at the hotel for 4 nights. We arrived on the day of the national strike so we were glad that we weren't in the middle of town. The hotel was modern and clean. The room was small and pretty bared. Bring your own shampoo/conditioner because all they had was shower gel for everything. Breakfast was ok and the same menu for 4 mornings we were there. We stayed there because we were IHG member. We did not know until the third day that as a gold member we supposed to get free wi fi - our children paid for the first 2 days. This hotel is good for business travelers or for overnight stay.

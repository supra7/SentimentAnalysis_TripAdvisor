Our bed was comfortable and we had a satisfactory stay here for one night, but our room was next to a mechanical room that made ongoing noises. We asked for a quiet room and did get one that faced the side away from the road, but the mechanical noises were annoying. Try to insist on a room that's both away from the road and also away from mechanical rooms and elevators if you want a better experience.

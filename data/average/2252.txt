Hello everybody. I booked the Trump under a blind bid with Priceline in the hopes of staying at The Venetian or The Pallazzo. Those hotels are at the very core of Las Vegas action today. The Trump is a lovely hotel with friendly service, but it is not close to a 5 Star property given the lack of amenities that make a property warrant so high a rating. Since the Trump is new, it had very clean, fresh rooms. We were provided a south strip view on th 59th floor....very lovely..., and the room was lovely too. The Bathroom was exceptional, neither the fresh newness, nor the excepional bathroom merited 5 Star status. Sorry to say, but this is a 3.5 star hotel at best, and perhaps less than that given Vegas standards of opulence. A word on the Train. I requested a room which might be spared th noise. I was told I had such a room. Alas, nothing breaks loud noises late at night. I wonder whether other hotels on the west side of the strip suffer the same troubles?

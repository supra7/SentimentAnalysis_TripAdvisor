The resort was slow in check-in and had completely inadequate parking. It was mostly clean, excepting the hair in the shower. Reasonable compared to Key West rates for 3 bedrooms, but ridiculous in terms of water view (next to none), inconvenient to walk through like a rabbit warren to get to the room. All pools close at sunset except one which is only open till 10. Very, very closde quarters, all rooms tight and small. It was only fair.

The lobby in this old hotel is beautiful and is a great way to begin your stay. Unfortunately, they've filled the lobby with bar tables in place of the quiet classical music of a couple years ago. Do not book this hotel through an internet agency - they have very very small rooms for those who pay lower internet rates. Book the hotel through Hilton, and specify a large room. The location isn't bad for the loop area, but its a bit of a walk to the North Michigan area. This is the perfect hotel for CTA availablilty - the elevated is available at the Wabash entrance, and the Red line is available at the State Street Entrance. If you do not use the valet parking, there will be very little room to leave your car while checking in - and they bell hop will be very upset with you.

Got given a room despite coming in well before the check in time,room was dirty,changed on request when the cleaner couldn't bring it up to scatch. Checked into another room which had to be cleaned on insistence. The staff were very helpful,willing to help but just can't get the cleaning right.Sajim at reception was particularly helpful and Santos was very friendly and likeable. A professional needs to go in the hotel and sort the cleaners out. My only complain is the cleaning standard,they even use the same cleaing mob for bathroom/toilet to clean all other rooms including kitchen. couldn't complain anymore. The cleaning standard is letting you down.

We have stayed at this hotel many times inthe past. The location next to Quincy Marketplace is great,but I have learned the rents have gone up and many of the quaint stores are gone with empty storefronts and high priced restaurant left. This hotel is going through major renovations. The escalator as you enter is nothing but plater board and the views from the restaurant are of balcony repairs yet the hostess insists on seating folks in the ugliest locations. Worst of all it seems call girls fill the rooms and all night long we heard the sounds of knocking on doors in the wee hours and other not so pleasant noises. Many guests were heard complaing they were not told of the repairs when booking. The one high point is the wondeful staff that do try their best to be pleasant.

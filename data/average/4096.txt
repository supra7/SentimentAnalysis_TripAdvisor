We were in Boston for just 2 nights, capping off a wonderful trip to Maine. Hotel is clean and looks nice, but the beds were terribly uncomfortable (much too soft), and the rooms are quite small. They assured us we could put in a cot for our 3rd child, but it was a feat to rearrange the furniture and make it fit. Location is terrific, not far from many restaurants and the T. Recommend Joe's restaurant for American. Nice environment, great menu and surprising speed with good food. Concierge was very helpful, if not enthusiastic.

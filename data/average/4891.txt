I stayed at the Palmer House with my wife for a weekend away from the kids. As any parent will attest, in that situation, standards are quite low - all you really want/need is a quiet spot away to reconnect with your spouse. The Palmer House offers that - with a great lobby, two nice lounges (yes, they can get loud, but they are nice) and a very good health club (unfortunately, they charge you for this, even if you are HHonors Elite, which is very annoying). I've stayed here before and have come to expect that the rooms at the Palmer House vary a lot - there are very good rooms and ones that give you claustrophobia. We were fortunate to have a decent room (handicapped accessible) with a good sized bathroom. I was disappointed that the TV was an old CRT model, the air conditioner was too loud and the shower had mold around the edges. Also, as others have posted, the hotel has huge floor plans and the wait time for elevators can be quite long, so factor that in to your plans. For the price we paid (under $200) these are acceptable trade offs. If you can get a good deal on the Palmer House, check it out, otherwise, keep looking - Chicago is full of really great hotels.

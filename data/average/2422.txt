The hotel was not the nicest of places but it got the job done and was walking distance of the nearby Penn Hospital. Even though some things didn't work, it definitely made up for it with its breathtaking views of the skyline of the city of Philadelphia and its view of Franklin Field. I would definitely stay there again.

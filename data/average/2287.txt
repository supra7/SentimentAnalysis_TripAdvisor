Pros: beautiful property, new and clean, nice pools, nice-sized rooms, coffee maker, small refrigerator, microwave, ten minute walk to trolley bus stop at Fairfield Inn, Walgreens next door which is very handy. Cons: bad location on busy street next to Home Depot in New Town, no view from patio, hotel charges an up-front charge for "incidentals" of $250 to your credit card and then will provide refund within five days of your departure if you don't use it, food in cafe not very good.

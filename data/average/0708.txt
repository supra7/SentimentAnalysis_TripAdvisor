Stayed one night to do some Christmas shopping in downtown Seattle; I live one hour away. The view of Elliot Bay from our room was beautiful and the outside deck spacious. However the decor can only be described as odd. A "mountain cabin" theme, with an Eastern inspired bathroom. The elevator was dirty, with worn carpeting.The lounge was lovely. A real plus is the hourly shuttle service to the downtown area, and the hotel is within walking distance of harborside shops and restaurants. I might add that the room was very clean, but the empty cabinets that once housed the old style televisions should be removed. I think this hotel needs a remodel.

While another reviewer noted that there is no street noise, my room on the 12th floor had so much noise from my neighbor that I WISH there would have been some street noise to drown them out. From the heavy sighs of frustration to them dropping their luggage on the floor....I put some music on before I heard anything else. Rooms were dated but clean, and customer service was excellent! I just wouldn't stay here expecting a quiet stay.

My room was relatively spacious (for downtown Seattle) with a partial view of Lake Union. It seemed a bit dated in some ways even though it had been remodeled at some point during the hotel's history. The room seemed pretty clean on the surface. The comfy bed was definitely the best part of the room. But the unfortunate problem was ... bed bugs. I have always been paranoid about them even though I'd never encountered them myself. I knew what they looked like and how to find signs of them. I didn't have any bites, but just finding a dead one and later, one live one, convinced me of their presence in the room. I also found a small "nest" or whatever on the bedskirt - wouldn't the housekeeper have seen this? I called the front desk, and they had the bellman bring me a key to a new room in the other tower within about 30-40 minutes. I received a letter under the door the next day explaining how serious they take bed bugs, how they would quarantine the room, and refunded my first night. Coincidentally I had to come back to the hotel a few days later (was staying in a different hotel in town for personal vacation time) to look for some books I left behind in that room's armoire, and the room was indeed taped off and the bed dismantled. So I feel that the Westin Seattle management handled this fairly well... but I also think they need to improve their housekeeping procedures to prevent this ever increasing issue.

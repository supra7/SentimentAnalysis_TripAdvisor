you guys are cheap and picky for those who are writing bad reviews about this hotel. I stayed at this hotel a couple of times i know this is not the perfect hotel. But hey what do you expect when your making 39 to 59 dollar rate reservations. Well if i wanted a luxurious hotel i would of payed Hilton or Hyatt 295 dollars up front. So stop complaining about the hotel being cheap and start paying for a more luxurious hotel. Never noticed how CHEAP people were.

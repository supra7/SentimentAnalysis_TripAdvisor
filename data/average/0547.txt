Thanks to another Tripadvisor review, my wife and I redeemed ourselves for at least one night of our stay this past weekend. We booked through Starwood based on the location and ability to use points. Arrived to be placed in the Pike Tower-- 22nd floor. After hearing of renovations, we opened the door to a less than average room. We were very angry to find out-dated furnishings, mold on the bathroom ceiling above the shower (with hair on shower curtain), and a stiff king bed. Walking down the hallway even gave off a musty smell. Upon reading trip advisor Saturday evening with only one night remaining, we found out that the Union Tower was the one newly renovated, so we immediately called the front desk to change. They offered to move us and we obviously accepted. Got to the new room to find what seemed to be a completely different experience/hotel. Updated contemporary furnishings and nicer bathrooms. This was the room we expected to find when booking using several thousand Starwood Points. We expressed our frustration at the front desk upon leaving and they gave us 1000 Points back to send us on our way. That was a small consolation for being left in the dark for 2 days of our romantic getaway. Next time, we'll try the Four Seasons Seattle-- which was booked full or we would have moved. Pool was nice... just filled with KIDS KIDS KIDS. Could not relax there at all.

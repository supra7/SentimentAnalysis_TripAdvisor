The hotel is polished and snazzy. However, it leaves A LOT to to be desired. Upon arrival, no bellhop greeted me or offered to help with bags. After check-in, I noticed that the previous guest had left her nightie hanging in my bathroom! The maid had completely overlooked it! Then, I went to use the small spa, which has no hot tub. After 20 minutes in the steam room, I was heated up and ready for a hot shower. Problem was, there was no hot water! The burners were down. I was told this has happened several times before. I caught a bad chill during the 15 minutes that I was standing in the 65 degree locker room trying each and every shower. No apology from the mindless female attendant and no manager on duty! Even though I was on a high floor, I could still hear the train whistle like it was in my room! Very loud. And each time the guests next to me shut their door, my windows and wall shook! These noises woke me up early each morning. Trump didn't bother sound proofing the windows, so you can hear a car horn 50 floors below! The restaurant is elegant and the service and food are very good, but the prices are very very high and the menu is limited. There is only one dining choice. The pool and fitness center are nice but pretty small by Vegas standards. I tried to reach the V.P. of the property, but the operator refused to put me through! They are instructed not to let guests through to him. I could not believe it! I also heard from several guests and employees that Trump has cut a lot of staff recently. Perhaps that is why the service is so lacking. Overall, it was nowhere near a 5 star experience. 4 star at best and that is pushing it. C'mon Trump! I thought you were known for top-notch properties. What happened?

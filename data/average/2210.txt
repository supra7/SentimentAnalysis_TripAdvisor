We booked the hotel online and it says steps from the strip. More like 1/2 mile down a dark road with no sidewalk access. After a long day of walking and shopping - it would be great to be able to get to your Hotel without worrying about being mugged or run over by a taxi cab. We thought TRUMP - well it has to be nice. Room is super nice - staff terrific - during business hours the mall is open across the street and great if you taxi everywhere. It would have been good if they had a smoke free casino also and when I got back in at 10pm to order room service no one answered and I am still waiting 25 minutes with no return call. Since this is NOT close to the strip you can not just walk anywhere to get anything....kind of is NOT STEPS AWAY FROM STRIP! Bellagio - in the middle of the strip is a much better choice or even Treasure Island although TI smells of smoke everywhere.

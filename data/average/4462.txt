I stayed in the Hilton Back Bay for a week in June 2009 and it was a bit of a disappointment. The doormen and front desk staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. My room was huge with a wonderful view of the Christian Science Plaza but tastelessly drab in decor. The lere centre was small for a hotel of its size and class. It was perfectly adequate and a nice location from which to discover Boston but I'll be checking out other options on my next trip.

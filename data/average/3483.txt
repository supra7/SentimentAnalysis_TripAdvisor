When we drove up I had my doubts, but the place turned out to fairly nice. There is a bar and a (very slow but tasty) restaurant. The rooms are very small, and the bathrooms tiny. Zero room amenities other than one towel left on the twin bed. No sheets on the bed, just a skirt and a worn comforter. Everything seemed clean, but the bed wasn't too comfortable. The worst part was the traffic noise. As the name implies, the hotel is on a corner between two very busy roads, and I didn't sleep at all due to the constant road noise (sirens, trucks, motorcycles, etc). My wife and daughter, however, slept soundly, so maybe it was just me!

In May stayed in the Long Wharf for one night. I was in town for an early birthday celebration. We had 5 guys in our group so we had two rooms. The beds were comfortable as always. Nothing tops a Marriott bed. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is right in the heart of the fun. The hotel was just ok though. I did not find anything real great about it. The rooms are built around what i assume is the open ballroom. It was a large carpeted area. The night we stayed there, it happened to be hosting a prom. Not a problem for us because we were out at the bars, but the noise coming from that open ballroom would have been disturbing to people staying in. After a late night we came in and got to sleep on those comfy beds....the only problem was we were woken up at 7:30 in the morning to the sound of the crew setting up the ballroom for another event. All you could hear was talking and the clanging of dishes and silver. we were on the third floor, so i could not imagine how loud it was for the lower floors. It may have been a busy weekend we happened to be there for but it was a bit disappointing. For the money, i think there are probably better options. The rooms were adequate though and again i love the beds.

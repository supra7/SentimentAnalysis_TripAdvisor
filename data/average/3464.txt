Dont stay here if you have only a day or two in Venice. Its at the eastern end of Venice and the 1.5 kms to city centre shall be atleast 40 mins crossing 8 bridges which is quite impractical with a kid. Vaporetto is very convenient though can be a bit costly. However if you are looking to spend a few days away from the crowd in Venice, it can be a good choice.

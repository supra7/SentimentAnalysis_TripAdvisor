First, my first issue was the 1-877 number that I have contacted with to confirm my reservation. The lady I spoke to was not friendly. And she kept asking me to spell my name for more than 3 times. She got an accent and was kind of rude. I felt bad after talking to her. Second, I checked in for 2 nights. The first night, there were no ropes and slippers in our room. The front desk sent us the ropes after we asking for them, but the slippers were out. The next day, the slippers were still out. The carpet was kind of dirty with some stain. The floor was cold to have my bare foot on it. And no slippers?! The room had no fridge and the TV reception was not too good. I thought they should offer some HD program or local channels that are HD, but just couldn't find any. I feel somewhat disappointed staying there and I might not stay in the hotel chain for my trip in the future.

Pros-Hotel is in a convenient location near Termini and the Repubblica Subway stop. Rooms were clean and staff helpful. Also our lowest-priced hotel in Italy (under 70 Euro for a double with cash) in November. Cons-Worst breakfast out of 4 hotels in Italy, many of the pastries/breads tasted hard/stale. FYI-We originally made reservations at Hotel Sonya (4 months prior) but were still placed at Hotel Opera Roma which I think is a common occurence. We were upgraded to the suite. The suite is spacious but in an odd configuration. Bathroom/jacuzzi are on the bottom floor, bed on the 2nd floor, and 2 other small beds are in the loft. The bottom level is very humid and pretty hot despite 2 dehumidifers being near the jacuzzi. There is no window or good ventilation on this level. The 2nd level also was quite warm and felt humid and too warm, even in November. The air-conditioning never came on as you can only lower it to a specific level. Although the hotel was a good value and overall it was fine, if we go to Rome again we would pay more to stay in another hotel.

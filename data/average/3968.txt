I've just returned from a 6 week stay at the Legacy which was okay. The staff are nice and very friendly and they will do their best to accommodate your needs. The WIFI access is good however, you do have to pay extra. The location is also great, next to the metro and easy access onto Shiekh Zayed Road. The rooms are also a good size, I stayed in a one bedroom apartment which had a good sized bedroom and living room area, kitchen and two bathrooms. I have to say that overall I found the apartment a bit dated, the room itself was very dark as there was no natural light, the furniture was not great, very dark and rather old. The apartment was never really clean properly either, there was dust on all the furniture and the curtains were filthy with stains all over them. The kitchen was okay but there was very few utensils. Twice in the bathroom there was a coakroach running up the wall (eeek!). Although I didn't have a bad stay, I dont think I would stay here again...

You can really make this place work for you, if you're willing to do without some conveniences that you may have gotten used to! Consider these qualifications: There's no daily maid service. Do you really need this? There's no complimentary breakfast. With what you're saving, you can treat yourself to breakfast out every day ... OR ... you can make your own coffee and a quick breakfast using the small efficiency kitchen. The room is a bit older, in need of some sprucing up, including paint. Chances are, unless you've gone through a remodel at home in the last five years, this place may be in better repair than your own home. If I were to stay here again, I would bring drawer liners for the dresser and extra towels, including mat, for the bath. Bed is comfy, and AC is in tip-top shape. Pool is HUGE and awesome. Parking lot is well-lit and secure. Definitely a no-frills vacation for us. The price was VERY right, even if the space took a bit of getting used to. We're uncertain about coming back, but mainly because we like to patronize the smaller mom 'n pop motels lest they give way to pricey condos and trendy chains.

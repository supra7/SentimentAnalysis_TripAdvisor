Overdue review. We booked hotel via bidding process on Priceline to try feature. The hotel attempts to be modern but the room and bathroom were aged and overall a very average establishment. On site amenities are minimal. The parking was atrocious as we paid for valet parking each day and on second night we were told the lot was full when we arrived back from day out at 8 pm. We were directed to park at nearby parking garage then required follow up to remove billing for valet parking.....upon checking out we had to take all luggage up road to parking garage. Hotel should know a space is reserved for a room occupant but were more interested in accomodating pub patrons....probably a higher turnover and better tipping option. Anyhow, we will not stay at thishotel again and possibly avoid whole chain.

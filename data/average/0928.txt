I stayed at the Westin in early March, 2005, and found it to be a functional business hotel... in other words, OK if someone else is paying the bill. The staff all seemed very nice, especially the front desk crew. Very accommodating and anxious to help. As mentioned in other reviews, though, this hotel is showing its age with worn, stained carpets in the halls and rooms. I liked the "Heavenly Beds" and showers... a nice Westin feature. Large, active, vibrant lobby area with couches and cushioned chairs... serving as a nice meeting place for many of the business travelers at the hotel. My main problem with this hotel was the exorbitant "side charges"... $29 per day plus tips for valet parking, $26 per day for self-park (!), and $16 per day for internet access when many hotels are offering it for free. Room service prices seemed extremely high to me, even before the fees and charges tacked on at the bottom of the page. Apparently they had just opened a new restaurant, but my room still had the menu from the previous restaurant, which caused some confusion when I called downstairs. After seeing the prices and limited selection, I opted for the McDonald's next door despite their resident panhandler. As with most places in downtown Seattle, the Westin is in a good central location within walking distance of major attractions like the Pike Place Market and the Convention Center.

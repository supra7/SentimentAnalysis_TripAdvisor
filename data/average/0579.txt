Stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms and the lobby were very nice & upscale. Rooms & bathrooms seemed to have been updated. During check-in there was a long line (with only 2 front desk clerks), and during check-out I was somehow double-billed. I had to wait for the manager to come out and clear the charges. Pros: -Accommodations are excellent (you basically get what you pay for) -Walking distance to shops, bars, restaurants Cons: -understaffed at check-in (took forever!) -incorrectly billed at check-out (although this was fixed after about 20 minutes)

We stayed here for the Addison Boom Town July 4th Celebration. Our room had a 2nd door with access to the outdoor pool. I believe these rooms are slightly larger than other rooms. This LQ is older but the price and location make up for it. The wireless internet service was only adequate in our room. The breakfast that was offered on July 4th at 8:45 a.m. for a full hotel was absolutely pathetic for a La Quinta Inn and Suites. We saw waffles, muffins and bagels, orange juice, milk, coffee, tea and cereal. It was nothing like the breakfasts we have had before at this LQ. We left without eating or drinking anything and went to a McD's after checking out.

The location of this cute boutique hotel was Awesome! There's a cute little market/ convenience store half a block away, a starbucks very close and a Whole Foods a few blocks away. Tons of beautiful restaurants within walking distance! Pike's place market is walking distance as well, a must see if you haven't been. Walking distance to great shopping!!! Forever 21, Nordstroms, Sephora,J Crew and much more. The rooms were small but the hotel it self is very nice and the Staff was super friendly and helpful! I would recommend hotel Max and I would stay there again.

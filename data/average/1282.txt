Easy access off the 5 freeway it is located four blocks from the airport and therfore very convienent. Also there is a gas station only 1/2 block away so if you have a rental car, it is easy to fill up and drive to the airport, drop it off and have the hotel shuttle pick you up. The staff were friendly and informative. The rooms were snug but clean and quiet. They had only plastic cups and the ammenities were pretty basic. The breakfast was a bit simple. Chipped beef on pancakes, cold cereal and fresh fruits. Again, the rate after tax was $100 so you get what you pay for. We were there only to catch a early morning flight so it was ok but definately not a romantic getway spot.

Got a great rate through Priceline, the location was wonderful, in the middle of everything. Hotel was beautiful. Staff was rude, unhelpful, did not get the room requested, could not get help with large luggage in or out of hotel. We were there for a special cruise event, when we asked for directions from the staff they wanted a tip for giving directions to the trolley stop.

This hotel is great because it is in the center of the city and downtown. It is so in the heart of the city every time we would walk to a new site we would pass it on the way. We were able to walk to every site and attraction you could ever want to see. The staff was nice. We didn't like the Heavenly Bed system that Westin is so proud of. My back and neck were so messed up we HAD to go to a spa the day we checked out and I am still hurting. Our TV didn't work and the staff was very helpful in promptly sending up a technician. Unfortunately he was in our room for quite a while and we were tired so I asked him to leave and just fix it the next day while we were out and he refused to leave. We only Paid $150 a night through Priceline and I wouldn't spend anymore.

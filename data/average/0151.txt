Located about 15 mins walk to the waterfront or Pike Place, although it is uphill returning to the hotel. Is close to a large highway (21 lanes of it), so there is some traffic noise. We were given a room on the 31st floor, an executive club room but that does apparently does not mean executive lounge access. I know when I booked the description included lounge access because I remember the breakfast being included, so after some discussion with the reception, we were granted access. Shame this happened! The rooms (bedroom, lounge & bathroom) were a little tired but nicely furnished with good views of the city & waters around. Coffee maker available and flat screen TV's x 2 In the ExecutiveLounge, you could buy alcohol, not sure but possible state intervention there, wine for example $7, whereas it was only $5 in the bar. Why more expensive in the Executive lounge? Small amount of canapies available from 5-7 pm . Breakfast complimentary in lounge, fresh fruit, bread products & cereal, nice selection! 5 min taxi ride to railway station. This is fine for downtown or the waterfront, but by no means the best Crowne Plaza out there. For an extra 10 per night, you could stay at the much better Fairmont Olympic, we did later in our holiday!

Nice hotel for being in the same hotel chain as "The Knights Inn" Friendly staff and room priced right. I had only two issues the traffic noise (hotel is close to a major road) was unreal. I suggest a room on the third floor and toward the back of the hotel. Also the room had the smell of bug spray. Room had flat screen tv, microwave and frig. Again Nice Hotel overall!

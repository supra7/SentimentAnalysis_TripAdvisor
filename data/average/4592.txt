I had a quite satisfactory week-long stay at the Meddusa. The place is a bit threadbare and my room (first floor on street side) was not as quiet as I'd have liked. But great location, friendly staff (not great English skills), clean (but a bit threadbare) room. Breakfast never changes but includes cornflakes as well as the usual yogurt/cheese/bread/cukes/tomatoes/olives/tea/instant coffee/juices. Terrace view is not the best but lets you survey the day's weather. Plenty of free drinks stocked in the refrigerator. Wifi worked well in my room. I was able to use my T-Mobile phone to make free US calls via wifi. Starbuck's and several nice sidewalk cafes are a block away on the pedestrian mall part of the street, just before the Mosque courtyard that leads to the covered bazaar (three blocks from hotel). Aya Sofia and tram stop are about four blocks away. I paid E308 ($460) for a week in October '09, and feel that it was a very good value.

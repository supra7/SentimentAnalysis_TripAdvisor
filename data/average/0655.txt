I was a little wary about the hotel after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. My son and I stayed for two nights and had no problems at all. On the plus side, we were allowed to check in early into our rooms (at 11:30 a.m.) for no extra charge. That made a big difference. I enjoyed doing a load of laundry after camping for eight straight nights. The washer and dryer were clean and in good working condition. The staff was extremely polite and friendly. They reserved a Town Car for us the morning we left and it was only $30.00 to get to the airport. The driver was there early and it was much nicer than taking a cab. The hotel is conveniently located. We walked to the Space Needle, Pike's Market and Pioneer Square. Our room was 330 square feet, so I was puzzled about some of the complaints about the rooms being small. Our room was only $129.00 in the heart of the summer, which I didn't think was too bad. On the negative side, we did have a view of an adult entertainment store. The rooms are a little worn and shabby--not dirty but not at all elegant. But when I realized that we would be out of the room almost all day and that the Westin was almost twice what we were paying, we decided to spend our extra money on the dining room at the Edgewater Inn on the waterfront. We ate outside and had a fabulous view of the Sound. Anyway, I felt the room was of reasonable quality for the money and the staff was a lot friendlier than at the more expensive hotel we stayed at in San Francisco! One other tip: take the Ducks Tour...it was a lot of fun and you get a good overview of the city.

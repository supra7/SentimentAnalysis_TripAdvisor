A forced stay due to airline not issuing boarding pass to allow passage into terminal through Immigration. Lounge had light snacks and Tiger beer, but stopped serving around 7pm. Comfortable setting with Internet access and printing capability. Breakfast begins too late for travelers using United Airlines. Hotel bar had draught beers ($12USD for 1/2 liter Tiger) but they suffered from an off-flavor indicating poor handling. Football matches projected behind bar but accompanied by annoying hip hop tunes, unescapable even in nearby seating..No airport bars anywhere in Terminal 3! Last resort is the Cheers market selling canned beers. Rooms are fairly spaceous, with a hard king bed and some soft pillows. View of airport runway and exposure to associated noise and vibration most of the night. Also hallway noise from slamming doors.Tasteful tan draperies across wide windows. Lightwood reading desk with adjustable chair. Open closet with bamboo-colored wall coverings and cabinetry. Subdued recessed ceiling lighting. Green, brown and white patterned carpet matches floral wall designs well. Glass wall between room and bath. Glass enclosed shower. Well-lit, large-mirrored bath. Programmable phone wake-up alarm along with battery-powered clock. Excellent WiFi speed (600kbps+). 42" flatscreen TV with 30 cable channels, no pay movies. Empty mini-fridge. After check-out I noticed numerous insect bites and raised red bumps on both ankles. I would advise travelers to closely inspect the bedding.

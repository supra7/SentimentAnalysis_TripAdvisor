If you want old world charm and a great location - this is your hotel. But you'll pay for it. We got the AAA rate of $189, and used Hilton points for another night. I believe it's over $250 a night otherwise. I've stayed at several hotels in downtown Chicago, and many other hotels around the world in my lifetime. Each trip gives me the chance to reflect on what I want, for that trip. In this case, we were meeting a group of friends with small children, and they really wanted to stay here for the location and oppulance. But for us, with a small child, we really prefer something with a fridge and a microwave. So this hotel wasn't our favorite. If you're traveling with friends or a spouse, this could be your splurge because it's walkable to a lot of famous sites, and easy to the "L" and bus stops to get to other famous sites. The room was relatively clean. I mean, what hotel doesn't have issues in that realm? We found a nasty stain on a bedskirt, but just tried not to think about it. The staff was extremely friendly. Again, what do you want in a hotel? Location and charm? Low price with small appliances and a free breakfast? You have to do the research and find out what works best for you. For our family, we would skip this beautiful historic hotel and go for something more practical.

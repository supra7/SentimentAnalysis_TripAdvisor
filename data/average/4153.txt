I have stayed in this hotel a number of times. It is centrally located and rates can be very reasonable for a hotel of this class. Rooms are smallish but well-furnished and comfortable. So what's not to like? Well, the total absence of access to free WiFi. Before when I visited, although WiFi in the room was a steep $12.95, you could pick it up for free in the Business Lounge or the Statler Lounge or the restaurant. Not any longer - all are secured. And yet the Au Bon Pain next door (hardly a classy joint) has a free hotspot. I stayed in a Hampton Inn on the way up from New York - free WiFi (and breakfast). What are they thinking? Better to add a couple of dollars to everyone's bill and have free access. This will certainly affect my buying decision next time I visit.

I chose this hotel because it was all-suites. Unfortunately, it looks a lot better on its website than in person. It is drab -- ugly beige couch, ugly carpeting, cheap particle board doors. The kingsize bed wasn't very comfortable and the pillows were worse. They're huge, hard things that feel like they have a layer of plastic underneath the ticking and pillowcase. So every time you try to get comfortable, they crinkle. The things I liked about the room were the deep bathtub and free wifi. And there's a kitchenette, which I didn't need. The hotel itself is well located, just down the block from St Catherine St, near Ogilvy and the Apple store.

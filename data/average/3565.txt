I found the hotel staff to be very pleasant; most importantly the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. My room 225, was acceptable the design was a bit odd. The shower, sink and toilet were not located in one area, the toilet is in a closet sized room, the shower faces the sleeping area and the sink is just right of the door as you enter. I prefer that all the bathroom components are located in the same room not spread throughout. Also I found the shower to be lack luster it looks like car wash with multiple heads, the problem is there is not enough water pressure to use it properly. The main head barely produces any pressure and is much colder than the other heads, this issue was brought to Rachels attention but they were not able to fix. Additionally, the closet was exceptionally small not barely enough to hold one suit and a couple shirts. A friend of mine was staying on the fourth floor where he had a bedroom, proper bathroom and a nice balcony with two chairs. Not sure how this room cost but I think it would be worth the increase. Overall my stay was not bad nor was it great.

The hotel by itself was okay. Service was fine but seemed like the staff wasn't willing to go the extra mile for attention. No one helped with the bunch of luggage I was carrying. Best thing was the room. Very clean and spacious and the free parking. Worst thing is the neighborhood where the hotel is located and their key system seemed to be not working. During the 3 days I stayed, both my keys stopped working repeatedly and had to be redone. I don't think I'd be coming back to this hotel any time soon.

I stay here numerous times a year and for the location, it's awesome! You are within walking distance of some of Seattle's greatest offerings. From Pike Place Market, the pier, Westlake mall, it's wonderfully located. What I don't like is how evidently old the building must be. The heating cooling system is ancient, and some rooms have the analog control on the wall which is fine (though I prefer the digital controls like a lot of hotels have) but some rooms have a wall heater that you raise the cover too and it always looks broken, like it either won't close all the way or open all of the way. Some knobs may be missing, hard to turn, etc. My other gripe is the towels. Can they not afford Downy?! Or any fabric softener?! Those things will rub your skin off. Food in the bar is pricey late at night. A basket of french fries was $6.95?! $12 burgers don't come with a side? If this was Boston or NY I could understand, but when there are good eats just footsteps from your property, you would expect better pricing. The beds are comfy though and they use white duvet covers and that's HUGE for me. I need to know that my linens from top to bottom have been washed.

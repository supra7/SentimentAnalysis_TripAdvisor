Stayed 1 night at the Warwick hotel on Oct. 29th Arrived at 12:00pm and used self parking, $26.00 for the night and valet is also $26.00 per night. Parked on the 7 level of parkade and took stairs to lobby as there is no elevator in the parkade. Check in was quick and easy less then 5 minutes. Our room was on the second floor and was clean. Room was small with 2 double beds, 26" old tv, small fridge in room and a coffee maker. Small bathroom with a shower and tub combo. Water tap for shower would not shut off completely. Over all if you get a good price for your stay, Under $100.00 a night, The hotel is a decent 3.5 star hotel, Close to most attractions etc.. The staff we encountered were helpful and friendly.

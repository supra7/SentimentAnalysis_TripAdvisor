Nice hotel, the room was not so big but clean, from the window you can see and hear the train running , so it is rather noisy. Good price. It is in the very hearth of Chinatown, not do far from brooklin bridge. Public transportation are near the hotel too, The reception is not located at the entrance but you have to go to the second floor, people of the staff are friendly and helpful, the internet connection is free if you have a laptop, otherwise you have to pay. Good hotel but bad location.

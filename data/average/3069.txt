I spent three nights there. When we arrived we discovered they made a mistake with our reservation. They thought we were arriving one day later, but they admitted it was their fault and they sent us in hotel just in front without paying anything more. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room is nothing special but clean. The breakfast is average. The spa is nice but expensive, I would prefer an historic hamman in the city centre. The location of the hotel is fine, very close to the monuments and to some restaurants.

Hotel was well located, clean and staffed with the usual friendly and informative Turkish staff that one expects in Istanbul. Nevertheless it is not "Premier," "Regency," all "Suites" nor does it feature a "Spa" as anyone would expect a spa to be. Breakfast was cheap. One major issue that I had was that they seem to have erroneously installed industrial "Airwick" air fresheners in all of the bathrooms (see photo) which reek of faux citrus. I woke up the first morning and really felt like I had been chewing on a Febreze all night. Of course I asked housekeeping to shut it off and they said they did but actually didn't. I'm very kind to hotels in general as per my other reviews and there is nothing desperately wrong with this hotel, it's just grossly overrated.

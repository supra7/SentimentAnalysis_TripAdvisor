Overall, this hotel was pretty good. We stayed here for 4 nights and had very little interaction with the staff. Our room was small but nicely decorated. On our first night, we went to the bar on the 28th floor, where they had a great happy hour special and nice views of downtown Seattle. The location is okay. We walked to Pike Market every day, and were able to walk to other downtown areas (Captiol Hill, Pioneer Square, the ferry terminal) as well. It is up a hill but it's an invigorating walk. If you don't feel up to it, it's easy to hail a cab around the city. The walls were kind of thin. There was a really loud woman in the room next to ours. I had to knock on her door and ask her to quiet down b/c her loud talking was waking me up at 6 am every day. I could also hear our neighbors' alarm clocks. In this day and age, I find it offensive that any hotel would still charge for WiFi. With this hotel, it was worse because they also charge for use of their computers.

Stayed there for one night. Good size room, nothing to amazing. The building has a weird layout so some of the rooms dont really have a veiw besides for the room across a small courtyard. We asked to switch rooms which they did do for us. They had a car park under the hotel which was nice. Wifi in the rooms as well. Rooms where clean and comfortable. Location was about 7km outside the main part of the city, which we rented bikes and rode into town one day, and took the bus as well which didnt take long either. Had a full breakfast with many options to pick from. Only thing I dont get is that they considered a double bed just two beds pushed together?? Also I had left behind some items in the room which they found and then mailed everything that I left to me, nothing missing. I had to pay for the shipping cost but was a small price to pay to get everything back. Overall I would prolly stay there again if I couldnt find anything closer to the city for the same price. They also had a bag storage for no extra charge, so after we checked out we left our bags in a room and went back out sight seeing.

Great location, just off La Rambla and a few steps from the Metro. Very clean, modern with friendly staff who all speak excellen english. The hotel is small with just 21 rooms, reception desk and a small breakfast area. Break fast were simple but adequate, cereal various breads, ham, cheese fruit and yogurt with tea or coffee. Bread rooms are clean, comfortable with good sized bathrooms, tv and air conditioning. Major downside was the noise from outside. No double glazing and this meant nights were particularly noisy as revellers returned home after a night out. If you are on a short break this hotel would be a great choice as it is within easy reach of all the major sights and shopping. Just don't forget the earplugs!

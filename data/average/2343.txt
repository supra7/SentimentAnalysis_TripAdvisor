We came to hotel after getting "You can dream again" certificate that they sold us at Time Share presentation at the hotel about a year ago. We liked the hotel for the same reasons other people on this thread did. However, we were very disappointed about the deal. The agency charged us extra fee for the week that we wanted. At the presentation we were promised that the certificate is good for any time of year. The hotel manager refused to grant us drop off back at the Cancun airport. We were told at the presentation that the pickup and drop off is included. At presentation we were told that the certificate gives us the same benefits that we would get if we owned time share at the Hotel. That was not true since transportation to Playa Del Carmen was not granted to us - only for Time Shares. The same apply to tour discounts. Manager explained to us that this is agency's fault. I do not think that this is entirely true since the Hotel is using the Agency to feel the rooms. Speaking about Time Share deals that they have: They offered us a deal for 30 year, no maintenance, flexible week. For 20,000 USD. At best, we would probably visit the property half of the time (15 times). Considering average stock market return of 10% a year, the 20,000 over 30 year period would of return $200,000 inflation adjusted. So the single week at the resort would cost $200,000 / 15 = 13,000 USD!!!!!! So avoid financial prison of the Time Share!

me and my boyfriend spent 3 nights in this hotel and we had no problems. our room is clean, breakfast are very basic here but not bad. its also close to major attractions in Istanbul, it was cold when we went there so its really nice to walk around and there's a lot of good restuarants to dine or drink nearby. i would recommend this for those who wants to enjoy the city more than their rooms.

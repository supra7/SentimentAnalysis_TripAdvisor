We booked a room here as we dropped our rental car at the alamo office. Was sort of expecting something better, as i hadnt stayed in a hilton before. Best thing about the place is the location. Clean but dated rooms gave the hotel abit of a depressing feel. But the single ply loo roll was laughable. sorry next time im giving the hilton a miss.

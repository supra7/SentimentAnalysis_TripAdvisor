The hotel&room were nice. Had a 2 bed studio with kitchenette. Spacious bathroom. The restaurant food was delicious. Claudia (waitress) was exceptional. She's very friendly,pleasant, and goes out of her way to please. Camilo (chef) is great. Food was inexpensive. Kids pool was great adult pool was ok. Housekeeping personel were lazy. If you're not out of the room by 9:00AM, your room would not be cleaned. There were bed bugs. My legs look like a connect the dots puzzle. Told front desk about issue and they supposely sent an exterimator and changed the sheets. I still got bit. Beach isn't private and its dirty. Broken glass and trash all over. Boqueron strip on other side of marina is closed during the week. Also be careful when walking from pool area to the beach/or strip over the bridge. Be wary. There is no security nor cameras in that area. Hotel doesn't even have sufficient camera's on the grounds & none in the halls.

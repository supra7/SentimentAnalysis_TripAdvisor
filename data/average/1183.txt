We booked our room through the Victoria Clipper, not knowing where to stay in Seattle. The location was awesome; the room was blah and spartan and the hotel really didn't have the character I was expecting. On the upside: It was clean and we slept well. It's an older hotel and it feels like a well-kept older hotel. No problems with noise from other rooms. It was an awesome location, and for that reason I recommend it. One elevator was being worked on when we were there, which they warned us about at check-in, and thus it never really bothered us.

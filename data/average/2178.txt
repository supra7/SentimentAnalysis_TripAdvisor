Enjoyed our stay, the room was large but lacked attention to detail (for example, clear glass doors in the bathroom were excessive and intrusive and downright dangerous in low light). Service was great as expected. Pool was nice, a bit loud, but its Vegas. Room service food was good, not great. Location was great, just a short walk or shuttle ride to the strip. Overall I would stay for business, but look for other deals if wanted 5 star luxury. Warning: I did come across a used needle in the lobby bathroom - but this is not specific to the Trump, and unfortunately not Vegas. Vegas is and should be for adults looking to party, the sight of kids in strollers may be good for business / image but with an underlying stash of used needles and seediness, please leave the kids at home.

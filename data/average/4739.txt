While this is a decent hotel, it was not in our experience one of the best Chicago has to offer. We arrived at 2:00 on a Friday, with check in being at 3:00. No rooms were available, and were told to come back at 3:00. Came back at 3:00, still no rooms? My husband was in his work clothes, after a meeting. It was a hot day, and he just wanted to shower and change. We were told they would call us in a few minutes with a room. By 4:00 still no call, so we called. Amazingly a room became available, but probably the worst in the hotel. Right next to the fitness center, and across from the elevator. Obviously we ticked someone off by actually expecting check in at check in time. Usually this is never a problem with us, just one of those days my husband really needed a room. The room had no view, was rather small with a small bathroom. Nothing spectacular. We did call to complain, forget it, no rooms until tomorrow. We were only staying two nights, and really did not feel like packing everything up after staying one night. Who knows when we would have gotten the room anyway, After we had already gone to sleep? Perhaps we were treated this way, because we got a great rate through a travelzoo promotion. I don't know. But we are Klimpton in touch members. We stayed at the Nine Zero Klimpton hotel in Boston with a travelzoo rate and were treated wonderfully, by the way. The Monaco could learn something from this sister hotel. We did enjoy the hotel restaurant, South Water Kitchen. Service was good and food, tasty and fairly priced we thought. There is also construction right in front of the entrance to the hotel/restaurant, which is a bit of a hassle.

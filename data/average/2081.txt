La Reve is a nice hotel until you check out. Everything is priced in US dollars and unless you have US dollars to pay with, you are going to pay their jacked up exchange rate. In our case it was about 15% higher. If you leave your room charges on your credit card, you are presented with a bill showing your charges in US dollars and the number of Pesos that will be charged to your credit card. If you are like us and carring Pesos, again you are stuck with the escalated exchange rate. The only way you can dodge their little scam is to pay cash with US dollars.

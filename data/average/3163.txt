I stayed 3 nights here as I attended a conference just down the road at the RAI. It has recently been refurbished in the main public areas and is contemporary and bright. However I wished afterwards that I had stayed in a hotel in the city and taken the very easy and efficient transport, or a bike to the conference. The rooms are not at the same standard as the lobby, but are moderately sized. I think the most disappointing aspect of this grey monstrous block was the service from the staff. Cold and miserably efficient.

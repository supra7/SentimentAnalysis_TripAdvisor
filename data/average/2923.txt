This is a trendy spot. It is not fancy or spacious. If anything it feels very cramped. The lobby is small and crowded. The rooms are small (and I had a suite). It worked for a business hotel because I got a really good deal and it's in Chicago where hotels get expensive. You are 2 blocks off Michigan Avenue so it's na easy walk. There are some stores nearby and you are a short walk from the Hancock tower. They have a breakfast buffet on the roof - don't bother. The service is slow and sullen (unlike most of the rest of the staff). The food is marginal. You can do better almost anywhere. Would I stay here again - maybe. If I needed a downtown hotel for $100 a night and could get this one then yes. If this hotel was at full price then no. Chicago has lots of great hotels. If you are going to spend some money on the hotel then you should avoid the Avenue and stay at one of them.

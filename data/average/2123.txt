We were at this hotel on April 23 and 24 at the beginning of the tour and again on May 3 and 4 at the end of the tour. This is a barely adequate two or three star hotel -- nothing exceptional. It has two tiny elevators that barely hold four persons each. This contributed to "luggage congestion" when the luggage for the 43 people on the tour was delivered. Our room was tiny with little space for luggage. The bathroom sink was actually in our room by the entry door. The remainder of the bathroom appeared to have been designed by an architectural student with no relevant experience. The toilet was behind a transluscent glass door that had at least a half inch of space all around with no jamb or latch. The shower was in a simalr compartment beyond the toilet, This was obviously done to minimize the space required for the bath facilities. The shower was good though. The room was hot and the central A/C was not on so we used the window to try to cool the room. Since there was no breeze, we initially had to keep the door open to provide enough cross ventilation to cool the room somewhat. The dinner on the first night was good as was the wine list . Similarly, the breakfast buffet had nice selections and was good. The location of the hotel was pretty far from the old section of Istanbul where most of the interesting sites (Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosue, Grand Bazaar, Spice market, and others) are located. It is, however, several blocks from a pedestrian-only street with many restaurants and shops. We stayed several extra days in istanbul beyond the end of the tour and taxiied over to the Apricot Hotel for the remainder of our Istanbul stay (see review of the Apricot Hotel).

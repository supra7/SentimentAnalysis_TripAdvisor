Room is nice but truly small. If youve been to the Hudson or Marcel in NYC, you know what this means. We had the Queen of Art size. The description said suitable for a cozy couplemaybe for one or two nights. We were there three nights, and even though we were out of the room doing things most of the time, it started to feel a little cramped. Go for the King room if there are two of you for more than two nights. Bathroom is nice and big enough. They could incorporate a little more shelf space without marring the design, I think. Shampoo, conditioner and soap provided. So is an ironing board and iron and fairly cozy bathrobes. Hair dryer. Room safe as well. Closet was big enough to fit clothes in without inserting at an angle, as someone below asserted. Im pretty sure I had the smallest room, so I would not worry about the closet. Yes, the air conditioning is a window unit, but it worked fine. Flat screen TV only uses that Concierge TV that unfortunately more and more hotels are using. God, I hate that. At least Hotel Max managed to have the LOCAL weather channel updates--Ive been in some places where it was the generic weather channel. Bedside CD/Clock/Radio sounded good. Annoyingly for a modern hotel, no iPod jacks anywhere (not even the TV...I tried). Look of the hotel is interesting and agreeable. Art everywhere. Street noise should not be a factor unless youre coming from extremely quiet environsthe hotel is on the not-so-noisy edge of downtown. Bar is so-so. Better to walk a few blocks to a place called Vessel for expert cocktails. Still, they allow you to take your drink into the hotel lobby if youre a guest, so that is nice and convenient. Did not eat there. I paid $172 plus tax per night and feel it was worth it. I would go back, but there are a few other places in Seattle Id like to try first.

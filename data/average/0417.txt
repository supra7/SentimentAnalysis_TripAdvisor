We recently traveled to Seattle for a short vacation and stayed at the Renaissance. I was somewhat underwhelmed. The location is pretty good; not great. It's at the top of a large, steep hill, so if you're planning on walking around Seattle, be ready to make the the climb more than once (this is coming from a person who's in pretty good shape). It is walking distance to the ferries, shopping, museums, and the Pike market, but it isn't a short walk. It is also RIGHT NEXT to the freeway, so if freeway noise bothers you at night, then this isn't the place to stay. Our room was clean and fairly comfortable, although our reservation was messed up and we ended up changing rooms to accommodate our needs, which were communicated in our original reservation. The Internet service was $13 a day, which seemed a little high. The soap / shampoo in the room was horrible. This sounds like a small thing, but we travel frequently and I try to limit what I bring, so I've started depending on whatever is provided. Normally this isn't a problem from a 4-star hotel, but this time I felt like I was showering at the Motel 6 with the no-name soap and shampoo that smelled like cheap cologne. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and the service very friendly. However, we had our 20-year-old son with us and when we sat down to order a drink near the bar one evening, they ordered us out of the area because he wasn't 21. I can understand this since Washington has a strict law, but the area was large and not easily defined as being the "the bar", we weren't familiar with the law, and they were a bit loud about the whole thing which was embarrassing to our son. Overall, I wish we had stayed somewhere else.

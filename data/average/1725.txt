Situated on a nice but small beach alongside a few other hotels and close to a shopping and restaurant area. The building is a bit austere with open air atrium "airport style" around which rooms and noise rise. Variety of pools suitable for families with young children , external areas were a bit tight when we were there as hotel was full. Reasonable size rooms but bath/wc small with separate vanity area. Sonz restaurant was very good for food quality and service, Two Swans breakfast ($30/head) buffet restaurant was also nice with ocean view and fish pools. Its an ok hotel suited for families and as we are a couple I would not use again.

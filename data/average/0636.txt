We booked 2 nights through the hotel's website, got $65/night + tax using a AAA discount. You get what you pay for, it's a no frills, low bidget place. Front desk staff was trying to help a large group when we checked in so they were a bit overwhelmed but otherwise I had no issues with them. The windows in the rooms appear to be single-paned so yes you will hear all the traffic noise outside. There was only 1 thin blanket on the bed, so we asked for a second one. The heating unit is old so it didn't work that great but it also wasn't that cold at night. The bathroom vent was LOUD, but there was a second light in the bathroom so I didn't need to hear the vent everytime the light was on. The bathtub is small and the showerhead was so low I had to bend over to wash my hair. There was maybe 6 drawers and 6 hangers so plenty of room to put away our clothes. No safe in the room but we didn't have a need for one. The iron looked new/barely used and the full-size ironing board was nice to iron clothes. Parking is $15/night and seemed secure enough, I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood at night. There is a McDonald's right across the street and a Starbucks 1 block over. We didn't eat in the restaurant since the breakfast prices looked a bit high. Depending on how much walking you want to do, most tourist attractions are within reach.

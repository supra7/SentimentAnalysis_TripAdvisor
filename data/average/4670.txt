I have now stayed twice in this hotel. This "luxury" hotels is perfectly located near Michigan Ave as well as subways and offers fine rooms. However: be aware of the fire department nearby and the cooling system on top of the telecom building across the street. One wished the rooms were better armed against the constant noise. Oh, breakfast is included in the rate but rather poor.

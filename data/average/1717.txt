This hotel in Cidra is well-hidden and has some beautiful scenery. I was there for a week, using the hotel as a base to explore Puerto Rico. I was dissapointed that I had to ask 2xs for the room to be cleaned and during the week "breakfast included" was a small ham and cheese sandwich and coffee. I am ok with continental breakfast but this was pushing it. One of the days, they forgot breakfast altogether. Also, if you are planning to sleep on the weekend, dont expect much rest with the club playing blasting music until after 4am!! The staff was professional and polite and the rooms were clean but basic....

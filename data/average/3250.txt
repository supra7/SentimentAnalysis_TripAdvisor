I chose this hotel because of the price, proximity to the McCormick place were I was attending a conference, and generally favorable ratings. Not familiar with Chicago, I was concerned about the location's safety. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and I slept very well all 4 nights I was there. It's an easy walk to the Convention Center, and I had no safety concerns (as a woman traveling alone). My only complaint is the same as others ... no in-room coffee! There is a very small family style cafe onsite for breakfast and lunch items, but no adjacent restaurants or coffee shops. The price was great -- I would stay here if I attend another conference in Chicago!

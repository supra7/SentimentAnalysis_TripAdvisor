We've stayed at the Doubletree many times. When we stayed there in July 2009, the coffee setup in the lobby provided free morning coffee. At our stay on August 21 the coffee was Starbucks at a cost of over $1.00 per cup. ( We checked the Courtyard by Marriott across the river and the coffee was still free.) I'm afraid that the Doubletree has nickled and dimed us away from them. The front desk seemed short-staffed, too. They also charge for wi-fi in the roms. What was a welcoming atmosphere has been lost to making the quick buck.

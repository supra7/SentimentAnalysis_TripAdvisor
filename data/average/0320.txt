My friend and I came to Seattle to see a concert, and this location was perfect for walking to the event. But we found the hotel to be a little run down - broken lock on window, no shower fan, had to call to get shampoo (conditioner was there) and coffee (only had bags of decaf in the room), bathroom tile lacking molding, tub crinkled when you stood in it for a shower, and just a general need for more paint and care throughout the room. Hotel staff ranged from very helpful to totally bored. This hotel has great potential, with a little bit of TLC. As is it seems expensive for what you get.

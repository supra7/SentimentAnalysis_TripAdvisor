Stayed at this hotel when it first opened as one of Maui's newest premier hotels. Stayed here again a few years ago for a vacation. Stayed here recently while attending a friend's wedding. My room/suite was not ready for early check-in as requested (never had this problem at other Hyatt properties) so we had to wait for a couple of hours, making us late to the rehearsal dinner on the other side of the island. Breakfast buffet at Swan Court is okay IF you get there before the rest of the hotel guests. The line is VERY long as this is the only breakfast option other than the "express" breakfast area down by the pool, or room service. Oh by the way, you have to sharing breakfast with birds. They fly freely between un-attended tables to help themselves to your buffet selections. Definitely NOT what I remember this place to be when it first opened nor from a previous visit. Two POSITIVE points, however: The valet and the front desk agent had impeccable customer-facing skills. Bravo! And, the guy at the bar in the pool cave was very personable. I tend to choose Hyatt first over other hotels, and I hope for better things at this property.

Stayed here after New Year's day and following day since we had tix to Seahawks game 01/02/11. We LIKED the fact that it was close to new rapid transit terminal which we chose to take to stadium. This plus we luv their complimentary cookies that they offer upon check-in. Yes, the hotel is large and somewhat dated - but the cleanliness and service is very goo d. My only blip was with a faulty magnetic door reader that prevented us from gaining access to our room. I had to trek all the way to the front-desk from out tower location (to have key re-coded) only to f ind it did not resolve issue. Frustrated - we called front desk - who called security - who called maintenance. They discovered faulty battery problem and reset. All of this resulted in out take-out food getting cold plus I lost my scarf somewhere along the way. Also, wished to have their shuttle drop us off @ transit terminal but we were told to wait - we decided to walk and it was rather cold. Saw shuttle pass us along the way ;-( Still, LIKE the location and the cookies ;-)

My stay was NOT what I expected at all. I was there for 11days & had 14 key cards. That's more than my total trip!!! Security was lax with room information on 1 of my colleagues.(her room number was left on a piece of paper in a chair in the lobby)Never knowing if I could get into my room daily was a guessing game & frustrating as EVERYtime this happened I had to go back to the lobby from the 22nd floor.(you have no courtesy phones on the floors)Needless to say some of the other colleagues experienced this same problem.Your hotel was recommended by a colleague who'd stayed earlier in the month. I changed my reservation from Embassy Suites because of her. It was a mistake.

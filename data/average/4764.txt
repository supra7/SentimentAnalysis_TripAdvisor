Was a little let down by this hotel. I LOVED the location. Right in the heart of N. Michigan Ave. and all its shopping. But the room itself was pricey for the size of the room. Stayed in the suite and it was tiny!! Furniture in the room was ancient and looked shabby too. Didn't want my guest to come up as I was a little embarrassed.

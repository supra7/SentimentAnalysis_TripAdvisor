We thought the location and the room were good but the buffet breakfast was the worst and most expensive we had in the 3 weeks we were in the U.S. Everything was lukewarm dry and tasteless the coffee poor and even the fruit ( a last resort) was under ripe and hard. Our advice is to eat breakfast out it was a Sunday and several places were offering brunch for much less than we paid. Next time we will forget the view and stay in town.

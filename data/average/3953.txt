Nice hotel in a pleasant suburb of Tokyo The Komaba is situated a little out of Tokyo, but fairly easy to access (2 stops on the underground from Shibuya - but you may need help locating the right part of the station), then 10 min walk through small streets. The hotel is the usual many-floored square box; the rooms are a little old-fashioned, but quite comfortable. Unlike many Tokyo hotels, which have frosted glass in bedrooms, we could look out of the window, and had a wonderful view of the Tokyo skyline, particularly at night. The breakfast (1000 yen, if I remember correctly) was copious and had all the elements of a good Japanese breakfast and also a western breakfast. Lunch was good too, and not expensive.The staff were pleasant, and many of them spoke English. A free English language newspaper was available in the hall.Nearby (about 10 min walk from the underground station, but in the other direction) is the very interesting crafts museum, the Mingei-kan.We thought the hotel was quite good value for money, and returned the following month for a second visit.If it's raining (which it did often during our stay), check out the umbrella park at the front entrance - very useful.

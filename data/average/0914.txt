The Westin Seattle is a great location when you want to be near all the action like Pike Market and shopping, it's really centralized. Hop on the monorail and you'll be at the city center, space needle, the emp. The hotel itself is nice, friendly concierge, smiley staff, and good room service. However I didn't consider this as a 4-star hotel. The room is clean, however is a bit dated like the carpet. Most of the surfaces are just ok, but dusty. The bathroom is not top notch, some stains on the shower curtain, and the molding of the room are fraying. We had a room on the 34th floor with a nice view. If you are into feng shui, like I was, you would find the layout of the room to be kind of strange. The bed is at a diagonal, so that seems off to me somehow. I had a nice stay but the W Seattle is better. If this Westin is 4 star, then the W Seattle should be 5, and it's not that either. I give this hotel 3.5 stars at best.

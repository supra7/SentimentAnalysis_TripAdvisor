The Titanic Taksim is an excellent hotel. The facilities are brilliant, the rooms are spacious and well finished an furnished and the shower makes it difficult to not luxuriate for just a bit longer. Further highly commended is the spa, gym and mini-Hamam in the lower levels of the property. Where the Titanic does sink, pardon the pun, is in its reception. I found the reception staff to be particularly unfriendly and less than helpful, there was a particular gentleman at reception who was incredibly impatient, so much so that we tended to avoid him. I imagined that it could be a language issue but I also take it that we were not the only English guests to stay at the Titanic. This was certainly the one issue that tainted the experience. I will be heading to Istanbul again later this month, the Titanic is still on my list of hotels to look at, I'm hoping that my experience was a fluke, but as a contingency I will not to be booking my full stay there. Overall though a good hotel in the Taksim area.

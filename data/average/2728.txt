One of the good things about this hotel is that its situated in a very good place. Chinatown is beautiful and very interesting. The hotel was also rather close to the subway and the connections were good. The staff was nice and had a great taxi service that took you to the airport driving to Newark was about 60 dollars. They also had tea for free, vending machines, and a TV area. The rooms were nice and ok size. However, they were not the cleanest Ive seen. But thats not really the reason to why I wouldnt stay here again. The reason is the itch I got from the bed. Im sure it wasnt bedbugs or anything, but Im also sure it was from the bed. I got the rash after sitting in the bed for only ten minutes and they just got worse and worse. They were mostly on my legs, but also on the arms. I think it was because of the mattress or maybe even the detergent. I should add that Im not allergic to anything and usually not even sensitive to things like that. It made the stay rather unpleasant. Another very annoying thing was the fact that the bed sheets were to small for the bed. They ended about half a meter before the bed did. It was kind of disgusting since the mattress was dirty and covered with a lot of hair from all parts of the body. I had to take one of the towels and put it down there just to cover it. Not very nice! So next time I go to New York I will look for another hotel to stay at.

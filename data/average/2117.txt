The location is perfect, in the new downtown; from the hotel, at few steps were lots of resturants, pubs and bars on small, charming streets. We had the best beer at a patio, even if a summer rain started... To get on the other side of the Bosphorus, in the historical center with the touristic sites (i.e: Haga Sofia) you need like 15 minutes using the funicular (one of the oldest..) and the tram, which is modern and not very expensive. The staff was friendly, the hotel is newly renovated.. Back to the room - one of the the worst which we ever had..small, with one chair only for the desk and the bathroom was baddd..The sink is in the room and on the left you have the toilet with door, of course, and in the righ of the sink you have the shower.. Everything was modern and new..but hey, I like my privacy, even if I am with my wife: A complete batroom with a door would beat the LCD TV screen which you have in the toilet section!

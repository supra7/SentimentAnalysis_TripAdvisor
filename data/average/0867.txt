We stayed at the Westin recently for a couple of nights, having booked the room for less than half the stock rate on hotwire. For the money the hotel was solid...the bed was comfortable and the room a decent size. The hotel is older and large, we typically stay in more modern or "boutique" style smaller properties so it was a little out of the norm for us. For the money though it was fine. Great location and half price parking if you park on your own at the garage next door...which others have mentioned is even connected by a second story covered skybridge. People mention the low showers and they are low, but certainly not the worst I've seen..being 6'5" I notice these things, they are roomy and adjustable to a certain extent, nice when both heads are used. Is this my favourite seattle hotel, no...but if you can get a good price then its nice and a good value. Just don't pay full pop...if you're going to spend that much there are far nicer options. I'd rate it more of a 3 1/2 star than a four and it's showing its age a little is all.

The Palmer House Hilton Hotel is located in downtown Chicago, a few blocks from the Willis [previously Sears] Tower and right on the L-train. It is an excellent location. The hotel is beautifully appointed, and the rooms are clean. Its amenities are expensive, though. Internet access is over $14 daily. The hotel charges for toll free calls. And parking is $36 daily. I could not get cell phone coverage in my room, so any attempt at communicating with the outside world would have cost me...unacceptable for such an expensive hotel.

On the plus side, the room was spacious and comfortable, and the staff was friendly and helpful. However, the facilities really need attention: - Desk phone in room doesn't work - Bathroom exhaust fan is extremely loud - Room door was not well sealed, therefore noise from hallway comes into the room loud and clear (including what I assume was a staff member loudly moving supplies at 4 AM) - The sole elliptical machine in the workout room doesn't work

This older hotel has undergone some recent freshening but it's still an old hotel. My Expedia discounted room was a tad larger than a closet and needed a thorough cleaning (Coke spills all over the desk and phone from several days before). Linens were first class and partially made up for the other shortcomings. Banquet dinner service for our small conference was plain awful. Food was OK but the table service was comparable to a diner. No, actually a diner might have been better. There are better lodging destinations.

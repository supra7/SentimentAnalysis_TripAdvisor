The room was very clean and very comfortable for two people. The room had two flat screen TV's plus a microwave and a nice supply of coffee and tea. The view of Harvard University and the Charles River was excellent (we were on one of the upper floors). Boston was very cold and windy when we were there, and unfortunately, the heater in the room never did seem to warm up the room. Still, the comforter on the bed was a perfect weight for sleeping. One odd thing about the hotel (or at least our room) was that the water pressure for the toilet was extremely weak...you literally had to flush several times to clear the bowl, and even then, it was never a sure thing! There was free internet access in the business center, but not in the rooms. Many other Hilton properties offer free Wi-Fi in the rooms...why is it so expensive here? The buffet breakfast ($20.00) had a wide range of items, but overall I felt it was overpriced, e.g., the scrambled eggs were cold, and the fresh fruit wasn't very ripe. We ended up driving to a McDonald's on the second morning of our stay. The location is pretty close to everything (e.g., the Harvard campus is just a few minutes by car and about a 15 to 20 minute walk on very nice sidewalks). So, in some ways, the hotel is nicely situated, but on the other hand, the property sits amongst several very busy roads on what seems to be the middle of a cloverleaf. There were no stores or restaurants in the immediate vicinity, so if you want to run out for a quick snack or whatever, it is necessary to drive. There is only one way out of the parking lot and, with the traffic, it was not easy to get out of it of by car. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, but there was a long wait at check-in and the concierge seemed to be pulling double duty at front desk. All in all, the room was comfortable, the hotel was clean, and our stay was mostly fine...just not quite as good as other Hilton properties I've stayed at in the past year.

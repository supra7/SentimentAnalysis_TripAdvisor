My family and I stayed at this hotel while visiting Dallas. We chose this location due to its quick access to midevil times and downtown Dallas. Also, we wanted a kitchen and two separate bedrooms. The location is not great because it is in a kind of dirty area. The hotel parking lot was dirty and had trash in it. The lobby was decent, but nothing special. The room was dated, but at least it had lots of room and a kitchenette. The hotel has a small pool and hot tub, which were too cold to try. We didn't spend too much time at the hotel as we were checking out the sights. PROS: -Lots of room -Great access to Dallas -Kitchenette -Good breakfast CONS: -Dated and not so clean -Noisy

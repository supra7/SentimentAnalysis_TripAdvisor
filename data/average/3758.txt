This was a pretty nice hotel minus the lizard that got into my wife's bag during the night that had her jumping around early in the morning. We went to go to Six Flags. It turned out to be pretty hot that day and after coming back to the hotel expecting a nice long hot shower it took at least five minutes for the water to get hot. It took just long enough for me to be convinced I wasn't getting a hot shower and for my blood pressure to shoot up. The breakfast was better than average and they kept putting food out all the way up until breakfast ended. The bar and restaurant were pretty good. The drinks weren't watered down and the food is reasonably priced. Be warned that there are a lot of strip clubs around this hotel, which can be a good or bad thing. I got the hotel at a pretty good discounted rate (around $70 a night). I would recommend it for the rate I got it for but not at full price. The hotel is nice but is definitely showing its age.

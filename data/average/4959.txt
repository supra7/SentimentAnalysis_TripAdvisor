Stayed at the Palmer House for a training class that was help on premise. The lobby is beautiful! Kind of a weird layout with a lounge in the middle of it but beautiful nonetheless. The check in was quick and the staff members were very polite..everything was great and then I got to my room. It was TINY! Like closet tiny! I cannot possibly stress how small it was! Then I looked at the bathroom, it was even smaller! I could use the toilet, start my shower and wash my hands in the sink at the same time! I felt like I was back in my college dorm with a better bed! I was not impressed but I was on the government's dime so I decided not to gripe. This hotel is in a great location! The red line is practically outside the front doors! There is also a nice pub right around the other side of the building that had great food and a fun atmosphere. My fellow attendees did not have the same gripes about their rooms so I assumed there rooms were not as bad as mine. This is a cool, old hotel with friendly staff, a great location, and lots of history...just make sure you don't get the tiny room :)

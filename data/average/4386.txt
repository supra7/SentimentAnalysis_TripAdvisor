I stayed at this hotel with my family in July 2010. The hotel was 5 minutes from downtown Boston, with quick access to high ways. We stayed at the bi level suite which was ok but not worth $420 a night ! Parking is not free at this hotel, and the parking card used to open the gate is not reliable. Food was not good and the hotel is very busy and noisy. Staff was helpful and the concierge was great. The air condition in our room was very bad and we complained about it a lot.

The Good: The staff in the office were very nice & welcoming. The room/bathroom were very clean upon entering the room. Pool area was nice. Breakfast was good. Hotel is set off the road, rarely heard any traffic on the strip. The Bad: Our reservation was almost mixed up with another until I realized we were looking at someone else's reservation slip. We stayed in a Family suite; neither of the sofa beds were made prior to our arrival. Housekeeping was sketchy; our trash was missed one day, a broom was left behind another. The Ugly: Dinner prices at the restaraunt. Yikes! The sofa bed were as if we were sleeping on the springs & rails.

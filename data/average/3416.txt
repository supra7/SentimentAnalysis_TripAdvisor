The hotel is conveniently located in the Changi Airport, connected with the Sky Train to the main 3 terminals. Rooms are nice, clean and the bed is really good. Sleep quality is great for an Airport hotel. The rooms are lovely decorated, the club floor is very nice with some open areas, pools and waterfalls that make it seem a tropical paradise more than a Airport. The only really bad part of the hotel is the Staff. Unhelpful, slow and they seem not to care too much. We arrived late after a late flight and we were really tired. Reception staff took very long to check us in and during the check in she went away for a long time without even saying what she was doing. Puff! simply disappeared and left us there, dead tired, waiting for her to return. We asked her what happened, and she did not even answer. Very rude. Next morning at breakfast, staff was again slow and very confused. They moved us from one table to another, but during the moving they forgot our bags on the other table, then they kept following us while we were taking the food from the buffet asking us what bags were ours. They seriously need training.

It was a beautiful one-bedroom suite, a little small but for the price a GREAT deal. The bathroom was really too small, however, and I had to call down twice for more clothes hangers. But what really got me was the $48 per day to park my car, which was not disclosed beforehand, and ended up costing as if I stayed an extra night. That said, I would stay there next time if I didn't have a car.....

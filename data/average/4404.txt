and Warm Cookies too. really nice breakfast buffet - can get a package to include it - made to order omelettes and pancakes. Dinner was awful - raw prime rib, cold soup - don;t eat in restaurant but breakfast very nice with great views. Ask for room with river view. Can get free parking in a package - ask for it. Front desk vewry nice. TVS in living room and bedroom didn;t work. Heat in bedroom didn;t work. But free coffee in room and Starbucks for charge in lobby. Very nice bed - comfy. Really in Cambridge - not really in Boston. Not a good location for Freedom Trail - have to take a car or bus to tourist things.

We stayed here for 4 nights in April. The hotel itself is fine, a typical HI, with a mediocre breakfast that was pretty crowded every morning. The location however was not great for a family of tourists. It is pretty far from the sights and we ended up taking taxis everywhere (which are plentiful and fairly easy to find. except after the FC Barcelona match). It is, however, not a bad walk to the water, but still sort of far from the tourist sights such at the Aquarium and Harbor area.

Our reservation was made several months early, but when we tried to check in we were informed that we would have 3 days in one room then have move to another for the final 4 days. The reason given was that the owner wanted it and they had priority. The whole reason to stay in a condo is to unpack and buy groceries. So on day 3 we had to pack up and check out in the morning and check back in, in the afternoon. We paid for the day but didn't even have access to a room for hours. To make things worse it took them about 45 minutes to check us in upon arrival because their computers didn't like the way they had to split the room and they were unable to override the system. Great place, might not be worth the trouble.

There are some nice things about this hotel like the gym, housekeeping(just don't ask them anything cuz none of them speak English) and location. But the most important thing is the safety of my grandchild. First I stayed on the sixth floor above the cement.One screen was torn 3/4's of the way across, the other had no screen at all meaning my one year old could easily fall out. Because they messed up my reser, on the second day I moved to my requested room on the 12th floor. Guess what no screens. My grandson was looking out the window and decided to go around the pillar. He caught his little head between the pillar and window sill, children who are larger than him could get their whole body stuck. The pool is nice and clean but if your child is not 3ft. bring swimmies or they have to sit on the step only. There are no activities for the kids or playground equip.to play on, not even on the garden floor (looked like they were only growing mulch).The breakfasts were boring and no kids meals. The prices were pretty high,cost me 13.00 for one drink at night, no entertainment so why so high? Oh yeah the business center was nice...so if you are adults only it will be a good hotel for you.

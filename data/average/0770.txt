I stayed at the Edgewater during my first stay in Seattle. At over $500/night I was expecting a water front room. Well, I got the water front, but there is a giant and very noisy barge that is currently oocuyiong the space in front of the water front rooms. If you book at this hotel, please call them first and ask whether or not the barge is there. They must be drudging or something... the noise was all day 7am to 6pm. I was able to negotiate 50% off my rate, which was great...but the whole experience was very strange. The restaurant is great...literally overhangs the waters edge with a great view of Tacoma.

The Omni Chicago is in an excellent location close to Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile. We stayed here for more than a week in July 2011 and found the location to be the best aspect of this hotel. We found our room decor to be dated and in need of refurbishment. Although our room was a suite with a separate living area and bedroom area, both areas were quite small. Even combined, both rooms were smaller than other hotel rooms where we have stayed in Chicago and elsewhere. Our room had nice views of the Chicago skyline. We had breakfast a number of times at the hotel and found the breakfast options to be generally good. This hotel has two separate elevators, one from the ground floor to the lobby, and the other from the lobby floor to room floors. Elevator capacity was often insufficient to meet demand for elevators, which meant that we at times had a long wait for one or both elevators. In general, better options are available in the Chicago both in room size and price.

The front desk staff were very nice, professional and happy people, very Westin; as I've stayed at a few of their properties. The rooms and general building were ok. The main lobby is similar to other properties (not as grand as Vancouver's). The elevators need touch up work and new carpets. The rooms are nice enough, but the bathrooms and water pressure... well it was a little like staying at a three star hotel and not a four star hotel. Parking was the highest I've ever had at a Westin - $39 USD per day... steep when I'm already paying a lot for the room. One of the main entrances is adjacent to a homeless hang out and that was intimidating on a few occasions as there could be 20-30 people hanging around. The staff make up for the less than appealing attributes (when compared with other Westin properties) - if you like Westin stay with them in Seattle, but lower your expectations on some of the usual things you'd expect from them.

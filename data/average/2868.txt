On the advice of previous TA reviews, we made sure we booked a "standard" room (through expedia). We however think we got an economy room - it was on the first floor in the main building and absolutely tiny. We even had to request for a TV receiver. The reception is noisy well into midnight and we can hear everything from our room. There were many choices at breakfast, but it lacks quantity (e.g. 6 pieces of each cold cut is hardly going to last the b/fast service). Many choices around the same area, no need to go for this.

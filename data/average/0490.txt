Arrived in Seattle after a long drive from Portland and looking for a decent hotel.This Hotel turned up.We were going to stay at the Travel lodge which was right behind the Quality Inn but they wanted $20 a night more plus $10 parking fee.We obviously went for the better deal at $100 per night and no parking fee.Stayed for 2 nights.Nice indoor pool.Hot free continental breakfast,not bad for free.We were about 1 block from the Space Needle and then a short walk to the tram to Pikes market.Takes about 7min.Room was smaller but beds did not hurt your back.Hotel has seen better days but secure and clean.Front desk was helpful and friendly.Would stay again.

Nice hotel good area just too far from where I needed to be... service was eh.... I guess it was because I didnt book directly with them (discount) I was given a room facing a beautiful brick wall.) Otherwise the room was clean and comfy .. the bed was too given the fact that I was never in the room the brick wall thing wouldve been more annoying than it was... I would go back if I could stay riverview if not I wouldnt bother I love great service and I was not getting it here. reception seemed a bit snooty..she never asked one question abou myt flight? ...first time to Chicago? The wine reception info ...nothing nada zilch...I hose to spend my $$ there and I can choose not to. There are too many hotels that are willing to give outstanding service so one will repeatedly come back. This just was not the case here!!!

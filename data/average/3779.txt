The Hotel Lawrence in Dallas Texas is a good value for the money. We stayed there to attend a meeting at the Convention Center. The Lawrence is only 3 blocks away. It was a pleasant walk in the morning and evening. The West End restaurants are only 5 blocks away. One morning it was raining, so we got the hotel shuttle to take us to the convention center. The lady driving the shuttle was prompt and courteous. The carpets in the rooms and hallways are worn and in need of replacement and the bathroom is rather small. Overall it was pretty clean and the towels are sumptuous. Bed was comfortable. Would probably stay again.

We went here for our Honeymoon. I was expecting the greatest thing ever. I have to admit the pictures were nicer that it really was. I did enjoy it - but I thought it was going to be different by the description. The room was not up to a 5 star cleanliness and the greens were slightly sad. They looked partially dead. It was a rush to get a seat by the pool. The gym was less than desirable, as someone that works out all the time it was very limited. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time its just what it was built up to be it was not.

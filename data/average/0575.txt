I loved the hotel and it's service...but I couldn't believe we had to pay for something most other less expensive and area hotels offer for free - **WIFI**, $10/day. I stayed here because it was a hotel chosen for my conference...but I wish I'd read the review in Fodor's which mentioned this one thing that would have caused me to consider other hotels. Also, only on-site parking available was valet at $33/day. Off-site a block away was $28/day but offered in-out privileges.

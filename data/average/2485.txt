If you want to hit the nightlife in River North or downtown and like a modern, hip vibe this is the hotel for you. Restaurant looked good but didn't get a chance to eat there, there is also a lounge/club on the topmost floor that can get pretty loud. The room was nice but tiny, I was told that a "comfy king" has a half wall of windows but the only window was the glass door that led to the tiny balcony. That was kind of a let down considering the photos they show on the website....but the view from the balcony was pretty decent so it was okay. So my advice would be to upgrade to the corner room with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. The bed was extremely comfortable and pillows/linens excellent. The shower is what really makes staying there worth it. Full glass shower that looks into the room and a rainfall shower head.....its like being in a spa. You could easily spend an hour taking a shower. There is plenty of room for two people too.... The hotel was loud, one night you could hear doors slamming and girls yelling and laughing, they were totally drunk. The front desk suggested a middle floor because the sounds from "Vertigo"( the lounge on the top floor) can penetrate four or five floors. When going for an early morning run on Sat morning there was a drunk chick talking on her phone unable to get into her room, pair that with laughing and yelling every couple of hours it reminded me of college dorm days. Overall a nice place, if your looking to relax though I am not willing to say it would be a good idea, people stay there to crash late at night when partying downtown

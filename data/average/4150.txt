Tower level rooms on the concierge level, the "nicest" level in the hotel, and I get to sit up til after midnight listening to my neighbors have a "conversation" then actually talk for another hour, as clearly as if they were in my room. I called the front desk and was put on hold for 5+ minutes, so I hung up and called back. Different person answered and knew exactly why I was calling. They offered to come upstairs and ask the neighbors to whisper or stop talking. Really?!?! I said no thanks. They offered to bring a fan up for "white noise". Laughable. Then they offered to move our room, though my six year old child was already sound asleep. No reparations The exclusive happy hour in the tower lounge consisted of cold cuts, veggies and dip and one kind of cookie. Again, really?! Oh, and the "marble" bathrooms advertised...plastic. Splitting, old plastic. Looks like luxury from here. And there, but once you're settled in, but if you can't sleep, what is luxury worth?

Beautiful building and great location. When I booked the room, I paid a "surcharge" of $15 for a "King Bed." Turns out that's just a "request." If one's free I can have it, if it's not, I get the smaller bed.. but they DON'T refund the request fee, or whatever it is. Great location, and knowledgeble staff.. Great restaurant and beautiful building! Small rooms, but that is Boston. I travel a lot, and am used to "nickle and diming" by big hotels -- comes with the territory. But this "room request fee" is new to me.

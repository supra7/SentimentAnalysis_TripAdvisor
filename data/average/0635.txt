We have stayed in the Sixth Avenue Inn twice in the last 9 months.....since the first time, the rooms have been updated and it is an improvement. We like the location, close to shopping, the market, and our son's condo. We can walk anywhere in Seattle. The restaurant serves a good, reasonable breakfast. It is a no frills room, but very clean, and the beds are comfortable, the shower hot. We travelled Europe last fall, and for in-city room this is as good as it gets for the price. We will return, soon.

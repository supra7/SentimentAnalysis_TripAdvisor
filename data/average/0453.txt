Nice hotel in a great location. You are within easy walking distance to all of the downtown attractions and on the same block as the theater. The rooms are nice with good appointments, and the maids were really nice. The Hilton Honors lounge was also outstanding. They served a full spread every evening and free breakfast each morning on the top floor. The hotel is a little pricey, but not out of line with the rest of downtown Seattle. The biggest problem is room size. It's fine for a couple, but don't even think about putting more than 2 people in one of these rooms. With two twin beds you can barely walk around, and the bath room is "cozy". Also, if you are taller than 5-9, you will be looking down at your shower head.

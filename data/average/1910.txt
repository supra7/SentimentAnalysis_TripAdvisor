We stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for 7 nights in July. We booked the hotel last minute and found that this was one of the only resonably priced hotels in Maui on the beach and as it had pretty good reviews on Tripadvisor, we booked up. Having read a lot of the reviews, the hotel was as I expected - the rooms are a little dated but fully functional and they contain everything you need for a beach holiday. The a/c wasn't up to much though and we relied heavily on the fan to sleep in a cool room at night. We booked a garden view room which I soon found out meant the cheapest room but actually the ones facing the pool and ocean were noisier than our room so we were very happy and slept perfectly all week! The location cannot be beaten - right on the beach, a wide stretch of sand (it's much narrower towards the Hyatt Hotel) and it's not even a 5 minute walk to Whalers Village which has a suprisingly good selection of restaurants and shops (some expensive, some cheap). The staff were friendly but we didn't take part in much of evening entertainment or hotel organised events and preferred to dine at a different restaurant every night. The only other point I would mention was that our cleaning wasn't very thorough - some days it seemed that none of the surfaces in the bedroom or bathroom were cleaned at all and all we could see that had been done was the bed been made. However, with hotel prices so high in Maui, this hotel is a good choice and provides good accommodation and location for a reasonable value.

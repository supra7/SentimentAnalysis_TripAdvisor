It seems like nobody has anything good to say about this place...It seems as if a lot of the guests had ONE problem in particular, and because of that they are writing these horrible reviews..I don't believe that one bad thing going wrong constitutes some of the bad things that I am reading. I actually live in the DFW Metroplex and had the opportunity to stay there for a Wedding and we had a great stay!! We had 8 rooms total and everyone who stayed there talked about how nice the service was, the employees were especially nice. For the money and the amenities...it was great!!! As far as to what part of town it's located in...you don't walk in any Metropolitan area alone in the United States at night by yourself anymore. The price was actually great for what we received. I would recommend the Sterling Hotel to anyone that's on a somewhat limited budget and wants to stay close to downtown Dallas but doesn't want to pay the $150-200+ per night. The Karaoke bar on Friday and Saturday nights were a BLAST!! A lot of good talent too!!!

We were very concerned almost sick about coming here with all the poor reviews and we booked through Priceline therefore there was no looking back... We were also pleasantly surprised at what we found. The lobby is beautiful, Excellent location and tons to do in the area (ww walked everywhere or the T is at the door step). the rooms are very average, but clean... YOU WANT TO TRY AND GET A RENOVATED ROOM ~ I think this is the trick at this hotel based on the reviews I've been reading. Also, the price was right for what we got! Boston is a great city and I would reco this hotel for it's location, value and overal average quality....

We have just returned from 4 nights at the Hyatt Regency Maui. This hotel is centreally located in Kaanapali & the location was perfect. It was a short drive to Lahaina & the Whalers village where there were plenty of shopping and dining options. We stayed in a Partial Ocan view room on the 19th floor in the main tower which we found dissappointing. The room overlooked a dirty large rooftop and you could only see the ocean if you stood on the tiny, windy balcony & looked over the side to the right. The room was nice however was lacking in cleanliness upon our arrival. The mini bar was covered in a thick layer of dust which was a bit off putting. Our package came with Wi-Fi however we were unable to maintan an internet connection for most of the time we were there. We did contact the IT Desk - Business centre for assistance however the staff advised us that the hotel was located in an area which had poor internet reception. We didn't dine in any of the Hyatts restaurants as the were all way overpriced. The Beach walk & Whalers Village was a favourite for us. The Whalers village provided a great variety of well priced beach front dining alternatives & lovely shopping & was only a 20 minute walk down the Beach walk. The room service was good. Of the 4 nights we were there our room was serviced every day so it was always nice to come back to a tidy room with exception to the dusy mini bar. Overall, our stay in Maui was lovely & there is plenty to see & do there. We will definitely return one day, however we did find the Hyatt dissappointing & will probably chose another hotel upon our return.

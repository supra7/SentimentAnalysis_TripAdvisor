For the most part, Holiday Inn Express is a pretty consistent chain, but this one seemed to be in the process of catching up to the rest. The breakfast room was under construction while I was there, but opened on the last day of my stay. The layout of the room was a little strange, the furniture was kind of old fashioned, but the beds were comfortable as always. Parking is also a little odd, everyone has to park behind the hotel since it also shares a lot with two other restaurants. All in all, a decent hotel, but I've had better.

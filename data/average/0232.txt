Stayed here because it got very high reviews. I prefer to pay a bit more for good service and value. The valet parking staff were very friendly and the room cleaners as well. Nothing special about the desk staff. The room we stayed in was tiny and a cramped bathroom. Reasonbly clean. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything, all words of every conversation and also you can hear others in the washroom, no details needed. When I asked for earplugs, they offered to change rooms, which I wasn't keen on doing at midnight. But he said all rooms are like this in terms of thin walls and same beds. So what is the point of moving? We stayed in the same room. Very cramped space for 2 people. Ok if alone. Parking is 29$ not 20$ as listed in the Expedia website. It was ok, but there are so many better places to stay for same or cheaper.

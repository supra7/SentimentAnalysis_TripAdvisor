I got a good deal of something little over SG$20 per night, so for me the was worth every cent. The hotel is located in Geyland Lor 10, which also has some other hotels facing, Fragrance Sapphire, Happy Hotel and Hotel Ascender ( I think that's the name?! ^^"). The area is the night area for locals, full of restaurants...karaoke bars more likely and certainly night working girls. But it didn't trouble my sleep :P. In fact, during my stay it wasn't noisy like I expected. After all for the amount I paid would be just enough for a dorm type room in hostels, but I got my own room with doubled bed and private bathroom with hot water. What could I ask for more?!

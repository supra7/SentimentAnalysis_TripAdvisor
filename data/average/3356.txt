This apartment style hotel is in a good location. It has a comfortable bed - although I found the pillow too soft -and had everything needed. . I appreciated the washing machine in the little kitchen/ laundry area. The TV had lots of good documentary channels which I like and the bathroom was more than adequate. However, due to the 4 small windows and lack of natural light or view, the room was not one where I wanted to spend a lot of time. It was good value for a 5 star hotel and I would rate it as average for this class of hotel

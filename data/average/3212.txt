I booked this through Venere because the price was good and the location was commented to be central but safe. Places in Rome can get a bit complex at times, so it was on the quieter side of town, walking distance to Colloseum, roman Forum, Trevi Fountain. Also near the Termini station for access to Vatican City. But the rooms are really, really tiny. the bathroom door opens halfway to the bed and the room was not really clean (you could see from the small closet). Staff was not friendly and somewhat to appears to ignore you by pretending not to see you. But you get that a lot in Rome.

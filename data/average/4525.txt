Avoid this hotel. The room was quiet and clean. That's the only positive. The concierge was horribly uninformed in every way. The front desk was unresponsive. The lobby is sterile and noisy. The bed was way too soft. There are no safes in the rooms. The sauna was out of order and the locker room needs an immediate overhaul. The food in the restaurant is below average. The place gives a general impression that no one is in charge. We were charged for items in the minibar that we never consumed. Extra cost for wifi. And apparently they treat their employees badly. There were pickets outside. 4 Star? No way.

I visted this hotel on a Thursday with two other family members. Check in was quick and our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner. The lobby, restautant, bar and pool looked great at this hotel. The rooms and hallways left a little more to be desired. On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle. After staying in Hilton's in Alabama and other states i was expecting more from the Hilton in Miami. The room's didnt look nearly as good as they did in other less known cities. No safe or frig in the rooms. The staff was great. They only give 2 free continental breakfast coupons no matter how many people you book in the room. I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly. Checkout was quick. I would still stay again now that I know what to expect.

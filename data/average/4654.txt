all the above reviews are right, however i would not go back its a very unpersonnal hotel, and for the price ( which are equivalent to some 4 stars ) you can find better service, in a much better and safer location, the area is bad, so bad that you can see everywhere banners hanging from balconies please clean up and make our bario gothico safer....thats what the locals want, so as a tourist there are some alleys, small street that you must avoid

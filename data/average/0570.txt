I was given a smallish corner room with two double beds--plenty for me, actually, but what I noticed is the difference between the Sheraton and other similarly rated hotels. 1. Bathroom: the usual shampoo, body wash and conditioner--no shower cap. 2. The mini bar: No refrigerator, just a small ice bucket; and a basket of overpriced goodies. 3. One of the things I look for is a whirlpool (jacuzzi, spa, whatever you want to call it). The Sheraton's did not work. I called downstairs. Someone came up and fooled around with a broken treadmill, but did not come near the spa, probably because it needs professional attention and the hotel doesn't want to spend the money. 4. In general, the service was generally very good, but the room service??? Can you believe $10 per mediocre pancake? And to add insult to injury, they charge you $3.50 to deliver it!, plus the tip.! 5. The decor is so-so, with some scribbly, slap-dash prints adorning the walls and the carpets and wallpaper just a bit shy of the standard I'd expect for this price. I'd recommend this hotel to a friend, but only if the friend were prepared to expect less for more.

I spent 3 nights in the newly opened Capital hotel and was happy with the overall service. The hotel is far from being finished and there are several signs that the work will be ongoing for some time (for example, the wireless internet is not currently available in the rooms at the time of writing though is available in the bar/lobby). The hotel staff are very professional and courteous and the catering standard is generally high. Overall the hotel is a generic business hotel. It would be suitable for leisure trips provided you had some reason to be in this area of Berlin. The location is far from being central and, while there are some shops and restaurants close by, it is not located in one of the nicer districts of Berlin. The nearest metro stop to the centre is about 500 meters from the hotel (A taxi costs about 12 euro to the centre). The hotel itself is sheltered from the main street and is very quiet (with the exception of church bells at 8 o clock every morning which are impossible to sleep through!) Rooms are decorated to a high standard, though the lack of tea or coffee making facilities are sorely lacking. There is a good selection of TV stations for the German speaker and only CNN is in english.

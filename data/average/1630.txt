My husband and I are in our twenties and stayed here for our honeymoon. The resort is beautiful and very secluded. Our room was nice but we were booked for the infinity pool and ended up having to stay in the mi hotelio room...which was not as spacious. The breakfast and lunch was delicious with different themes for lunch everyday. BUT-we were very disappointed in the dinner options. The food was not good for dinner! We ended up ordering from the LIMITED room service menu each night because we were so disappointed in our food selections. Also, if you enjoy nightlife and activities do not come here! The nightlife is non-existent! Overall we had. A quiet, romantic and memorable honeymoon but were a little disappointed and won't be planning a return trip!

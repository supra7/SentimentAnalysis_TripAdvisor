The main draw of this hotel would be price and location. It's within several blocks of the terminus of the airport train and within six blocks of the waterfront area. Pretty good location considering. This is an old hotel that has not been renovated, per se, but kept up in most regards. The staff is upbeat and helpful, although a little quirky. For example, when my key woudn't get me into the small workout room, the front desk staff advised me to tell the maintenance guy that he neeeded to rekey the door on the workout room. Then the maintenance guy told me that front desk guys really just didn't code my key right. Whatever. The workout room is a brutally uninspiring room with a total of three machines (bike, treadmill, and stairclimber). There is a pay-per laundry, which is convenient. I found the bed very comfortable and there is a small desk in the room, but it is not well outfitted for business. For example, I found only one outlet within reach of the desk. When I plugged my phone charger in a wall socket, it would fall out due to the weight of the plug. The place as been around for awhile. There's an on-site restaurant and bar, which is cozy and convenient. Don't expect fine cuisine. This is food that likely comes from some sort of premade service. Considering the range of good restaurants in walking range, I'd recommend something else based on my experience. There's a McDonald's right next door if you want cheap. Basically, this is a bland property, with not much to recommend it and not much to disparage it.

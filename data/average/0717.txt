How the Edgewater makes the cut as a four star hotel I will never understand. The rustic decor is in need of an update, the amenities aren't all that impressive and 50% of the rooms have a view of the parking lot and nothing else. If you want a view of the water you can expect to pay literally hundreds of dollars or more. The 67 lounge, however, has great food and an incredible view of Elliott Bay. The chess set in the lobby is also a very nice touch (I'm always looking for hotel's that make chess boards available to their guests). The teddy bears are pretty cool (albeit pricey), too.

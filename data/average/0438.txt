I read many of the other reviews before my first stay at this hotel. While it is true that the parking is expensive, bathrooms small and floors cold it is an older property in a large city. For me the high point was the friendly staff and location. One negative I will mention is the extremely narrow spaces in the parking garage. I was very thankful I was in a rental car as it is essentially impossible to park then open your door without hitting the vehicle next to you. On balance it is an o.k. hotel and I would stay there again but it certainly isn't anything above average.

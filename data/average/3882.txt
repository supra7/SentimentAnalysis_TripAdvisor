The Point Orlando Resort was clean and comfortable for the 2 night trip we planned to see Harry Potter World. The "suite" was a single room with a wet bar more than a kitchenette We picked this hotel because of its close proximity to Universal Studios, the breakfast option, and because it advertised it had a shuttle to the park therefore I did not rent a car for such a short trip. Unfortunately the shuttle runs once in the morning (and not even to get you there at the opening), and once at 9:30pm to bring you back. Very inconvenient for a day when the temperature feels like 110 in the shade. The breakfast was not worth the $9. Get a coffee and head somewhere else or plan to have a breakfast snack in your refrigerator. This is a condo resort so the amenities are thin at best. Pool was nice as was the bar & grill situated next to it. Although it was nice for the price we ended up spending more than expected on cab rides to eat and get back and forth to Universal than we planned.

We stayed at the Marriott Long Wharf for four nights because my husband had business in Boston. Although his convention was at the Westin, we wanted something close to the waterfront and the markets. While the hotel location is fabulous, the hotel itself is a bit "tired" looking and is in desperate need of updating. The carpets, the painting, the decorations, all look like they've been around for awhile and the hotel would dramatically improve with a more contemporary style. As it is now, I would opt for a hotel with more style.

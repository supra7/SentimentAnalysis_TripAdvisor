Stayed at this hotel from April 5 -9, 2007. I had stayed here several years ago on a business meeting and liked the location. However, this visit was over the Easter weekend so many families were staying in the hotel. As an Elite Gold member, I had requested an upgrade to the concierge floor but did not receive it, but was given key access to the lounge. Having lounge access is a great benefit at this hotel because it is open 7 days a week, unlike other Marriotts in the US. The benefit is a free breakfast and evening desserts The concierge lounge staff does a great job keeping up with the crowds that I experienced on the weekend with constant replinishing of food and cleaning of tables. One downside was that there were many unruly children who were unsupervised, particularly during the evening. Some were "skating" on skateshoes across the marble floor and others would poking their fingers in the lovely desserts offered in the lounge. No lounge staff attempted to address the situation. You would thing that there would be some rule about unattended children. The rooms were small but nicely furnished with comfortable beds. However, the noise factor through the walls in adjacent rooms and children running up and down the hallways was unbearable. Additionally, upon checkout I noticed I had a restaurant charge of $60 and had never eaten in the hotel restaurant. The front desk clerk, rather than removing immediately as has always been my experience in such charges, made me wait about 1 hour while she "looked into the situation." This is no way to treat a Marriott loyalist. She finally confirmed it was an incorrect charge.. Overall, this is a great hotel if you have children with you as they will "blend" in with the others. Being close to the Aquarium is probably the draw. However, I would not stay here again when I visit Boston.

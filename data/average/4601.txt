YOu are right downtown and close to everything. Even had a Farmer's Market with interesting and great things across the street. Hotel is over-rated at $300.00 plus per night. Wall paper coming off the wall and curtains in bathroom torn. NOT EVEN a free cup of coffee on arrival or any in your room at all. they charge excessively for everything, even the Internet when it is free at a well-known coffee shop down the street. Hotel has dog I lobby that you can walk, if so inclined.

Just arrived from a 4 night stay. It is a very good hotel, but other 5 star hotels are better. We were the only couple there, on the 2nd day another couple arrived. There is no fitness area, so there's nothing to do except use the spa. The prices of food are ridiculously expensive so I suggest you take a cab and find a good restaurant. It's a very small hotel, away from the city centre. I booked this hotel because all the other 5 star hotels were fully booked. It's nothing compared to El palace hotel, which is in the centre. Once you've experienced El Palace, you cannot enjoy your stay anywhere else. The staff was excellent at ABaC, very professional especially the breakfast blonde lady. She's amazingly genuine. Wherever you go you need to take a cab, it's 10 minutes away from the centre.

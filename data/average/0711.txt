Overall for a 4 star hotel i was disappointed. The room service was impossible. To get extra wine glasses to our room we were told it would be a 40 minute wait. So anything we needed we had to trek to the restaurant to get. We were most upset with parking. On the way in it said $43.00 valet parking. We foolishly assumed this was a one time charge and since we didn't plan on using our vehicle while we were there we decided that the $43 dollars would be fine. Upon check out we were charged $86.00 for parking!! After not having used our vehicle the entire time! That's $86.00 for 2 days!! Outrageous! When we asked the front desk about the charge they were rude stating that we should have asked about street parking, but that is often limited. The Edgewater is abusing the fact that there is no where else to park and therefore can charge big money for a service you have no choice but to use. This and the general service at the hotel left us with a bad taste in our mouths. You can do better in the same neighbourhood, shop around. NOT A 4 STAR!

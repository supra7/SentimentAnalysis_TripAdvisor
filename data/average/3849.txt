Good points: In the 'free bus zone' for easy access to the city. Clean and cheap. Restaurant strip close by. Bad points: Behind a bar and club strip so lots of noise at all hours of the night. Soft bed that sags in the middle. No climate control in room. Conclusion: I'd only stay here again if I couldnt find something else at a comparable price in the city. The street noise kept us up and if a hotel cant provide a good nights sleep then meh.

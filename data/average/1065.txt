There's a lot to recommend the W. The location is great, the bedding really comfortable, and the room design is cool. But I somehow feel like they're so busy promoting the brand that is W that they forget they're a hotel first and foremost. For example, there's an iPod dock in the room, but you have to pay for wifi ($5/hour), which seems just crazy to me in this day and age. There's also no coffee/tea in the room, and no microwave/ coffee pot so that you can make your own. So if you want some morning caffeine, which seems like a pretty basic amenity, you either have to pay about $12 for room service ($6 for the drink, plus $4 delivery, and other charges) or get dressed and head out to the Starbucks across the street. Also, the bar/restaurant downstairs is a total scene, which, depending on your point of view, is probably either really cool or kind of depressing. And the lighting in the hallways is so dark you can't even see your room number. Like another reviewer said, it's eerie, not cool. All in all, there's a lot to like at the W, but I'm not in a hurry to go back there. With the wifi/coffee situation, I felt like I was getting gouged; with the scene going on downstairs, I felt like I had to get through a club to get to my room. It's not a warm place, so to speak, and I'd rather stay somewhere where I felt cared for.

I stayed here for two nights, and found it comfortable and reasonably-priced A full buffet breakfast was included, with waffles. The room was quite pleasant, even during a spell of very cold temperatures. It was less than a five-minute drive to the car rental location at the airport, and is in easy reach of I-5 and an alternative route to downtown Seattle and Tacoma. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.

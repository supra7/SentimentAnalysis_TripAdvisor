We spent 6 days in Las Vegas and choose the Trump for various reasons. One - kitchennette, Two - sofa sleeper... my son was with us. The hotel was extremely nice but the bed was not what I expected for a hotel of this caliber. I travel a lot and the bed was not as comfortable as the "Hampton Inn". The sofa sleeper was worst. My son actually slept on it one day only. He choose to just sleep on the sofa and did not want to move to another room because we had a spectacular view of the strip. The hotel's staff was excellent, friendly and accomondating.. Because the Trump is a little off the strip there are two shuttles that take you to the strip with stops at the Wynn or Caesars Palace. This is a plus, but during the week they don't run very late (10PM & 11PM) and since things don't really get started in Vegas until sunset, this can really dampen your plans if you want to use the shuttle and not take a taxi. Most shows start at 9-10PM so you will be taking a taxi back to the hotel often. On the weekend they run until 12MN & 2AM. A little better, but not great for a 24 hour town. TIP - If you stay at the Trump, learn to ride the deuce ( public bus) to the Trump shuttle stops or walk through the mall across the street. It will save you a lot of time. I will not stay here again, because for the money I know I can get convenience and better sleep.. IF the beds were better this hotel would get a better rating..

This is a fairly new hotel and rooms, etc were good. Spacious, comfortable, quiet. Our only complaint was the food - it was terrible. We went to the Great American Grill for dinner and for starters one of the entrees ordered was not available then when the food arrived it was cold and very unappetizing. Sooo we tried breakfast the following morning - how can you mess up breakfast - well this place can. Selection was very limited - what they did have was premade and had been sitting for quite awhile. In most Hilton Garden Inns they make your hot breakfast as you order it. They were short on utensils and glasses and made no effort to get more. Do not eat here under any circumstances.

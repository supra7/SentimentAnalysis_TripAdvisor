Booked a trip room which was a small twin room with another bed in it. The entrance (as well as the photo's) to the hotel gives the impression of the place being fairly modern, but once inside its really just had a lick of paint and some false (black painted office panel) ceilings inserted. The staff were helpful and very friendly ... the location was excellent, especially as it was -6 and we didn't really want to walk far which is a major plus for this hotel. From what I could see, the hotel didn't have any facilities ... a vending machine in the soulless 'lobby' (an uninviting room with a few chairs in it) where drinks of water and coke were 2 euro's a can. The room was very cramped and had one single halogen light in the ceiling, presumably to save on electricity. There was also two small lamps, one of which didn't work. There was no iron so I borrowed one from reception ... the ironing board in the room was as much use as a chocolate teapot being about 50cm long with legs about 10cm which wouldn't enable it to stand up. I would have been fine for a midget or as a childs toy ...

At times wonderful, at times very poor. Consistently inconsistent. On the other hand, the staff were all very friendly, very helpful, and very happy. Despite holding itself out as one of the high-class all-inclusive resorts, the Tres Rios is not there yet. It may get there, but it has a lot of work to do. The quality of staff they've hired is a good start, but a lot of work has to be done to bring the entire experience up to the level they've set for themselves. For the price they charge, the quality is not yet there. Finally, despite charging a fairly high price, and billing itself as a top-of-the-line resort, I found that there were a nickel-and-dime approach was taken with many amenities, such as charging extra for certain types of wine (as in merlot vs. cabernet -- not even high-cost brands), for matches (even after you purchased a $25 cigar), etc. These small things must be changed for this resort to move into the class it thinks it's already in. That category is within reach, but there's much to do. I wish them luck, but I won't be back anytime soon.

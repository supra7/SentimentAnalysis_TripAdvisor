This hotel was in a good location and was an average Westin: great beds, friendly service, no problems with front desk, valet, or housekeeping. In other words, everything you should expect from a hotel. But for the price, it's not that great. Add to your room rate a $31 valet charge and $10 internet access, and it adds up to be a rip off. I wish I'd stayed in a budget or moderately-priced hotel. It amazes me that a city like Seattle can get away with charging so much. Over-rated.

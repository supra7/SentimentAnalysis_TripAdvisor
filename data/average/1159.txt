not for families with kids. Nice but cool front desk people. Manager very nice. spotty service. One time we were fawned over the next time ignored. If you are hip and trendy, this is the spot for you. If you are not, like us, the start with walking into a space with a topless painting is not for us. While the painting does not offend me, the 6 and 10 year old kids were stunned.

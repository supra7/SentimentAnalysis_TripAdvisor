Don't get me wrong, Secrets Maroma was a great resort, picturesque vistas, great service and beautiful beaches. I just had a little something els in mind after reading the reviews on this place. First off, if you are a foodie like the Wife and I than this is not the place. There are but 2 kitchens that 99% of the food comes from. With as many people as they need to serve there are quite a few shortcuts. Many dishes have been sitting around for hours prior to being served, only microwaved before being brought out to you. The raves on Portofino and Himitsu are way off base. I found both lacking. The World Cafe breakfast was a bright spot, with many fresh and cooked to order options. After day 4 it does not matter where you eat as they all begin to taste the same. Room service, while prompt, was just the same as you would get in any on the onsite places. The beaches were very clean as well as the pools. Service was not lacking at either as there were quite a few staff members ensuring you always had a drink. It was just too bad that if you just wanted water they would care less as no tip was expected on their part. A tip from us would be to get your pesos before stepping foot in here as the more you tip the better off you are. Just don't use the store or atm for tip money as the exchange rate is a joke and it only dispenses US dollars. The wine prices were absolutely ridiculous, with a $15US bottle of Maquez De Riscal going for $100US. Stick with the house wines. While I can see most people being satisfied 100% with this place we were not. We were expecting something much more and were let down overall with the food seeing as it is such an integral part of the experience. The best food we had was when we went into Playa Del Carmen for lunch, real cochinita pibil and panuchos rather than the microwaved, limp yucatan cuisine served at El Patio.

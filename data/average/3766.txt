Hotel is a little worn and shabby, but the receptionist Lenny was fantastic, answered all our questions, even rang round to get a table on Thanksgiving. Hotel shuttle very useful. Location of hotel is good for the historic district, but not ideal for shopping and eateries. Dart station close, are really handy.

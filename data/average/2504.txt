Not impressed with the service. We arrived at the hotel and there was no one at the very messy desk, unprofessional looking. My biggest issue with no one being at the desk is that they had not logged out of the system, this is a security issue. When the guy finally arrived, he did not apologize, he just asked if we were checking in. He checked me in to a room two doors down from the pool table and the bar, very noisy. I asked for a room change and he gave us a room on the second floor above the entrance, not the best yet better than the first one. My real issues: The body lotion bottle was empty The water bottles had been refilled with tap water The phone by the bed did not work at all The phone on the desk worked if you used the base and not the hand held unit, it started beeping in the middle of the night. The clock was unplugged, unprofessional, plug it back in and set the time, I should not have too None of these things are huge issues alone, all of them together indicates to me that they have a lousy housekeeping department. No reason for any of these issues. The hotel does look tired for a hotel that open not that long ago. For the people complaining that it is far from the City Centre, you are correct, do your homework and you would have known this, it is an airport hotel. As far as the rooms are concerned, they are exactly what they promote. You dont like modern, dont go there. The bed is low, we found it comfortable and slept well until the phone started beeping. The blackout shades are amazing, best I have ever had. The shower spacious with good water pressure. It is a loft hotel. Hard to find due to construction.

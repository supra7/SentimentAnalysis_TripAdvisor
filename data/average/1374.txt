I purchased two rooms at the Hilton through the "Name your Price" option via Priceline for a very good deal. The hotel and staff was second to none, and the beds were some of the most comfortable I have every slept on. Our room looked out to Mount Rainier, which was just spectacular. The location was perfect for commuting to and from the airport and despite the airport being just across the street I never once heard any air traffic. Our biggest negative was all the little tack-ons that this Hilton charged, whether it be for internet, parking, printing. Anything outside of your bed was extra, which was very frustrating considering lower level establishments like Quality Inn or Hampton Inn provide all this for no extra charge. I realize that we paid hundreds less through Priceline and should be happy with what we got for the price, but these charges applied to those travelers who paid the full price as well, so I must rate this as if I paid full price. Overall the hotel was a taste of luxury, and the extras are part of that taste.

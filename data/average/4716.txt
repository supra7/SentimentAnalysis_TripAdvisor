Our room was a disappointment. Our room was so small that I couldn't roll in my suitcase on wheels because the space between the bed and wall was too tight. It might have been suitable for a single business traveller for a single night, not for a couple on holiday. As well, jackhammers and road work outside all night long. Very annoying. And Red Line train is shutdown on weekends... would have been nice to have a warning. The breakfast at Cafe Atwood was very good, as well as the wine hour. Overall, I wish we had stayed somewhere else, a few miles north of the hotel, closer to the nightlife and restaurants.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel while visiting Seattle. The rooms were nice enough, clean and we had a nice view of the Space Needle. The bathroom was very small and there were not any bathrobes. Be prepared to shell out $36 bucks for parking in their self-park parking garage. Apparently this weekend was very busy for them so finding a parking spot in the garage was a little difficult and a semi truck was blocking the entrance to the self-park garage which made things a little chaotic. We also experienced unusually long lines upon check in. The front desk staff was very friendly, the valet staff seemed overwhelmed. We will probably stay at the W or Sheraton next time around.

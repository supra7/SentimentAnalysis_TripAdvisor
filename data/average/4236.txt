A well located hotel, just walk outside to the beautiful park and within minutes you are on the Freedom Trail. There is a T stop nearby for the airport and further excursions. Step inside and the lobby is beautifully presented . However the room was disappointingly average, a little dated with a strange window dressing arrangement made for collecting dust! The ensuite was clean and the king sized bed very comfy.

As a Sheraton member I have stayed at this hotel a number of times. Great location for shopping without a doubt but being a "Preferred Guest" doesn't seem to be a benefit. No late checkout, only 2 towels in the room (for 2 people), no morning newspaper, charged $3/luggage bag to store for a couple of hours and the most annoying thing is being asked to pay $11 for WiFi, which we didn't. When will hotels get the message that this is a real sticking point for travelers, especially when paying $200+ for a room. On this point alone, our next stay in Seattle won't be at the Sheraton.

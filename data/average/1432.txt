Bit surprised by some of the rapturous reviews on the site-yes, the hotel is good value for money compared to other cities around the world, but it is in no way comparable to some of the top 5 star establishments. The foyer area is rather sterile and uninviting, restaurant food is quite good but breakfast is appalling! No freshly squeezed juice (or even Tropicana for that matter!), meagre selection of pastries and the worst coffee we had in Montreal. For a city with such great restaurants it was shocking, and room service was no better. However, the coffee in the Millesme cafe was not too bad, so it's worth paying the extra and getting your morning coffee there. For a hotel that's only a year old, you can already see signs of wear and tear-our carpet in the executice suite was rather badly stained, and the room was filled with the smell of smoke, which to be fair the staff did try to rectify.The kitchen area was nice, and I'm sure that if you bring a young family it is very convenient as there was a separate shower room/toilet and a sofa bed in the livign room area. The room was spacious (as we had the most expensive room bar the penthouse suite which was not available) but it wasn't exactly kitted out luxuriously and it's obvious they used cheap materials to build everything. However, the spa is nice, gym just ok, pool area hit and miss. Breakfast sorely needs improving, and staff could be a little more knowledgeable.Also turn down needs to be until later in the day, who wants their curtains all closed at 4pm?There are a LOT of curtains!STaff were perfectly nice and the bell boys/valet service was good. ALso free internet was very useful.Not sure if I would stay here again, but possibly if we came with a small family.The area is near shops and nice department stores, but Montreal has more charming neighbourhoods.

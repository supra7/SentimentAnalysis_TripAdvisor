The staff was very friendly, the area safe & the rooms clean but in dire need of renovation. (FYI: No bar soap or lotion, just bottle on the wall and instant coffee only in the room). Maybe it was just our bed (room#631) but it was so bad that I think the bed springs are still imprinted in our backs! The view was not good (empty lot with graffitti) but it's Barcelona so we were rarely in the room. 2 blocks away is a charming street (Poblenou) that is a nice walk to the beach that leads all the way into old town. Airport is about 40 minutes away.

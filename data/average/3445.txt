This is a very modern hotel with a great swimming pool. The location is also good if you have an early morning or late arriving flight. The problem with this hotel is that they charge for everything and the service is spotty. We stayed at this hotel for a business trip for 12 nights and then again for 6 nights. The first stay was good with a newspaper every morning and a cookie or fresh fruit at night. We booked the same class of room on the second stay and only got the amenities after asking. The front desk staff seemed nice but really did nothing to correct any of the problems that we had. Also, the room rated stated breakfast for 2 but when it came time to pay they said it was only for one even though the print out that I showed them stated 2 people. I agree with previous posts that they need more tv channels.

We stopped over in Dubai as we were flying Emmirates from Bris to Glasgow. Due to the length of the transit we were put up in this hotel. I just wanted to let everyone know that it was comfortable and cleanliness was acceptable but not brilliant. The staff were ok as well, but not great. We recommend you walk a couple of blocks to the Metro and head to Down Town Dubai to see the Dubai Mall and The Burj Khalifah ( the big giant tall building thing).

Great location, just 3 minutes walk to RijksMuseum and VanGogh Museum, and shopping street. Hotel has been renovated since 6 months but big deception for paying a room at discount price of Euro 255 .- Reception very small, and often without any staff. Room really small, may be 12 sqm. All rooms on the 4th floor were of the same size. No AirConditionned . No Minibar. Very small bathroom. Tiny LCD TV. Internet working poorly. Breakfast on the lower floor, with only access by very steep stairs. Hotel a little noisy at night as facing a pub. Hotel is 3 minutes walk from CANAL BOAT stop. 3 Different boat lines (Red, Blue and Green lines). All the 3 lines are great and worth doing Very convenient to visit Amsterdam, on a get in /get out basis. Boat tickets valid on day of purchase until next day 12am. Much better to visit than the touristic boat tour leaving near train station. Great place to eat Chinese Cantonese food is ORIENTAL CITY 3 floor restaurant, near Dam Square. Restaurant is always packed but worth waiting. Great Dim Sum menu, and very efficient service.

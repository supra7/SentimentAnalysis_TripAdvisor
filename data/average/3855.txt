There's nothing wrong with this hotel. It isn't fancy, the rooms are small and the beds aren't very plush, but the location is a good one (if you want to be in Belltown, which i did) and the price is pretty good. (I say "Pretty Good" because for not very much more money i could have stayed at a 4 star downtown if i booked through one of the online booking services.) The staff were great - super helpful and friendly. I initially thought to myself that i would rather shell out a bit more money to stay at a fancier hotel, but I warmed up to the Belltown Inn. Sure, the bed was so-so, the tv was small and my room looked out at another wall, but my room also had some free snacks and beverages, a microwave in its kitchenette, and free bicycles. Seriously, the hotel has free bicycles (and locks and helmets) for use by the guests. The front desk people pointed me in the direction of a lovely bike trail along the sea and i had a wonderful sunday morning ride. That is a pretty good perk. I hadn't planned to rent a bike and probably wouldn't have spent the money to do so, but being able to go on a hassle-free ride, but splendid and the best part of my stay, So, it's not fancy, but it is affordable and full of pleasant surprises.

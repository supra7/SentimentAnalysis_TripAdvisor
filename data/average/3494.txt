I recently stayed at the Hotel Re!. Im satisfied with this hotel during my vacation. The hotel price is not too expensive if we want to compare with what we got in this hotel. Once I entered the hotel, it was so impressed to look on their retro design. I found the staffs to be fantastic and any issues about my reservations & rooms that needed addressing were rectified promptly by the front desk staff & duty manager. The location is great as it is close to Outram MRT Station and some of Singapore most popular sights, The gym & spa were also standout features of this hotel. The rooms were a bit on the small side but quite functional. Buffet breakfast could have been better but it was ok! My problems were at second night where wifi was not reliable & I was disturbed by the loud noises which had been made by the engineering staffs in the evening (8-9.30 pm). They fixed or did maintenance on hotel hallway or ceilings.It was totally unpleasant. Nothing great but not that bad either.

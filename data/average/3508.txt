This hotel is ex University student accommodation and as such the standard rooms are very compact. Not too small though, as everything fits in nicely and has been decided with both style and practicality in mind. A large, comfortable king size bed and quiet surroundings ensured an excellent night's sleep. Breakfast in the morning is a buffet affair with a number of choices, good enough to set you up for the day. Location is VERY good. I'm not sure what the other negative comments are relating to really - the MRT (underground) is 5 mins walk away down two short flights of steps and a meandering slight hill and the lovely iced drinks that can be bought in Outram MRT station from the cake shop are a good reward for the short journey. Hotel Re also runs a free shuttle into town, so you can't really go wrong. China Town is a short walk or one stop on the MRT, and it is equally easy to get to Sentosa, Orchard Row, Little India - you name it. Our shower was slightly broken when we arrived, but 10 mins after our phone call to reception the maintenance man turned up and fixed it immediately. A nice little hotel that is somewhat cheaper than the big names.

We found this hotel for a great rate ($80/night) through Quikbook.com, and it was very close to the American Airlines Center, which is where we wanted to go in Dallas. Very nice area - close to everything! It is definitely an older hotel that you can tell has been updated and renovated. It is like staying in an older house that your cool friends have decorated. haha. The parking situation was a little confusing...we paid to "valet" park (16.24 total a night) but it was only until 10pm, and our game went after that, so we just had to park on the street and they valet parked it in the morning. The beds were comfortable, although I found a hair on my pillow that was definitely not mine. The bathroom was small, but the toiletries were very nice (from B&B Works) and the shower was A-MAZING. The water bottles in the room were free, and they had free Wi-Fi. The staff at the desk were very nice and helpful. They only had one elevator, and it was incredibly slow. The stairs from the 8th floor might have been faster. They had a pretty good breakfast. It is a great place to stay if you're just looking for a nice place to sleep and you want to spend most of your time out of the room and sightseeing. But for the location and the price, this was great. I would stay here again if we needed to come to downtown Dallas.

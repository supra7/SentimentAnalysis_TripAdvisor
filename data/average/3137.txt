All in all, the hotel was not bad. I organized an event at this hotel and the service was ok; the hotel is nice and clean, also the rooms are pretty but definitely very small, especially for a 5 star. The food wasn't what I'd call excellent, but it was OK. It is within walking distance of the Taksim square and other attractions are quite close, too. I used the spa, got a massage, went to the hairdresser, all available in the hotel but just as big enough to give you a quick getaway, but not to concentrate one's vacation on. Most meeting rooms have no windows because they're underground. The service is not really excellent, staff was always nice and helpful, but I found out recently that some very expensive materials we'd been looking for the past months hasn't gone lost as expected, but ended up being somewhere in the hotel and the staff never consigned it to our hauler. But all in all it was a positive experience, and I've received support where needed, so everything went smooth.

This hotel offered great value for the money. Our travel agent attempted to book two twin rooms to accomodate our four person group, but was told there were only doubles available. Not our first choice, but I was tired of trying to find a reasonably priced hotel in a good area, and decided on this hotel on the recommendation of our AMA travel agent. When we arrived we asked again and were told there were still no twins, but they would give us two King bed rooms at the back of the hotel on the ground floor for no extra charge. We were estatic. Rooms are small, but understand that this is typical for most London budget hotels. The beds are very firm, so by the end of our 10 day stay, we were getting a bit stiff as we're used to softer mattresses. The rooms were clean, but not always consistent to the same standard each day. They could do with a checklist, to ensure that everything is done each day. Breakfast was very basic, but very well maintained and enough to get you started in the mornings. It's not a luxury hotel, so why do people expect a luxury breakfast? The staff was very friendly and always willing to help. Whenever we asked for extras, they were quick to accomodate and also quick to explain if they could not fulfill your request. Our every request was accomodated, albeit not always right away. The hotel is a reasonable 10-15 minute walk from Kentish Town Station. The tube system is great, never had any problems finding our way. I felt quite comfortable staying there and walking the area. Yes, it was noisy, but London is a noisy city and I'm not sure you could ever get away from that completely. All in all, I would recommend this as a budget hotel to other travellers.

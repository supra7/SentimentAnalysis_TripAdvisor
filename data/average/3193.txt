This hotel is very good if you are planning to stay in Rome for a few days, but not for 2 weeks. The staff there is very nice and helpful. The rooms are quite small, but everything is very clean. Be careful, because you do not have Internet everywhere in the hotel, we were a bit far from the modem decoder. The breakfast was very good although not varied and always the same (excellent cofee btw). One morning the shower was cold, but it did not bother us. In brief: excellent for those who are looking for a hotel near Termini and low prices but good quality.

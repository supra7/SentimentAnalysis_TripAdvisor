Stayed here for one night, parking was an issue especially since guests are expected to pay $27 for parking also that there's no elevator in the parking garage. When i got to the room it wasn't the cleanest, had sort of a strange smell, not to mention the towells that told tales of previous "male body fluid" stains. The white curtains had obvious brown stains on it and all in all it looked like they tried to remodel it but it's more like putting lipstick on a pig. I also heard random banging on the wall like other reviewers, sounds were speratic and random. Service was good and everyone was really nice but all and all i wouldnt go back...

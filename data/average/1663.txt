First off, chances are huge that you'll stay here for biz/conference. It's right next to the convention center, next to the also huge Marriott Marquis and Hyatt, and you really won't have to leave it during most business matters. It's also very convenient to the airport and has a great location overlooking the Bay. It's walking distance for your biz dinners/events in the Gaslamp. The rooms are blas, you can get a great view and that's about it. Not much in terms of character, but like I said, if you want character and all that jazz...simply try out other hotels in the Gaslamp. Would I stay here again? Well, after the Hyatt, Marriott and some others depending upon where my meetings are, or if I'm here for fun. If you're here for fun, don't bother. Otherwise, it fits the bill.

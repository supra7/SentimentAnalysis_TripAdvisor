This hotel needs work! It's close to the cruise port which is why we chose it. No safes, no Pay movies, no minibar or fridge. Needs updating in hallways and rooms. Pool, bar and lobby are pretty nice but not fantastic. Staff was friendly but not overly accommodating . When I asked where I could get a drink they said the Doubletree next door . Bar hours are lousy .. And sending your guests to the competition? Hmm room service was actually very good. Hotel fine for a night but not more .

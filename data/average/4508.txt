I went through Priceline and got a great deal at the Hyatt by naming my own price. It's a good hotel for crashing for the night when you are sightseeing or on bussiness. The fitness room was great and I loved the steam shower and pool! The sauna was not working. Great location to walk easily to the North End, decent room. The room was clean, comfy enough. Phone did not work. Have to pay for Wireless, so I did without.

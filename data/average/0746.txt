Contrary to many of the reviews here, our recent stay at the Edgewater was pleasantly pleasant. With all the comments on the size of the rooms, we were expecting a phone booth, but are pleased to report the room size was adequate. We got a room facing the city, and yes you can see the rail tracks but that didn't bother us much. Parking is valet only at $30 plus tax, but worth every penny as other lots in the area are iffy at best. We enjoyed the lobby fireplace and lounge area. Just kick back and stare at the water. The fact we didn't pay full fare probably enhanced our stay. $72 though PL is tough to complain.

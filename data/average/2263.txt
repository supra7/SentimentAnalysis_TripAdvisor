This is a great little budget-friendly boutique hotel. The rooms were basic but spotlessly clean, and at a very reasonable rate you get helpful amenities like free wifi and breakfast. However, I just can't recommend this hotel until the building works are finished at the neighboring property. They started promptly at 8 AM everyday (including Saturday) and were literally jackhammering on other other side of the wall from our bed. Let's face it, 8 AM isn't all that early, and we should have been getting up anyway, but it's just not a very pleasant way to start the day when you are on holiday. As I said - there are plenty of positives to this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the location is perfect for exploring the major sites, and it's great value for money! Just give it a few months until things quiet down...

Had two seperate stays at The Moore. First room was on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the Puget Sound. The room had updated furniture, bathroom fixtures and possibly new carpet. I was pleasantly surprised. I was prepared for the small and thin towels. The water pressure wasn't good and I am not that finicky. Second room had bad water pressure as well. There was music at the Theatre one night, but at least it was soothing to fall asleep too. Can't say enough about the helpful and knowledgable staff. Kudos! GREAT LOCATION!!

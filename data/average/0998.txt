We stayed in this hotel for just one night. This hotel tries very hard to be accommodating, from the friendly staff to the wine voucher they provide to guests who missed the wine tasting. But the hotel itself is old. We got two handicap rooms. They are slightly larger than regular rooms. But we looked right into the dark and ugly valley behind the hotel. Also, the chimney in the valley made a lot of noises. We had problems with the old toilets too. This is a 4 star hotel. But it felt more like a crappy 3 star.

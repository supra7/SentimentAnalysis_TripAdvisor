Folks, I stay 125+ nights a year in hotels .. below are my ratings for this property. 5 being the best rating. Diamond Member Accommodations (i.e. Lounge, Breakfast, etc) = 1; This may seem like a harsh rating but I think it is spot on. I have stayed at the Waldorf in NYC, who also doesnt have a Diamond Lounge. However for a mere price of $6, one may get an outstanding breakfast buffet. This location in comparison charges $20+ dollars. Some Hilton name brand properties even provide a free coupon to Gold and Diamond members. Lounge  Not sure why they dont have a lounge, I requested that the GM provide feedback on this one. Room = 4 - Big screen TV and clean rooms Staff = 5 Gym / Pool Facilities = 5 Location = 3 - A short taxo to most BOS attractions

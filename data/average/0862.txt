This Westin was the hub for Alaskan Cruise Ships. Many people coming in and out starting and ending their cruises. The breakfast restaurant was very small with cafeteria style service. Not enough seating for the many people trying to eat breakfast. Very crowded and hurried. The rooms, if you pay to stay on floors 31 and higher have great views. The bathrooms are quite small for 2 people to try to get ready at the same time. If you have a choice stay in the North Tower for best views.

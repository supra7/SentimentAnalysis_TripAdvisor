Our family stayed at the E.S. for one night as we were in the area for a graduation. We tried to fit our tall family with teens into the double beds but it just doesn't work, lesson learned, we need queens. Room and mattresses were nice, though. I like having a sink outside of the bathroom as well as inside when traveling with multiple people. Breakfast was very crowded, people standing in line, and those who tried to run up after 9:00 a.m. were turned away. Kids wanted to swim in the morning but it was adults only in the early morning. The hotel is now starting to charge $8 for parking, which on top of the $150 room, will keep us away (side parking lot wasn't full, btw). We don't like being "nickel and dimed" and there are better choices around.

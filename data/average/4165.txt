We booked our stay in October for a New Years weekend. My husband and I have spent New Years eve in Boston for many years and have stayed at several hotels. I chose this hotel because I was interested in something closer to Boston Common and after reading the reviews decided this was a good choice. I also decided to upgrade our room to a Tower queen which I must say was a mistake. The room and bathroom were extremely small which was very disappointing. Also the water temperature in the shower was tricky to regulate since the water knob would slip. So it was either on the cold side or very hot. My last complaint...a $12.50 per 24 hour WiFi fee!! Hotels of lesser quality offer free WiFi. On the plus side...I will say the staff were friendly and pleasant. I'm not one to complain but If I had this to do over I might have requested a room change. This was not what I imagined or expected.

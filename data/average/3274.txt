I booked this hotel through the airline package deal. It was in my price range, a 4 star hotel, the pictures looked good and it said it was close to the city center reachable by a 20 min bus ride. The reality is, it is about a 45 min bus ride to the main bus station and then from there you can hop on another bus to take you anywhere in the city center in 20 minutes. The hotel itself in my book would be about 2.5 maybe 3 stars, without seeing others to compare. The single room was small, twin bed, the walls needed to be painted, ugly orange blanket and the shades did not work properly. Now, the breakfast they provided (granted it was free) was pitiful. I had the only thing that looked good which was a bowl of corn flakes with warm milk, if you got there quick enough cold milk. There were hard pastries, warm yogurt, a fruit basket, watery scrambled eggs and what looked like a meat soup passing for a bacon product maybe. This hotel is not located in a good place. No resturants near by, only little pastry places where to shop workers maybe spoke a little english. I would not recommend this hotel because after spending 7 days in Rome as a solo traveler the bus got tired, the breakfast sucked and the hotel not in a good spot to go back to your room to put your tired feet up. I did alot, let me tell you alot, of walkig. It would have been nice to go back to your room and put your feet up. Once your back, your back. Unless you want to spend another hour on the bus to get back to the main area. The only good thing about this hotel was the friendly staff. they were nice and very helpful.

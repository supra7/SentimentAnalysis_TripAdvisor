I booked this hotel through Priceline and was worried when I saw all of the reviews here. I wouldn't spend $250 a night here but for a Priceline hotel this is pretty good. We had one of the newly renovated rooms and we asked to face away from the freeway. It was fine. The Good: -- the staff were very friendly -- the room was fine, big enough for the two of us, newer furniture and flat screen TV -- it's within walking distance of everywhere you'd want to go in downtown Seattle The Bad: -- it's pricey if you don't use Priceline -- the door to the bathroom didn't close quite right but we didn't mind and we didn't report it until we left

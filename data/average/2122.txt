I stayed at the Pera Tulip hotel, after reading some of the reviews on Trip Adviser. It is located close to the more famous Pera Palace hotel, which is closed, and over shadows the area, making it something of a building site. This is a trendy looking modern hotel, so had lots of good features, although the biggest disappointment was the room size and no views at all. I expected small, after reading the reviews but even for me, I thought the rooms were too small. I'm only just over 5 feet and still I felt cramped, given this was meant to be a 4 star hotel, and I paid a 4 star price, the lack of more spacious rooms, meant this hotel really didn't qualify for 4 stars. Everything else was fine, the staff appeared cold in the first instance, but were in fact very helpful, booking restaurants and explaining how to travel around was, never too much trouble for them. This hotel is tucked away behind the main shopping district in modern Istanbul, it was close to bars, restaurants, and shopping, although this isn't the main reason to come to Istanbul, it was well positioned. Transport to all of the main tourist attractions was easy from this location , without having to stay in the very , in- your- face, heart of the old town, so it was ideal for sight seeing. All in all I think I had an average stay in this hotel.

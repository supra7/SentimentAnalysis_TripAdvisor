The bathroom is quite unique, i.e., the shower stall has a large slab of marble as most of one wall, the toilet is auto-flush, and the door is smoked glass. That said, while we were quite comfortable, for more than two people there would simply not be enough room, two could not be in the bathroom at once, and large people simply would not fit. This is a nice, boutique hotel in a great downtown location, close to everything, not to mention buses that go everywhere (downtown is quite parking-challenged )and light rail between the airport and hotel. Hotel staff were very knowledgeable and friendly.

I'm staying at the Trump Las Vegas right now and had a good experience all day until rude concierge almost ruined my mood. We thought it'd be fun to try a buffet since we are in Vegas so my husband asked her which one she recommends. She literally rolled her eyes at us and said "I'm not really in the business to recommend buffets." Lady, I'm not usually in the business of eating buffets either, I just had dinner at Jean Georges in new york last week for no special reason other than I felt like a good meal that night so yes I am a food snob but I thought buffet is what one should try in Vegas. I thought the staff here so far was very gracious until this encounter with someone who obviously doesn't understand her job description. Even if she didn't want to come right out to name a buffet there was much more gracious way to answer our question.

Coming to the Crowne Plaza....you get the distinct feeling that this is a hotel that cannot decide whether it would like to cater to business travellers, resort travellers or simply people looking for a night stay in between flights. Here are the plus / cons for your own considerations Plus - Proximity and ease of transfers to T3 - Bed is very comfortable and pillows great - General room Cleanliness is great - Food although expensive is of great quality and served fast even during peak hours - Noise level not noticeable Cons - Very weak amenities ; cheap quality for crowne plaza standard - Tiled floor to bathroom and at entrance depicts cheapness - Room has no wardrobe and clothes are hung out at a rack close to the TV ; unsightly - Very expensive minibar items - NO air conditioning to rooms....immerse heat for people not used to the humidity Overall this is a hotel with amenities to please for a short stay and hardly one that you would reslax in...the decor suggests resort, the facilities seems catered to the business and the tiles in the room just spoils the look and makes the hotel looks cheap....as i said...this is a hotel that cannot decide...for those on short stays...who cares ? hahahah

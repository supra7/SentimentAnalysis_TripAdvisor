My business colleague and I were pleased to get this hotel at a fair price about $150/night while in Vegas on business. The hotel room and amenities were spacious and upscale. However on a closer look The Trump International began to fall apart. The room had broken drawer pulls, burnt out light bulbs, broken door stop etc. I requested the hotel manger so that he/she would be aware to let housekeeping know to address such issues...as it has to be obvious to a maid that these things were out of order. No big deal after a few phone calls they did come up and make the repairs while I was out. After a conference call the next morning we left for meetings...with our room service coffee and trays in the room...on my return the coffee cups half full were still there...but the rest was cleaned up. That evening I noticed that the TV was working intermittently as well...I did not call as I did not want to wait for maintenance. With some small attention to detail this would have been a much classier hotel. Upon check out the standard question "How was your stay?" When I responded that the issues took a little doing and that the cleaning service left something to be desired it was clear that the desk manager either did not have the ability or inclination to note the issue...not a good sign as well as no follow up from management. My fourth stay at a Trump hotel...the others were in NYC...I gave the SoHo one a pass because it was so new...but this seems to be a pattern. Definitely not a 4 star hotel.

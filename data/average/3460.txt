Location on far end of island is nice to get out of main squares, however hotel was harder to find. Staff charged us an extra 20euro per person on top of what we had booked online (for some reason I don't remember other than it was to take advantage of tourists). Stains on carpet and bathroom wasn't as immaculate as it should be. I wasn't that impressed by the value we got for how much we paid. Breakfast buffet was extensive though (should be for 20euro a person).

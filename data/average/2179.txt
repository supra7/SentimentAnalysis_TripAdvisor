Went from April 15-19 . Nice hotel , nice staff but I would not consider this a 5 star hotel! Lots of little things add up and put a damper on your stay. Great rooms awesome beds, but the train horn is REALLY LOUD!! and you can really hear the traffic even on the 55th floor. No one offered to up grade our room but the people who looked well off got their room up grade for free. We were there for 5 days no one cleaned our room , we had to run after staff for clean towels and we still had to pay the resort fee even though we never received our water or coffee and there was never room on the shuttle. The walk to the strip is not that bad though. If you can get a deal on this hotel do it ,if not pay the extra and stay at the Wynn or Encore .

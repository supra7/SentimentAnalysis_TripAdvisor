So I booked a 4 night stay at the point orlando and requested a free upgrade to a larger room for choosing their hotel over the hundreds of hotels in Orlando. The manager said no problem we can go ahead and do that for you. As you can imagine, when we got to the hotel they were magically filled to 98% capacity. The hotel never seemed to be packed with people at any point. Even at breakfast the next morning we only saw about 5 people eating breakfast. Our room was small and shared a small foyer or hallway with another room so when your neighbor comes in and out of their room you hear everything. The laundry room used by the cleaning ladies was at the end of my hall so all night long I heard what sounded like a helicoptor out side my window for 45 minutes was my guess to be the dryer going all night long. My wife and I also didn't like the area at all. It seemed runned down and of a low class. Area was also very very busy and tough to get around in. Traffic was horrible so waiting for the trollies was quite a wait somtimes. One of the reasons we booked our stay at The Point was their close proximity to Universal Studios which they offer a free shuttle to. Well their free shuttle only drops you off and picks you up early before the park opens and then well after the park closes. So in the morning you have to wait an hour and a half for the park to open and then, assuming you want to stay the whole 9 hours the park is open, you have to wait an hour and half after the park closes to be picked up. What good is that?! We canceled the rest of our stay at the Point and went back to the Buena Vista Palace located inside disney. It should serve as a red flag when you post a video on your website of a customer stating that she has appsolutely no complaints about The Point Orlando....obviously! their not going to put someone on their website listing negative complaints about their own hotel!

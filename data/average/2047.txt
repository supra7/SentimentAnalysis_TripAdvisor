I stayed here as part of a lay-over with Emirates. I stayed on the 6th floor, and the lifts were about 100m from the reception towards the back of the hotel. The hotel is located near the airport. The room was basic, but clean. The TV was a bit old with limited english channels. No tea or coffee making facilities. Toiletries were minimal (two bars of soap and two packets of shampoo). It was generally quiet, although I could hear a bit of noise from people in the corridor at night. Despite the large numbers of people checking in after being transferred from the airport, the check-in was handled efficiently. Breakfast was a bit crowded and many people were forced to share tables with strangers just to get a seat.

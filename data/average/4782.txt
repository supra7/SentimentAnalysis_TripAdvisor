I stayed in room 11-270, and was disappointed. My room was very close to the L train and I heard it all evening and in the morning. Luckily, I slept with my iPod in. I would have expected better sound proofing. Definitely ask for a room that does not face the train. The room itself was nice, as was the TV and internet access. The other amenities in the hotel were very nice. Appreciated having a Starbucks and shoe shine stand on the lower floor.

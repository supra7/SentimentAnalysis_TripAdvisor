Pros: Wonderful downtown location. Near Boston Common, Theaters and Chinatown. 2 blocks from two different T stops (train). Near the start of the Freedom Trail and several landmarks. New carpet. Coffee maker in room. Cons: Old, small rooms. Tiny bathrooms. No breakfast included, but standard at the high end hotels.

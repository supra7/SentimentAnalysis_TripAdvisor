This is an older Westin property. Towers are circular, so rooms are oddly shaped (although reasonably spacious), with noisy halls. Location is good, close to shopping and the waterfront. Elevators are slow, as most traffic is vertical. Food/drink quite overpriced, even for a downtown hotel. Electronic minibars, which often malfunctionl. Westin Heavenly Beds, comfortable for some, others find them too soft. Fintess center and indoor pool were fine. Staff were attentive. Overall, I had an adequate stay, but have stayed at better places in town at similar costs.

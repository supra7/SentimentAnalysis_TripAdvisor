We've not stayed here before, and I was a little apprehensive after reading the emphatic low reviews. Here is what I found: 1. The building is obviously not new. But it is not in bad shape. 2. The lobby is smallish and sparse, but is clean and in good repair 3. We had no problem with the desk staff 4. The elevator is small and old. We used it and had no problem. 5. The breakfast area looked newly redone. While we were there they tore up the floor and began replacing it. I asked why, as it looked new. I was told it was new, but was uneven in a couple spots (I certainly hadn't noticed) and they called the contractor back in to do it all over. This is hardly the sign of management that doesn't care. The breakfast has a waffle station, cereal, yogurt and fruit and bagels and muffins. There was plenty there for us. 6. The room we had was quite large, nice high ceilings. We liked the big new flatscreen. Also a microwave and fridge. Again, this is not a new building, but the room is clean and in good repair. Our room faced the street and the noise from the street makes it in the room pretty well. I don't know what the hotel could do about that, though. Our two beds were quite comfortable. Overall: this is a VALUE hotel, not a LUXURY hotel. That being the case, we found it to more than adequately meet our needs. Maybe those awful reviews were legit at the time, but its not what we experienced. They have new management, and it seems to be making a difference.

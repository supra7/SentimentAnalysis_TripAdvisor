The location of property was great, staff was great, very friendly and helpful, but the air conditioning didn't work efficently and effectively for a hot sunny days of July, especially the corner rooms where the sun would heat up the rooms during the day and the it took the A/C until midnight or later to cool room to be a comfortable temperture.

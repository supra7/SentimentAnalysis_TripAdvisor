My husband and I attended a convention at this hotel and although the lobby and convention rooms were quite beautiful the hotel rooms were in a bad state. The bathroom especially was so old and probably hasn't been updated in the last 50 yrs. The room was quite small and very plain with white walls and what looked like plain white bed sheets for curtains! Needless to say for the price we paid it was very disappointing for a hotel of this caliber. On the plus side we did stay on one of the higher floors and the view of Boston was beautiful.

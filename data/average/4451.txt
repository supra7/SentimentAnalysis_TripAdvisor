The good: Location, view from room, gym, pool, hot tub, service, slept soundly, clean shower The rest: Though I slept soundly, the walls were a bit thin and I could hear a what must have been a whole family chatting & playing about in the next room during the day. The toilet my room (1706) was bizarre in that it shot water back up when flushing. I had to wipe drips of dirty toilet water off the seat a couple times because of this. Then, we figured out how to flush so that only the lid got wet and not the seat, but still... That said, the bathroom was otherwise spotless. The lobby was kept freezing cold (60's?) so that I did not want to stay down there long. It was raining for most of my visit, and under such circumstances this hotel seemed like a minimalistic place to stay. Excepting the freezing lobby, benches beside the elevators, pool area and a relatively dark & expensive restaurant on the first floor, this hotel did not offer any comfortable place beyond one's own room to sit down, relax and wait out the rain.

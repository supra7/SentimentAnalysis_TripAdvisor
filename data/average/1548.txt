We had a great stay for the first 3 nights. LOVE the location in the Lower East Side. AMAZING view of the skyline from the roof. Next to the F subway, clubs, restaurants, shopping... Really great brekkie in the a.m downstairs and computers to check email. Rooms were small but super dark curtains, great shower.. everything was unbelievably wonderful until i woke up on our last a.m w/ bites on my left calf. My gf had a couple of bites on her chest as well. DAMN! We so regretted not checking even more closely than we had. Now we're cleaning the hell out of our clothes and luggage and more than a little afraid that we'll contaminate our home. Such a shame. I would've loved to given this hotel a great rating but bedbugs are pretty unforgiveable! If you come... wrap your luggage in a bag!

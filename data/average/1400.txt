This hotel is about as close as you can possibly get to a major airport -- literally a 10-minute walk to the airport. However, room was small, with poor heat/AC control, and overpriced relative to a much more spacious room that we had at the Bellevue Hilton. Would recommend only for an overnight stay for an early morning flight.

This hotel is beyootiful. Lovely rooms, lovely lobby. We enjoyed the luxury of this place, for sure, though you should be ready to hear the ELs go by at night and early morning. Here's the thing: they charge you for everything. For instance, there's no coffee in the room. You have to choose between a Starbucks at street level or expensive room service. I talked with a man who had worked in the mailroom there and you have to pay for them to hand your mail from the postman to you. Local phone calls begin at $1.50 and are .50 a minute after that, or something like that. Wireless or in-room internet access is another charge. (If you fly Southwest, you can access the business center and print your boarding pass for free.) For the kind of rack rates they charge, you'd think the Palmer House would throw in some things that are standard and free in other hotels.

This was the last hotel we stayed in on our multi-state honeymoon. We splurged and wish we'd chosen somewhere else. The bed was really, really, really comfortable, and the bathroom design and decor was nice, but those are about the only good things to say about it. Usually I'm reasonably happy with hotels, but this was such a disappointment. When you pay $180/night for a room, it should be worth it. What Went Wrong: --Reservations staff noticed we were on honeymoon and offered, pre-trip, complimentary champagne; the front desk staff forgot until two hours after we'd been in our room. --We arrived precisely at check-in time with luggage, and they wouldn't change our designated room (same price!) so we had to leave our luggage at the desk. When we returned an hour later, they hadn't delivered our luggage to our room, as promised. --Other reviewers mentioned it, but I was shocked anyway: The volume of ridiculous stuff in your room that is only accessible through paying for it. It seemed really tacky to have $50 oxygen therapy something (canisters?) - why are they shilling for that product? --I'm used to small spaces, but really. The room was ridiculously small. --Furniture was in poor condition.

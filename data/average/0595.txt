Booked a club level room for three nights for the price of two through a deal on the Starwoods website. I checked in on the weekend so obviously the lobby was very busy but service was fast & efficient, checking out during the week had no waits. The lobby has free wireless internet available & comfortable sofas/chairs. Had a room on the 33rd floor which included complimentary high speed internet; club lounge has complimentary continental breakfast of lots of varied fresh fruit, cereals, coffee & pastries; hors d'oeuvres of veggies, cheeses, small desserts & drinks in the evening. The only disappointing things were that there was bird defecation on the window & the ice bucket still had a bag of water in it. I didn't use/touch it & neither did housekeeping for 2 days. The bed of course was the best part with a great mattress & sound sleep. Otherwise it was fairly standard: hairdryer, coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee & tea, iron & ironing board, large safe that you could fit a laptop inside of, good shower. Health club/pool/hot tub: I never went in the pool or hot tub because it was always busy morning/evening & as well, lots of children/families. I did use the health club every day which consists of 4 treadmills with views of Seattle, one crosstrainer, a few bikes. My only complaint was that the room was too warm with the sun shining in & just being in a small area with a lot of people working out. You can't beat the location: a block or two away from the main shopping street (Nordstroms, Barnes & Noble, Sephora, etc), coffee places, restaurants. Also a 5 block or so quick, easy walk to Pike Market & the new Seattle Art Museum on First Ave.

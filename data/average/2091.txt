When I arrived I had a bit of trouble with the room, the door to my room wouldn't open with the key I was given so the man at reception took me to a different room which had no mattress on the bed, and finally to the room I stayed in. This meant that I'd had to go up and down two floors with my 65l backpack a couple of times which wasn't ideal but nevermind. The room was fine, TV worked, really big bathroom, comfortable bed. The shower didn't have a curtain which was a bit annoying because the spray got everywhere but other than that nothing to complain about! As a backpacker it was luxury, as a normal holidaymaker it would probably seem pretty basic.

I stayed at the W for a recent conference in Seattle. The hotel is in an okay location -- fairly central but other hotels are closer to the attractions, shopping, etc. Everything was about a 3-5 block away -- not bad but again other places were closer. My biggest complaint is that the W "vibe" is getting a little tired and not fulfilling the brand promise. The idea of a hip, cool hotel with great service and amenities seems to be lacking now...the hotel is a little worn -- furnishings and common areas are showing their age and "turning the lights down" even more is no longer able to hide it. The service was atrocious. Long wait for everything. No "whatever whenever" staff on duty, no concierge, lines too long at front desk to ask them. The rooms are comfortable albeit again a tad worn and the beds and bathrooms are nice, clean and comfortable. The lack of a clear parking solution is not good for business travelers with cars. There are so many other nice hotels in Seattle, I would try one of them before returning here again.

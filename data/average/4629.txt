I have stayed in this hotel several times and most recently in March, 2010; I love the location. but I would not stay here again---there is absolutely no room service in the wee hours, and I am a business traveller that is ready for my coffee at 5am. I am a woman who does not want to traipse the streets at that hour. I spoke with the front desk and eamailed cusotmer service but for two months my comments have been ignored. I was with male colleagues who also wanted late night food, and were equally dis-ssatisfied. If this hotel wants to attract busy business travellers, they need to modify its in room- dining to 24/7 like all other top notch hotel programs.

Hotel was clean, rooms were nicely decorated, beds were comfertable. I wouldn't pay the high prices the hotel charges for a vacation though. I was inside some of the other downtown hotels, hotels that are similar in class to the Crowne Plaza, and the other hotels were more modern and fresher looking. My biggest compliant was the doors do not go all the way to the floor, so in the morning, the hustle and bustle of the hallways will wake you well before you desire. Both mornings I was awakned well before I inteded by the housekeeping services in other rooms surrounding mine. The staff was helpful and friendly. We stayed on the Club Floor so were able to enjoy the complimentary breakfast buffet. Decent offerings- bagels, fruit, muffins, cereal and assorted beverages.

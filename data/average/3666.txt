We stayed on Americas labour day holiday so the place was very quiet. The pool has no changing room and no robe in the room but room service was quick to rectify this. The rooms are comfortable but the carpet was tired and stained so needs to be replaced. The staff were very friendly but too attentive and hovered too much. The ground floor is under refurbishment at present so the whole area is slightly makeshift but they are realistic about the issues. My tea pot was refilled with water but half the contents were in the saucer. Check in and check out was great. They charge for Internet. When will this stop?

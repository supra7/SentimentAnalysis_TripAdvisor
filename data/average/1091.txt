My husband and I drove to the Hotel Max. The streets in the downtown area of Seattle are tricky what with one way systems and a grid system that isn't quite at right angles, plus some lane restrictions and road works finally getting up to the spot where we could stop our car for the valet to park took a little time and proved stressful. The service at the hotel is very good, from the concierge to the valet and house-cleaning staff. Everyone is very friendly, courteous and professional. The room we had, an Artist King, was small to say the least. The bathroom was probably worse and almost impossible for two people to be in at the same time. The room was clean and averagely appointed. They did take pride in offering a variety of pillow shapes and densities (we had all feather/down pillows). The bed didn't offer the degree of support we are used to. Wifi service was unreliable and slow. I don't think there was an ethernet option. I would check with the concierge if I were you. There is a free business centre where presumably internet connections are more reliable and fast. My husband booked the room through a website called Booking.com. We decided to stay one more day in Seattle and my husband didn't want to move (I was desperate for more space) so I went online and found the same room with the same "freebie" (free wireless internet connection) for a bit less so do shop around for rates.

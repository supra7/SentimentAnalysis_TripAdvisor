This was a great hotel, except for one thing...the street noise. You could have put our bed on the street and there would have been no difference in the noise level. The staff was very friendly, talkative, and wonderful. The manager, not so much. Our room was warm. There is not individual room controls and when we asked to have it turned up we were told that others were cold and to check the vents. We were also charged $1.50 each day for a safe fee. The contract said we could ask at checkout to have this removed. I specifically asked at checkout and was told it would be done, but have yet to see the amoutn credited.

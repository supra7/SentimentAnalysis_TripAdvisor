We stayed at the Holiday Inn for a few nights at the start of our trip and then again for a week at the end of our trip. Overall we had a great time would definently stay there again. Room service (we ordered pancakes and bacon and eggs) was really great! Not too badly priced.. we also ate at the restaurant once or twice, wasn't the cheapest place, probably normal for a hotel restaurant, the food was also great. We liked the location of the hotel for its proximaty to Hollywood Boulevard (not too close not to far) but there was some building works going on next door which was very loud in the morning, we had that noise the first stay then stayed on the other side of the hotel the second time and had the Nth Highland Ave traffic. In all we were happy with the hotel, the staff were nice and helpful, the beds and bathroom nice, clean and comfy and the food was good. No laundry though, which was a problem.

Stayed there for one night on a business trip. At check -in the people all looked (and acted) as if they all were trainees, they took a long time, mixed up the reservations, etc. DO NOT go to the restaurant for dinner in floor 30 as the service is terrible. It is impossible to get the waiter on your table, indeed we had to stand up and go searching for him in three ocassions. They also mixed up the dishes and didn't know what belonged to whom. The food was average. The rooms are super-modern and the views are nice, but me -and one colleague sleeping in a different room- were awakened in ht emiddle of the night but a strange an unidentified sound (it was as if something had left from the night table in the room). This happened two times during the night. A final nuisance (this one minor) was that when you take a shower the bathroom really floods. I reported this when checking out and they told me they know this problem (new hotel, you know). If management trains well its people this hotel has the potential to be a super hotel. Meanwhile I would spend the next year sleeping somewhere else when I go to Madrid.

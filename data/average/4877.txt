Well, the good things first: The building is nice, the location is perfect, people were friendly. The rest was quite shabby: The room was smallish, no bar, nothing, not even a bottle of water for their esteemed hilton honors member. Internet at horrendous prices. Light switches don't work, one must press about fifteen times to get light. Not too fast, though, otherwise you switch it off directly after one of the precious few times it actually switches on. There is a safe mounted in the closet that makes it impossible to hang pants there. There is a connecting door to the adjacent room that is paper thin, and one can see light through the gap around the door. Naturally, on can also hear the neighbors breathe, or whatever biological function they might be executing. The air con does not work well, the temperature fluctuates between too cold and too hot. The closed window lets in a draft that freezes your feet, should you try to sit at the desk and work without shoes. One vending machine expects you to bring ten quarters for a bottle of mineral water, the other one at least accepts one dollar bills. No change machine, take a hike to the lobby for change if you get thirsty. Stylish, but useless sink in the bathroom: No shelf or desk space for toothbrush etc. In short: There are much better hotels in that price category in Chicago. Never again.

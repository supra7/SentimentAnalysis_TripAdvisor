Checked in room 2902 on a Friday afternoon. Check in very smooth. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was very small. Tub was a little bit dirty with some tiny hairs that were their prior to us and the tub water did not drain, we had to call maintenace. Hotel was in a good location. The beds were VERY comfy but the pillows a little bit too soft for my liking. Housekeeping was quick in response for toilet paper and towel requests and maintenance. Elevators a bit slow especially around check in or out time. The pool was much much smaller than you see on the hotel website. Employees very accomodating except for Bellmen, if you are not quick with the tip they actually ask for one. Decent hotel for the value. Be careful of the cab drivers, we had different rates to and from airports. We visited Millenium Park, Navy Pier, and Oak Street Beach (pack your own beach towel) Ate at Gino's East for Chicago Deep Dish around the corner from the hotel.. Pizza was like soup, too hot and mushy. Excellent spinach sticks though. Had the best ice cream at the ice cream shop in Millineum Park. Also ate at Weber Grill, got seated right away with reservation. Not overly impressed with this restaurant, it was good steak but I have had better. The Corner Bakery right down the street from the hotel was very very good for breakfast. Niu served Japanese, very cool atmosphere and good food. And one of my fav's was Yogurt Couture on Erie and State, a yogurt bar with every topping imaginable open til 4am on Saturday

We chose Edgewater for our New Year's Eve get-away as it offered a very nice view of the Space Needle and the fireworks display, plus was billed as an iconic Seattle landmark that catered to many celebrities such as the Beetles, Led Zeppelin, etc. Unfortunately the price value didn't match the hype; particularly for the traveling family. We had booked a family suite with a balconey and a Space Needle view. Turns out you can't have both so we obviously opted for the view but now in a smaller room, (for the same price). On site parking is by valet only and is over $40 w/tax however there is a parking garage across the street for $21/day. Close to Pike Street Market and obviously the waterfront. Close to Seattle Center, and Space Needle but quite a hill climb. On site shuttle is available but not on demand; it's by their schedule. Very expensive restaurant on site but nearby is Spaghetti Factory. No luggage carts available; all controlled by bell hops; for a fee. (Small) gift shop has a bistro but limited hours. Lobby has a western lodge theme for some reason and then store-bought posters of various rock bands over the fireplace, (none autographed by-the-way). Rooms, decor, etc. Reminded me of a Travel Lodge type inn but at a 5-star hotel price. However will say all the staff was polite and tried to be accomodating.

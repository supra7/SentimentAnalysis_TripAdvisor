Me and my my 5 friends stayed here in September, the Hotel itself inside is nice and clean and the rooms are great and good value, but this hotel is situated in the worsed area in china town, theres no decent places to eat for miles and its right next to train tracks so the trains are very loud, believe it or not though you actually become immune to the noise and after a night or so it didnt bother me! the staff are lovely here i really cant fault the hotel apart from the awful location! If you dont mind walking a good half hour to eat somewhere thats not chinese then this place will be fine! there is a subway (orange line) 2 mins from the hotel but its almost impossible to get a cab here, plus everytime we were in central manhattan and stopped a cab hardly any cab drivers knew where this was. I wouldnt go back to this hotel! id spend a little extra for something in a better area! plus china town stinks due to all the cooking :(

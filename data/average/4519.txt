I stayed here on business at special rate of about $220/night. The self-parking in the garage underneath adds about another 30/night. The hotel is a bit run-down but OK (minibar appreciated), and was about a 20-minute walk from the convention center. The lobby is one level above street level and as a result, the street entrance at night, which is on a side street, is fairly desolate. They do not have anyone working the entrance at street level at any time of day. I took a cab back both nights around 11 PM and found no one at the entrance which was a little unnerving in a big city. As a woman staying alone I'd pick another hotel next time.

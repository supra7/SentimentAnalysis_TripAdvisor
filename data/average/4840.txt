I stayed at one of the refurbished floors of the Palmer House. This hotel is a wide variety of room sizes and decors so you never know what you will get. My room was HUGE and with modern decor. I enjoyed the extra space but they forgot to update the TV to a larger model. At the end, it was impossible to watch TV from bed because of the distance. The hotel is impressive because it is in a traditional building, but it lacks in the details. This hotel is very big and it is always busy so there is not much care for personal attention to customers. I had the unfortunate experience of ordering a cup of coffee at the lobby area bar. The waitress was very unfriendly, took forever for the coffee to arrive and it was cold. Fortunately, there is a Starbucks in the premisses. Location is very good, close to many stores, but with so many hotel options in Chicago, you can certainly do better than staying at the Palmer House Hotel.

My family and I stayed here for 2 nights at the start of a Route 66 driving holiday. The hotel location in the Loop in the centre of Chicago is very good, and the decor in the lobby and main hall is impressive. The hotel was very busy when we stayed. Our main issue was at check-in where the hotel claimed not to have our booking for 2 rooms (the only hotel to have a problem out of the 10 we stayed in on our trip). After much debate and messing around we did end up with 2 rooms - one perfectly acceptable twin bed room, but the other was a very small double with just enough room to walk around the bed. The hotel was also the only one on our trip who tried to charge as twice as we had already pre-paid for the rooms - that took a long time to resolve but the duty manager at check out worked very hard to resolve this before we left. It is only fair to state that the hotel followed up on my customer satisfaction survey comments both promptly and courteously. All other aspects of the hotel service was very good.

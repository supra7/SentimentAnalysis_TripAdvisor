The grounds are indeed lovely and our room was very nice. One thing that really bothered us was the fact that upon check in the front desk told us after going into the back room for 10 minutes that she had a beautiful partial ocean view for us, but that she could upgrade us for $75.00 per night. When the bellman took us up to our room he warned us that we would not like this room. He was correct. It was the room right next to the elevator and ice machine. It was the last room in the corner overlooking the roof. What a come on to get us to upgrade! This room was dreary so of course we went back down to upgrade. She still tried to put us over the roof even after paying for the upgrade! We finally settled on a room overlooking the area where the flamingo's are. It was very pretty and the room was very clean. What tiny lanai's though. This place was pricey for what you get. For $500.00 per night+ you can get some beautiful rooms in Wailea without all the noise and confusion. The beach was gross. It was all rocky and muddy and the ppol was wall to wall chairs. We couldn't even get to the pool because there were so many chairs side by side. We took towels and went further down the beach. Swan Court was the worst meal we ate on our whole stay of three weeks on Maui. For $175.00 our food was dry and service was lacking. We don't mind paying for a great meal but that was disgusting. The other food in the hotel was great but big $$$. All in all we were glad to leave after 4 nights. Just way too zooey for us and service was quite lacking. We don't like feeling that they knew we would upgrade if they gave us a lousy room. This is not very good customer service.

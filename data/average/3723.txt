All in all, this is great value for the money. Breakfast buffet was very good. We have stayed there before and as I remember, the hospitality hour was quite nice as is the extra treat of evening cookies. We were upgraded to a queen suite but the view was awful. It was a "U" shaped arrangement where we saw only the brick wall and windows of another part of the hotel. The rooms were clean, the amenities adequate but the lighting was not good except in the bathroom. The elevators were slow and the valet parking was terrible. It took almost an hour to get our car and when we called for a bellman we were told it would take 45 minutes for someone to help us. We finally toted everything ourselves. I would recommend this hotel to a friend but not before mentioning the glitches we encountered.

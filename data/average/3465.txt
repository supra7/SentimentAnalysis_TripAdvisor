After reading all the reviews, I was expecting a bit more. Rooms was OK, although we were upgraded to a Jnr Suite, it was still not better than average. The staff is not very friendly or helpful.The restaurant was closed the entire time we stayed there, so could only have breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast was pretty average as well, loads of bread and cokes, but not a lot of variety. The bar was not that good either. For a 4* hotel, I was expecting a bar fully capable of at least making a classic cocktail such as a Margarita! This hotel is nothing more than average. Pleasant, but won't return to it again...

Given the rate compared to other SeaTeac hotels, the location is the best thing this Radisson has going for it. It is approx. 3 city blocks down the hill from the hotel shuttle waiting area at SeaTac, so if you have the energy and not too much luggage (and hopefully it's not raining), you really can walk to the Radisson faster than calling than shuttle and then waiting 10-15 minute for it. We were laughing when we got to the hotel and looked back to where the shuttle had picked us up. That's the best part. The room is nice, if your key works and you can get in the door without somebody having to fix it at 9pm. The hot tub is not maintained and, for starters, needs to be refilled. The helpfulness of the front desk people ranges from pretty helpful, or questioning a guest as to why they are asking a question about parking, to whatever. Like many big cities, service quality is random. The rooms are clean, kept clean (we stayed 3 nights, only because we prepaid), and reasonably quiet if you're away from the elevator. There are much better deals in the area that also include breakfast, if you're willing to stay a few minutes farther away. The 13 Coins restaurant next door is very expensive, even for Seattle, even for being next to an airport, and is just okay. Just find a better place to stay.

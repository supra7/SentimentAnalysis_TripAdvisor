Stayed for one night while traveling on Amtrak. The location is very good for tourists, 2 blocks from the Space Needle. Travel to the train station, downtown, and stadium area was also convenient using the monorail and bus tunnel. The hotel was undergoing some renovations during my stay so the elevator was out of service and some of the hallways were tore up. The room was a little dated and could use some work (hopefully will be addressed with the current renovations.) The lobby, pool, and breakfast areas were very nice and the continental breakfast was very good. Overall the hotel was a good deal and hopefully will be even better after renovations are complete. Next time I'm in Seattle I will stay here again.

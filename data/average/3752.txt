The hotel was acceptable. The area was very dicey. Lots of homeless, the area around DART (Dallas area rapid transit) was full of folks that looked like they had just been released from the pen. There were no police foot patrols, and frankly, I would not have walked around without a gun. Dallas, if you want this area to prosper, increase your police presence, and lighting. The hotel was basic and fine, I was kept awake all night by the traffic. Make sure to ask for a room on the quiet side if you decide to stay here. I would not recommend walking around the area at night.

In general, most of staff was courteous and helpful. Door man was not very congenial. Pearl had quite an attitude until she had fixed me some turnip greens also had coffee there every morning and it was good! That kind of broke the ice. Gift shop hours were horrendous!!! Unacceptable! The sports bar was the only hope as far as amenities goes, absolutely helped make this stay here for 9 long nights way more enjoyable! Thanks, Kim,V,Cassandra,Dana and Richard Dent! I want to give a special thanks to Bob Wood and Patrick the maintenance man! They are deserving of a bonus. Renee seemed ok until she saw us conversing with Patrick. Renee passed us and we said Patrick is helping us and then very rudely she replied "I bet he is" No props for Renee!

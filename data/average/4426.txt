The room was fine, a one bedroom suite. However, we got very tired of feeling as though we had to constantly tip everyone. The room was okay, bathroom a bit small with no exhaust fan...annoying. Very few wall plugs. And finally, VERY noisy heating system. Just 'okay' overall. Better choices in the Back Bay.

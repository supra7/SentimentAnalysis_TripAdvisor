Stayed 3 nights for business. Recd a smaller 2nd floor room facing an inner courtyard. This was sold to me as "quiet" ... But I find interior facing rooms to be very dispiriting. 2nd floor also houses the gym (tiny) and parts of the restaurant... So not too desirable. Room was cleanish, but still showed age, particularly in bathroom. Toilet did not work well and required me to open it up and jiggle to stop running. Shower also dated and not super clean. Soap and shampoo dispensers are also a cost saving measure I don't really appreciate. On the upside, hotel staff were very friendly. Wireless was fast and free, and I liked the loaner bikes available. Location is pretty good w respect to most parts of downtown. Tulio, restaurant on site is good.

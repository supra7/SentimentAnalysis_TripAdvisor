With a recent multi million dollar renovation, the copley square hotel, missed an important mark. The old musty smell of the place was never alleviated. When the front desk was notified of this problem, a staff member zipped up to our room with an air purifier, leading us to believe that we were not the only patrons in the hotel with this problem. Luckily we were out and about. Great location, great bar ( $2.00 Kobe sliders on Mon-Thurs), good valet service. But the smell.

Stayed there March 2006, had double room on 6th floor at the back away from traffic noise which was clean and fresh, large clean bathroom with plenty of hot water and good shower. Short walk from Darling Harbour and central railway station. Even walking distance to Harbour Bridge. Plenty of shops and places to eat nearby. Paddy's Market 2 mins.

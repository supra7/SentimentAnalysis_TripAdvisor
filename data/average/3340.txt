I always think it helps to know who writes these reviews - so, here I go: I am a woman in mid-30's and traveled w/ two friends (one male, one female). The female and I shared a room and the male had his own room. We travel a lot for work and stay at Hilton and Marriott hotels. The Barcelo Raval was super cool, modern and unique, which we loved. The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable, we were comfortable. The hotel is not in the best location - it is a short walk from Las Ramblas (the main street for tourists) which is great, however I would not have felt safe walking by myself at night - if you are with a friend, it's perfectly fine. And, I'm a city girl - I live in D.C., travel by myself to a lot of places, etc. And, although the room looked cool - it wasn't very functional - the shower door is all glass and is right by the sink and there is no door to this area, so if you are modest, it's hard for two people to get ready at the same time - if one needs to use a sink. Of course were on vacation, so there was no need to rush through our morning routine - just wanted to point that out. The toilet is through a separate door, not near the sink. We got one set of towels that were dirty - I'm sure it was just a mistake. And, when we asked for new towels - it took us three asks to get them. Once again, we were on vacation and it wasn't the end of the world - just a little annoying. There was free Internet - that was a big plus! And, so was the rooftop bar - a beautiful view of the city. Overall, I feel we got what we paid for - which is good. And, if I were to return to Barcelona, I would not be the slightest bit upset if I stayed here again, I would just prefer to find something else.

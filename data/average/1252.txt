This hotel is so handy for us to use. However, I will more than likely look for another hotel (and ther are several in this area) next time we are here.. Most of the hotel has been updated except where you eat. That definately needs it. We were shocked that this hotel is now taking on the attitude of the airlines and charging for everying. I am used to paying for parking in downtown locations; ie Seattle, DC, etc. However Tukwila, Washington ??? We complained and received 2 nights waived out of 4. The other major complaint is the heat in the room. We could not turn it down enough and were forced to open windows, thus listening to the train noise from 100 yards away for 4 nights. Our toilet did not flush properly, so my husband, the plumber lifted the lid to find a washrag in there??? They fixed this immediately and I thank them. This hotel is loosing its spark.

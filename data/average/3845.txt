The Belltown Inn was good for the price we payed, great location walking distance to mostly everything and surrounded by great dinning and bars. I would recommend this hotel for people on a budget. We picked the Belltown Inn because we wanted to see the city and not spend much time in the room.The room was small but in general the hotel was pretty clean and the staff was friendly.

This was our second stay at World Quest Orlando. Our first stay here a year ago was more pleasant than the second. The place is nice enough and the 3-bedroom condo has plenty of room. They have a free continental breakfast but it is the same everyday. Also there is no water to drink or ice at breakfast. The pool was dirty the entire week and was never cleaned during our stay, it was spotless during our stay a year ago. I reserved months ahead of time and asked for a room close to the pool in building 1 or 2. We got building 3 and were as far from the pool as possible in building pool having a pond view. The cleaning crew does a good job when you can get them to come to your room. There were several days I had to call multiple times to the front desk to ask for the service because housekeeping didn't come by that day. I did get hurt while in a public area at the hotel and it was the hotel's fault. The manager took over 30 minutes to come and see me and then demanded I fill out an incident report, when I just wanted to return to my room and lay down. She treated me as if I was a nuisance and it was my fault I was nearby when something broke. I wasn't offered ice for the rapidly swelling bruise or anything, my husband ran to the bar by the pool and got ice for me. Very rude. All in all, we might return someday but only if we couldn't find somwhere better first.

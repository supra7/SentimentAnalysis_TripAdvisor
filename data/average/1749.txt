I have stayed numerous times at various Hyatt properties and Maui property is lacking. It is currently undergoing a several month renovation and I would not recommend staying here until after it is complete. The daytime hours are filled with construction lose, dust and scaffolding. Views are blocked, no penguins on the grounds, alternate entrance and bad odor at west entrance from parking lot where you descend into a musty tunnel to access main hotel. Common areas, carpets and facilities are dated, worn and in need of replacement. Staff is unaware of changes when asked. I asked about where to get coffee in am and they gave me wrong hours and were not sure where the coffee bar was. I will definitely look at other options in future.

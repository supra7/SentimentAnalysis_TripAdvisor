We went to Montreal for a long weekend without children. Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location - convenient to fantastic restaurants, Old Montreal and shopping. The hotel offers valet parking, which was helpful since we drove to Montreal. We stayed in a junior suite - small bedroom, small living room, galley kitchen. The decor was minimalist - clean, but not sumptuous. The bathroom was large, but not elegant. However, the shower was great. Hotel Le Crystal has two problems - the food and the spa. Service and staff are extremely attentive, but the food was the worst that we had in the city. Also, at least when we were there, the spa treatments are a waste of money. The young girls are friendly and talkative, but the massage left much to be desired. If we were to go to Montreal again, we would choose a different hotel.

I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and a day. I was travelling through Dallas and had a transit at DFW. But i wanted to meet a few of my friends also in Dallas so wanted to stay for a day and then meet them before and travel out. I booked this place through my travel agent itself who booked my whole itenarary. Only condition i had was that the hotel was close to airport (infact with in airport premises) This was a good fitment and was economical too. The Hotel arranges for Airport Pickup and Drop Shuttles and with advance notice they even arrange for Cabs early in the morning. The hotel is walking distance from Pizza Hut and a Chinese place. But they are on expensive side. If u r looking for a Mac D or a Subway they are long away. Though i did not have any issue as my friends visited me and i moved with them. Nothing much to stay except its economical considering it to be close to the airport....

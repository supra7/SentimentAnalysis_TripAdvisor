If you like loud music for breakfast with your cold egg and bacon then the Barcelo Raval is for you. the bedrooms have a alarm flashing light in the celing which keeps you awake all night and if that doesn't then the street noise and noise from neighbours will . (due to thin walls) The rooms were very clean with comfortable beds, flat screen TV's coffee/ tea facilities and a lovely power shower. The front desk staff helpful and polite. We wouldn't stay here again, I like something more peaceful especialy over breakfast.

We arrived a bit early and our room was not yet ready and so the person at the desk stated that we could leave our bag in their storage room. When we returned to the front desk to check into room approxiamtely 4 hours later, we noticed our bag was still sitting in the hotel lobby- this was strange, but since nothing was missing from the bag we didn't worry about it . The room was nice, clean and appeared orderly. Compact, but who needs a large room anyway? The shower did not drain properly and we mentioned it to the front desk when we were checking out. We had paid for the room through one of the on-line services and so it was determined at check out that we did not need to pay anything, but when I received my credit card bill I received a charge for my stay, plus I received a charge for taking something from the honor bar, which did not occur. Trying to get that sorted out has been a bit difficult. Overall, the stay was fine, but it is the after affects that leaves me with less than steller comments about the hotel.

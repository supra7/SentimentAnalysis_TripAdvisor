The facility as a whole is nice, but this place needs to pay attention to the details. It's located on the northern side of downtown Miami, about a $20 ride from Miami beach. The general area is not well serviced....very few restaurants in walking distance. The restaurant has a lot of safe food, the service was very bad when I stayed....usually went more than 20 minutes between servicing. Don't pay for the wifi....it can't seem to handle the demand in the evenings and constantly times out. The rooms are large and have nice views, but lack safes, mini-fridges, and the TVs are very poor (movie service wasn't working when I stayed and the remote is really unresponsive). The non-restaurant staff was very friendly and competent.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Kudos to the housekeeping staff. Housekeeping was very responsive. The room was comfortable, however, the shower needed renovation. The opening was so warped because of moisture that it was hard to close the door. There was black stain all around the bottom half of the shower door. There was a mildew smell that permeated the entire room that seem to come from the bathroom. A suggestion - have the housekeeping staff check that the lamps in the room are in working order as well as the electrical outlet in the bathroom before each check-in.

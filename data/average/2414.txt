I stayed at this hotel one night (May 3) and found it perfectly acceptable, if not quite as nice as some other Residence Inn properties. Contrary to the experiences of other reviewers, my room was clean and in good repair. This made all of the difference in the world. Perhaps management has taken earlier criticism to heart. It also was quiet during my stay. However, signs at check-in informed guests that they were not to host "keggers" in their rooms, so I gather that the noisy, hard-drinking party crowd may frequent the place on week-ends. Also, the prominently-marked SUV for Residence Inn security was highly visible during my staff, with the guard driving from one parking area to another. That may say a lot, but there were absolutely no problems of any kind during my stay. Front desk check-in was efficient, but cold to neutral, as though the staff really would have liked to have been somewhere else, but tried to hide it (unsuccessfully). Two surprises: the room rate included not only "free" drinks and dinner, but also a "free" dinner entree (shrimp primavera pasta); and a fairly complete (and "free") breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, oatmail, coffee, juice, bagels, pastries, etc. There is a computer and printer in an alcove just off the lobby, which I found to be convenient for checking e-mails and for printing my boarding pass.

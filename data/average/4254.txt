10 years ago I stayed at the Park Plaza for a convention and we complained about non-working elevators, room that were way too hot, the inability to keep a window open, and that this would be an awesome hotel with a couple of minor tweaks. Needless to say, the owners didn't listen to a thing we had to say. I stayed for a weekend for a different convention in Boston. The location of the Park Plaza makes it perfect for getting anywhere in town and the price is very reasonable. However, the hot and stuffy rooms are unbearable. We literally had to turn the heating system off because the A/C never came on. When we tried to crack a window open, it was so heavy that only I could do it and it would not stay open. So bleeding 2-4 min of hot air out of the room was the most I could manage at any time. The hotel used to have a back passage way to get to Au Bon Pon but they have now blocked that off with a restaurant that leaves much to be desired. Basic food that is overpriced. All in all, this could be a great bargain for Boston if you could only get a not so humid night of sleep.

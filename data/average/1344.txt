Stayed one night. Called to request a room in a quiet part of the hotel but was told that because it was booked through Priceline, we pretty much don't have a right to make any requests. Sure enough our room was on the second floor by the ice machine. Spotty wifi. Restaurant was overpriced. Nice enough property but wouldn't pay published rates for a room here. (Stayed at the Osaka Hilton the next night...they do it differently there, don't they? Excellent 2 nights there!)

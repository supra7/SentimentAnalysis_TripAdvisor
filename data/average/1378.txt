I thought Radisson hotels were reasonable good. If this property is an indication then I have to say they aren't too good after all. The hotel is a little run down with paint peeling, the elevator is positively asthmatic, the rooms have a strange layout. Luckily the beds are very comfortable so my short stay wasn't too bad. I used the little bar to get a substandard glass of red wine served by a surly young man. There's a lot of choice nearby, next time I'll be taking it.

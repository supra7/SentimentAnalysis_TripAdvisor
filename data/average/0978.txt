We booked the standard room, the least costly of the three choices. The room was fine, clean and quiet, but had a bit of wear. We arrived late and were up early the next morning, so the room was fine, but if staying longer and wanting a more modern room, spend the extra and ask to be in the newer wing. The AC worked well, but was a bit loud.

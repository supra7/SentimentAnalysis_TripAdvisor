Have stayed in several hotels in this immediate area over the last few years. This one was oikay, but OUR ROOM WAS REALLY TINY plus the wifi was a VERY poor signal. Had a lot of trouble getting connected & staying connected. Finally got them to re-boot their routers, but still VERY poor signal. Breakfast was pretty good: Texas-shaped waffles, bagels, toast, cereal, plenty of good coffee. Front desk staff personable and caring. Ready to fulfill requests in a prompt and courteous manner. Everything clean - housekeeping staff friendly.

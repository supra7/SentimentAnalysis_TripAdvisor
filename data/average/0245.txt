My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower Park for the first two nights of our Seattle/Portland trip last August. We were attracted to the property for its central location and moderate prices. Although we preferred other hotels on our 10-day trip, we were overall pleased with our stay at the Mayflower Park. For the rates we paid, it was a decent value for downtown Seattle. The location truly is the best selling feature of the hotel. We were able to easily walk to all the major downtown attractions, even the Space Needle. The attached mall with the monorail stop, was a great convenience. Pike Place is a short downhill jaunt and the fabulous Tom Douglas eateries are scattered throughout the area (Palace Kitchen and Dahlia Lounge/Bakery are not to be missed). The front desk was staffed by friendly, attentive service professionals. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. We had a mixed experience with the doormen/bellmen/valet staff that lounge in the entrance. Doors were opened and held sporadically and conversations among the bellmen apparently took priority over guest service. Yes, the elevators are slow, but this was nothing we had a problem with. We had a king size corner room with couch and side chair seating area on the 9th floor. We had no issues with street noise, and enjoyed the view of the city. The room was a perfectly comfortable for two. The bed could have been a bit more plush. The mattress was just okay and could be due for replacement. The bathroom was a good size and was tucked around the corner, giving the room a nice layout and a break from cookie-cutter, chain hotels. I really admire the work that was done to save a preserve this historic property. However, the entire place needs a cosmetic freshening. The brass dcor and linens feel solidly late 80s/early 90s. A total overhaul isnt necessary, just an upgrade in bedding and furniture.

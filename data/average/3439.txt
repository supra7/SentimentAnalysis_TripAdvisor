This hotel is just way too much money for what it is. Its price is not suitable for an airport hotel. The hotel was really dead- as were the restaurants- and it will have to lower it's prices if it wants to be competitive. I will not return. The carpet in my room for really filthy with lots of different hairs so it is had not been thoroughly vacuumed in a while. Not good enough. I was hoping to enjoy room service after a long flight but, again, the prices were just too high so I walked into Terminal 3 for dinner. Better to find a hotel nearby.

There are many things to like about this hotel and a family with young kids looking for a weekend base camp with a free breakfast may enjoy the place. It cetainly wasn't terrible but a business traveler might think twice, especially if paying full rate. There was a nice desk in my room and another smaller vanity in the bedroom. The front room smelled a little of smoke. The beds were terribly soft. I woke up with a bad bachache. Thermostat was hit and miss for controlling a/c and heat. VERY HARSH fluorescent lighting (which is strange given that soft white fluorescent lights bulbs cost the same). Toliet seat broken. Soap dish coming off in the shower. Wi-Fi is expensively extra -- $10/day. Parking is tough -- you could actually park at the Courtyard next door and be closer to the door. Breakfast was chaotic -- they need to have someone there just to guide people. This is not to say that the Embassy Suites is a horror chamber -- it isn't but there needs to be more attenton to things and a competitive spirit (everyone else is free WiFi).

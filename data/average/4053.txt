This is actually the second time I've stayed here, this time was for my bachelorette party. The Marriott most definitely has VERY comfortable beds and pillows, so I was happy when we pulled up in front of it (I didn't know where we were going.) The rooms are nice, although smaller than an average hotel room. One of our rooms (we had 2 adjoining) smelled like it used to be a smoking room, it definitely didn't smell nice. The bathrooms are VERY SMALL and VERY outdated : ( It took forever to check in. There was no line and it still probably took a good 15 minutes to get our rooms assigned. I love that there's a sports bar, a Starbucks and that the hotel is directly connected to the Prudential. It's in a great location. If it wasn't for the small bathrooms, this place would be the perfect place to stay in Boston. They were very nice to let us check out at 1pm instead of noon, so we could go grab lunch before dragging our things back to the cars. Valet service was prompt on a Sunday at 1pm as well.

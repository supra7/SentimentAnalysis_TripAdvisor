This hotel should come with a health warning "beware of the bars at the rear of the hotel" We were not expecting perfect silence in Istanbul but having to sleep with ear plugs to try and block out 3am clubs is a bit much. The hotel staff are aware of the issue and were good enough to move us to the front of the hotel for our last night. Other than the noise factor the hotel is in a good location and has good facilities for a hotel of its size. One thing is that the breakfast could be better as it is clear they have cut corners on produce where possible.

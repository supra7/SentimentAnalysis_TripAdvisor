On Feb. 16th we checked in around 5:30 p.m. at The Edgewater Hotel. It has been afew years since we have stayed, but have been to many weddings and receptions. As a retired couple we go to Seattle about once a month, and usually enjoy the excellent service and location of The Roosevelt Hotel. We decided to try The Edgewater again as we had enjoyed our stays in the past. Regretably, we will not be returning , or be able to recommend the hotel to family & friends. Upon checking in we were assigned a Cityview Deluxe Room, which we had reserved. However, we didn't realize we had one of three of the worst rooms due to the proximity of the railroad tracks. Upon hearing a train every 5-10 minutes I saw the complimentary earplugs on the fireplace and knew we were in for a long night. My fears became reality as I wore the ear plugs, and still didn't get any sleep due to the crossing sounds and never ending trains. Waking up extrememly tired I made coffee and turned one of the mugs over to use to find it dirty with particles of food stuck to the sides,,(I have pictures of the mug), upon seeing that disgusting mug it made me question the cleanliness of the entire room, decided to forget the coffee. As it was chilly we tryed for two hours to get the fireplace working, which had worked the previous night, to no avail. The pilot light was on, but the fireplace would not come on manually or using the thermostat. For a Hotel of high reputation we were sadly disappointed at our experience this time at The Edgewater. Since we are retired, we travel extensively and expect more from a 5 Star Hotel. Also, our bill which was delivered to the room was wrong, however, the front desk attendant remedied that at check-out. Leaving frustrated and tired we probably will not be returning when we have enjoyed so many other properties with no issues.

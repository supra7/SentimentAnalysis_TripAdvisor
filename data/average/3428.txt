I deceided to use this hotel after a flight cancellation in Singapore. I rang through from the terminal information to ask if a room was available and they said yes. I arrived at reception only to be told that the room wasnow not available. After complaining to the manager a room mysteriously appeared. I was then sold a joint breakfast and internet package. I then spent 30-40 mins onto the tech support trying to get the internet connection up and running with no success. I complained to the manager again who then informed that the internet had a problem in the hotel for the last few days! So why did they not tell me this on arrival! Appology was very poor! This is very unusual for Singapore! Check out queues also bad with 5-6 deepe and only 2 out of six desks open. Overall poor service. I took this hotel to save time on going into town but ended up loosing more time in poor service.. I am amazed that a business hotel has such poor Internet! No Wifi in the rooms only cable that did not work!

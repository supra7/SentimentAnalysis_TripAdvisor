Beautifully restored grand lobby. Lovely staff. Clean (though room was dark most of the day and needed lights on...and so narrow that room service delivery person had to angle self and juggle tray to get between bed and TV to deposit food on the desk...) and nice towels and toiletries. Good water pressure. That's the good news. I and a colleague on a different floor experienced the same noise issue: someone having a perfectly normal conversation on their phone in the room next door sounded like they were in my room. Not yelling. Just talking. Bizarre that sound would carry so fully between rooms. (No adjoining door either.) The big issue for me is that a conference venue hotel with all the pretensions of gradeur that the PHH has, doesn't have WIFI in the rooms. There is a plug for a computer. Low speed at $14.95 plus tax per day or $19.95 for high speed. I travel with my iPad, so I was out of luck. The front desk has "a few" wireless network boxes that you can try to borrow. They had none during my stay. The lobby has some wireless on a pay by the hour basis. I didn't use it, but others did. If you forego the internet connectivity, you can do online check in for your departing flight and print your boarding pass at the main floor UPS Store which serves as their business centre.

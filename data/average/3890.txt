We stayed in a one bedroom, it was spacious and clean, and a great deal. Our only flag to throw up for future guests is that the sofa bed is completely unuseable. I had this before, but thought perhaps that person ws just extra picky, but no - our son actually closed it back up and tried sleeping on it as a sofa, but even that was too short for him. So, if you have a family of more than 2 people, then get a room bigger than a one-bedroom. Only other thing is that we requested a cab to the park as shuttle is not a convenient time, and they did not confirm with us and cab was ordered for wrong time.

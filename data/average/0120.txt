I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The hotel has a great location within walking distance to everything. The outside is pretty old and rundown looking but they have free parking. We were lucky enough to get room 109 which is the only one in this hotel that has a kitchen in it. The rooms are 1980's and could really use a redo. The bathroom had no plugs so I had to do my hair in the kitchen. The hotel is right on an alley so it is loud if you sleep with the windows opened. I felt safe and if you get over the place being a little older you will enjoy your stay. Wasn't bad and wasn't great. The rooms are really small and we actually got some giggles on how run down the place was. If you are looking for a cheap place and want what you pay for this is it. I read reviews before going and we didn't run into any drug dealers, prostitutes, or fleas so that was good.

It was an okay place to stay. I was in a single room that was very small and a little cramped but clean enough. The breakfast was basic. Beware of pre-paying for this hotel through online agencies... There was another couple that had to fully pay for their stay again. Reception also was very reluctant to help me with a prepaid transfer I had organised with them but finallly after an argument they followed up. Wifi was not working at the time.

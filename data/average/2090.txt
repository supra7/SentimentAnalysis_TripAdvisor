Its not the Ritz but for the money you cant really complain. We paid 42.50 a night including breakfast and parking. Its a bit of pot luck which room you get but our room was fine. Breakfast is cereals, toast, ham, cheese jam and tea / coffee. Its a 2 min walk to Finsbury park station and its close to a tesco express and other food outlets which is handy. The staff were helpful and I would stay there again. It is very basic but fine if you want a few days in London.

I was in town for business staying at theWit, but when I tried to extened my stay, because my husband was joining me, they were sold out. We worked to find a hotel to move to that was within walking distance of everything...and was reasonably priced. The Hampton Inn & Suites - Chicago River North met both of these requirements. The location is great and the rooms were clean and comfortable. I would especially like to thank the front desk clerk Yanelli, who always greeted us with a smile and helpful information. Upon check-in my husband discussed his concerns regarding the fire station being one block away...and the noise that that may cause. Yanelli brought out a map of the hotel and explained that the double-double rooms on the back-side of the hotel are the quietest, however the view is not as nice. The king rooms are on the main street where it is a bit noisier. We decided to give up our king room and take a double-double. It was a great decision for us and we appreciated that Yanelli gave us the choice. Every time we came to the front desk for guidance or information, we either saw Yanelli's happy face or the nice gentlemen that works with her. I can't forget to mention the staff working the room where the breakfast buffet is served. They took their job seriously, yet they were also very friendly, happy and accommodating. The complimentary breakfast was a nice treat that we had not expected and it really came in handy when we were in a hurry to eat and run. Oh, and speaking of food, the hotel is actually one block away from three of the restaurants run by Rick Bayless, from the Food Network. (OMG-the food is fantastic-reservations needed) Hampton Inn & Suites - Chicago River North is doing something right! From: The Gomez's

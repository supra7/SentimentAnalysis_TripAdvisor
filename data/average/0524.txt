I loved the decor; the privacy; the view. I did not like the check in and check out which was long and line up format. There was a way to do it via phone. But I forgot to inquire beforehand. The other complaint is parking. $43 and some change per night. I thought it was awful! The most I have ever paid especially when you could park down the road for $6. Otherwise this hotel is a great location. A short walk to Pike's Place. Amongst all the shopping.

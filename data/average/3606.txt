The manager is trying to make this hotel better..The desk staff is not helpfull..I expect a property of this size and look to have people who care about what package and rate plan your on..I had to ask the front desk how was I supposed to get my included breakfast...She hadn't even thought about it...I also found out that I had to pay for parking!There was no mention of this when I booked and no way to find this out previous to booking..I rechecked this...I mentioned this to the manager and he gave me no explanation why this is the policy of the hotel to have hidden charges..The hotel's room carpet needed some cleaning but basically it was clean and a nice room..Wifi cost extra... nice bed and nice breakfast buffet...I think there are better value places....look around...

My wife and I spent a weekend at Hotel Max and felt it was a very good value for Seattle but a less than comfortable stay. The hotel is funky in a cold,dark ,hard-surfaced way. The decor has a rock-star orientation that doesn't invite one to linger. Rooms are minimalist; small but adequate. Bathrooms are among the smallest we've encountered (including Europe, trains, and small cruise ships) and are a challenge to maneuver in. This is not a hotel for a rainy day inside. Hotel Max is a good choice for the value conscious. Clean, adequate service and a great location - close to downtown shopping, many restaurants, the Convention Center, and the Monorail and new streetcar lines. A long walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Pioneer Square and the sports stadiums are, realistically, a cab ride away. Parking is pricey, but that seems to be the norm for downtown hotels in most large cities. We would recommend it for business, a shopping trip etc., but not as a romantic getaway or a place to lay back and relax. Fortunately Seattle has a great downtown so you would most likely not rely on the hotel for anything more than the basics.

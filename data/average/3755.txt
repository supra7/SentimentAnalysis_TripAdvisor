First off - I need to say that Marriott is my chain of choice, and this stay won't change that decision - I might even choose this property again if in downtown Dallas. Four things bothered me: - The lady that checked me in was snotty and didn't acknowledge my Marriott Elite status (protocol for any chain). - AC/Heater. I asked the from desk to have maintenance look at it twice because the thermostat wasn't working correctly - it was either roasting hot or ice cold. Maintenance did look at the unit, but it wasn't fixed during my stay. - Valet parking is ridiculous at $18 per night. Take my advice and pay the $6 to park across the street. True there's no in/out privlege, but you're in the west end and can walk or train anywhere downtown. - The oatmeal at breakfast was too soupy for my taste. I know this is really picky, but all the other Marriott's have the right oatmeal mixing ration figured out. Pluses: - Location - Price - Clean

After reading the reviews, both good and bad, we decided that the sun-thurs deal was too good to pass up. The price is great and the location is awesome but we still won't stay here again. The check in time is 3:00 and when we got there is was 3:00. There was a lot of people in the lobby waiting for rooms and seemed very irritated. This gave me a clue what we were in for. People were coming to the desk saying they got the wrong rooms as they had doubles when they booked queens. The staff repeatedly stated that the beds were queens. We had to wait for 45 min till our room was available. The desk staff wasn't even apologetic in any way. Our room was laid out weird and so small with two "queens". These beds were the smallest queens I have ever seen. I think some of the rooms may be decent and we just got stuck with a bad one. The housekeeping staff would leave doors open as they cleaned them so we could look inside as we were walking past. Some of these rooms looked really good compared to ours. One actually had a large flat screen tv. The inner door to our room would shake like someone was trying the door whenever someone would walk by. This got very annoying when trying to sleep. My husband put socks in the door so stop the rattling. The housekeeping staff was very thorough and was polite when passing in hallways. The head of housekeeping was not polite and seemed abrupt with the staff in front of patrons of the hotel. Yes, the price is good and the location is unbeatable, so if you can put up with a cramped, noisy room with not great customer service, then this hotel is for you.

I landed a room for here for $65 on Priceline for a Friday evening stay....I see that some have gotten rooms even cheaper. Pretty nice airport hotel....standard Hilton. Housekeeping seemed to be a little slack....there was an empty wine glass sitting in the hallway across from our room when we checked in, and it was still there the next morning when we checked out. The toilet in our room was also clogged when we arrived. Otherwise.....no problems. Nice comfy beds and good linens.....quiet place, even though our room fronted on Pacific Hwy. The $18 ($20 with tax!) parking is pretty outrageous, but they do have a 24 hour shuttle to sea-tac if you can avoid bringing a car.

Stayed here for 2 nights on business in November. Check in was a bit of a faff....... arrived at 2.55pm and was barked at that unless I stood and waited I woud be charged 10 to check in early so "I will be back in 6 mins to let you check in for free" hmmmm ok!!! Check in was very smooth to be honest but got to my room on the second floor to be met with my heating up full blast and this was when the temp outside was 15 degrees!! luckily could then change it to air-con as window was screwed shut. 2 Lifts in hotel and one of these when down on my first night there and was still out of order when I left which made for long waits as more than often housekeeping held the lift at a certain floor!! Breakfast was ok as most people on the run and there was a good variety - free WIFI in bar area which was great!!! I would stay here again if on business but wouldn't take my children here if we were in London.

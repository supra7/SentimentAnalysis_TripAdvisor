I loved this hotel; the service was great; they accomodated by request for an early checkin and checkout with no problem. When the first room was located on a noisy corner they moved me as soon as they had another room. The only faults I found was that the bathrooms are very small. It is impossible for someone like me (6'4") to take a shower without bumping into the faucet control and the amenities shelf and the shower curtain wants to envelope you when the water is turned on. Once outside the shower there is barely room to turn around, when you sit on the toilet your legs stick under the sink....very small. Even in European hostels I have not seen bathrooms this small. I am sure they have room with bigger bathrooms and I would definately ask for that when making a reservation. The only other thing I found is that it could have been a little cleaner and upkept. In the first room, the carpet was fraying and in the second the bathroom wall had soap and water spots on it. Make sure you get a package with free wifi; I had difficulty connecting on the first day but then it was fine for the rest of the trip.

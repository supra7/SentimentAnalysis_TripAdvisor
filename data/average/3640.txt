I stayed at this hotel for three nights (March 17, 18, 19, 2006) while I was in Dallas for the NCAA Basketball Tournament. I selected this hotel because it was close to the American Airlines Center where the games were being played. The rooms were clean and well maintained. I found that the comments from a previous posted about no places to eat close by to be correct. The breakfast area very nice and well stocked, including the usual juice, coffee, pastries, cereal, and waffles. The only negatives, (excluding the weather which caused major flooding problems in the Dallas Area) is the conference room sits right off the lobby/registration area, and both Friday and Saturday nights there were rather large and loud parties being held there which was a little distracting when trying to check in. There is very limited parking for this hotel especially when there are events going on in the conference room. Finally they advertise wireless Internet, which is almost non-existent in many of the rooms. I couldn't connect in my room on the second floor and but was able to connect in the breakfast area. I would stay here again but would probably look around before returning

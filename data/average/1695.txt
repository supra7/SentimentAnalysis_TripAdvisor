I find it hard to delineate all of these 4-star hotels...the lobbies are just different variations of the same style of decor, the rooms all blend together in my memory, and they all ream you on parking (here it's about $25/night). So, my ratings reflect just those things that pop out. I used Priceline once again...I'm a local and it's the only way I stay in the Gaslamp since I know there is an abundance of rooms in 4-star hotels (as long as Comic Con or a holiday is not happening). I got the two beds per room as I requested, but no adjoining rooms were available. They treated me respectably considering I only paid $95 per room for two rooms....sometimes that's not the case with hotels and their Priceline customers. The reason for the 3-stars is because of specific location and overall feel. Yes, the hotel has great views, but location is a lot more important to me since I don't spend a lot of time in my room...and, when I'm in it, I'm not spending a lot of time gazing out the window. It's just outside of the Gaslamp district, across and a ways up Harbor Drive...a taxi is required to get to all the restaurants and clubs. Unless you're a maniac. When you've got 6 women, that adds to the overall cost. Also, the place just felt deserted...even of staff...and a bit cold.

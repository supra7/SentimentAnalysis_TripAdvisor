Where do I start? First of all, the Mi Hotelito is under construction and the smaller pool is closed. So, although we were upgraded to a nicer room, all the rooms are all on the edge of the big pool which can be very loud, especially when there are ten drunk Texans yelling to each other from room to pool and back. It was never possible to keep the door to our deck open because people were always shouting to each other at the pool. We tried to order the "24 hour" room service, were not able to locate a menu so called the front desk. We never got the menu, so ordered some snacks from room service. After waiting an hour, we still did not get our food. Speaking of food, the term "gourmet" is used very loosely here. The Itialian restaurant was good, but the Asian restaurant serves only one piece of sushi at a time and it does not look anything like the food on the website. The staff is very friendly, the resort is clean, but there is a definite nasty odor on the beach. Combined with the intoxicated Texans, it is difficult to relax anywhere in this resort. Do not waste your time snorkeling with the marina next door, they take you to a 90% dead reef and a small cenote that is really nothing to see.

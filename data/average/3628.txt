This hotel is an old Ramada. They have replaced the carpet/drapes/bed/chairs recently so the furnishings aren't dated. Some of the furnishings look like they've been refinished but not replaced. The mirrors in the bathroom were losing their reflective surface around the edges. The refurb job brings this hotel up to two star standards - do not mistake this for a luxury hotel, but it's not a dump either. If you can get in here around $59-69/night you'll get your money's worth. Check-in is fairly easy and the lobby is well kept. The rooms could use some brighter lights, especially the bathroom. The marquee out front says high speed internet access, but I didn't find anything in the room, but you can get 52.4 on a dialup - not bad for a hotel.

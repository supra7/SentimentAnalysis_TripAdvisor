The historic Palmer House has undergone a beautiful renovation, but it's hard to change the size of the rooms. Our king was so small, we could barely move around. The bathroom was good for one person only, and that's if you kept the door open. Finally, the walls seemed paper thin. I would go back, but only if I made very sure what room I was getting and where it was located. The staff was great!

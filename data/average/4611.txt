My husband and I showed up a day early for a little leisure before a business conference. We checked in and quickly requested a different room as the first one was extremely musty smelling. It was on the first floor overlooking Copley Plaza. We sacrificed the view and a bit more roominess for a back hall room that smelled better on the top floor. We faced another building. Oh well. This room at least smelled like they put some type of fabric softener sheet in the vent. I suppose in a hotel of this age, maybe they can't get rid of the smells, but I don't remember the Plaza smelling like that in New York. Our new room's bathroom was the size of a closet. I'm NOT kidding. The tissue box cover was metal and sat atop the back of the toilet, which was slanted toward the bowl. So, you guessed it, the tissue box was forever falling on the toilet lid. There's no place to put your toiletries, no counter at all. The closet was so small, the two of us could not get all our clothes in it for a four day trip. Not much drawer space either. Anyway, it irks me to be asked to pay for internet access and coffee when the room rate is over $200 a night. (There is a Starbucks at the Westin across the street and a Panera .8 miles away.) The desk staff are quite inattentive. Just a so-so place for quite a pretty penny. Just enjoy a walk through the lobby, and then keep walking.

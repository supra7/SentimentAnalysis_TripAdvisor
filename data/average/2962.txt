My fiance and I spent one night here using our reward pionts before boarding a cruise the next day. The hotel was quaint, in a quiet area of Barcelona. It is two blocks from the train station so it has easy access to all the different areas of Barcelona. They had a great complimentary breakfast which was a nice touch. The bed was quite hard, which made for an average night sleep. I would not sleep here for more than one or two nights max. The bathroom was clean, though extremely small. If you are taking a cruise, this hotel is about a 40 euro taxi ride from the terminal. This is good information as I thought I was a bit closer to the terminal by staying at this hotel, but I was incorrect. The great thing of this hotel is they are very accomodating, and they let you keep your luggage in their storage room if you need to. Overall, good hotel for short stays.

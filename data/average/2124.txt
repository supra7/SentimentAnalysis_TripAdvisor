This hotel is in a great location, right near Taksim Square. From Taksim Square, there is a multitude of transport to take one into other part of Istanbul and it's all very cheap. The hotel itself was nice, very modern. However, it was noisy (our room was right beside the elevator), the spa facilities such as steam room and sauna didn't work and everything was very small, including the room. The bathroom was really small. It was clean and we got the room for a decent rate as it was low season, however, I wouldn't pay high season prices for the room we had.

I've stayed here on numerous occasions while traveling on business. The room is somewhat small but comfortable. The restaurant and the lobby bar were about average for their service and a bit pricey. The free Internet access is nice compared to other hotels around that location. There is a StarBucks right on location. The rates are quite good comparatively for downtown Chicago in the business district. Make sure you stay away from the elevator shafts or be prepared to be kept awake by loud banging noises.

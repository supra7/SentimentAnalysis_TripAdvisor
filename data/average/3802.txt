Nice hotel We stayed at the mandira in a deluxe cottage for 7 days in march,the room was clean and tidy,the grounds were magnificent,as were the pools.Breakfast was good with a brilliant view. If it,s a quiet holiday in a good position then this hotel is good value but if you like a fun atmophere by the pool or meeting lots of fellow tourists over a few beers then i would sugest you try elsewhere. This not a place for familes with teenagers or little ones as they would be bored(we didn,t see any there over 2 years old!). For the elderly it is a wonderful place, for me its back to the dynasty.

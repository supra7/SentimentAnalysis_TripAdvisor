Staff was friendly and we absolutely love this location. That said, the room, when air wasn't moving, smelled of stale smoke. This became glaringly apparent after our first day out of the room. The room types need to be better described, because what I thought was a "suite" was more like a normal hotel room with a mini kitchenette. The floor in the kitchenette was nice laminate wood-look, but while the carpet looked clean, it really wasn't. They really need to wash it. Two main reasons for staying here was the inclusion of a DVD player, so I could do video review (side business) while travelling. I couldn't get the thing to work (audio, but no video - no instructions in the room), and by the time I complained and maintenance came up (over 8 hours), it was too late for me to use this resource. By the way, to use it, tune TV to channel 3 (seriously, who does this anymore with flat screens? changing the source via menu doesn't work). Lastly, the "hot tub" wasn't very hot. It was barely about 10 - 20 degrees warmer than the pool, and on the last night we were staying, the heater was broken, resulting in about a 70 degree hot tub. I can't say it was worth it's price, but you may want to look around for a better alternative if you can find something for the price (aka, if you can get the Drury across the street for close to the price, do it).

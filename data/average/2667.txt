To ease the reading of my review I devide it into two parts, pros and cons, and start with the pros. We stayed in the Hilton Miaimo Downtown for 4 nights and were enjoying a bayview room. Pro: ++ excellent location, good connection to the airport, downtown, South Beach and Key Biscayne. ++ great restaurant, room service, friendly waiters and reasonable prices + clean rooms and bathrooms with nice beds and an overwhelming view + freindly personal in general Cons: - - - The valet parking company is a mess. We were given the wrong care twice and a couple of dollars were stolen from the cup holder (which was closed). The bucks were estimated to be the tip, so maybe it's their service to self-tip. Theft was reported to company, but did not reach anyone when dialing the number I was given. - - Our room was prepaid (booked with Expedia), which was confirmed three times when checking in, but guess what happend? Back in Germany the credit card was charged again, this time from the Hilton. Took a week get someone on the phone who was really helpful and delivered resultes, but finally the refund was USD 50 short and we are going into round two... Must be a business sissue between the Hilton and Expedia, but not favorable to me due to a lot of time and money spending for international calls... Conclusion: Good hotel, well locoated with nice, clean rooms and friendly people but in terms of business processes, communication and availability not the Hilton standard I'm used to.

Stayed one night before leaving Miami on a Caribbean Cruise. GOt the hotel on Expedia for good price , it was difficult to find anything in Miami because we scheduled at the last minute. I would not recommend the location, it is an easy walk to the bus to get to South Beach, but the bus leaves a lot to be desired. There is nothing in the area of the hotel, except for the Arsht Theatre. We had a very early flight and arrived in Miami around 10:00 am. I was amazed when we arrived at the hotel to drop our bags, and they gave us our room. For that, they deserve five stars.. The room was nice, no view for us, but fine for one night. Bathroom was clean with nice toiletries. It was a short cab ride to the cruise ship in the am. The pool was really nice with nice seating, but we had a terrible thunderstorm and could not use it. The only problem is that in the morning, while getting ready to check out, the power went out in the bathroom and 1/2 the room when I used my own hair dryer. It was not fixed before we left. Good thing that my hair was dry!

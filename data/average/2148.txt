2nd visit to Vegas (this time with the family) and we were all looking forward to staying at such a well known quality hotel. The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff was brilliant. Very courteous. Very warm and friendly. excellent. The pool area was superb and the poolside bar & restaraunts were really good. The Gym was very well fitted out and all the machines worked. The efficiency of the lifts were very quick & reliable, so we did not have to stand around for ages waiting for a lift (unlike many other hotels we've stayed in) The rooms, however, were disappointing. We booked two rooms, one twin and one double. The twin only had a normal bed (extremely comfortable) & a sofa bed (very uncomfortable). Both rooms were very poorly sound proofed from the noisy roads and railway lines outside. Each night, we would be repeatedly woken up by the freight train's horns and the constant noise from passing traffic. Given the quality of this hotel, we had hoped Mr T would have spent more on the double glazing!. We stayed for 7 days & so you should take plently of your own coat hangars, as they were not enough supplied by the hotel. Not sure if we would stay here again, as the constant hubbub from outside was disappointing.

This is a large hotel well located in Boston for sightseeing but in need of a refurbishment. The rooms are spacious and the bed very comfortable but they are trapped in a 70s time warp, particularly the bathroom. Service was fine and the buffet breakfast good value and quite nice but not well presented. The hotel is attached to a mall and has a Starbucks in the foyer. This is very convenient but gives it a strange atmosphere. Very much a large conference hotel. The rate from the Marriott website was good value and I enjoyed my stay here but not really up to Marriott standards.

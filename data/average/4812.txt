We went to Chicago to celebrate our 30th anniversary. My own fault I went through Priceline to book the hotel and took our chances that a 4* rating would give us what we want. The hotel is absolutely beautiful! Definitely rate it at least a 4* if not higher. The staff were nice - I wouldn't say exceptional. The room was a huge disappointment. Very small King room. The bathroom was 3* or less due to it's size and decor. If you have a bad back, you would not be able to reach the tp. It was also very dark.

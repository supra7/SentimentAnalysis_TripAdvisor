We stayed in townhouse room for 4 nights. The hotel is directly across from the market and we did have a view of the water, but unless you have a burning desire for this view, the room is not worth the price. The room, while nice, was not worth $400/night. The downstairs is actually a little cramped and, with only one bathroom, it made it a little inconvenient for the 3 of us. You can open the "balcony" door, but you can't go out. It is actually just a window that opens. I really think that you can do better staying further down first street at one of the other hotels. Location just isn't worth the money.

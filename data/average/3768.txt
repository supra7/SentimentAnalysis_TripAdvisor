Arrived in Dallas as our first stop after long flight from the UK. Good points: easy to get to by car from airport. Very pleasant and helpful receptionist ( an older guy called Lenny) who arranged valet parking for us as we were really tired, at no higher cost than it would have been to park up ourselves.Environment was kind of " shabby-chic", quite an old fashioned reception area,but clean.It was cheap for Dallas, but perhaps only so as we had booked well in advance.The hotel is an easy and safe walk to the West End district, with variety of restaurants, bars and shops. Breakfast was a hlp yourself buffet with a selection of cereals, fruit, boiled eggs, toast and waffles, entirely adequate. The hotel offers a free bus drop off/pick up service to anywhere within a 3 mile radius. Just down the street is the Texas Book Depository and the infamous Grassy Knoll, with excellent nuseum charting the JFKennedy rise and ultimate assassination.Plus the tourist info place is right there too.We also made use of the hotel secure boxes, which was good to have at the start of our vacation. Negatives: Though our room was adequate in terms of size and facilities, and the bed was reasonably comfortable, the room did smell badly of stale cigarette smoke. On arrival, Lenny noted that the room initially allocated to us had been allocated to someone else, so perhaps this was the only alternative available? Anyway, I guess we could have complained and asked for a room change, but to be honest, we knew we would not be in the room much, and we were too tired to bother asking the first night. Probably a mistake. Overall, it was an OK stopover, perfectly adequate, but, in spite of Lenny's welcome and helpfulness, we would probably choose somewhere else to stay if we return to Dallas.

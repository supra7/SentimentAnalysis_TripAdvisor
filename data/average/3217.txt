This hotel is located near Chicago's Chinatown. I booked the room because of the price, but ended up spending my savings on taxi fare because the hotel is a bit off the beaten path. The closest subway stop is about a 30 minute walk. The room itself was spartan, but comfortable and clean. I found the beds to be very comfortable. The front desk staff are adequate and sufficiently friendly. The area around the hotel is quite bleak. There are no convenient stores or other attractions.

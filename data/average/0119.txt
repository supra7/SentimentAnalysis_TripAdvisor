I was in a rush to find a reasonably priced room in downtown Seattle, of course, at the last minute. I found this one and booked it four nights without researching it. Out of curiosity, I looked at the reviews. I got into a panic! I changed my reservation to two nights because I did not want to lose money, but I was scared. I checked in with great trepidation. The office is totally ugly, like the elevator and stairs. But the attendant was cordial. Yeap, the elevator is filthy, so the stairs which stink even when they are open to the outside. I did not run into any questionable, drunk or frightening characters. Guests I came across were the typical tourist (some with family) who stay in very low budget motels and perhaps know what to expect. Thus, all rooms open to a corridor, and if you do not close the curtains, everyone will look into your room. Nothing new about that on motels. My room had been remodeled very recently: new carpet, painted, new bed. The bathroom had new linoleum, new sink, painted, new mirror. Good soap, shampoo and conditioner provided, but no cups. The door lock and dealt bolt worked fine. The room was designed for a single bed, but a queen bed was provided instead. This made the room very tight on space. So tight, there was only about 2 feet open space around the bed. But there were no bed bugs, the covers were warm, and the bed most comfortable. The place was quiet at night. I should say that I did not go out after dark to explore the place in the dark, my typical approach when I visit a new city for the first time. I let others do that and report. The wi-fi worked well all the time, on my Mac and iPod. I would had stayed the extra two days, since I felt comfortable at this place, but I had made reservations elsewhere.

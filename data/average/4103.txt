A very disappointing stay! I stayed here for a convention in October 2007, but missed the convention room rate by a couple days. I needed to go, so I got stuck paying the $549/nt rate. I stayed at the hotel once before in 2000, and it's starting to show its age. My room was small for the price. I requested a king and got two double beds. The carpet had a 2 x 10 inch burn at the foot of one of the beds. They gave nothing for free -- you need to shell out an extra $10/day for wired internet. The exercise facility was nice, but packed every time I tried to use it. The water fountain in the exercise room was out of order, though you could buy bottled water at a machine next to the sauna. I volunteered for the committee that sets up future conferences -- we won't be coming back. If you can get a rate in the $200 range, it's worth it based on the location. If you get stuck in the same situation as me, you have several alternatives within a couple blocks. Try the Sheraton or Hilton.

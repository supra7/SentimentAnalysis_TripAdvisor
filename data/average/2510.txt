We stayed at the Aloft at the Airport in Montreal August 12, 2011. The checkin was around 10:30 pm. There is a self check-in kiosk when you enter the building. We had a reserved room on the "pet floor" - which was on the ground level. I think I had my expectations too high because I expected to be greeted by staff either in the drive way or in the lobby asking to help with our bags. There were no porters to be found - so don't expect any. The lobby had an absolutely stunning modern design and I wish I had more time to spend admiring it. The rooms were also a very lovely design. There were no issues with cleanliness. The bathroom doesn't give much privacy as the door is on a track which allow it to roll closed. It does not lock, nor is it sound proofed. There didnt seem to be a fan in the bathroom either. The coffee in the room was terrible. I used the coffee maker to make one of the weakest coffees I have ever had. My friend is SPG Gold and we were told there was some sort of card for free coffee in the morning but we never saw this card. There was no SPG benefit in this hotel except a late checkout. There was a shower and no bath tub. This was fine by me but could be an issue for other guests. There are no mini shampoo bottles or bars of soap. There are mounted dispensers on the wall for the 2in1 shampoo/conditioner and body wash. I believe they should be providing a loofa/shower puff or something to lather the soap since there are no bars of soap to be found. My last problem with the room was the bed - there is no need for it to be so uncomfortable! After travelling for a day I would prefer a comfortable bed to relax in. All in all, I would stay here again. It is very aesthetically pleasing despite some issues & there were no charges to have my dog. I just need to lower my expectations a bit...

We booked through Priceline and got the room for $120.00. Very nice but no free internet and $35.00 for parking (valet) No continental breakfast. The work out room was good. You get nothing extra from this hotel. We stayed at the Best Western on this trip too. Free internet, Continental Breakfast and great location. Their beds were comfy too. So make sure you get a good deal on your room because the extras add up!

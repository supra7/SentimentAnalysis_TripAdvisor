Small room, small elevator, and I think robots work the front desk. Upon checking out the fella asked me, 'How was your stay?' I answered, "Fine." Less than a minute later, he asked me the exact same question again! I know you've got to act like you care when it comes to customer service, but come on. At least listen to the answer of your question or just don't ask it. King size bed was nice, but I had to roll over the bed to get to other side of the room. Even though it's an older building I think the management could put the appropriate size bed in proportion to the room's size. Also no free WiFi. They charge you for that. You can go to their business center for free, but who wants to stand in line for a community computer in this wireless age? Interesting art throughout and the complimentary CD (single) was an indie artist which I dig, but I was too scared to assume it was free given bottled water was $6.00 each.

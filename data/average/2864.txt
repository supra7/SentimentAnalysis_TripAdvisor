My girlfriend and I reserved a room in the Best Point for 4 nights through hotels.com, but upon arrival, the host claimed that they were doing work on our room so they had to put us in a hotel down the street for the first night. He apologized and upgraded our room for our second night, but we were not impressed. It just felt like a scam. That being said, they did put us in a decent hotel for that first night, but it wasn't nearly as nice as the Best Point. The Best Point itself is a really nice place to stay at a great price. If we actually stayed in their hotel for the length of our stay, I would have given 5 stars in a heartbeat...

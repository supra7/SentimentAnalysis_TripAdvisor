We needed a room to stay in the Downtown area that was moderately priced and clean. This property offered that. We were in walking distance with 6 year olds to the local attractions. The staff was extremely courteous and went out of their way to ensure everything was ok. The beds were not comfortable, but for a short stay it didn't matter. The onsite restaurant offered good food at a reasonable price. Free WIFI is a plus. The hotel offers soap, lotion and shampoo in a dispenser for the Eco-conscious consumer. If you are looking for luxury, this is probably not your spot, but if you need a place to stay in town while you're waiting on your cruise to take off or for a few days this property will work.

This was a typical Hampton Inn. The lobby area/food area was a bit small. I had just finished up a cross country trip of 3500 miles and so wanted to have a bit of relaxation. The room was great as usual and the staff provided me extra coffee and such as needed. The room had only a shower which was fine...huge and nice! The pricing was not as good. VERY pricey for the room but it seemed that price can be obtained in that area.....I searched for something as nice a bit cheaper but the hotel fills up completely so they can charge what they want. Would shop around next time to try and find something cheaper though for the value of the room.

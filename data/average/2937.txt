I found this hotel very nice for the price,nice pool,clean rooms,great service,good coffee in the entrancevery quiet while we were there.Friendly staffcute little garden,outdoor bar-b-q,very relaxing.Close to all shops on 5th ave,10 minute walk to beach and 5th ave.My 2 teenagers like it very much as well,especialy the t.v. and the hammock................lol.I would love to go there again,my brother goes there every year,always to this hotel.

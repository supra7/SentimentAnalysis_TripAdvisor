The hotel, rooms, etc. are lovely, modern, and very well appointed. What I didn't expect was to find a $20 per day charge for overnight parking. If this were a downtown/city hotel you might expect it, but this is an airport/suburban hotel, and the $20 was a ripoff. I was not made aware of the charge until I entered the garage with my car and saw the posted signs - already checked in and way too late to make another choice. They say the charge is on their website, but I never used their website. In fairness, they cut the charge in half after I complained. Too bad about the excessive charges. I would have rated it higher and if you are only using their shuttle, then it's a good choice.

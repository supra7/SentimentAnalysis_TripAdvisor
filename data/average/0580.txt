I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights in July while in the Seattle area on business. I was assigned a club floor room in the Pike St. Tower. Although the Pike St. tower is the older of the two, the rooms and corridors are still quite clean and fresh. I happened to be on the 34th floor, just below the fitness center and pool on the 35th floor which were under renovation. There was quite a bit of drilling/jack hammering going on from about 9:00AM until about 4:00PM, which was annoying, but at least it wasn't going on at 6AM. A temporary fitness facility has been setup in the newer tower, and it does the job. The room was comfortable with a nice, large flat panel television and plenty of space to spread out. The hotel staff was friendly and the check-in process was quick and efficient. The location is also great with plenty of shopping and restaurants within a quick walk from the front doors. I stayed at the Westin Seattle last year and the Sheraton's location is much nicer. All in all, a pleasant stay.

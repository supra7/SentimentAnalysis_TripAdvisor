Until my last stay I would rate this hotel overall very good. Excellent for front desk friendless and helpfulness,very good for location, price, free breakfast, free parking, wireless internet and cleanliness. I will have to down grade the hotel to average because of my last stay. Breakfast was average,(the staff lady in the breakfast room was very attentive), front desk was indifferent ( the staff on our previous stays were fantastic), the carpet in the elevator needed a deep cleaning. I just didn't get the good feeling that I had on previous stays. I am tempted to try another airport location on my next stay.

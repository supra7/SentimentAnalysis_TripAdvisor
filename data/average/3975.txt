The hotel is nice modern and clean but way out of the central areas of Dubai. The rooms are clean and have nice facilities. However, as most pictures on hotel websites, also here they do not represent the reality. The architect must hate bathrooms!! We travel a lot but we have never seen such small bathrooms! Trust me I'm not exaggerating when I say they are small they are! I hurt myself everyday whilst taking a shower. Just turning around in the shower was a task on its own. Forget using the bathroom with 2 people! Really strange because the rest of the room and living room was quite spacious. The staff are friendly. The breakfast is ok but really not more than average. The 3rd day you are out of options on what to choose from. The hotel is really basic, so don't expect too much. You are able to get a good night sleep though and that is also pretty important! If you go on business, this hotel is not central at all. I guess for holiday the location is acceptable but not great.

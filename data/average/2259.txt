The hotel and service are your average middle of the road hotel. Adequate breakfast included bagels, fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee. If you want anything else, be prepared to bring a Swiss bank account. The staff is friendly enough. The pool was closed even though it was in the 80's during our stay which was disappointing. VERY IMPORTANT: Know that you will NOT have a good night's sleep here. It is INCREDIBLY noisy as this hotel is directly next to a major highway on-ramp and every motorcycle in town loves to drive as fast as possible on that ramp. Also, if you're in town on a Wednesday, DO NOT stay here. There is a motorcycle competition in the parking lot that goes on until very late at night - not the hotel's fault, but irritating after driving all day nonetheless. We tried to opt for the air conditioner's obnoxious-motor sound to drown out the sound, but that didn't even help. Be forewarned. There are better options in the area; choose carefully.

We came to Mexico escaping the coldness of New Jersey only to find cooler temps at the Resort also....Wear your slippers full time in your room as the marlble floors are way too cold and pack a sweatshirt for the evenings because there is "No" heat in the rooms.....the Staff were fantastic and very helpful...A very "new" resort with not much to do except Eat and drink if that's what you're looking for.

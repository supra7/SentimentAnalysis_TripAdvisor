I stayed with my friend in April 2009 and it was quite worth the money! The location was perfect for wherever we had to go! Staff was very friendly and courteous and always kept us laughing! No issues with services and no complaints on my end. Room was relatively clean, pretty standard. No luxury here but it was a comfortable place to sleep. Breakfast was good. I did find that every morning there was a harsh smell outside our door so maybe it was coming from the kitchen...no idea. Everything is pretty much within walking distance and if you needed a cab, one was handy and could be provided to you by the staff. We did end up renting a car for one day which was so worth it. Alot cheaper than taking cabs throughout the day. Cab rides in L.A. are expensive. Runyon Canyon is close by and a must to see. Universal studios/City Walk is a 10 min drive by cab. Walk of fame seemed like a 5 min walk away and we even walked to Sunset Blvd! Only took us about 30-35 mins. Hotel was not noisy. There is a convenience store across the street if you need bottled water, cigarettes, etc. Last but not least there is an abundance of nightlife and venues are within walking distance no problem. Check out Geisha House, very nice. Lots of cool shops too! Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Just wished we could have had warmer weather as in April it seemed a bit cooler but it is definitely worth the price.

Hotel is nice and clean, but is really nothing special. The location is good for the centre of town and is close to the market if you want to visit there. The hotel itself didn't do anything to offend us but ...is just didn't feel as good as I expected. I think perhaps we are just more B&B people rather than hotel kinda people.

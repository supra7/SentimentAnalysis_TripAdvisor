Pros: Clean Friendly and helpful staff Large room. We had two double beds w/plenty of room remaining to move around and were not on top of each other Good sized bathroom Quiet but we were not on the freeway side Comfortable beds, bedding, and pillows Good lighting Cons: Really, really, really loud heater. So much so that it drowned out the TV and we had to turn the heat off at night as it woke us up. Not sure I would stay at the hotel again b/c of how loud it was. No mini bar in room to use as a mini fridge. Was advised the mini bar/fridge is an add'l per night charge but the front desk clerk willingly and quickly supplied one gratis $37 / night parking. Appears to be the going rate at all the downtown hotels but in my opinion the Crowne Plaza should not charge the same rate as the Westin Charge for WiFi Minor stuff: No cork screw in the room, called down to housekeeping. 3/4 of an hour later when went out for dinner still waiting for the corkscrew. Fan in bathroom didn't work. Apparently environmentally friendly based on the signs about re-using towels, etc, but no recycling containers for paper, cans, etc On the edge of downtown but not a big deal. Everything still within easy walking distance. Only one arm chair and one office chair. Should have had two arm chairs. I've checked that I would recommend this hotel to a friend but that is only if the heater is fixed and the rack rate is significantly discounted. Otherwise, no.

We traveled from Vancouver to Seattle and stayed only one night at the hotel. The location was perfect for our purpose: have a night out in downtown and attending a preview at the Seattle Art Museum the next morning. The Executive has an agreement with a parking next door and we payed $23 for a 24-hour parking period. Our room faced the Seattle Library. Noise from the street wasn't much of a problem, but I could hear other guests using their showers through the pipes. In the morning, I could hear people talking on the hallway and doors being slammed. Small room ,very small bathroom (no bath tub), but we didn't need anything more than what was being offered. There is a coffeemaker in the room and a Seattle's best Coffee at the lobby. When we visited, they were offering a 'wine reception' at the mezzanine  that meant having a glass of wine before leaving for dinner. Nice! I would stay here again whenever I need a central place, but it's not exactly the kind of hotel I would recommend to friends, unless they are looking for a great rate.

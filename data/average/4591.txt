We were transferred from the nice Venus hotel to the Meddusa hotel. The walls were paper thin and the party upstairs keeped us awake until 2:30 am. The second night was a little better however you could hear movement around the hotel all night long. the rooms were simple and clean. We preferred the Venus hotel.

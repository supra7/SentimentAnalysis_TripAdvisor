Overall nice hotel with friendly staff. Love the nightly milk and cookies as well as the happy hour. Only complaint was my room. I was on the forth floor with a view of their airconditioner and roof, the cable on my TV didn't work ... which the promptly fixed, and the blinds on my windows were messed up. I had to spend twenty minutes untangling the cords on them to lower the blinds. Nothing was a big deal but with all the hotels that I can choose from it make a difference when I need to decide where to stay next time I'm in Dallas.

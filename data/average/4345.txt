I have read the other reviews and we didn't experience the problems the other travelers had. The hotel is in a good location, walking distance to many Boston attractions. The Concierge was very helpful giving us tips on when to avoid certain locations. Thy strongly suggested the Duck tour, which my husband, 2 children (ages 10 and 12) took. The hotel rooms are very small. The only inconvience was the size of the bathroom. Very small with no countertop space. For the price (we received a AAA discount), I can't complain.

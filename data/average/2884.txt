Basically this hotel makes its money of a local railroad company. They have train engineers come in during the middle of the night, and they sleep on the third floor which is off limits to everyone else. Otherwise the place it pretty bare. It's clean, seems relatively safe, and the staff is nice enough. But there's no real dining options. The manager does a Sam's run on the weekend and stocks the place with Cup of Noodles, and frozen burgers, etc that you can purchase for inflated prices. Breakfast buffet is offered in the morning, but I think it's part of the railroad deal. Everytime I went in there, it was packed with the railroad workers laughing and talking shop. No one else really. I found certain staff to be wonderfully helpful others not so much. I was told I couldn't have a kind size bed because I booked on priceline. Even though the hotel was empty on the 2nd floor when I got there. I wouldn't hesitate staying again. Clean, nice staff, and great price. But I totally wouldn't call it a 3 star hotel. More like 2 to 2.5. I felt like an add on to the railroad workers home, not a guest at a Marriott.

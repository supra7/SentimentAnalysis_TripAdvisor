I guess I could sum up the stay by the first 30 minutes. They did not have the king sized "bed" that we reserved, so they put us in two queen sized "beds". One of the worst mattresses that I have ever slept on. We went down to the Umalu for a welcome to Hawaii drink and it cost us $27 for a Mai Tai and Strawberry Daquiri. The pool was busy if you wanted a place to lay out and not if you wanted to go swimming. The hot tub when we went to only one time had small children in it and 4 young guys sucking up drinks. On Friday night they had entertainment at the Umalu and then on Saturaday night they had a private party with a DJ that played loudly until 10 PM. Not good. Like in other reviews the breakfast buffet was included but a 15% tip is $18 and we chose to go to Safeway and buy some breakfast items and eat on a nearby beach. The staff was friendly and courteous. I compliment them. This is a great place to stay if you want to do things everywhere else.

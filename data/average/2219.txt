The hotel is very nice - although i dont know that it rates 5 stars like it recieved on priceline. I dont usually stay at that level of hotel so i am not sure about the usual standards. This is a mixed hotel/condo property and the rooms are all very large and have the kitchen in them. there was a nice restaraunt on site, but i did not eat there. The bad- location -location-location (for me anyway) it is quite removed from teh strip - almost a lie to call it a strip hotel. I had a great view of the porn shops and strip clubs on industrial blvd from my window. almost nothing else close by at night, but for daytime, right across from the fashion show mall. it was a bit of walk to nearest casino (wynne) and quite a walk to next nearest casino. If you want to be removed from the stip - this would be a good choice, but there are other choices out there that may be nicer or more affordable THe worst - the RESORT fee that is mandatory. i dont remeber exactly how much but it was over 10$. i personally did not use any of the services, but did walk through the spa and pool area - not impressive for the money, especially since you had to pay for it, i have seen much better for free at other locations. the only real plus to this location - they give exceptionally late checkout - 4 pm, great for those late flights.

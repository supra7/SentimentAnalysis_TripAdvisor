I've been there for 4 days in August in order to visit Seattle. It is far from Seattle downtown and parkings are expensive there, so that I recomend to choose another hotel to visit the city. The swimmingpool of the motel is very big and the spa is also perfect to relax after a long day walking around Seattle. Rooms are big and clean, however it is a little bit old and breakfast is not too good... In my opinion the motel is a little bit expensive for what the offer.

In general, the stay was fine. It was well located for walking around the city. We rarely used a cab except to and from the airport. Plenty of wonderful food around as well. However, the rooms varied in size and quality among the same rate. We were traveling with extended family and had booked and checked in at the same time, paying the same rate for three rooms. One was spectacular but located in a different area, one was an average sized room, like you would expect at a US airport hotel, and one was the size of a walk in closet. The window was narrow and overlooked the roof and the kitchen-this caused a host of issues that were never resolved. 1)All of the rooms were overly warm and stuffy. We repeatedly asked for help with the heating as it was spring, and warm enough to be without coats- and did not need the heat blasting in the rooms. 2) we had one small window-no ability for cross ventilation but HAD to keep it open. The location meant that we had all the smells and sounds-including people on their cigarette break and music at 5am wafting into our room. 3) We were there for 10 days, and daily asked that they not spray the room with febreeze as the combination of stuffyness and smoke was to much with perfumed spray. Every day they assured us they would cease, and every night it was clear the room had been sprayed again. The bed was not great but not terrible. There was barely two feet space on any side around the bed. That's how small the room was. Not pleasant. Breakfast-was amazing and included.

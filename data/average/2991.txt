Great hotel. Clean, comfortable and modern rooms (Flat LCD screen with large variety of channels). Nice continental breakfast. Only downside is the location. The hotel is two blocks away from the nearest metro station (Llacuna), which is several stops from some of the main attractions in the city (Plaza De Catalunya, Las Ramblas, etc.). However, its is pretty close to a nice Rambla (Rambla de Poblenou), where you can have wonderful catalan meals for a reasonable price (besides the pleasant walk towards the beach). Also, hotel could have free internet connection in rooms. Would definitely stay tthere again!

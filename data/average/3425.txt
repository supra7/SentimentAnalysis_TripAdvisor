This hotel was conveniently located at the airport and there is a subway into town which is very good. However the staff were not particularly friendly and looked down on us. Apart from that there was an iPod dock which was very good but no DVD player. If you are just staying between flights it is very convenient. Don't bother with the breakfast it wasn't particularly good and the wifi is useless!

Stayed at the Westin for 2 days on the "Holiday Shopping Package" $199/night + a $100 gift card to Pacific Place per night. Location: Downtown Seattle everything is within walking distance. Hotel is located between the monorail and the streetcar so if you're looking for a quiet hotel I would suggest trying a different one. Hotel: Is dated needs some renovations, but I was not disappointed overall. Food: The main restaurant is in winter hours so I did not have a chance to try it. Shopping: Everything is close by Macys, Nordstroms, 2 malls and many retaliers have a street presence. Most stores open till 8 at night and the streets felt very safe. Also check with the concierge desk as they can give you discount coupons or freebies to some stores and restaurants.

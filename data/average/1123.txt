Stayed here for one night in July 2010. It was the only place downtown that had a vacancy for the night we wanted, so we had to pay a lot more than we wanted to, to get a place to stay. For the money that we paid, we really were expecting a lot more than we got. The hotel is nice inside, but everything is just so small. The lifts were just tiny (and you just don't expect it for a place that is both so expensive and elegant looking). The room was undeniably pleasant, but the bathroom was just ridiculously small. I felt claustrophobic in the shower, and as soon as you step out of it you are faced with the sink! There is just no room to move! It is all furnished nicely and is extremely fashionable, but the bedroom itself is also rather small. The location is good, but there is a charge for the wireless internet which really isn't what you'd expect when you are paying a premium anyway. The mixture of the bedroom and bathroom small spaces really didn't match the price, nor the grandiose of the hotel.

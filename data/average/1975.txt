Got in February 29 Lanai was getting retiled, repairs took longer than expected which took away from our time, but oh well. Would of rated higher if we didn't lose the lanai for a week. Rented our unit through MauiOwners.com not the El Dorodo so we were pretty much stuck with the unit. Great unit though, great view, great location, lots of newer stuff in unit. Some of the units are getting dated, but a number of units including the one I had are investing some money in their investment. All staff were great Jeffrey, Pam, thanks. Pam is great to book tours through and also makes great sandwiches. Cabanna can be tricky to get a chair, they do that caribean thing though, put towels over the chairs to hold them then show up whenever. Went down early one day so I could be there when it opened to put towels over a couple of chairs for me. Got there 20 minutes before there was supposed to be any towels handed out yet. Imagine my surprize to find ten chairs already taken with towels issued from the Cabanna. (something fishy going on here) Great place though would not hesitate to go back, now that I know a few of the tricks the reguliars pull off. Make sure to buy some groceries at costco when in Kahalui, can get expensive to eat out all the time, but it is Maui. Hope to return soon, mahalo.

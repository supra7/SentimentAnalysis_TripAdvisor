hotel itself is not too bad and location is not that bad (20 minutes drive to disney and 30 minutes to searworld), but room is tiny. our 1.5 year baby usually likes hotels but he felt claustrophobic in this hotel and was scary first 2 days but on the third day he got used to it. If there are more than 2 members in your party, check other hotels for bigger rooms. The room looks nice on pictures and from distance, but if you look closer you will see that everything is scratched and dusty. The bathroom is like a tank in submarine - if you do not like being in a closed space, you would not feel comfortable there. Our room got cleaned first day and when they forgot to clean it up second day. they never changed soap and shampoo and I had to ask second day for fresh towels. The breakfast is bad. We went to local groceries shop (Publix) and got ham and put it on bagels in the morning, that made breakfast where a bit more delicious. so do not plan on it if you stay for more than 2 days - it is not that good. Staff is ok I think - they helped me when I asked. The biggest turndown for us was that they put queen size sheets on king bed so once you lay down, the sheet will uncover unpleasant mattress that you will touch eventually and pillows are very bad like a spring so I went to nearby target to buy $15 pillow for my wife - he could not sleep first night because of these two issues. Our room was quite in the end of the building, but they have extremely loud vending machine in the middle, I cannot imagine to stay near it. No internet in the room, they have one computer in the lobby with maximum 15 minutes usage. So while the hotel is not expensive and looks good from distance and on pictures, think twice. We would not return there for sure.

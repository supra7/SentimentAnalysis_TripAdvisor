Pros: +Amazing room +Huge bathroom +Great customer service +jacuzzi with jet +tv in bathroom +iPod radio Cons: -Extra $15 resort fee each day (plus tax) -$6 to use Internet for 15 min -No self parking -Far from strip (1/2 mile) -wi-fi is extra So this is the first time I've stayed in a five star hotel and maybe my experience is indicative of why I like the 3 or 4 star hotels. The rooms at the Trump hotel was amazing, the bed was soft yet firm, the bathroom was huge and the bathtub wig a jacuzzi was divine. However what I don't appreciate is when a hotel isn't up front about their fees. Be honest! So when you check in they will have you sign a form stating that you agree to pay $15 per day for a resort fee (tax is extra). The associated stated that this fee was to pay for the hotel amenities such as the gym, valet parking, pool and business center. By the way whether or not you use the facilities is irrelevant....you will pay $15. Fair enough, so I proceeded to the business center later that night to use the Internet t and print out some business forms when I discovered that there is an additonal charge of $6 for defy 15 minutes and another fee (about 80 cents per page). Another thing about this hotel is that it's a bit far from the strip. I don't know the exact distance but unless you walk through the mall that is located across the street you will either take a taxi or walk down a long sidewalk Overall a good hotel, but for the money I think are better deals out there and I despise businesses that aren't up front with the fees during the booking process.

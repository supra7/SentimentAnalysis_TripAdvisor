Stayed here for a work event over this past weekend. It is truly a historic hotel with a great lobby and entrance. The hotel is huge and houses over 1,000 rooms. The rooms however are quite small and outdated. Renovations are definitely do up especially if they want to get me to stay there again when I am in town.

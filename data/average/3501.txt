Recently stayed at the Re! and I have stayed there several times before. In common with all Singpaore hotels, it is a little expensive but the location is good with only a short walk to Clarke Quay and the main attarctions of Singapore - Chinatown is very close. At this stay at the hotel, found that the aircon did not function well - a key requirement for a westerner in Singapore! The room, however was comfortable and the stylish decoration of the hotel is interesting! This hotel has become increasingly expensive as it begins to establish itself - the cost for what you are getting is now a little high.

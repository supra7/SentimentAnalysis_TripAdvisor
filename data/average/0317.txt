We chose to book this hotel even though it wasn't the cheapest, because the name "Executive" lends itself to a certain standard that the cheaper hotels didn't have. While the lobby, bell hop, and front desk area were all well polished, the elevator was completely dodgy (mis-matched buttons, jerky and rickety and VERY noisy, the doors opened before you were at your floor, etc) and the rooms were pretty average. While the finishings and overall appearance of the rooms was nice, the crown moulding was about 1/2 inch away from the ceiling, the toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom was at eye level when you are on the toilet, the bathroom itself had a glass door to the bedroom, not a wooden door (not bad, just weird). In the hallways, the wallpaper was peeling off the wall and all of the trim work was well dented and scratched. We were on the 8th (top) floor, and during the night it was almost unbearable with the noise from the elevator. Though we were on the opposite end of the floor from the elevator, the noise kept us up most nights. The hotel also placed us in a room with a door going through to an adjoining room, but did not consult us if this was okay before doing so. Let me tell you: it was NOT okay - the walls and door were so paper-thin that we could hear the neighbour sneezing, drawing their shower curtain and talking quietly. I think the problem with this hotel is that the building was so old and try as they might to give it facelifts to make it an "Executive" hotel, it falls very short of executive status. We would not stay at this hotel again.

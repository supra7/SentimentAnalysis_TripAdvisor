I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Monaco. The location is perfect. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I got a low price as part of a package deal so the hotel offered good value. Otherwise, I was hoping for a bit more based on the other reviews I saw. I think this is a solid 3 1/2 star hotel. Good but not great.

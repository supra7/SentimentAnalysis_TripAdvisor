Looking for an inexpensive stop on a trip going thru Memphis. Found this property, price of 50$ on priceline sold it for me. Check in was easy enough, room was clean, but in need of an update. Work is continuing on hotel public areas but done quietly. Neighborhood is pretty sketchy - other than fast food, not a whole lot of food options. Found a grocery store down the road that was more of a warehouse - think walmart of the americas.... I suppose it was worth 50$, no major problems, which is the best I can say.

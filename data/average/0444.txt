Stayed here because of the government rate that is within state per diem. A little out of the way and doesn't feel like a Hilton. The hotel has an odd smell--like fresh air never gets in the building. The rooms were very average and the bathroom very small. Although I am a Hilton Honors member there was no acknowledgement or room update that I usually receive. Food was typical bad Hilton and over priced. Arrived late so didn't really have any other choice. But definitely many better Seattle restaurants for the same price or cheaper. What I will have to say is that down to a person the service was outstanding. Every staff person went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. Everyone was personable and tried to give you little tips to make your stay better (e.g., the escalator was out at the metro station). Just need to take this outstanding staff and give them a better hotel

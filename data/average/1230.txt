We had the opportunity to stay here on the way home from vacation. It was a nice looking hotel, with clean, well furnished rooms. However, we arrived late and had to have maintenance in twice, once to fix the toilet the other to fix the modem. They followed up these services with calls to assure the maintenance was to our satisfaction which it was. The biggest bummer of the stay was when we attempted to get on the shuttle to get the airport, as we crossed the parking lot the shuttle driver told us we would have to wait until the next shuttle and basically left us in the dust.....I emailed the manager of this and received no response. It was funny that they bent over backwards to assure the maintenance issues were resolved, but when we actually had a concern they ignored us. However, we would probably stay again.

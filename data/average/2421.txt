PEOPLE!!!! This Hotel is Excellent when a loved one is in HUP!!!! My wife was there for three days for surgery. We live 90 minutes away, so I choose to stay in Philly. The bad reviews almost made me find another hotel, and Im glad I DIDNT!! The Hotel is connected to the hospital by an enclosed walkway over the road. I didnt even have to wear a coat!! My room was CLEAN! DID NOT SMELL! The parking was only $10 per day, compared to $40 at the nearby Hilton family hotel. Anyone should not be afraid to stay at Penn Tower. YOU'RE NOT ON VACATION!!!! There are places to eat. The hospital has a cafeteria. I could stay with my wife till visitors had to leave at 8:00PM and just walk back to my room. Well priced! Convenient! STAY THERE!!!!

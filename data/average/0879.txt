If you are looking for something that is close to downtown and convenient for walking, this isn't a terrible choice. However, the hotel itself needs a number of improvements to live up to its 4-star rating. We booked this hotel on Priceline for about $145. They seemed intent on putting us into a handicap-accessible room on the 6th floor, which is fine but there's no where to put sundries in the bathroom (which I am pretty sure irritates disabled people as much as it does able-bodied people). The first room that they put us in did not have a clean bathroom. There was literally urine and toilet paper in the toilet and the floor and shower area was visibly dirty with grime and hair. We called and asked for them to clean it or move us, so they moved us next door, to another handicapped room. We took them up on it. In both rooms, there was a wall of windows that looked out on to an exterior wall of some sort. So, we weren't able to enjoy the view because it was entirely obstructed. We ate in a restaurant in the lounge and the staff was fantastic. The prices were typical for a downtown area and the food was good. We had our 1 year old child with us and they brought out ice cream and crackers for her and generally spoiled her, so we were pleased with that. Between the hotel charge, parking (which was substantial-- I think it was $18 for the off-site, non-valet parking), internet (around $10) and dining, we spent around $250 at the hotel. Considering the substandard accomodation, I'm not sure it was quite worth it.

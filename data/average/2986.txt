I have stayed in the Holiday Inn Barcelona for 4 nights during a convention in the city. The hotel itself is a good choice, being cheaper than hotels close to the Convention Center and others close to the beaches or the Ramblas. Moreover, the subway is only two blocks away, allowing you to go virtually anywhere both for tourism or business. The rooms are pretty standard, what is good, clean and silent. The downsides are the price for the Wi-FI internet (18.00 Euros/day!!!) and the front desk staff, which, with few exceptions, are almost rude and are not willing to help anybody. Summing up, a good choice for Barcelona.

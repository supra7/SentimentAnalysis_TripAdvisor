This hotel is attached to the Prudential Center and all the associated shops. It's a great location, especially on cold snowy trips. There are an abundance of restaurants within an easy 3 minute walk. The staff is so efficient they may at times seem unfriendly. The rooms are small, clean but a little worn around the edges. This hotel has all the Marriott features you'd expect and the beds are really comfortable. It feels like a convention hotel and there are lots of non-hotel guests milling around if you like people watching. At times the hotel lobby and 2nd level lounge is too crowded and filled with tired shoppers looking for a break.

My families first stay was in June 2011, on the second floor, Not to bad you can hear noise from up stairs nothing you cant live with, Our Families second stay was the first week in August 2011, room 102 right next to the rental office. This was a very different experience. We were woken up at 1:00am by the manager yelling at the TOP OF HIS LUNGS for an hour, putting someone out for being to loud! (How ironic). It happened again the next night at 11pm. I thought there was going to be a physical altercation. It sounded as if they were right in our room.

Typical Double Tree Hotel. Comfortable, quiet, nice clean rooms. The restaurant wasn't bad and a decent value for the money. My one issue with this hotel was the onsite gift shop. Charging someone $2.50 for a small bag of chips or 3.99 for popcorn that can be purchased for .99 at any convenience store is complete rip off and kind of ruins the the positive experience of staying at the hotel. I realize the gift shop is not part of the hotel, but not all guests realize that. Also, having some smart a$$ rude lady working there doesn't help matters either. My advice to the hotel, have these clowns get real with their prices or don't renew their lease. They really give an otherwise nice hotel a bad rap.

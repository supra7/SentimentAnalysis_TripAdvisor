We enjoyed our stay at the Park Plaza. The room was small but adequate, but the location--just down the street from the Ritz Carlton and a few steps from the Boston Public Garden and Boston Commons, is excellent. Also the price was right, less than any other hotel I could find in the area. I don't know whether newer parts of the hotel have larger rooms. In any case, we would return here on another trip to Boston.

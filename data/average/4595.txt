This grand old lady has a great deal of charm, but badly needs a large dollop of TLC. The hotel has an elegant old world facade and nice classical internal decor. However, the decor needs upgrading and a lot of the furnishings are badly scuffed. Its overall upkeep looks to have been neglected. It has a very tired feel. Without wishing to be unkind, it's like a 5 star being run as a 3 star. The beautiful pictures on the hotel website were misleading in conveying the impression of a more upscale hotel. Our bedroom was a good size and had what we needed, but it was showing its age. The location is excellent and the the hotel staff were polite, if a little subdued. Overall, we managed to see past the hotel's failings and enjoyed our short stay.

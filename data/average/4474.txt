The hotel is located in the back bay area of Boston  towards the south side. It is not in the immediate downtown area but is right across the street from the Hynes convention center and a large mall. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, as well as other major hotels like Sheraton, Marriott, Westin and others. The Hotel  the interior of the hotel is nice but nothing fancy. No extravagant lobby or sitting area. The elevators appear to be designed to have at least one unused elevator at the lobby. Check-in was quick and staff was courteous. There is a bellman at the entrance most of the time. The hotel is kept in good shape and the hallways are clean. Did not use the pool or workout facility. The Rooms  nice, and fairly large for a big-city hotel. As usual, the Hilton beds are among the most comfortable. Bathroom is small but efficient. Room was generally clean but found a few stray hairs in the bathroom. TV was not HD. Good views from the upper floors. The Restaurant  had breakfast at their restaurant Boodles. The buffet was decent and the dining room quaint. There is really not a good bar at this hotel but you can walk across to the Sheraton and find a nice lobby lounge or at one of the area restaurants. If you are spending time by the Hynes convention center, this is good choice of hotels but there are others with better lounge & restaurant areas. NOTE: make sure you tell the cab driver the Back Bay Hilton by the Hynes center on Dalton. Just said the Back Bay Hilton and got dropped off at the Boston Hilton  which is more downtown.

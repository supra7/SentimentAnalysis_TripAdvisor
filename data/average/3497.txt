In a city of phenomenally expensive hotels, this was the best value I could find that had consistently good reviews and availability for my dates. However, there were drawbacks: for $150 I expected more than a shoebox, a shoebox that felt like sleeping on the set of Austin Powers and with a motorway right outside my window. Surprise costs at the end: tax and service: should have been clearer when signing up. Water heating that takes 15 minutes to warm before taking a shower. Fitness room that consists of a single running machine and one other machine which I forget. I would have been happy if the room had cost half as much. There must be better places in Singapore.

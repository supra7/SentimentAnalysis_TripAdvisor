This hotel is located a short walk from the metro station and it is easy to get to, even though it is outside of the city. Seemed to be in a safe area and was quiet at night. The rooms were clean and spacious. The internet was expensive and so was the food. This hotel is just an average place, nothing luxurious - it is overpirced for what it is.

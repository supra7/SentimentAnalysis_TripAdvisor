Given the point of our weekend getaway was to be centrally located, this fit the bill. However TINY size of the bathroom felt like an airline lavatory. Very few extra's in the room such as adequate coffee, no mini frig unless you had a key to the minibar, which was packed anyway. All things pushed you to buy from the hotel, which here too was very over priced. Wine selection was minimal at the lounge and way over priced for the quality/selection. Overall the hotel was clean, lobby, room, lounge, restaurant, etc. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. Finding the lobby was an odd placement (not on the street level). The blackout curtains did little and the light from the hall came in through the door jam causing me concerns about security. At least use of the room safe was free. However the staff was accomodating to a late check out - but that may have more to do with my level of Hilton points than anything else.

This hotel isn't as bad (for the price) as some reviewers claim. A lot of what they say is right (the breakfast is just about ok, they seem to be running some kind of import/export business with Africa from the lobby, and so on) but AS LONG AS YOU GET A ROOM ON THE FRONT, and I can't stress that enough, you should be all right. The location is perfect for most of the sights in Istanbul, yet the area is genuinely, authentically (perhaps even too authentically...) local. The manager, Ramazan Gol, tries to be helpful and speaks good English. The other staff try to be helpful but don't speak a word of anything other than Turkish, sometimes with quite hilarious results! The only thing that really irritated us, because it was so stupid and needless, was that despite the fact we booked months before coming here, when we arrived we were put in rooms I am loath to even call by that name. Stifling little cupboards under the stairs might be more appropriate. When we remonstrated, we were almost immediately shown to perfectly pleasant rooms a few floors up, on the (non-noisy) front. So WHY ON EARTH weren't we put there from the start? It would've have changed our whole attitude to the hotel and this review would probably have been a lot better!! Oh, and be warned: don't take the manager's proffered recommendation of a fish restaurant in the horrendously touristy area just behind the back of the hotel. We stayed in Istanbul for five days and generally ate very well for very little money. At the fish restaurant we ate appallingly badly and got thoroughly ripped off, after being accompanied there personally by the manager who assured us that the restaurant owner would "take good care of us". He certainly did that!

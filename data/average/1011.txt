During my stay in Seattle, I had the opportunity to stay at the Hotel Vintage Park and the Hotel Monaco Seattle. I would say that, between the two, there is really no comparison as Monaco was much larger, well-appointed and helpful. Both are in a good location and about a block from one another (the length of the Seattle Public Library in between). I have nothing to complain about with Vintage Park, only the observation that my room was rather small (but just fine for a solo traveler) as was the very small lobby. No one offered to help with my bags to the room, though I managed despite quite a load. Another observation was that the hotel staff - bell vs. front desk - seemed very competitive with one another which I thought odd, or at least to be so obvious about it. I would stay here again if I got a good deal on the hotel - the location was fine, room interesting and clean, and no glaring problems. It just doesn't beckon you back like some other hotels. I loved the Monaco Seattle, as well as the Monaco Chicago. You can tell a big difference between Vintage Park and the Monaco.

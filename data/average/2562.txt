We've stayed here before but not for a year or two since Travelodge started to charge much higher prices for this Euston hotel. It's location is great for our requirements,being only a short walk to Camden and Fitzrovia. The rooms are clean,quite large for a budget hotel and contain most things you would expect.The shower room is really quite nice and the shower is warm & powerful.The towels are good. That's the upside.The downside is that every effort seems to have been made to make the rooms as joyless as possible.Dull paint scheme,thin,plain blind.Awful fake wood units etc.It could all be so much nicer. So there you have it.Not as nice as the Premier Inn over the road but the shower is better. Not as nice as the Ibis around the corner but a lot cheaper. You pays your money and takes your choice. Oh and one last tip.Don't use the machines to check in.They start by giving out the worst ground floor rooms right at the side of the road with 24 hour buses. OK for a night but could be better.

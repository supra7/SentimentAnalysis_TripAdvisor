We had a nice stay recently at the Palmer House in Chicago. It is decent location (by Park and other downtown attractions), but you are a hike from the Rush/Division area. There didnt seem to be a whole lot going on around the hotel after midnight. Our room was clean, but old and we would never pay the rack rate to stay here again.

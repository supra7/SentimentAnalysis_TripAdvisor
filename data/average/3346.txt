Very Clean. Stayed in this property the first time i was in Tokyo. it's situated about 3 minutes from the Hatagaya subway station, just off Shinjuku. For a budget hotel this is actually quite good.The rooms were small but the beds were reasonably comfortable and bathroom... tiny (as usual.. for japan hotels).Breakfast was normal, toast and butter/jam with coffee/tea.If you are a backpacker with a little more budget to spare than a shared hostel, or if you are not intending to spend a lot of time lazing in a 5-stars hotel, but just to use it to sleep, this is actually a very pleasant hotel to stay. Oh, it's quiet too!

Just returned from a 3-night stay at Roosevelt. First of all, the staff was cordial and friendly uniformly. They tried their best with a tough situation. The place was down to one smallish elevator. Because this place is popular with cruise folks with lots of luggage, this meant LONG waits during rush periods. I would not book a room until all elevators are working. Second, my cable TV did not work most of the time. They would fix it; then it would go out. I was there on business so -- apart from the World Cup Final -- this was no big deal. However, if you were there with kids..... Good things about hotel: Staff; location (near Convention center, Westlake -- where airport train comes in, and Pike St. Market), price is high but this is downtown Seattle. Vonn's restaurant next door has Sunday buffet brunch for $10. It is nothing special but worth the $10. (Excellent bacon...) My room was a little stodgy but clean and quiet. AC worked well. Free Wi Fi in lobby + one public computer there; pay wi fi in rooms. Nice big TV but cable didn't work well. Bad? Elevator (being repaired) and check in time. Bad cable TV. One ice machine on 3rd floor. If you are big ice person, this could be a pain. I didn't care. I didn't have a car so I can't comment on parking although it seemed to be right next door. I came from airport on Grey Line Shuttle ($15) and was dropped right across the street. And I took light rail train back to airport (short walk over to Westlake from Roosevelt); long walk at airport through most of parking garage to terminal.

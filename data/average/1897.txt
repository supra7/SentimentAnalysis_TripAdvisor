Just got back from 7 nights in Maui. We have stayed all over the island from Wailea, Kihei, to Kaanapali. The best advice is to make sure you know what you really want before booking this hotel. It is older, built in the 60's and it shows in the building. The grounds are beautiful but not "manicured" compared to some other properties in Kaanapali. The rooms are ok, but worn. Breakfast is good, but exactly the same every morning. The Tiki bar makes great drinks. The Tiki grill has a small menu with very few healthy choices, but really great service. The pool is small, but theres no fighting over lounge chairs, and no charge for towels. We traveled with two young teen boys who didn't really care for it. Not much for them on the property. Nightly music was lovely. This hotel didn't have many young couples (30-40 age range). Mostly older folks 55+. Our stay wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular either. The entire hotel staff was very very nice. If you want a higher end hotel, multiple pools, updated rooms and amenities,this is not the place for you. If you want laid back on a budget your golden!

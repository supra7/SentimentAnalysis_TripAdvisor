We arrived at 8pm, the deluxe room we were given was small with no windows but a nice inside patio which was small but was an extension of our room and was somewhere to sit. We were tired after a flight from London so we just crashed. The following morning the manager asked us if we liked our room, we said we missed a window so he switched our room to a corner room which was a great improvement. We liked it and wanted to stay an extra night but the room had been requested so we checked out and went to the Hyatt for one night. The staff were friendly and the corner room we had was just fine, a little on the small side but the bathroom was big. I loved the style of the place, the staff and the location but the size of the rooms were the only gripe. I would stay there again but only for one night, and only if the room we had was a corner room with windows.

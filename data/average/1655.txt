So we went away to SD on a romantic weekend getaway sans kids. The hotel looked great on paper and so we booked it. Beautiful views of the Marina and of downtown. Beautiful, new hotel (next to the Convention Center along with the Marriot and the Grand Hyatt). Right across the street from the happening Gaslamp Quarter. All in all great hotel in a great area, at least when there's no conference in town. Downside: My wife and I arrive around 10pm on a Friday night and get to our room looking forward to open a standard hotel room half bottle of wine. Guess what? No mini bar. It took about 45 minutes for the bottle I ordered to arrive. 2nd: In room dining stops at 11pm...Wait? This is a giant Hilton. We had to move fast. 3rd: We used points to book the first two nights. Unless you are a frequent Hilton traveler you have no chance of earning VIP status. 4th: The room was small. I mean really small. 5th: I signed the bill upon checkout. I was content with my charges. Next...two days later I get an extra charge for $450 stating they made a mistake! Not a story I would expect from Hilton. Positives: Great location, friendly service and a solid lobby bar/restaurant. Also, Fox Sports Bar is on sight, which was perfect for an NFL playoff weekend.

I choose this hotel trying to close our vacation in a nice place. The smallest rooms weve found in our trip, our room was skipped for service twice, only warm water, too many trainees at the restaurant. Only one of the concierges drove the extra mile and helped us with some luggage we sent from Kuwait and delayed at customs. They dont sell alcohol, to have a beer you have to go the Hilton next door and pay like a bottle of champagne. Far from most of the atractions, maybe good fr business.

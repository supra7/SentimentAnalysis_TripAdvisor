This hotel is in a convenient location in the Back Bay area. The lobby is beautiful. I didn't try the restaurant or room service. My single room was small and a little cramped with a small double bed, hardly any closet space and a cramped shower with no tub. The bathroom had hardly any counter space for toiletries, makeup, etc. The shower spray was very powerful, however; I ended up with a huge puddle of water all over the tile floor whenever I used it. Also, there were no available outlets in the room, so I had to unplug a lamp to charge my cell phone. I was told when I checked in that there were no king beds available. I had a choice between the small single room or a room with two double beds. I was alone, so I chose the single room. Had I known how small it was, I would have picked the room with two double beds. I know the hotel was busy and there was a convention being hosted there, but I still find it hard to believe that in a place that size they didn't have any larger single rooms available. Maybe the receptionist gave me a limited choice because I booked the room for a reduced rate on hotwire. Anyway, I was a little disappointed. I expected more from a 3.5 star hotel. By the way, bring your laptop if you need internet access. It's free in your room, but they charge for it in the business center. I wouldn't stay here a second time. There are better options in the Back Bay area for the price.

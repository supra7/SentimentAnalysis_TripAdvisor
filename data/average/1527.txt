Stayed at Secrets Maroma from Feb. 26 thru March 5. The look of the resort is very stark and lacks character. I was very disappointed that our fellow travelers were put in ocean front rooms and we were put in the back of the resort. Rooms are very nice, but was really turned off when I filled up the tub with brown water & had to waste a few hours while the maintenance workers cleared the water...still could not use the tub. We then moved to another room. We stayed at Secrets Capri at an earlier time and thought it was great!

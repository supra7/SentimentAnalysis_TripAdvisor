We booked this hotel because of its proximity to St Pancras station as we had to catch the Eurostar the next morning. For 19 we had a decent sized room which was clean and comfortable. We were on the lower ground floor and could hear and all the passing trains but with a decent pair of ear plugs it didnt bother me much at all. I'm sure being on a higher floor you wouldnt hear the trains but then you would maybe have to put up with traffic noise from the main road. If your only looking for somewhere to crash and not a prolonged stay and you manage to grab a cheap room for 19 then you'll struggle to find a better place to stay.

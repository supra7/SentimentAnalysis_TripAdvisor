Staff is great at the Edegewater and so is the location. What is not so great is the $30 valet fee and the rooms at the Edegewater. The lobby and restaurant are nice but as soon as you step into the elevator it is a great indicator for a feel of the rest of the hotel. As I stepped into the elevator it had the smell of an old casino, there are a lot of scuff marks and the carpet was just dirty. As we walked down the hall towards our room it was pretty much the same feel. We had upgraded to the waterside of the hotel, since coming in the view was just gorgeous so once we walked into our room I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the room. The only modern and nice part of our room was the bathroom at most. We were told that it would definitely be a lot quieter being on the waterside but it wasnt. We always heard the constant noise of the trains running by and the boats sounding off their horns. I never had a decent nights sleep and also found the bed and pillows uncomfortable. At the end of it, I was a bit shocked by the total amount that we paid to stay here verses the quality we received. I would have to say that if you are willing to pay the prices to stay here, look around for a more modern and nicer hotel. It is definitely not worth the price to stay here.

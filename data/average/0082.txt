Very basic hotel and good rate compared to most of the hotels in the area. Stayed here for 3 nights. Excellent staff that was very friendly and helpful. Very central to everything in downtown Seattle. Could definitely use a revamp (lobby, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc). Nonetheless I'd stay here again because the price was very affordable.

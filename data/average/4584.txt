I traveled here for business for the first time and was somewhat disappointed. There is only wireless internet service in most of the rooms, which I can not use with my office laptop for security reasons. I had to switch rooms in order to have high speed internet access... and the internet service seemed to work only some of the time. The connection wasn't working consistently and nobody in the hotel could help. They offered a toll free number for the tech people at the DSL company. The front desk failed to provide me with my mini-bar key and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack in it... There were many many tourists in the hotel, which isn't good for business travelers because they tend to make a lot of noise. I don't think I'll travel here again unless I am a tourist.

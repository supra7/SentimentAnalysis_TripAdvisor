There are 2 totally different reviews for this hotel depending whether you are planning to park there or not. If you are coming by bus, please skip the next few negative lines: The garage is deep underground and unattended - I would never allow my wife or daughter to join me down there and certainly not allow them to go by themselves. Sublevel one, two and three are usually full, while sublevels 4 and 5 are reserved for local apartment renters. That leaves sub level 6 that is usually gated - they expect you to exit your car and find the dungeon phone to call the desk and have them send a person down to open the gate. Nothing like getting out of your car in an unattended, garbage- smelling, dungeon to use the wall phone. Then, once you find a spot 6 levels underground, you need to go through a series of poorly marked, poorly lit, doors to find the elevator. And, of course, they charge $22 per day for this awful adventure. Coming by bus? The lobby is great and the rooms are clean and adequate (although we had no view - just the hotel air conditioner.... pretty bad). The mattresses are not bouncy.... we jumped in and it felt like a sand box. It must be a new style because we did sleep ok. The bathrooms were meticulous and the shower was great. Hence, this is a mixed review (the price of $160/night prepaid was fair). I must say that the staff at the Hilton are truly great. Ruebens and Christopher are part of the concierge staff and there's nothing that they wouldn't do for you. Christopher spent a long time explaining how to get from Montreal to Ottawa and was truly a pleasant fellow that had me thinking positively about the Hilton experience. (clean room, no bugs, friendly staff, fair cost...... I guess thats good).

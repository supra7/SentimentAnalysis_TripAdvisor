This was a good hotel. It's ideal if you are visiting Seattle on business with appointments downtown or events at the convention center (the hotel is a short walk to the convention center). It's also ideal for shopping downtown as most of the main shopping areas start near the hotel. The staff is excellent. Some key items to consider: 1) The hotel is a medium walk, with some steep hills, to many tourist attractions, which could be a bit far for some individuals. However, bus transportation downtown is free. 2) Parking is expensive (although I understand that all of downtown Seattle has expensive parking). We paid approximately $37 per night, including tax, for on-site valet parking. 3) Internet at the hotel is good, but expensive. It was approximately $19 for 48 hours. 4) The gym features above average resistance training and cardio equipment relative to most hotels that I've stayed at. However, there is no pool or hot tub. The area around the hotel, in terms of being a safe neighborhood, is good for jogging/running. There is a major fitness facility a few blocks away from the hotel.

Ok so Mr. Trump.. yes your rooms are beautiful that is a 5 star for sure....Tv in the bathroom mirror, jacuzzi, room atmosphere. But here is what stinks no casino in the hotel, walls are paper thin(train goes by twice a night) hotel pool is basic and music is boring, no restaurants except the lame one In the lobby, no shows, no shops. Closest hotel is the wynn about 5 min walking. So to sum it up I don't plan to stay here again this is Vegas man step it up.

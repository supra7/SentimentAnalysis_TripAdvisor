We live outside of Boston and have stayed at many of the hotels in the area. This hotel is good if you want to stay in the heart of the tourist area. You are next to the Aqarium, walking distance from the North End and Fleet Center ( New Garden) and across from Fanuial Hall. There is a great rooftop deck on the third floor, as well as a great gym and indoor pool. Request a room on that floor if these appeal to you. Most of the rooms do not overlook the water but as soon as you walk out you are at the harbor, by the boats and near a park. This place is best in the summer months. We found the rooms- just okay but the bed was comfortable and you could not hear the outside noise. The biggest detractor for us was the tour busses and heards of tourists as soon as you left the hotel. There is a Legal Seafood across the street and great Italian restaurnats just a few blocks away( try Mikes Pastry). The parking is cheaper at the Boston Harbor Garage on Milk St by the aquarium than at the hotel. If we stayed in that area again we would choose the Millenium- it was the same price, had a terrace and we liked the rooms better. The Marriott Long Wharf is good for kids or people who don't like to walk.

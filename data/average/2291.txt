We were going to stay at Key West for one or two nights so spent a while looking at the hotel options and the reviews. Chose a Friday and Saturday which I accept are the busy nights and after much searching chose Parrot Key due to room size and location which I thought was walkable from the town. We turned up at 5ish and couldn't park as there is insufficient parking for the resort so were told that the Walgreens car park next door had some allocated parking for the hotel. That car park had tow away signs so I had to double check where we could park. We then took all of the cases out of the car rather than the one bag we had packed as I wasn't sure about security - it's also pretty obvious you are a holidaymaker when you walk across thier car park with cases!!. The room was Ok as we had chosen the suite which we discovered is over two floors. It did smell a bit damp though and having just left Hawks Key which was about the same price for the weekend we were very disappointed with the standard. We shared a taxi to the town and then walked back however the front desk had said it was about 15 minutes walk away - if we could do it in that time then we would be in the 2012 Olympics!! Location is very poor.They had no availability for the Saturday night but we wouldn't have extended our stay as we were very disappointed.

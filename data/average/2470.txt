We had a group res of about 14 rooms for a family reuinion, we had family from all over US as well as UK. Most of the desk staff was WODERFUL especially Yubi, she went the extra mile, but what put a BIG dent in our high esteem for the hotel was the extremly disdainful attiitude of senior desk clerk Martha, who was downright RUDE, as was the night auditor,who disappeared for long periods, they basically had the attitude "Why the hell are you here" bordering on xenophobia. In our group were 5 hoteliers inc myself,we operate from a Hilton Garden down to a Super 8 , if any of my staff were to show this bad an attitude to guests they would be facing extensive retraining or even dismissal. Also the breakfast was COLD two days running, those who came in for b/fast at 6 am found luke warm food if you came in later you were out of luck, as they refused to let us use microwave, there were vegetarians in our group, they were told there was no fruit even when we could SEE piles of it inthe back kitchen. Overall for me, an eyeopening stay as far as service is concerned I am glad the staff at my hotel is well trained.

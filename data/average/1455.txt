Hi guys!! Ok, I want to high light the good and the bad. I will be the first to admit that I might be sort of a resort snob...I like things nice and I like things luxurious so my expectations at times can be a little high. However, when you see 5 stars next to a resort, you assume that is what you will be getting. The food~ I have had better tuna fish out of a can BUT I am from Louisiana and it is hard to beat our seafood and our flavor so again, this is my opinion =) I will say that Portofino had ok steaks and lobster but it was only bc I brought tony's and tabasco haha. The rooms~ were a 5 out of 10 at best. Musty and damp most days. Get an ocean front or a swim out ) The beach was beautiful and the pool areas was a blast each day. Hard to get drinks at times and like pulling teeth to get drinks in your room. Entertainment was hilarious...they had Mexican American Idol....this was AWESOME =)) I will definitely try out other Secrets/Dreams resort, just wouldnt return to this one...been there, done that. If your wanting 5 star luxury , I would totally wait until August and visit Secrets, The Vine in Cancun a couple of months after it opens (give them time to work out the kinks) It looks AMAZING!!! hope this helps. Fun travels!!!

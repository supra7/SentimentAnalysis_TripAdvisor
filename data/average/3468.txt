If there is one word that we can use to describe this hotel then it is "functional". Our room was clean, well kept and certainly met our expectation. It was also good to see the inclusion of tea/coffee making facilities ... which is uncommon in our experience of European hotels. The staff themselves were polite and helpful ... though lacked warmth of personality. A good selection of foods were available for breakfast. Our overall impression was that of a good, functional hotel, but lacking charm and character. The hotel is worth considering but bear in mind it's location. You can't easily pop into the centre... it takes a good 20 to 30 mins to walk to St.Mark's Square ... and most of the tourist sites are there or on the other side of town. This time can however be reduced by using 'vaperetto' (public boats) which has a stop just near the hotel. It can also pose a problem if your flight home is early in the day from Trevisio airport, as the logistics of getting there means a very early start.

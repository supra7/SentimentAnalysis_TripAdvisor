The hotel was clean and in a great location. Rooms were small but comfortable and free wireless was a great benefit. Our first room was extremely loud and the staff were more than happy to move us to a much quieter room which was much appreciated. House cleaning however was very loud in the morning and failed to remove unwanted rubbish from our room. As there were no printers, so when we asked a staff member to print some tickets for us she was rather rude about it. I don't know why as she was standing there doing nothing anyway. Overall the stay was ok. As my title says, it wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't terrible.

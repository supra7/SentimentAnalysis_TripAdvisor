This Hotel was pretty nice. Customer service was just ok at the desk. The room was a nice size. The bathroom was nice. The was a clear shower door which is a nice change from the shower curtains. The room was clean. The only thing weird about the room was there was a pillar in the middle of the floor. I thought that was strange. If you got up in the middle of the night and forgot it was there, that could be dangerous. The only other crappy thing was that the referigerator was making a weird noise all night that kept me awake. When I mentioned it to the front desk at check-out, you can tell they didn't care. Overall, the airport is super close and the rooms were nice.

The good parts: A great location right on the Mag Mile...but not close enough to an "L" stop to be truly convenient to public transportation; One of the nicest beds I've slept in...but the slippery comforter kept sliding off so I had to flip it over to the fuzzier side. Great toiletries. The bad parts: Costly and slow internet; broken A/C in the workout room (but otherwise a really well-equipped room with high-grade headphones and lemon-infused ice water...no one seemed to care that the workout room was 85 degrees either); a Ritz-Carlton going up next door that blocks views (Howdy Neighbor!); housekeeping kept insisting on cleaning my room two hours after I checked in (never knew I was that much of a slob).

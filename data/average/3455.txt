an easy stay with excellent staff. at best this hotel should be classed as the upper end of utility. difficult to appreciate it's creative 4# classification. room size was utility and at times could feel claustraphobic. bed was 2 singles put together with a very definite ridge between them. bar is actually in the dining room and not a comfortable area to sit in. dining is at specific times in the evenings only and closed on sunday following braekfast linen spotless and a very clean hotel. outside is very utility and not very imaginative given we are in venice

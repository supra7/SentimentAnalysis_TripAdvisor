I have never written a review but use them all the time to make sure I get exactly what I am looking for.. in this case I am disapointed in the Hyatt.. the grounds are very nice and the location is fine, but the rooms.. hardly a 4 star hotel they are in serious need of a upgrade, they smelled of cigarrete and the second day I found a dead coachroam in the bathroom, I asked for the cleaning service to go up as fast as possible they took two hours.. almost every day the cleaning service was there around 2:00pm.. for me this is late since I have a two year old that needs her naps.. the spa not a big deal nice views but not as beatiful as other spas I have been.. by the way the forgot about my appointment waited in their waiting room for half an hour until someone passed by to see what had happened.. I had to cancel since I really did not have time to wait.. they did apologize and sent me strawberries that night.. but still I think I should mention.. the food is very good, the service is good (except for the cleaning group) the beach towel system they follow somewhat of a pain.. I wanted this vacation to be special but the hotel disspaointed me because of the rooms.. probably just expected more.. Luau was very nice and worth seeing it..

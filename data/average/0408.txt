This hotel is on a hill so if you plan to walk from the hotel to the many nearby attractions, be ready to work your quad muscles, because walking up the hill can be literally breathtaking:) I am exaggerating a bit, but it is a leg workout nonetheless. The lobby areas are nicely decorated in a modern design, there is a nice bar and lounge area with a big flat screen TV where I watched people eating dinner in front of. The 28th floor has a restaurant with beautiful city views and it also has a small fitness facility and salt water or saline pool (I can't remember which). It is a 15 min walk to the monorail which takes you to the Space Needle and lots of shopping and restaurants along the way. Also the hotel is just a hop, skip and jump to the modern public library. One drawback it that it is located next to a freeway, so if you're smog sensitive perhaps this is not the place for you.

Easy access Went to Frankfurt for a couple of days and we were looking for cheap and convenient. This location offered both. It is only a couple of blocks from the Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (Central train station) and although the streets are lined with sex shops, there is a heavy police presence and I never once felt unsafe walking down the street. The rooms are nice and clean and have very interesting color choices. Shower and toilet in the hallway, but these were also nice and clean. The elevator works fine, but is VERY small.

This was our first time in Chicago. We decided to stay at the Palmer Hilton because it was downtown, had a pool, was a Hilton hotel and had cheaper (still expensive) parking than other hotels. Originally, we booked through Marlin Travel for 179.99/night. We requested a king size bed but when we got there, we were arranged 2 doubles. They offered to upgrade to a king with premium services; orderves from 5-9pm, unlimited non-alcoholic drinks and snacks all day and a contiential breakfast for 39.99/night for the upgrade. We decided to upgrade. So the room was 179.99 + 39.99 for the upgrade + 37 dollars for self parking (they wanted 61 for valet). The building was beautiful in the lobby. The staff were so nice and courteous.Plenty of weddings and events were going on and I can see why. It looked as though you were in the middle of Italy with a painted ceiling and columns around. However. The room was small. Very small. There was no couch, just a basic bed, basic desk and a TUBE tv. The remote hardly worked. The bathroom was most disappointing. You could not sit on the toilet with the door open as it would hit your knees. The door also hit the bathrub when opened. You couldn't get ready in the morning without closing the door. The shower head was a duel-like shower which was the only benefit. There was no seperate shower. The room also did not have a mini fridge, it did have a safe though. The pool was nice- it had a nice skylight. It was also nice that the hottub was seperate from the pool. The towels in the pool area were very nice. Overall, due to the cost, I would not stay at this hotel again. You do not get enough for what you are paying.

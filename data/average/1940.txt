we stayed at the KBH. i already knew what to expect, so i was not put out by the dingy, out of date lobby or the musty rooms. there were no leis or friendly greeters, just a tired check in person, we arrived at 400 on a friday. we got to our ocean front room only to find a huge tree blocking the view in front and a wall extending out 10 feet on our right, blocking the view towards black rock. we were grateful that they had another room available which gave us a practically unobstructed view up and down the beach. we were on the 3rd floor and felt like we were on the beach -- made THE difference in the whole trip! if you dont like people noise during the day, dont get these rooms, if you love to see the ocean and whales jumping from your room at all hours of the day, it is worth it (ok,ok not if your view is blocked by a tree and a wall). DO NOT EAT at this hotel. neither the aloha plate (THE MOST NASTY OF FOODS),the tiki grill (why we ate here and got Costco frozen pattie hamburgers and not the Hula grill which is 50 yards from this hotel is beyond me)or the actual restaurant, you will be disappointed with all of these.the tiki bar was a nice friendly place and the mi tais were good. the grounds we very clean and meticulously kept. i would not like this hotel if i didnt get the room that i did. although below us was construction during the day, all 7 days we were here, the view still made our stay bearable. keep in mind that when people say it (this hotel) is a glorified motel 6, they are correct. check out was done by an elderly woman who could not use a computer to save her life. ... but again, the room made my stay here wonderful. i rated this at a 3 becuase i felt that even though my room's view was magnificent, i paid big bucks for it, so that should be a given. the rest of the hotel was just ok.

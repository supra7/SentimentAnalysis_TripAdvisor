We stayed at the Hilton San Dieigo Bayfront for four nights in December 2011. Our US645 + taxes/per night corner room (including buffet breakfast and internet) was slightly larger than a conventional hotel room with two double beds. Howerever, we felt that at this price; our money basically paid for a great view. The room didn't have a bar refrigerator and there was only one paper cup for dripolator coffee. The decor was nice but by no means luxurious. As the hotel was close to the busy convention centre, it was stretched to capacity with guests. This was particulary noticable in the hotel dining room. Four mornings in a row there were long cues of people outside the restaurant all standing around in groups with electronic tags waiting to be called up for a breakfast table. Once inside the restaurant: food, plates and cutlery were insufficient for the number of people wanting to eat. Many containers of buffet food were empty and I couldn't believe they only had one small double toaster for hundreds of people to use. Also, if your seeking a decent coffee - you won't find it at this hotel. Furthermore, if your just in San Diego to only attend a convention, then the Hilton Bayfront is adjacent to the convention centre but it is several large city blocks from Horton Plaza - the main shopping mall in the Downtown Area. We don't think we received value for money at this hotel and when we return again to San Diego we will probably stay at a hotel at the other end of the convention centre which is of a similar price, more luxurious, and closer to Downtown.

I recently spent two nights at the Crowne Plaza. I have stayed at other CP hotels and been impressed. Our stay at this property was at best average. I find Seattle to be generally expensive when it comes to accommodation but the beds were hard, the food was bad and the service was mediocre. Although the location was good, I will try another hotel on my next visit to Seattle.

The hotel has an excellent location - short walking distance (2-3 minutes) from most attractions in Sultanahmet and great restaurants. Also, hotel offers free wi-fi. The breakfast is good, with a nice selection and variety. I arrived several hours prior to check-in and the hotel staff was kind enough to send me to breakfast (free of charge, although I didn't stay there the night before) while they got the room ready. I had booked a deluxe room with a city view, which on the website is described as having a king-size bed and an excellent view of the city. The first room I was shown had 2 queen-sized beds and looked out onto the small side street and the building across the way. I said that this is not the "excellent view of the city" they had advertised and asked to see another room. The next room I was shown can only be described as the smallest hotel room I had ever encountered in my 10+ years of traveling to Europe. It had a queen-sized bed against one wall and just enough space (approximately 1-2 meters) to walk along one side of the bed or along the foot of it. The bathroom was much more spacious; actually the bathroom was only slightly smaller than the room. There was no place to put the suitcase, there were no drawers for clothes (only a tiny, 1 meter wide hanging closet) and there is no way that 2 adults can use this room at the same time (one would have to sit on the bed to allow the other to walk around). However, the reason I settled on this room was because of the terrace. The terrace, shared with 3 other rooms, was wide, spacious, and had views of the Blue Mosque. The air-conditioning was mostly a fan (blew the air without cooling it).

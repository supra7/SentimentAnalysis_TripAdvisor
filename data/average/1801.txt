My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights during our honeymoon. And even though the resort is beautiful, it was not exactly what we were looking for. Previous to our stay we had been staying in Kauai's North Shore and was overwhelmed with the peaceful beauty of the land. We arrived on a Saturday at the Hyatt and was taken back by how massive the resort was and how many people were at the pool. If we went back to Maui again, we would stay at a less crowded resort. When trying to select a resort for our Maui stay we went back and forth between the Ritz, Four Seasons and Hyatt. Thinking back, I wish we had picked the Ritz or Four Seasons for our honeymoon. Hope this helps future honeymooners!

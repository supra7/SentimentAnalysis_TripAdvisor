We stayed at the Trump in August 2011, but would not stay there again. Though the hotel has some definite pros (see below), they are far outweighed by the cons. Pros: Fantastic service and very friendly staff. Lovely, clean rooms, nice pool, fluffy towels. The spa is fantastic--I had a wonderful, wonderful massage with Wally. There is no casino in the hotel, and, therefore, no nasty smoke smell in the lobby. Cons: the hotel is located slightly off the strip, so is a little inconvenient (there is a shuttle that takes you to the strip, but it stops running at midnight). The biggest con of all (and why we would not recommend or stay at this hotel again) is that it is incredibly noisy because, due to a serious design flaw, the room and suite doors slam shut (very loudly). During the day, it is merely annoying--at night, it is unbearable. The constant sound of doors slamming (at all hours of the night--after all, it is Vegas) repeatedly woke both me and my husband up both nights that we stayed there.

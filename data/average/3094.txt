The hotel was situated in a good location and was very easy access to public transport. A bit noisy during the night due to the tram passing through. There were a couple of nice nearby cafes/bars in the area. Our hotel room was very clean with fresh towels everyday, however the room we had needed to be maintained and updated due to a broken toilet seat and a leaky sink. It also needed a lick of paint. The breakfast was very basic and the staff only spoke a little amount of english, although they were very friendly. Overall, the hotel was small and quaint and was good value for money.

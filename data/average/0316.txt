Not sure why folks are so down on this place. Our room was very clean, nicely appointed. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but if you are doing more than sleeping in your hotel room while you visit Seattle, there's something wrong with you. ;) I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced hotel, conveniently located.

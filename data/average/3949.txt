First of all let me say that this is my 3rd consecutive year staying here. On the good side, it is a great place if you have children. The property is (mostly) fenced in and children of all ages ride around on bikes, skateboards, scooters and anything else they can find. The mgmt. shows movies on Saturday nights. The beach area is waveless and safe. It is a much quieter place than Campland on the Bay which is close by and can be heard across the water at night. The negatives are that the property is basically a giant asphalt parking lot with very little distance between spaces and no privacy. Because the area is safe, many parents let their kids run wild and more than once I've had to tell children that my campsite is not their play area. The mgmt. advertises internet access. It is poor at best. Each year they claim it's new and improved and each year it is crappy. They also claim to have cable tv. Of the 18 or so channels listed as available, I get 6 and most are the quality of an old school aerial antenna. The previous 2 years, I had a spot on the entrance road of the facility. The adults were noisier than the kids late at night. This year I moved over the southernmost row and have found it quiet and peaceful.

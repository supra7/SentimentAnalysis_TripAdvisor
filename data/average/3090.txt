We stayed here for two nights from 24 to 26 Jul 09. We made our reservation directly with the hotel on its website. For the price we paid (CAD$194.48/night plus $20/day for parking) , we expected breakfast to be included but was told when we got there, breakfast was an extra CAD$16/person. Check-in was fast and without any hassle. Parking was at the underground parking lot accessible by elevators. Security was very good as you need to use your room card key to use the elevators and to enter the parking lot. We were assigned a room on the 2nd floor with terrible view. The room was ordinary (2 queen-size beds, TV, fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, small bathroom). The bathtub was dirty though; there was dirt around the tub. We had our breakfast at the Cafe Circo at the lobby on the second day. It was a buffet with your choice of eggs/pancakes/bacon/sausage cooked to your liking. Cost for two adults was CAD$31.50. Our 4-year-old ate for free. We were not too impressed with the breakfast so decided to go a nearby Chez Cora the next day. The swimming pool, hot tub and fitness center are on the 11th floor, also accessible with the room card key. Location is excellent as it is just two blocks away from the main shopping district. Overall, it was an okay stay, but we would not stay there again because it is not good value for money. Wew ould try the Holiday Inn next door the next time we are in Montreal.

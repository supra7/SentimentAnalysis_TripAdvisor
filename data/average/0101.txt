Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor, our expectations were high. After staying for 3 nights, we felt the hotel was definitely overrated. Location is good, view on roof is fantastic (the great weather helped). Rooms are okay (though we requested a room away from the street noise and did not get it). Valet staff went above and beyond. However, we did experience issues with Maid Service and Concierge. Several times the maid knocked once then barged into the room (early in the morning, no less). On two occasions we phoned the Concierge service for restaurant advice, they said they would phone back and never did. In the spirit of a boutique hotel, they did not have evening/late night dining or room service. I would recommend to friends, but with some caveats.

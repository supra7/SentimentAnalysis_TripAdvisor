This hotel is nice had a clean comfortable bed, the bathroom is clean, the staff is ok, dont use their transportation service is a rip off, just get a cab out side, outside of the hotel smell like a fish, well is in the midle of china town, so go figure, is kinda dead at night a little scary to walk to the subway, so at night we get a cab instead, there is a lot of chinese restaurant arround, we tried a few places since we love chinese food they all great. if you on the budget this might a good place stay, but I wouldnt pay more than 100/night to stay here, I rather move to long island city much cheaper and more better neighborhood!

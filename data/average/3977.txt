....we found that the deluxe apartments are not worth the extra money we paid for on our recent New Years Eve trip. There were 4 of us (all adults) but discovered only a 2 seater in the lounge and again only 2 seats on the balcony. The room was very plain and lacked colour and style but did have all the things we needed like toaster, glasses etc. For a deluxe apartment you would normally find an IPOD docking station and bath robes but there weren't any of these. The TV in the master bedroom didnt work and the shower screen in the second bedroom leaked. HOWEVER, To be fair the staff were lovely, the location was perfect for us and the hotel facilities such as the pool, sauna, steam etc were fantastic. The complimentary wifi was also a bonus, the apartments just seemed very average compared to others close by....maybe a little TLC, colour and a few added extras to the deluxe apartments would justify the higher rates.

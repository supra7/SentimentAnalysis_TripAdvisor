I stayed here with my husband and 19month old daughter after reading all the reviews her on T.A. It is a beautiful location and we chose an oceanfront room b/c we have an infant and knew we could hangout on the lanai while she was in bed. The rooms was lackluster but the view was amazing. The grounds were beautiful. The staff was OK....I didn't get the Ohana vibe at all. We had 2 instances when the staff was clueless. I probably would stay here again but might upgrade for a place where the staff were a bit more accomodating.

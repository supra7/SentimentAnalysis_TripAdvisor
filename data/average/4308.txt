Having just returned from a week at the Boston Park Plaza the only let down was the room to room noise. As far as my wife and I were concerned the sound proofing could be better. The bathroom was small by US standers but did it's job, good shower and clean. Good bed and clean room. Lots to do and see, we walked most places, Coply shops, the harbour ,Park ,and part of the Freedom Trail. If you do not have time for a sit down breakfast there is coffee and patries etc to go by the bar area. Bonfire the onsite restaurant is very good, great steak (but closed Sunday's) Would I recommend it to a friend, Yes, but would have to mention the room to room noise.

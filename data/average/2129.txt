I've stayed at the Hotel Washington several times now. The location is outstanding, one block from the zocolo, across the street from the Juice Bar Canada, just a few feet from Cafe El Popular and La Blanca for late night eats. Clean, small rooms, tiny bathrooms but everything one needs. The towels and bedding have been recently upgraded, and the city is in the midst of renovating the colonial facade. No frills, but a bargain at the price.

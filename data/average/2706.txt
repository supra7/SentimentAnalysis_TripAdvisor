Pro's - 1) Great location (Walking distance to Michigan Avenue Shopping, Portillo's, Rain Forest Cafe, Rock and Roll McDonald's, Lou Malnati's Pizza, Uno's Pizza, etc... 2) "Most" reception personnel are nice and friendly... 3) Breakfast is good (Didn't care for the mass produced powdered eggs) 4) Decent fitness center Con's - 1) Prices are not that beneficial to AAA or Government travelers... 2) Rooms are not conducive to anything longer than a two day stay for two people with luggage. I asked for a larger room, for $20 extra per night, with only extra hallway space (No extra livable space)(Very limited clothing storage space)... 3) Parking in the attached garage is $38 for hotel residents, but there's a $28 garage around the corner at Kinzie and Clark streets (next to CVS Drugstore) (If you stay in the attached hotel, you "CANNOT" get a luggage cart from the hotel and take it back to your vehicle.... You "MUST" have the concierge/bellhop retrieve your luggage with a luggage cart OVERALL: The hotel is a great stay so long as you get a great deal on the price (do your homework), stay in the $28 garage around the corner, and travel very light

Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The cocktail hour was fun and the food for breakfast and dinner was great. Location is good and with police constantly patrolling downtown, we felt fairly safe. The rooms are a little rundown with cracked walls and water damaged shower. It took forever for our air conditioner to cool the room. I think the cost of parking is unreasonable.

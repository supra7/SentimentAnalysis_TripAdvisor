This hotel is located perfectly for first time visitors to Boston. Location is key. You are on the waterfront, beside the Aquarium, the best place to eat - Legal Seafood is just across the street, the trolly car stop is just outside of the hotel, and its the starting point of the trolly tour, This is a must do, for $38.00 for a two day trolly pass you can get on and off the trolly to see the city. You got to stop at the second stop - the USS Constitution, and museum - free tour of the ship, its facinating! then you can walk the freedom trail to Bunker Hill, which is very nice, then hop back on the trolly and go to the next stop. Quincy Market is located steps away from the hotel so that is convenient. You can walk over to the Barking Crab for a lobster dinner. Overall, the location is the best thing about this hotel. Hotel is clean, pool is very small, the beds are not so comfortable neither the pillows. The bathrooms have bath & body works aromatherapy soaps and lotions - very nice. I forgot my jacket in the hotel room, and they were kind enough to fed ex it to me at no charge and I live in Canada. Now that's service!

My husband and I live on Oahu and made our first trip to Maui in June. After reading the reviews of the hotel and looking at pictures, I felt confident in my reservation. I was very disappointed upon my arrival. I did not feel like the pictures of the hotel told a true story. From what I could see, the entire hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. Everything looks tired and worn. Our room was at the far end of the complex and there was no elevator to our third floor room. Not a huge deal because we are young and only had a weekend bag. This would be a big deal to older visitors and those with large suitcases. We had free vouchers for the hotel's breakfast buffet at the Mixed Plate restaurant. We got take out the first morning since we were catching an early snorkel trip. We were some of the first people in line so there was no excuse for the poor quality of the food. We took two bites and threw it away. We didn't even bother to go back the next morning. If you are traveling to Maui on a budget and don't mind cheap hotels, this hotel will do. Just don't expect any bells or whistles. They didn't even have shampoo and conditioner in the room. It is well-located on the west side of the island and you can walk to the Whalers Village for meals and entertainment. If you are looking for a resort experience, this is not the hotel. Not a great pool and not much atmosphere. Luckily, we knew this was not are only trip to Maui so we made laughed it off and made the best of it. If this would have been my honeymoon, yearly vacation or one and only trip to Maui, I would have been very upset.

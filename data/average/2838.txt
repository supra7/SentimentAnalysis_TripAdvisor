We loved the location of the hotel since it was easily accessible and was basically a 2 min walk to Las Ramblas- right smack in the tourist area. The hotel room & bathroom were clean with modern fittings. However, the room was a little too small for our liking especially since we had 2 big luggages with us. We were happy with the free wifi & safe. Don't bother with the breakfast since there are better and cheaper options in the surrounding cafes. We didn't have issues with any noise, possibly because the room was on the higher level. If you need to do laundry, there is a laundromat in the small alley next to the hotel, which offers the service at a decent price. I would not hesitate here, if I'm travelling light given the small rooms.

Stayed at the Moore of 4 nights in July 2008. The location is excellent, central for what you will want to see in Seattle. Not far from Pike Place Market, close enough for breakfast! We were in one of the top floor rooms with a shared bathroom. Generally, it was just OK, BUT FOR WHAT TOU PAY, I don'tthink it can be bettered. It is clean, comfortable, and excellent value for money

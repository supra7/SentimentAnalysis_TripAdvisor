Kimpton Hotels are always funky and fun, but Hotel Vintage Park is a bit more grown up and elegant. We are local and wanted a quick get away, so the actual hotel didn't matter. We got a great price on priceline. The hotel has a wine theme and each room is named after a Washington winery. Nice touch. The room was nicely decorated but small. Our view was a painted wall, facing the back of the building. While the view was nothing, it was quiet. The bed was too soft, but nice linens. The bathroom vanity and shower tub were too small. Everytime someone turned on the water or shut their door, we heard the noise. Overall, it was fine, but not outstanding.

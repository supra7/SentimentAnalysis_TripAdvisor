We have been coming to this fabulous resort for nearly 10 years now and this is first time I have noticed the wear and tear. Looks just a bit beat up and to be honest they are trying to update and remodel while staying open. I great hotel on a great island. Also, the food on Maui in general has deteriorated, the fish at the restaurants seems "old" and many of the servers are not native islanders anymore- seems like an influx of eastern European servers and shop help. What's up with that?

I liked the look and feel of this hotel. It's older, but it has personality. My room was clean but also a bit worn, with an older Zenith analogue TV (but a very nice new and easy-to-use Sony clock radio) next to the bed. It was a bit dark, and could have benefited from a lamp next to the sofa for reading purposes. The service was rather friendly although not too polished at times. Attention to detail seems an issue: when I checked into my room, there was a card and gift addressed to another guest and my check-out took awhile owing to a credit card mix-up. Warning for those who like to use room service: there is none at this hotel during a renovation of the restaurant downstairs (there is, however, a complimentary Continental breakfast spread in the morning in the lobby, which includes a fireplace). One thing I really liked at this hotel was the long list of complimentary 'on request' amenities for the rooms, including humidifiers. I would return to this place, because the price is right and the staff have the right attitude. After the restaurant is open again, and with some more room modernization, I imagine it will be especially nice.

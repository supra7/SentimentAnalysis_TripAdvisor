The good parts: Location, lots of restaurant by the hotel, bus service, trains are near by. If you want a taxi, let them call it for you. The A/C works great but only in the rooms. The hallways are NOT A/C. Some of the bad parts: First, there is a smell of sewage. My bathroom had this smell as did the spot outside the breakfast room. I am not sure what was up with that but I am so glad I don't have to smell it anymore. Second, the breakfast was good however one day an Italian family came in and took the toast basket. I asked the lady for some toast and she gave me about 8 pieces of toast. I had 2 pieces and took off. She ran after me and asked if I wanted my toast. I thought it was kind of odd. Third, it is a huge tourist spot. There are people everywhere. Be aware that getting out of the door can be hard. Fourth, the internet is insanely slow. If you are hoping to upload pictures, think again, It is about the speed of a 56K modem for 8 euro/24 hours. Fifth, the shower usually caused the floor to be flooded. I don't know what the deal is but I found it best to take the shower head off to shower. Otherwise, water leaks out onto the floor. Sixth, the ceiling as leaking water one day. It was from the a/c unit. I let the front desk know but they didn't do anything about it. So if you want a good location which is kind of nice... this might work for you.

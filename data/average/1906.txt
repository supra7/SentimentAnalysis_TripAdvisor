It's a good option if you're on a tight budget, but you do get what you pay for. You feel like a poor cousin next to far more expensive hotels, but you have access to the same beaches, shops, and restaurants at 1/3 to 1/2 their price. We were first given a room that was very old and smelled strongly of turpentine (they were working on the room next door.) After we complained, they gave us another room that was better, but not by much. We paid for partial ocean view, but neither rooms had it. The pool is small and not worth dipping in when you have the vast ocean in front of you. Food is very average but costs just as much as other hotels and is far more pricey than restaurants close by, so go somewhere else for your meals. You'll see lots of seniors on fixed incomes here.

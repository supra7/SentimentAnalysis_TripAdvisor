We had booked a Superior room with seaview; when we checked in and went to our room, this was a bigger room but facing a wall. When we called reception, the Manager came around and apologised but they were double booked and prom,ised to move us to his best room the next day. To compensate, he offerred us dinner and free use of sauna/steam. The following day we were moved to a supposedly excellent room but was small with insufficient space to get in and out of the bed easily, no set of drawers, no table, tiny tv and the smallest bathroom we have seen anywhere. The point is that when checking us in, they knew we were not being given the type of room we had booked but failed to mention this, i.e. they wouldn't have said anything if we hadn't complained and the Manager was not interested enough to check that we were happy after moving us. By the way, breakfast was limited in variety and the same everyday for the five days we were there. Finally, whilst one would expect to pay for a Turkish bath, massage etc., we did not expect to have to pay for the sauna or the steam room.

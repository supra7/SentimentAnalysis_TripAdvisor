The hotel is located on the outer edge of central Seattle on a very safe street; the staff is very customer oriented; the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. OK, what was wrong? The window wall is two sets of sliding glass doors that admit lots of street noise and serious drafts- on a cold, rainy night that was a big negative. The room's decor was black and gold, circa 1972 vintage Holiday Inn- gross, dated and depressing. The hallways were worse. In fairness to the hotel, they are in the process of renovating. In fairness to you, understand that a 'standard' room is a to be avoided, unrenovated room. Based on my view of the public areas and my room, I would rate the hotel 2 stars. Having experienced it, I would pay a lot more money to stay elsewhere.

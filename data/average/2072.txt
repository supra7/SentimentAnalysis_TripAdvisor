We got off to a bad start. Arriving about 6pm on a Saturday night with a written confirmation of a king room, we were told our room had been given to someone else (incorrectly, it was claimed), and there was only one room left, with a smaller queen bed in the bedroom, and it was in the process of being made up. The manager was very apologetic, but not particularly convincing. We had booked a 2-night stay, and he only offered a $5 per night consideration. He insisted that he drive us to our restaurant. We noted that there was a broken makeup mirror removed from the wall in the bath, as well as a similarly removed broken glass shelf above the sink - both stored in a cabinet. Although the hotel claims that it is just a couple of years old, the furniture seemed much older. Our room turned out to be the most accessible to the street, but even it was up two flights of stairs. Other rooms are higher. On the plus side, the hotel was clean and quite, well located to the metro, and we even walked one night from the old town. We appreciated the mini-kitchen and the free parking. Our recommendation would be to confirm the particular room you reserved before arriving.

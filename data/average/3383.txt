This place is located in one of the hottest locations of the city. Darling Harbour is 10 minutes walk from the bridge. Its location makes it an excellent place to stay.City shuttle running free of cost can be taken from a stop which is very close to this hotel.Some local eateries near by serve awesome brekkie.This hotel is certainly not very great but indeed a decent place which is located in the centre of the city.

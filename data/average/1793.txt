Stayed at the Hyatt for 5 days in early August with my boyfriend. The hotel itself is pretty nice looking; beautiful outdoor areas, nice pool and beach access. However, for the money we paid I would have rather stayed elsewhere. If you have kids then this place is probably a great bet, but as a couple we would have traded some of the more showy things like penguins, parrots and fancy kiddie pools for some more personal comforts (our bathroom was really tiny, while on the beach you need to walk 5-10 min for a nice stretch, constant waiting for elevators, etc). Wasn't a big fan of the restaurants at the hotel either and parking can be a pain given beach access and luau onsite; didn't like that kids were constantly in the hot tub splashing around. Also note that they tell you that internet is free when you check in but that is only because they recently upped the daily resort fee to $25 from $15 ($10 of which is internet). Net, net the hotel appears quite family friendly and it is pretty nice looking - especially outdoors (service was fine) - it just wasn't our cup of tea.

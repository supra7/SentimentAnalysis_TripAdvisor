Due to a problem with our vacation rental and after an extremely long journey we were forced to find a room in a hotel for one night. It was 11.30pm and exhausted we headed out on to the main road and came straight upon the Destiny Palms Hotel. The staff at reception were extremely helpful and gave us the last available room, a twin room with two double beds, perfect for us and our two children. Too tired to pay much attention to the room we collapsed into bed. Daylight came and we were able to see our room more clearly and although adequate for the $54 walk in charge, flat screen TV's, extremely comfortable beds and great water pressure in the bathroom, there were certain areas that the hotel could improve on. There is a very musty smell that permeates the whole hotel - possibly from either the AC units or the carpets. The shower was old and not the cleanest we have seen but the wash basin outside the main bathroom was a plus. Breakfast was included in our room charge however we chose to give it a miss and head to our villa. For the budget traveller this hotel is a great find as it is close to shops and restaurants and only a 10 minute drive from the Disney Parks. The hotel could do well by improving its cleanliness and finding a solution to the musty smell but at such a reasonable price per room as a base while in Kissimmee it serves its purpose.

Stayed at the Wyndham Chelsea Garden this past Monday night. Our room was ok - very clean, typically smaller for NYC. We had a double so there was not much room to walk around beds. Not even a chair to sit on other than the desk chair - which we used to hold one of our suitcases. The lobby was teansy - nothing other than high stools for guests to sit on. A comfy chair would have been nice. Our room must have been over what was a staging area for LOUD garbage trucks. They circled the street, reloaded and dumped ALL night under our room window. It was LOUD! We did not sleep at all!!!!! Maybe better quality windows would have helped. Or, offering to put guests on higher floors on garbage nights. Would not stay there again b/c of this issue. For $300/night, was not worth it.

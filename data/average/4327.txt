We just returned from the Park Plazza on Saturday the 19th. The great location made it worth the stay...but the rooms really need work. Lots of noise...including the elevator. We purchased nothing nor ate anywhere in the hotel...used room service once. Compared to the $110.00 Priceline bid, the hotel was what I expected.

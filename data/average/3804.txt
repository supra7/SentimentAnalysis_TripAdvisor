We needed to be near my daughter and stayed there as the hotel has had such good reviews and it seemed a good price based on what we were charged- 49 per night. Downstairs was very shabby- a definite turn off and the kitchen which was in the basement, was shared by guests. People can cook for themselves and can make complimentary use of eggs, bread and milk. It seems a generous and great idea, but the reality of cooking with other residents of all kinds wasn't practical or inviting. I can't imagine hygiene is great, so we gave that a very wide berth. Fortunately, the bedroom was clean and tidy, though sparsely furnished. The shower was efficient. We found the toilet wouldn't flush- we had to lift off the lid and push down on the 'controls' inside. Also the plug wouldn't work, but rather than have someone coming into our room, we reported both on departure. I accept that you probably get what you pay for, but why are the reviews on Trip Advisor so good? I stay in loads of hotels so I reckon I have a good handle on this.

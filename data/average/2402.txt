It's hard to beat the location of the Rodeway Inn City Center - walking distance to most major tourist sites, convention center (if in town for a trade show), etc. Public transit is also just a hop-skip-jump away. Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean, and as a single traveller, I felt safe. My room had a large flat screen TV, single serve coffee maker and I very much appreciated the 2 free bottles of water that were replenished daily. Cons I encountered: TV remote was finicky (staff resolved), no in-room climate control (staff made adjustment upon request), unable to pickup strong enough signal to take advantage of the free wireless services, cracked tile in bathroom and corner stall shower only (didn't really make a difference to me). Definitely not a 5-star hotel, but I would stay again without question!

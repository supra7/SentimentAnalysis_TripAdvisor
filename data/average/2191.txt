This stay has been a 24hr continum of errors by the hotel. Check in was a nighmare with only half of the stations with attendants. Long wait... We had a large hair ball in our shower, which wasnt cleaned. Rooms are nice. Went to the pool while hotel was cleaning the windows causing s shower of water or cleaning product. Trying to speak to a manager seems near impossible along with other issues,ie roomed not cleaned by 4pm. Stay somewhere else if your looking for service.

stayed for one night in transit. rooms are accessed via outside, this creates a motel feel. perhaps it's so that passengers in transit can get a taste of singapore air, acceptable. internet was not free, what's up with that in year 2012?!! pool closed early, can't see why, in an airport hotel where people are on different timezones! convenient access via skytrain.

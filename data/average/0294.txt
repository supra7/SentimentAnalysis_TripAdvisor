This was the first hotel we stayed on our westcoast trip and we stayed here for two nights. We already booked this hotel at home, especially because of the good reviews of other visitors regarding the great location. It was easy to reach from Seattle-Tacoma airport, a disadvantage is that there is no free parking available, we had to use the parking garage next to the hotel, which costs about 23$/day. The location is really excellent, many sights are in walking distance to the hotel (e.g. Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and Space Needle, waterfront, ...). Our room was nice, clean and had the perfect size. Only the bathroom was a little bit too small, but still okay. The only thing about this hotel which was not acceptable was this terrible smell in the corridor and even worse in the room! Due to the fact that we couldn't open the window entirely, there was no chance to get rid off this disgusting smell. However, after 5 minutes in the room we got used to it. In our opinion the room rate is too high (despite the great location) and therefore we would consider to look for another accomodation in this area for our next visit to Seattle.

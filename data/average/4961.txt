We stayed in the Palmer House Hilton for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon trip. I had reserved a King Size room on the Executive floor. I had forgotten this at the time of checking in. When we checked in they said we were in a Queen. We asked if we could be moved to a King and they said no - the hotel was fully booked. Luggage up to room which was ok but the two Queen size beds seemed quite small. I found our reservation which specifically said King Size and my husband took this down to reception. Magically a King Size room appeared (even though they claimed to be fully booked). No apology. No offer to send someone to help us move our bags. The King Size room was nice though and quite big. On the Executive Floor breakfast is included, and it has it's own area for breakfast. It is pretty poor. It was a free for all and nothing was replaced or topped up. I don't think the Executive floor is actually worth is because the service isn't any better than you'd get in the rest of the hotel. We paid an had breakfast in the main restaurant the next morning and it was so much better. All in all it was ok but I expected much better. The hotel itself is nice but the service let it down. No-one went out of their way to help and they seemed like they couldn't be bothered.

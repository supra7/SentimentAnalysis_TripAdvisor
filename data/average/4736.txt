I was disappointed during my recent stay for a conference. Given the favorable reviews, I was anticipating a much happier experience. Several things were just "off". Although check-in time is posted at three, our room wasn't ready until 4:30. The desk staff appeared either overwhelmed or disinterested. For instance, as I was leaving one day, the counter person asked "Shall I call you a cab?". I responded that I would be taking the 'L'. The response? "I'll have X get you a cab." Also had a rather unpleasant experience with housekeeping. I returned (albeit early afternoon) to find that my room was being cleaned. I dropped off some material and said that I'd be back soon. I returned an hour later and while the room wasn't pristine (water glass still on the table) the beds were made, towels refreshed and I thought all was well enough. As I started to change clothes and relax, there was a knock on the door. It was housekeeping. A rather grumpy "I'm not done cleaning the room yet" came through the door. At that point I didn't want to be disturbed any longer, and said that everything was fine as it was. Too, I realize that the rooms can't all face the river, but our alley facing window did give way to lots of noise (from the 'L' and trash removal). I visit Chicago every couple of years on business and thought I would give something besides the larger chains a try. I certainly will not be re-visiting this hotel, though.

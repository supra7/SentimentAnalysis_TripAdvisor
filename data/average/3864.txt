Didnt know how far out of Rome the hotel was used a taxi from Ciampino Airport and was charged Euro 90 even though it was an official white taxi. Reception staff very helpful day & night. Rooms clean & comfortable. Took the bus and Metro daily to get to & around Rome only problem the bus that stops outside hotels finishes at 8:30pm and the Resturant in the hotel has only one menu that doesnt change and is expensive for what you get, we had no car so looking for somewhere to eat within walking distance was non existant. Breakfast was good and again service good. The bar of a night was hit & miss no one serving. I wouldnt recommend unless you have a car.

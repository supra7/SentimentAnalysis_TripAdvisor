I have stayed at a few Kimptons before and this one was not nearly as nice. I purchased a room through priceline, but only saved about $20 off the regular room rate. When I called the 1-800 number to ask for double beds, the woman on the phone told me that it would be impossible to get double beds because priceline purchases are "read only" in their computer system. Knowing this to be untrue, I called the 1-800 again and was able to reserve a double bed room easily. Unfortunately, when I got to the hotel, no double bed rooms were available. Knowing this to be a risk with priceline, I was not upset. However, the one bed rooms at this hotel are tiny. There was an obvious attempt to "update" the decor in the room, but it was just cheesy and out of date for a 4 star hotel. After returning home, I noticed a $15 charge on my card from the hotel. I called the hotel directly and was told that I was charged for a missing wine glass. I told the representative that I had used a wine glass but that it was still in the room. She said I must have taken it, to which I responded that I live across the country and do not need to steal used wine glasses to take home to the east coast. She finally relented and removed the charge, indicating that when items are moved around the room and not returned to their original location, guests are often charged for taking them. How does that work? Conclusion: in my humble opinion this is a 3 star hotel at best with a good location but not worth the 4 stars or amount it costs.

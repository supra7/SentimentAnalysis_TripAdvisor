The resort itself was convenient to Disney and very quiet when we were there. However, for a resort with very few amenities (pool not heated, no real restaurant on site (just a Tiki bar), poor selection at onsite 24 hr "market"... no beer, no milk), the resort fee seemed excessive. There are plenty of other properties in the area that are similar without the excessive fees. Especially ridiculous was the cleaning fee. It was $39 for a short stay (3 nights or less I believe) and it was truly unnecessary. It made me want to leave more for them to clean up just because I was annoyed at the charge. Staff was fine, but not particularly friendly. I shared an elevator with some of them and they ignored me and continued to talk to one another. Not a big deal, but definitely shows you the difference between this and the more upscale places.

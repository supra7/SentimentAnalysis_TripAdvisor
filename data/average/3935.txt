I chose Anatolia Suites for our 3rd stay in Istanbul as we were ready for a little more independence and autonomy this time. The location is spot on - a very short walk from Arasta Carsisi and Sultanahmet Camii in one direction, Kucuk Aya Sofya in another, or Akbiyik Caddesi if you take a left and follow the back streets. The apartments are clean and roomy - ours would easily have accommodated 4, and servicing is good. Breakfast is sparse and you will probably end up buying your own food from the shop on the corner. However, do not expect more independence or freedom to give friends a cup of tea at your place if you do chose Anatolia Suites - you won't get it, despite being a fully paid up adult. I invited someone in for tea and this was followed by a member of staff checking the kettle to see if it was hot (i.e. had we really used it or was there some dark mystery?). So think of this as a hotel with a bit more room and you have it. If you want to be treated like a grown up - look elsewhere.

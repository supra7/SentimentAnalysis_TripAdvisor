The hotel is conveniently located for business in Dallas. It is clean and functional. The front desk employees are friendly and efficient. Housekeeping leaves a little to be desired. Room was not made up by late afternoon. I was told unless requested, it might only be made up by 5.00pm. Towels are thin to threadbare and cheap. No bottles water in the room on some days. Coffee not always replaced. Response for fresh towels very slow - more than an hour!

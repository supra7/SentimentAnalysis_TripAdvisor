Just got back from Chicago and wanted to write my review while everything is fresh in my mind. We arrived in the early afternoon and our room wasn't ready. Check in was at 3pm, so that was fine. They held our bags and we did some sightseeing. Returned to the hotel and our room was ready. On first entering our room which was 1711 there was a slight odor. Not bad or anything. Then when I went into the bathroom, there was a mildewy smell. I really hate that smell. But it wasn't so bad to ask for a room change. There is no fan in the bathroom and with no air circulation, the mildewy smell is going to occur. So those are some things that bugged me. The staff at the front desks changes often. Most of the staff isn't really that helpful. We asked once for a restaurant recommendation and was given the answer "there are a lot of restaurants, here is a list". That isn't really what I was looking for. Then we asked directions several times and they just weren't helpful and didn't seem to care. There is one perk. Warm cookies are offered around 6:30 to 7:30 and I think again a bit later in the evening. The red line train stops right in front of the hotel so that is another plus. The location is great. Close to everything. I don't think I would stay here again, without attempting to try another hotel first. It isn't that I had a bad stay, but I think I could have had a bit of a nicer room without the smells and staff that would love to help me more.

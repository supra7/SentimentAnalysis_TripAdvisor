hotel was in good shape the beds were really soft and i had a good night sleep the breakfast was very good the staff was very good.....the bad was the tv sets flat screen lg picture quality was poor and had to turn up the volume to 53 just to hear it. and the the bathroom was rather warm. with no air flow .ugly was the housekeeping staff. just a bad attitude.

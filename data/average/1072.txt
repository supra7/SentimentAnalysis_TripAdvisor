This W has a very trendy, scenester-y downstairs bar that can be a lot of fun. However, I'm a woman who has to travel on my own for business and the whole thing can feel vaguely unsafe. The hallways are kept very dark - I guess they think it adds to the ambience. But wandering a pitch black hotel hallway by yourself can feel creepy, especially if you factor in how drunk many of the guests are. I've stayed here a couple of times and have been woken late at night by the sound of someone trying to get into my room. I think it's an honest mistake and happens because the hallways are literally pitch black, but it freaks me out, nonetheless! If you are looking for a place to party in Seattle with friends this is a great option. But if you are a woman traveling alone, skip it and stay at the Westin or Sheraton instead.

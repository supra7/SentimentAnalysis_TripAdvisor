Stayed for three-days conference, dacilities are decent, so are the rooms. Quite good, all in all. However, it is over one and a half hour ride to Taksim (city center) and the public transportaiton cannot be relied on. Taxi would cost you up to 70EUR in one direction, so be aware of this before you haul.

This hotel was very reasonably priced and had free wireless internet, as well as a pretty short walk to the convention center. However, the rooms were pretty drab and there was no room service. The one restaurant did provide takeout, but it took a long time. The staff was very helpful, however, including the folks who helped flag down taxis every day. They did have a "business center" which was a small room with computers, printers and coffee.

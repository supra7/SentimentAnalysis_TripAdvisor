My husband and I stayed for 7 nights at the Hyatt Regency in March. We stayed in a standard garden view room in the main part of the hotel. The Hyatt was a nice hotel that we'd recommend for families. We wanted a quiet, romantic week in Maui but it was far from it. First of all, the walls/doors are way too thin. It was tough trying to sleep past 7-8am every morning. There was noise from construction, parrots saying "Aloha" every minute, kids running around... it was not a restful stay for us. Second, the parking was limited very far from our room. Thirdly, my husband asked one of the service workers which way the parking lot was, and he got the dirtiest look from her. Perhaps it was an obvious question? But since it was our first day at the hotel, we were still trying to figure out where everything was. Although the service was fine and the rest of the people were friendly, we won't be staying at the Hyatt in the future - sorry.

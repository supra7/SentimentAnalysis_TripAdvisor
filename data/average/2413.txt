This room was perfect for our family, almost. It was a suite with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, kitchen and living room. We have 3 kids and it would have been perfect if we had been able to get the crib we had asked for for our baby. The rooms are nice and seem to have been recently renovated. Bathrooms were very clean, but small (separate room for toilet and tub). We had called a few days ahead of time to request a crib and were told no problem. We did not bring our pack n play on the promise of a crib. When we arrived, I asked about it and was told it would be brought to our room. Never came. I called 2 more times to ask about it and while the person at the desk was always courteous and said it would be taken care of, it never came. Baby ended up sleeping in bed with us, so not a restful night! Also, could not get internet connection to work, despite calling help line. Breakfast was pretty good...eggs, waffles, french toast, sausage, cereal, etc. So, if you don't need a crib and internet, this place is great! Good deal for the price.

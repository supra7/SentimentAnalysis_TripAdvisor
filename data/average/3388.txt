Room was OK. Said they gave us an upgrade, only to find it was 2 twin beds pushed together, I guess trying to make a king sized bed??? Liked having the fridge. Not super clean. They LOCKED us out of our room (we had 5 days left) after we had put 2 breakfasts on the credit card saying we were over our credit limit and that they had tried calling our room but we weren't there (duh, they think we vacation during the day in the room?) The breakfast (buffet) were cold. Liked we were near the Central Train station, and the free 555 green bus, and central market (fresh fruits & veggies). Darling Harbour has a restaurant called Pontoon that has 10 dollar lunches, & Nick's has good large breakfasts. Did not like all the homeless people around the area.

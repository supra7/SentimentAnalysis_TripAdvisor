I booked a room for a stay in Boston to do some shopping and to get into the Christmas Spirit. The locale is great, a block off Boylston St. and not too far from Newbury St. shops. Also the Prudential mall is across the street, a great feature for winter shopping, though it does close early on weekdays. The staff at check in was very pleasant. The beds were just ok. No special down comforter as is found in most hotels today. The temperature control for the room was not very reliable. The tv was old school, but had a good variety of channels including HBO. Parking overnight will cost you at least $36 in the nearby garage, a bit more for valet. There is free access to one of two pc's in the lobby for checking email etc. We ran away from the restaurant on site - way too many nicer options to waste a meal there. Hotel was just OK, but locale is desirable.

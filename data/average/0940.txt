First of all, it's not 'by the Space Needle', it's 4 blocks away. That's not 'by' where I come from. On the good side, the Monorail IS by the Needle, so it's easy access to downtown, and only $1 if you're a senior citizen. Didn't like the midnight gatherings of what looked like local hoods in the parking lot or their seemingly free access to the side doors and upper floors, bypassing the front desk 'security', but the place is clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and the free breakfasts were more than welcome. 24 hour coffee also available in the lobby. I'd stay there again ONLY if I couldn't find anything less expensive.

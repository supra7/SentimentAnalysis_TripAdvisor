Spent 4 days on the last part of our latest trip to Mexico - with my wife and son - and it certainly does not compare well with some of the places we have been on Riviera Maya. The grounds are attractive, but the layout is a bit daft, and some areas are just unfinished. The restaurants really are an imbarassment - the Asian fusion one is very bad - the chef should be publicly humilated. The Italian was only marginally better, as was the Mexican, but still both are on the verge of inedible. The ingredients were good, but the execution was just so bad. The wood-fired pizza and the evening grill were the only good food aspects. (They really should fix this problem, because they are destoying their return business). The sports bar has two pool tables, but neither have a complete set of balls. The water park has a "river" to snorkel and kayak, some cenotes to hike to, that are fun, and a bit out of the ordinary, but restricted to tours, rather than doing this on your own. We got to know the young "kids" who ran things there and they were very accomodating to us, though. The beach is not all that terrible as some have described. Not a real volleyball crowd at all, and mostly pickup water polo. We didn't get pressured beyond the first 10 minutes about the timeshare (regardless of what they want to call it) offer, but we made it clear we were not there to sit through anything, since it was our vacation - and did not get bothered at all. All in all - just average - and not an experience you need to repeat. I would suggest to the management that they really need to get things fixed on the food level as it is really bad - it just is....You really ought to be able to at least do good Mexican food - right?

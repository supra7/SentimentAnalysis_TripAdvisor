Just recently returned from SD Hilton for a business trip. It has a good location next to convention ctr (est 10-12 min walk). I had a room on the 29th floor-great view. The hotel has a very modern, kind of a space age decor. Parking was too expensive and you must walk outside to get to the parking garage. Service was very good (all very young). Exec lounge not ready yet. The bar was grossly overpriced. $68 plus tip for 6 drinks. The room service was good but again, grossly overpriced. Same goes for breakfast - I could get much better for less. I like a very hot shower but the water was only warm.

My husband I traveled to Secrets Maroma Beach the 1st week of March. We consider ourselves discerning travelers and travel to Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, and similar quality resorts. Like previous reviewers, we experienced stomach problems soon after we arrived which we attribute to the food and or drinks. Overall, the food is of average quality and the drinks are watered down. The house wine is terrible and the only beer available is Coors or Bud Light. The maid service is also inconsistent and they come for turn down service when you are getting ready for dinner. They do not want to come back and try to hand you extra towels, etc. when you answer the door. We paid significantly more to upgrade to the preferred club which does not give you anything more for your money other than a room closer to the beach. During our stay, a corporate group came in with 230 people who were very loud and abnoxious. They did not know how to behave in such a setting and really did not care about the other guests at the resort. The reason we paid more money for this resort is because we wanted to avoid this type of crowd .... very disappointing indeed. Also, management had overbooked one night while this group was there and had to bribe other guests to move to another resort so they could accomodate them. The resort is located on a beautiful beach and the restaurant and bar staff work very hard. We enjoyed the American Idol and Elvis Shows but the rest of the entertainment is not worth seeing. It is too bad that management does not care about maintaining the ambience that they sell in their brochures. This is a nice resort but not close to 4.5 or 5 star quality. Next year we will be going elsewhere!

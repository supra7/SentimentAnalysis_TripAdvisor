Avoid the single bedrooms around the lift shaft...not enough room to swing a mouse and no fresh air. Double rooms with outside windows seem better. Generally this is a budget hotel with no amenities, but its clean, hospitable, and provides a basic breakfast. The location is great for rambla-ing, and the market. Not so good for taxi service from the airport. I'm 55 so for younger folk this is probably a greater bet. Staff at reception are great.

Big black statues, over-sized lampshades and funky decor. Not really my style but bed was large and comfortable and room very clean. Semi-open plan layout. Great view from 10th floor. Small gym but no pool (weird bit of water on roof terrace labelled as pool but more like small water feature!). Breakfast ok but nothing special. Central location easy to walk to Ramblas, Montjuic and Barceloneta from. Slightly dodgy area so take care. We paid 2 nights with tesco vouchers and for a third ourselves so good value but wouldn't have booked it at full price.

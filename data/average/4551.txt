While the Hyatt had very comfortable and clean rooms in a convenient location, I cannot recommend it. The walls are paper thin. I stayed for three nights and the first night I had a room that had a door to an adjoining room. Between the paper thin walls and the huge gap under the adjoining room door, I could hear a normal conversation clearly. Unfortunately the conversation started well after midnight. When an alarm clock went unattended at 5 AM I packed up and switched rooms immediately. I'll give the staff credit for reacting to the limitations of the hotel but nothing makes up for lost sleep. After moving to a room without adjoining doors, I once again had trouble on Saturday night with young partying guests. I'd imagine they were Priceline customers like I was but it doesn't excuse the noise in the hotel. A security sweep by the hotel quieted down a party in the room next to me at 2:30 AM. But I had to call when people from the room were loitering in from of my door. People were making noise in the halls and slamming doors all night. It didn't help that several floors have a big open atrium so you can hear the noise from all of those floors. I can't imagine someone paying full price for this noisy hotel let alone the Priceline rate.

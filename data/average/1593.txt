RECOMMENDED: I have angst writing this -- should I tell you to stay here or not? Let me get the positives out of the way. The hotel is ideally located in the center of things. The property is all quite modern and the staff is professional & accommodating. We stayed 5 nights in 2 different rooms (our choice). Bedding is comfortable and plenty of lighting in the large rooms. Rooms facing the back courtyard are dead quiet to the extent you can sleep with window open. Some rooms are quite large (floor 1-3), floor 4 rooms take interior space and give you instead a balcony that is quite large (perfect for a cup of coffee). Styling is quite modern. Internet is wireless and free. Small business center with printer. Now for the negatives. The bathroom is open to the room. I don't care how well you know someone, there is a desire for privacy. The dual sinks are stylish but functionally useless, there is no where to put your toiletries. The small size means you splash water everywhere. The room has some unique LED lighting and we could never fully turn it off (I ended up pulling the lightbulbs out). Finally, one Sunday morning, the maids made a huge racket starting at 8.30 in the morning. After a while it became obvious - they wanted the guests up and out.. This is not what you'd expect from this class of hotel. Would I tell you not to stay here? No. Would I tell you to see if there is something else in the neighborhood perhaps as an alternative. Yes. Mgmt suggestions: (1) Put a higher stand in bath area for toiletries (2) Figure out how to kill those LED lights at night or change to normal bulbs).

The good things: 1. Front office officer is nice. I didn't ask for much service so can't rate other service. 2. Comfortable room 3. Small but nice fitness center 4. Integrated with T3 of Changi Airport The not so good ones: 1. The noise from the parked aircrafts penetrates the room 2. It's airport hotel so very far from the city

Most unpleasant check-in experience after transcon flight and car rental. Arrived at hotel and requested to self park car for the night (costs $22). Was told I had to park in one place first, check-in in the office, then come back and move the car. Entrusting a rental to a valet without collision damage waiver is not a smart thing, especially in a cramped parking garage, and I was just too tired at 11 pm to go back and move the car. But staff were extremely unaccommodating. One night when I returned to the garage, the path up to parking was blocked by a car the valet was intending to park, but he just left it with the door open and he was nowhere to be found. A toot of my horn resulted in nothing. The check-in experience was nervewracking too  while it has become common for hotels to request ID (which just raises my fears that guest security at the hotel is a real problem), the clerk PHOTOCOPIED MY PASSPORT without asking my OK or even alerting me that he was doing so. This is an invitation to identity theft that is unnecessary and inexcusable in any hotel! To the clerks defense, when I told him that I could not permit the hotel to keep a copy of my passport, he handed me back the photocopy and I ripped it up. I was prepared to risk paying for a nights stay because it was past the cancel time and heading elsewhere, but he let me in without the copy. While the room was clean and adequate and a good value for the area, the parking garage experience spoiled everything. The room could have used a microwave, they had only a refrigerator. The TV channels could only be changed from the cable box, but there were no instructions on how to do that. The in-room safe failed to work the last morning of my 3-day stay. But the room was quiet, the A/C worked, and the beds comfortable. Bath was standard HIX quality.

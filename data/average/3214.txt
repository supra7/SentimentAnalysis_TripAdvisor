Pros - we picked this hotel for the price and the free parking. The area around seems a bit deserted and there are no amenities, stores or attractions in close proximity. We were pleasantly surprised upon our arrival by how nice the hotel lobby looked and appreciated the gated parking. We had booked a room with 2 queen beds and that's what we got - it was a spacious, clean room with TV, mini fridge, coffee maker and a wonderful soaking tub, beds quiet comfortable. The next morning we found a little deli in the hotel and the counter person could not have been any nicer or more helpful. Cons - Front desk staff seamed disinterested and were just borderline friendly. Unfortunately our room was located on the 2nd floor above a bar that turned club on the weekend and faced the street which was noisy. Friday nite we noticed loud music and noise but it was not too overwhelming. Not so on Saturday, we got in after midnight and the 1st thing we noticed were people roaming the lobby and hallways, even on the 2nd floor when we got off the elevator. Upon opening our room door is was apparent that the club was in full swing and the music was so loud it made the floor vibrate. We called the front desk and they assured us they will take care of it, which did not happen. They also offered to relocate us to a new room, but since we were checking out in the am we did not want to go through the motion of packing & moving in the middle of the night so we had to wait it out until it closed at 2 am. So if you're planning on staying at this otherwise nice hotel for the price over the weekend, do yourself a favor and request a room opposite the bar/club.

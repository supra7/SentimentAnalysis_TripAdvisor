The Dana has lots of potential but lots to refine before it joins the list of "greeat/fun place to stay" hotels. Great location downtown near Michigan Ave. But problems began as check-in with a uncaring first encounter at check-in, mixed up reservation, and then to the room where the TV didnt work, toilet dripped, no reading lamp on one side of bed, elevators where the key entry needed 3-5 attempts to get to your room, etc. Room design is very interesting with glass walled shower facing the bed. Nice amenities. Comfortable bed. It just needs management to smooth out the bumps.

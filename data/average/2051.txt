we stayed here for 1 night in December, as we had a long stopover in Dubai. they allowed us an early check in at 10am free of charge, which was more than any other hotel was prepared to offer. the rate was also quite good. we arrived at the hotel at 8:30. i was hoping they'd let us into the room to sleep, but we had to wait till exactly 10am. the hotel is literally 5 mins from the airport. the airport taxi was very cheap. there was a mixup with the flights, and the hotel was meant to send their shuttle to collect us, but no one was there. we phoned and were told that someone was on their way, no one came. this was fine though, as we saved a substantial amount going with the airport taxis. the bottled water in the room is NOT mineral water. the seals were broken, and the 2 bottles had different levels of water in them. i'm not sure about how safe water in dubai is, but i found this to be disappointing. rooms are spacious and clean. we asked for a jug of milk delivered to our room for tea and were charged quite a bit for this. surprising. we didnt get to do much exploring in dubai, but we did go on the desert safari. i definitely recommend this!

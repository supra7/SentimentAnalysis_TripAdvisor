very bizarre once you get to the hotel. i walked in the "what i thought was the lobby" and noone was there. so i saw a phone on the wall and dialed it. they told me to come up to the 15th floor where the "lobby" was.. so strange. the room was nice, the beds were comfortable. two things to complain about. small bathroom where the floor was so cold and the toilet is where the tub is, sink is separate area and that they couldn't give us a decent half day rate. we showed up at 2am and left by 830 am because our flight was cancelled at seattle airport. that was lame.

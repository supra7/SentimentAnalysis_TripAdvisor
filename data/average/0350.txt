Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in Seattle. Found that it was perfect walking distance to most hotspots / tourist places and very convenient. It is an older hotel, but it is kept very clean and the staff were incredibly friendly. Parking is a little steep at $19/day but I guess that is to be expected when staying downtown. Overall it was a very good experience, and I would come back again.

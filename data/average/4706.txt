Have stayed here on several occasions before, and I have to say that this time round I was a little disappointed - nothing particular, but on previous stays I'd been put in rooms on the higher floors of the hotel and I remember them as more spacious and comfortable than the room I was given this time, on the 16th floor. Terrible soundproofing (which wasn't a problem last time I stayed) meant that I could hear everything from both rooms next door - the TV, people in the bathroom, etc etc. Also the room was a bit more 'tired' and less spacious than I remember. However couldn't complain too much - the price was good, it was perfectly clean and staff are helpful and friendly - it's efficient and in a great location. I just think that there might be better deals out there if you look around - however would be happy to stay here again.

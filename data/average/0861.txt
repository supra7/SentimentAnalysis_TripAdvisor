I loved the location of this hotel, it is right in the heart of Seattle, close to shopping, Pike Market and the monorail to take you to the space needle. We got a really good deal on the hotel, but I'm not sure if I would stay there again, and definitely wouldn't at full price. Internet access, parking and breakfast are all extra. The hotel charges $35 per night for self parking and more for valet parking, however, just behind the hotel on 5th avenue, is the Westin Parking lot that is 'not affiliated to the Westin hotel', yet has a walkway into the mezzanine level of the Westin. Parking for 24 hours is $22 and you can come and go as you please. I found the bed size and the rooms quite small, but they were comfortable. The wallpaper was probably fashionable 15 years ago, but now looks very dated.

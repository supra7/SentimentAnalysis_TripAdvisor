My husband and I stayed at the hotel from June 25-28th. There were some good things about our stay and then some things that we wish would have been taken care of. Here is what we really liked. The spa and their staff were very professional. I had a facial and an hour long massage. The waitstaff at the pool was very attentive. The hotel is nice to walk into without having the smoke of a regular casino resort. It is very convenient to the fashion show mall. You simply cross the street and you are right there. The hotels complimentary shuttle was great for going over to the Wynn or Caesars. The rooms have big windows with great views. The beds are very comfortable. Here is what was disappointing. The rooms were not very clean, not well maintained and the housekeeping staff was not attentive to requests. There is a long list I could go into but this is where I felt the hotel really fell short. I did complain to the front desk manager and we were upgraded to another room only to find similar problems with cleanliness and items not working in the room. We were overcharged by $100 at the cabana and put in a cabana that was being refurbished and charged full price. The waitstaff fixed the problem with the overcharge and apologized. I did complain to the front desk manager and she ended up offering to comp part of another day at the pool. I did end up writing a letter to the general manager who called me live to discuss our experience which I appreciated. He offered to have us come back and we are not sure if we will. There are so many choices in Las Vegas and we could not believe the amount of issues with the rooms etc.

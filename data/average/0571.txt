The business center opens at 8:00 and closes at 5:00 or 5:30! There was a long line, and the color printer was broken. And forget printing quickly from a thumb drive. All of this is a big negative for a hotel that hosts major conferences. The business center should open no later than 6:00 AM and stay open till at least 9:00 PM. The room itself was nice--not spectacular, but good. The beds were comfy, the coffee maker worked well, etc. Nice large HDTV, working safe, the usual amenities. Also the usual sea of business-hotel beige, but I didn't care. The staff is not overly efficient: After checking in at about 10:00 PM, we went to our room and found someone else's room service cart full of dirty dishes near our front door. It took three calls to the front desk to get this hauled away. Same when we needed the room cleaned in the afternoon (after having the privacy sign up earlier in the day). I got the impression that the front desk staff simply forwards requests to housekeeping or room service, which are not under any great pressure to do anything. There is free wi-fi but only in the first-floor lobby; it goes away when you go one floor up to where the meeting rooms are. That floor has a different, fee-based wi-fi. Same with the guest rooms: It's $10/day for cable-based Internet. The location is great, however. As others have said, you're near just about everything. Avoid walking down Pike Street, however, as you'll be pestered by panhandlers. Take Pine instead, which is parallel. Take cabs at night.

Overall, our stay at Hotel Max was pleasant. The hotel has wonderful art, great modern furniture, a central location and a friendly staff. However, one would think with such an ambiance that there would be more amenities that come with the price of a room but there are not. Guests are expected to pay for internet, parking, etc. I've stayed in five-star hotels all over the world and have paid the same price for my stay with amenities being standard. On another note, our "Queen of Art" room and bathroom were also a bit on the smaller side. The room fit our needs because we only stayed a day, but I would not recommend staying there for extended travel with more than one person.

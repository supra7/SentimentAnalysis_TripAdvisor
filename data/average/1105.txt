My wife and I wanted a getaway, so we got some theater tickets and decided to stay in the city for the night. We got a good rate at the Hotel Max and it is a trendy, chic art oriented hotel. But it has tiny rooms - the bed filled about 75% of the living area. And the bathroom, litterally 16 square feet (I counted 4x4 1' tiles). Sitting on the toilet, you can rest your head on the wall. That being said, it was all still functional, I am just used to a bigger room. The bed itself, was very comfortable and they have a pillow menu

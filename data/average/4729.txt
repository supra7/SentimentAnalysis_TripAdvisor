After reading all the great reviews, I decided to stay here for a couple of days on my way to a conference. Personally I'm a Marriott person but hey I was up for an adventure and decided to check out the Kimpton chain. When I arrived I asked if I could get a roon on a high floor which was a big mistake because the front desk manager told me that I would have to wait because rooms were not available when I checked in around 1 p.m. The manager told me that she would give me a call when the room is ready. I hung out at the bar for a couple of hours waiting for the call then I realized that I was probably forgotten after looking at my watch a little bit after 3 p.m. So, when I went to the front desk obviously the shift has changed because they had a different set of people working and I asked the front desk person if my room was ready. Of course, he has never heard of me before and asked me the same questions as if I was checking for the very first time. I asked him what happened the the woman before him and he said that I didn't get the call because the room wasn't ready. Oh, suddenly it was ready when I inquire? How about she forgot before she left. Honnesty is the best policy. Wonder if I would even get the call if I didn't go ask myself. Anyway, I signed up for the Kimpton loyalty program and will probably not participate just on principle. I'll stick with Marriott and Hyatt. To be fair the room is nice but not worth the 2 hour wait after a long flight for a high floor with a view of a brick building next door. The restaurant in the hotel has excellent service especially the bartendar. Just wish the actually hotel staff has the same level of attentiveness as their restaurant. I'm sure Chicago has other unique hotel options with excellent service to explore.

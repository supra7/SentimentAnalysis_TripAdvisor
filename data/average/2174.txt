arrived after 10hour flight from UK and was put in a high city view room as requested , was very impressed , jaccuzi , his n her sinks , seperate shower and separate toilet , plenty of storage , kitchenette with fridge , big bed and seating area . imagine my horror as a freight train pulling 30 plus wagons of coal ,sounding its ear pearcing horn as it crossed a level crossing less than 0.5 miles away . This we could have put up with considering the time of day (4.30pm) but this continued through the night and for the 7 nights that we were there. We were moved twice and even given a strip view room upgrade for free but could still hear the train. dont get me wrong this is a great hotel but be aware of the train or take ear plugs !

Clean and comfortable. Good location near to Common and shopping. Quite expensive, but what really bothered me was all the potential extras. Fridge- $15, WiFi additional charges. The list goes on. I do expect to pay extra for certain things, but in this price bracket not everything. Would look for an alternative hotel nearby next time.

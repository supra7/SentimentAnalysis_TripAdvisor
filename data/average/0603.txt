I stayed at the Sheraton recently while attending a conference. The proximity to the Convention Center and to Pike Place Market was a plus. The hotel is currently undergoing some renovations so the lobby is small and there was construction noise downstairs - but I couldn't hear the noise from the room. The room itself was fine but smallish. For the price, I have stayed in bigger places but I guess Seattle is expensive. The staff was pleasant but not over friendly.

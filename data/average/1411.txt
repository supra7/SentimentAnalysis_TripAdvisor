We stayed at this hotel December 5th. It quite a distance from the city centre and you'll either have to drive or take the subway/light rail to get to the main shopping district or Haupbahnhof. The uBahn or SBahn are about 1 km max. walk from hotel. We were upgraded at check in since all the rooms for our category had been 'booked'. The room we got was very spacious but reeked of smoke. We didn't bother complaining since we were only there for one night but seriously I had to launder my PJs et. al. the next day. The room was very spacious facing the road. There was not much noise (1st floor - European 1st floor; not ground floor) from the road or other rooms. There was a large screen tv, lots of closet and counter space, beds were good (soft), with a cordless phone and alarm clock. No fridge. Bathroom very spacious, walk-in shower with no current or door but very private (i.e. you can shower behind the wall while someone else brushes their teeth - if you're okay with that). Large mirror and sink. We were treated to a Saint Nicholas gift the next morning (Dec. 6th is Feast Day) that was left on our door handle. Friendly front desk staff. Easy check in. Overall not a bad stay. No internet unless you pay using your credit card. We booked over "expedia-like" website and got the room for $114 CND (but remember it was an upgrade) which lists for 89 euros. Just, seriously, if you have any 'smoke' allergies, check the room first.

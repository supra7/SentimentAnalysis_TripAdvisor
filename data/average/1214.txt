We stayed in the tower at this hotel and found the accommodations satisfactory. We wanted to spend a day in Seattle prior to our cruise and we did not want to rent a car. This hotel provided a shuttle from the airport and to the Light Rail station, which was convenient. (about 25 minutes into the city) There is a wonderful place for breakfast, Dave's Diner, within a short walk of the hotel. The hotel suggested we take Seattle Express to the cruise port and for return to the airport. I am sorry to report that we were less than impressed with this company, in particular, on the return trip. We called them when we arrived and told them our disembarkation was at 9:35 a.m. After several calls, they finally arrived in a 10 passenger van at 10:45 a.m. There was not enough room for all the people who had made reservations. We were able to catch a taxi, for the same fare or even a bit less with the four of us. If you are on a tight schedule, I would NOT recommend Seattle Express.

Location is good but I prefer another hotel a block or so away called The Colonnade Hotel | 120 Huntington Avenue | Boston | MA | 02116--rated very well on tripadvisor so check it out. Boston Marriott rooms are only average but access to two shopping malls via a catwalk across busy Huntington Ave will keep you cool on hot days and warm on cold days. The lobby is hectic and confusing and hotel personnel don't seem to notice guests unless you walk up to the front desk. For the money, check out The Colonnade where the pace is relaxing, personnel receptive, and the rooms are more comfortable.

We stayed in the Crowne Plaza as it had an outdoor swimming pool and Chicago in August is very hot. Great location for shopping. Very impersonal hotel. The room was very dark but of a good size. It does need redecorating. The pool was very nice - what a pity there were not a few more loungers. What genius bought the loungers? Because of their shape you can only lie on your back. Impossible to lie on your tummy to get your back tanned. if you want a central hotel for city sightseeing and shopping it is fine. Not a hotel for a romantic getaway. Would love to know what other hotels in Chicago have an outdoor pool.

it is a giant black-top, but that was ok.. you can just walk to the bay, but the way they have the rows set up with no walk-ways - people just walk through your sight. that's ok too.. it was the neighbor totally cranking up his leveling blocks and moving everything around and shining all his lights at 3:10.. I think if you weren't near this space you probably had a nice time, but I paid extra for bay view, strain your neck.. they said quiet time was 11 pm.. the people moving and making a huge racket.. hooking up and all that is not a sleepy time thing. so from 3:10 to 4:30 we had that going on, and then everybody else woke up at 6:30.. not a relaxing time.

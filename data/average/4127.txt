Stayed here for business for about a week. Aside from the minor annoyance of the lobby area being under construction, my stay was alright. The location can't be beat....walkable to so many attractions (aquarium, Faneuil Hall, Little Italy, etc) and it's great to be near the water. My only warning would be about the noise level...I am generally not too noise-sensitive, but I could hear everything: the maids in the hallway, people in the rooms next door, etc. Not to mention the air conditioning was quite loud when it would kick on. The rooms/beds are comfortable...typical Marriott style. For what it's worth, the restaurant/bar has a lovely view. I'd recommend this hotel if you want to be close to attractions and have the money to spend...but make sure to bring earplugs.

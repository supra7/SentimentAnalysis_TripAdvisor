I had little choice about where to stay - most hotels were fully booked. The Renaissance is on the edge of the downtown area - the uphill edge. While most things are within walking distance, the sharp uphill stretch on the return to the hotel is surprisingly unpleasant! The hotel itself is largely unremarkable. The public areas are clean but unmemorable; the staff are helpful but not particularly friendly; the rooms and bathrooms contain what you'd expect but nothing stands out as being of a high standard. The rooms were spacious. I had a room on a high floor and was hoping for good views; sadly they were marred by the very dirty windows, one of which was also suffering from condensation in the inner panes of the double-glazing where the seal had obviously failed. Breakfast wasn't bad, but I'd expected better. Overall, I'd be prepared to stay here again but I would explore alternatives first.

The Ace is a good bet for your money, if you're traveling on a budget. We got the standard room with the shared bath; the room was small but clean and the bed was comfy. Our room was facing the outer wall which is right above a lively street with lots of activity well past 3 am, but luckily we had ear plugs. The shared bathroom situation is fine; there was never a wait for one to open up and they do lock, so you have it to yourself once inside. The best thing about this Ace was the included continental breakfast: make-your-own-waffle station, fresh juice, Stumptown coffee (in to go cups!), bread and a toaster, granola, yogurt and fruit. It had everything I would want.

On two recent stays, I found the rooms at the Fairfield Inn near the Philadelphia Airport to be clean, if slightly in need of updating. The complimentary airport shuttle was a nice amenity, and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. While the regional train stops about a 10-minute walk from the hotel, the sidewalk is discontinuous. The shuttle driver was willing to drop me off at the station on his way to the airport, which I appreciated. I walked back from the station to the hotel when finished in center city - it was a feasible walk, but the discontinuous sidewalk and possibility of heavy traffic makes it a little less convenient than one might imagine. During my second stay, I had a rental car - it was a quick drive to the University of Pennsylvania from the hotel. If I visit Philadelphia again on business, I'll be pretty likely to stay here again.

Just back today after spending 9 nights in Point Orlando Resort, we had a wonderful time although i probably wouldnt go back. My reason for this is solely the food and drink situation. First of all the poolside bar is the only bar on the premises therfore if u want a drink at a bar u have to pay poolside rates and when thats 7.50 for a corona and 10 dollars for a pina colada with a decent shot of rum it soon becomes probihibitivly expensive. And worse of all is the fact that the bar closes at 11pm. The bar food we bought(kids chicken and chips) was fine the rest of the menu didnt inspire me at all. The breakfast buffet looked and smelled bad so we stayed away and the so called starbucks is 2 pots of brewed coffee with starbucks stickers on them. So my complaints are only about the food and drink situation. Everything else was spot on, clean hotel, clean room and pleasant staff. We had a fantastic holiday and we made great memories that we will have forever.

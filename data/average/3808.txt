We were a bit apprehensive coming here - a London hotel at 60 for a double room - would it be comfortable and clean? The staff greeted us and were friendly and helpful and showed us round. We had to pay upfront, but were able to look at the room first. The room was very small, but we have stayed in smaller, and it was not too cramped. The ensuite bathroom - toilet, washbasin, shower, wall cabinet, handwash and soap, one towel each, plenty of toilet rolls - was very clean. As well as the bed, we had a bedside table, a lamp, an alarm clock (old style), a small table, a flatscreen TV on the wall, one chair, and free wifi. Our room was on the ground floor. Our room was clean and had all the basics. Our only gripe is that the double bed was very narrow - too narrow for comfort and a good night's sleep. Only having one pillow each didn't help sleep arrive, either. In the basement is a kitchen where you can make hot drinks or eat breakfast cereals, bananas or swiss rolls (complimentary, do your own washing up) or cook and eat your own food. All this is free; you are charged 3 if you cook their eggs etc. The hotel has no parking, but there is free parking in the streets very nearby after 5.30 pm until about 8.00 am. It is also free at weekends. We stayed at a weekend so this was fine for us, but other times it's residents only, so I don't know where you'd put a car during weekdays. The hotel is next to a bank with a cash point. There is a small supermarket over the road, and a nice pub with food is nearby. When you think of usual London prices, this was good value for a room with ensuite bathroom and free wifi.

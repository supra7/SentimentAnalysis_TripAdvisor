This hotel is a good modern option for the price if you are visiting Berlin. The location is not great, but not too bad either. There are 3 u-bahn stations within a 5 - 10 minute walk, and from these you can easily get anywhere at anytime. You can walk to Schoneberg, which includes some sights and is worth exploring. Don't be put off by the immediate vicinity either - its safe and has some reasonable dining options. The room wasn't huge and mine suffered from a badly positioned column, but the double bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning/heating effective, there was a flat screen TV with English channels, and the bathroom (shower only) fine. As some previous reviewers have said, this is where the value element does let it down a bit - no in-room safe, towels a bit small and thin. I can't praise the usual evening receptionist/barman highly enough. Friendly, perfect English and always very helpful. He seems to be the sole member of staff in the hotel though from mid afternoon ! Internet is not free, but its cheap by hotel standards and works very well. I had the breakfast twice in a four day stay. In Berlin going out for breakfast is a big thing and I wouldn't recommend anyone to always have breakfast in their hotel - there are some great places to go. But if you do have it here its OK and reasonably priced. There is a bar and coffee shop available 24 hours (I think)

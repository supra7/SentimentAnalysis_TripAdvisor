We stayed @ this hotel for 3 nights while in Maui Feb 19th to 22nd. The room was good. Really liked the parking ramps on same level as our room. Parking was 6 dollars a day and also had to pay for the use of the safe. We had a partial ocean view which was good. Roomy patios. Enjoyed the breakfast's. They were similar to what you would get on a cruise ship. Sunday brunch is good in the restarant in the back-service was a little slow. It was our first morning there so we were anxious to explore. Maui is absolutley gorgeous. We enjoyed every minute there. Loved the atmosphere and the people. Staff friendly. Would stay there again and again and again.

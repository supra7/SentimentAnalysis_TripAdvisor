Just checked in to this hotel. The room is fair, very spacious and decently furnished in a corporate way. However I am seething because they charge 75 AED (about 12 GBP) per day for cabled internet access in your room for what turns out to be a ***120KB*** connection!! - so slow it's useless for anything but light email and text based web. Totally unacceptable for business, which is what this hotel is presumably mainly for. The duty manager also wanted to charge me a further 75 AED per day to have wifi access for my iPhone in reception (the only wifi zone). I tried to explain that this cost the hotel no bandwidth and no money but they refused to give me a password. This Internet scam in hotels is driving me crazy! If you're going to charge at least make it fast. In sum: don't come here if you need Internet access for work.

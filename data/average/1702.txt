Stayed at this hotel for 5 days while attending a businss conference. While the hotel is new and clean its interior and common areas are very modern and sterile. Too sterile. The rooms are nice, however, sterile as well. The second bed in the room had not been changed, I found debris in the sheets, the comfortor had make-up stains. The shower head could be found in any Motel 6. I parked a car in the garage ($21 per day) and prepaid for 2 days. I turned the car into the Hertz desk after the first day and was refunded one day parking on my bill. Every day after that I was charged $42 which was refunded (an automatic computer entry I was told). The restaurant and bar were very expensive, I didn't ever venture into either. The Fox Sports Bar was the chosen spot. There is not an entrance to the Fox Sports Bar from the hotel, one must go outside to enter (explained that Fox rents space from Hilton). Staff there were young, most were helpful but inexperienced in treating people friendly. The conciere at the hotel was the most curt unprofessional person I have ever encoutered at a conciere desk. She was efficient, however. Hilton needs to find a polite and friendly person to put at that desk and that would not be the blonde, thin, female that was working when I was there. The front desk people are usually working on a computer when you approach and are seemingly too busy to help those waiting. No check out process except to approach this desk. The conference wait staff is the exception, they are very polite, greet you in hallways, and are very helpful. To end this review, Hilton, you need to take a look at this hotel, send most everyone to a customer service school, work out the union issues, and buy a bouquets of flowers for the common areas to soften the blow of modernism and sterility. Get to work Hilton!

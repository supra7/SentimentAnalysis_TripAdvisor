I stayed at the ACE Hotel recently and I must say that I was a bit scared upon first sight, but ended up really enjoying my stay. I travel often for business and was sick of the Sheraton and Marriott so I decided to try something that was a bit younger and unique. While it is not the Ritz, it is clean, the staff are WONDERFUL, and it is within walking distance of many awesome bars / clubs. Don't expect a lot of amenities - this is a very minimalistic hotel - you get the bare necessities. I would opt for the deluxe room as it has a bathroom, otherwise, it gets the hostel / college dorm vibe in a standard room. The only real downside was that the walls are paper thin, so don't do or say anything you wouldn't want your neighbors hearing!

Stay at Westin in Seattle was okay. That location and our room had a great view of the city and satisfactory. I cant remember much about the amenities. The most I could say is that it was CLEAN. Because of its location that gives you a view of the city from an upper floor I would pay up to $129/night maayyybbe $149 because it is in Seattle. Benihanas not too far away and a fun place to have dinner (knew of them from New York).

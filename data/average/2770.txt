The hotel was clean and neat and staff are very friendly and polite. But lack of facilities, small rooms, poor sound insulation and less than picturesque location means that it is quite conclusively outclassed by many other local hotels at this price (70 Euros in our case). 20 Euros less however and this would have been another 5 star review.

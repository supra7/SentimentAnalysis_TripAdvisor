Stayed twice in July. The first time was great, stayed in the Tower which is next to the restaurant and Starbucks, very close to thge airport and the shuttle was quick. Room was clean, quiet and comfortable, and the staff was friendly. Stayed a week later and had a different experience. We got an automatic upgrade to a suite for $20 more a night. The suites are a long way from the main lobby. A trainee checked us in and gave poor directions to the room. We had 20 minutes to drive to the room, unload luggage and return without paying for parking. Sounds like plenty of time, right? It took a while to find the building, then went in the wrong entrance and eventually figured out that only one elevator in that building goes to the fifth floor. By the time I got back it was more than 20 minutes so I got charge $20 or so for parking. The family room suites are huge but this room smelled moldy, maybe someone had smoked there, but the bathroom was particularly moldy. They were 100% booked which might explain the poor service. They found a room in the tower and moved us, but our key did not work so I had to go back to the lobby and get a new one. After traveling all day it was very frustrating to take over an hour to check in. The manager came by because we complained and offered us free parking for the night, but he was rude acted like it was our fault the key didn't work ("maybe you put it next to a credit card or cell phone". No, we didn't, your trainee needs some supervision.) When we checked out the parking was on our bill, so I went to the lobby and the fixed the error. Another thing I found in the fine print: the USA Today is not free anymore, they add $0.75 to the bill unless you opt out at check in. Most people probably don't notice it. Once we got settled the room was nice.

Whilst the Hotel & staff were friendly upon arrival and throughtout my 2 day stay, the room & Lockwood restruant were also fine, it wasn't until my arrival back home & after checking my bank balance found there was a ATM tansaction for $146.00 made 2 days after I had checked out and left the state. Five phone calls later I finally spoke to a Front Office Manager who attempted to assist me. The outcome was nothing they could or would do. Advice is double check your bamnk statements. An otherwise enjoyable visit ruined.

Stayed in this hotel 15th 16th 17th September, Room was large as it was at the end of the block,but the ceiling came down from a point and i banged my head a few times when i went to get something from my case which i left in this area and forgot about the slope. The staff were very friendly at reception and booked use Taxi's with a smile. Hairdryer in the room was in desk drawer there was no mirror so wife didnt like that at all, tea making was in the pointy bit,wrong place more banging of head. Shower was not powerfull and although you could remove it from its fixing when you put it back it pointed straight at the sink and as ther was no curtain place got a bit wet. Bed was not very comfortable i have stead in other best western hotels and the beds were brilliant. Breakfast was a Rip Off at 15 dont bother with it. I stead here before it got taken over and it was a nice Hotel and not expensive it cost me 269 room only for the 3 nights. If you have a car its fine but each time we went to Golders Green it was 5 6 7 or 8 depending on how much the Taxi Driver wanted to rip you off. There were also private Partys on both fri and sat nights so you couldnt use the bar,if you wanted a drink you had to sit in the lobby.

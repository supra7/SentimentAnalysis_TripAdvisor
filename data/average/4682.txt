This HGI provided a perfect location for us to discover Chicago with our two girls. The State Street subway is essentially in the basement of the hotel. Water Tower, Michigan Ave., Navy Pier, Millenium Park and the Art Institute were easy (and interesting) walks. As some reviews have noted, the hotel lobby is not grand, but that did not diminish our stay. The restaurant is unusual for an HGI -- it appears to be a Weber Grill flagship store. Only had breakfast there, but it was better than a typical HGI. Lunch/dinner looked fine, but there were so many great restaurant choices around we couldn't get to everything! Rooms were more than adequate in size and were quite clean. Good TV and lighting. Heater/Air Conditioner was the old under-the-window style with thermostat on the wall. It was a bit loud. Windows did a poor job of blocking out sound, even 14 floors up. If you are from the city and used to noise all night, it won't bother you. It bothered us. Would I stay here again? Perhaps. The rate was reasonable and the location was great. Just wish they would have gotten better windows.

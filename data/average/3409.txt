This hotel is attached to Changi airport. Unfortunately it's only attached to Terminal 3 so you might need to push bags and trolleys around for a while if you arrive at any other terminal - not the hotel's fault. Guests are mostly passengers in transit and airline crew between shifts. The room we had was OK but the hotel does not provide free wireless broadband - an anomaly in a city where wireless access is ubiquitous. If you do want free wireless just wander into the airport building. Other reviews seemed most approving of breakfast - our impression was different. There was 1 coffee machine which spat out a very small amount of coffee and had a digital screen telling guests that there was no milk and staff which we would expect to be there to help in this situation were not visible except at the entrance. Evidently more importance is attached to your right to have breakfast rather than the breakfast itself - fried eggs prepared some time before you ask for one and therefore having the consistency of rubber - toast machines set so low that you get warm bread instead of toast -even asian breakfasts were very poor as there was no decent rice porridge nor any tasty noodle dishes. We can't believe the favourable reviews for breakfast here. Maybe we were just unlucky. The check-in desk for Singapore/Silk air was a definite advantage but it is not available before 10:00 am. Like many others, we chose this hotel because we were travelling elsewhere and near airport accommodation seemed more convenient. It's a pity the breakfast was so poor.

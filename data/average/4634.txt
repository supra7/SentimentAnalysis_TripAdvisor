The Fairmont Copley Plaza has a charming, historic building with attractive common areas and an ideal location. If the owners/managers put some money/effort into the hotel -- particularly the guest rooms -- it could be great. Alas, no. The rooms do not feel luxurious, they feel dated and in need of renovation. A good deal of noise can be heard even in interior rooms due to thin walls and guest room doors that slam loudly. Service is very uneven, ranging from extremely helpful to utterly indifferent. Significant refurbishment and some sorting out of staff are needed. As it is, there are better choices at this price point.

I'm very surprised by some of the reviews here. I have stayed here three times in the past year. Each time, same thing: wonderful when you get to the room (although just marginally clean) but terrible, horrible, customer service. First time: problem finding our reservation (we'd made 6 months prior) but finally found it. No apology. Then Houlihans restaurant was almost empty but took us over 2 hours to get lunch and pay for it. Second time I stayed, extremely rude front desk staff who would not tell us where to go for drinks, nor could they tell us best place to pick up the bus, and worse, when my spouse called at 10 pm, the main hotel number just rang and rang. Nobody answered! He tried 15 minutes later, same thing. This time, we made reservations 6 months prior, then two months ago I called to ask for late checkout. The person asked the manager and was given permission. We arrived and were told that regrettably they could not offer late checkout. We had to be out by 11 am. I asked why they could not have called or emailed me that. Was told, "we are booked tomorrow and have to clean rooms." No I'm sorry, not at all willing to negotiate. Our room was $189! Much, much higher than the Hilton Garden in down the road which is very nice too. I was told I could come down to the lobby later in the evening and "try to catch the manager." I said no, the manager could call me in my room. Of course the manager did not ever call. It seems the problem with the I Hotel is that they are not willing to work with a customer like a Hilton or Hyatt, or even a Super 8 is. They are always right, and never willing to look into something (like, where to get a bus). They say "I can't help you." This is NOT a way to get repeat business. Most of the front desk staff are university students and management either is not training them well, or they don't believe in offering staff flexibility. I'm done staying here.

We got this place through hotwire at a pretty good rate. When we got there the parking was very tight to get in off the street and into the underground where the valet was. The decor was very "posh" it is probably liked by most that stay there but just wasn't our style, the lobby is very small and is often full so hard to move about. The room we got was on the top floor but facing the alley and parking garage. It was very clean but very small, the bed was within 3 feet of the toilet. The evening wine tasting was a nice touch but again the packed lobby forced us to sit outside and drink. It is a nice hotel but I wouldn't recommend it for a younger crowd looking for a more relaxed type feel.

Beautiful, opulent building with friendly staff and conveniently located to everything you would want to visit in Chicago. That said, when I travel for business, I need to get ready quickly, usually early in the morning, with a cup of coffee and a hot shower. No coffee-maker in the room, but an expensive Starbuck's in the lobby. Tiny bathroom with low water pressure in the shower. Colleagues said they had no problem with water in the Executive Level rooms, but I cant' afford those rates. Internet access is available in the room for a hefty fee. WiFi is available in the public areas, again for a hefty fee. So I would stay there again, if I were just on vacation, but not for business.

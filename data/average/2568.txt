In an alright location, not as clean as u would wish, and just been woke up at 11:30 by a stranger that got key'd the wrong room number, my misses broke down in tears she was so scared. If security, a clean room, low noise and a decent bed is what u want, book elsewhere, very dissatisfied with the travelodge brand.

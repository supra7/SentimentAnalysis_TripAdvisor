Clean, serviceable, no major deficiencies. But dim "mood" lighting everywhere that made us all squint to get through lobby; room design is full of "little extras" that feel like a marketing consultant designed them (custom CD, "boutique" snack foods for in-room purchase, branding the concierge/front desk as the "whenever whatever" phone line, etc.), but it all doesn't add up to the understated, unobtrusive quality of good business hotels in Europe or major US cities, including those in the same price range or cheaper. My room looked out on ... the inside of a concrete parking garage about 10 feet away, where commuters looked into my bedroom as they got out of their cars, unless I kept the blinds closed. The heat/ AC system was pretty loud unless I kept it turned off altogether. Location is handy walking distance to Pikes Market and downtown restaurants/shopping. The Belle Epicurean, half a block away on 4th, has outstanding French pastries and coffee. I think you may be able to do as well or better with other downtown hotels for a little less money.

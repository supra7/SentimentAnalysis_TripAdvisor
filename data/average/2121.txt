We stayed at the Pera Tulip for two nights at the end of a 11-day trip to Istanbul. We had previously stayed at the Hotel Uyan (in Sultanhamet) and after a few days in Cappadocia (Kelebek Suite - fantastic!) finished off our time in Turkey at the Tulip in the Beyoglu area. The location was great, only a block of the main shopping strip and with everything you could need an easy walk away (e.g. shopping, cafes, restaurants). The Tulip is particuarly convenient for restaurants as there were many cool meyhanes in the small, windy streets nearby, which were filled with people both Friday and Saturday nights. It made for great atmosphere. The hotel itself was fine - the decore is well done and the breakfast spread was very good - lots to choose from. Having the option of filter coffee after lots of Nescafe throughout Turkey was very nice. Our only complaint was with the room. It was very small (even by European standards) and not very clean. The most disturbing thing was when we went to take a shower, we found a large clump of hair left on the shower wall - needless to say, it wasn't ours. All that being said, given the good location and very good breakfast, the Tulip was good value for what we paid. We booked the most basic double room and got a good rate online (EUR 99 per night). In fact, the rate when we booked through the hotel's website was originally EUR 110/night but when the rate dropped on one of the travel websites (venere.com), the hotel matched it for us. Had the room been clean, I would have been a much better overall experience.

We stayed here for 5 nights. The good news is it is close to the parks and was a very good overall value. The room was fairly clean (the rug was dirty). The problems we encountered included the lack of coffee maker although the web site said there would be one. We asked for one and it was brought to the room. The next day housekeeping neglected to leave any coffee refills. My husband thought the room was extremely small. Also there was no micrwave as advertised but a toaster oven. Also, no flat screen TV as advertised. OK, no big deal. The sheets did not fit the bed and were contiually coming off. Based on the price we paid, we would probably stay again but there were some problems.

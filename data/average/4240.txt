Although in a great position we did not think that Boston Park Plaza was value for money. There was no plug in the bathroom basin and on the morning we left on our tour while waiting in the lounge for the coach, we discovered a large chunk of uneaten steak on the carpet. It is a beautiful building and has once been an elegant hotel, but we thought it was showing it's age and was now quite dowdy.

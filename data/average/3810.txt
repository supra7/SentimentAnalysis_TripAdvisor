We were in Texas visiting family and needed a place to stay for the night to catch a 6 am flight from Love Field. Some of the reviews were mixed but we decided to give this hotel a try since it is a Ramada. For the price and proximity to Love Field the hotel can't be beat. In addition they have a free shuttle to the airport so that counts for a lot. The staff is very friendly. Now for the not so great. The hotel is very old and it shows but it seemed fairly clean. There was a definite musty order in our room that was unpleasant. The rooms are very small with 2 twin (not queen) beds which means sharing a bed with a spouse is not too comfortable. We were on the first floor next to the courtyard and it seemed like we were right next to the smoking area. A couple times during the night we were woken by people talking loudly while they smoked. Also the toilet handle broke on us and it was real fun having to put your hand in the back of the toilet to flush it. Still with complaints I have it served its purpose of a place to stay for the night next to the airport for a lot less money than they other area hotels.

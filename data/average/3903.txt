The room was lovely! Lots of space. Full kitchen. BUT! Cleaning SUCKS! Hair in the shower (before we even used it), cheerios/food debris in the pull out couch, they replaced enough towels for two people but we were three, and one of my pillows lacked a pillow case. It is a shame cause the place rocks...but the cleaning...even cheap motels are better!

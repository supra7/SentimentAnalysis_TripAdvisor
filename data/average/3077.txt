This place is in a great location and that is its saving grace. We arrived after a long trip and my husband was quite ill with a bunch of luggage that I had to drag myself and I got absolutely no help from the man at reception - in fact as soon as he saw us he ran back his desk. There is zero sound insulation, we hear everything from people talking, snoring, having sex,running the shower, flushing the toilet and TV all day long. It feels like they are right in your room. Forget about sleep without earplugs. The room is definitely on the small size and same goes for the bathroom, one person can stand there at at time. Nowhere to hang your bath towel or hand towel. There is no hook for anything in there. We asked for a non-smoking room and we got a room that stank of cigarette smell. Made all our clothes smell of it. The shower ran freezing cold one day and we didn't have hot water at all and weren't told about it. No hot water kettle to make coffee in the room - such a small thing that makes a big difference to people who don't want to spend 10 Euros every day on coffee. My pillow had hair on it when I first arrived which was really gross but I didn't expect more from a 3 star place in Paris.

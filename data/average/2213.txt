So we started off fighting with the hotel about the $50 hotel credit that was advertised... which was not a hotel credit, but a spa credit that you had to spend $100 at the spa to use.... not a good start... then we had to move rooms our first night becasue the wind was blowing the closed window vents off....... upon further inspection we found that DUCT TAPE was being used to attempt to keep them sealed... the noise was soo bad from the wind blowing up the vents we had to move.... then not once, no matter what time of day or night was the water hot in the shower...... so bizarre.... dont get me wring a beautiful hotel but not issues I have ever had at other 4/5 star hotels EVER!

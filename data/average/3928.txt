What a funny room, total dorm feel with cheap furniture and spartan look. That said, the location was great, AC worked well and no complaints. Personnel were helpful esp.via email when I was booking. It was nice being 5 min from Old Montreal and 5 min from the silly main drag of St. Laurent. Plus the Metro was close and walking in general was easy. A fair amount of sleaziness in the area but that doesn't bother me.

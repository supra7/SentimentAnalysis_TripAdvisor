The Renaissance is a great looking hotel. Day staff were great, night staff were not very helpful, left me wrestling with two suitcases and a heavy door while they watched from reception desk. Food is good and prices on food and drinks reasonable. The rooms are a problem. If the double glazed windows don't seal properly you might as well sleep outside on the expressway! The noise was dreadful. We were up and out at 5.30am as there was no point staying in the room. They did bring ear plugs when requested but it was all too late for a good night. If you must stay here go and visit your room before you get your bags. We were booked as part of our tour on the way back through Seattle, so the staff were very kind and upgraded our room to a beautiful suite but the first one we went to the windows did not seal and the noise was awful again, so we changed to a different room and it was, not quiet, but we could sleep with it.

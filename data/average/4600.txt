A perfect location to do lots of touristy things in Boston. The room we had was small compared to modern hotels but nicely appointed. The bathroom was starting to show wear with some torn wallpaper and the toilet broke but that was promptly fixed when it was pointed out to the concierge. Cool "flip-up" outlet on the desk so you don't have to crawl under it to plug in. The bed was wonderful. Not sure if it was because we were exhausted from walking around town all day but we slept like babies with four king pillows and a very comfortable pillow top bed pad. So here is the drawback, the room still smelled of the "this-used-to-be-a-smoking-room" smell. You know the smell? Where you have to wash your clean clothes when you return from a trip? We dealt with it but I will ask to change rooms next time before I just accept it.

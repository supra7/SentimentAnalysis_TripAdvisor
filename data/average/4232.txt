Used Priceline "Name your price" and was given this hotel at a rate almost half of what was listed on the various booking and hotel sights. At the Priceline bid rate it was worth it. If I had paid the price listed, I may have been a bit disappointed. The room was small, dated, and the bathroom tiny. It was clean, and fairly quiet although you could hear people talking in the adjoining rooms. It looks like it's in need of a facelift. There were cracks on the ceiling, and other signs of wear and tear. We were there for a quick weekend visit so it was adequate. The T (green line) was steps away from the front door. There's also a Starbucks and Au Bon Pain a block or so away, for a convenient, quick breakfast. There is free WIFI in the seating area next to the restaurant (and in the restaurant as well), so no need to pay for it in the room. We parked down the block at Central Parking (they have a $25 coupon for 24 hrs on their website). The hotel garage was $44 so this was a good deal.

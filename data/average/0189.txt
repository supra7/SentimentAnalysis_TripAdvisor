While the lobby and website made this look like a 4-star hotel, the rooms themselves were terribly dated. $10 a night for wireless Internet Access that barely worked to the point of being unusable where I was at the end of the hall. Otherwise, the rooms were generally clean, the location is very convenient, and the price is reasonable.

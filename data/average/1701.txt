Hilton Bayfront is very nice looking hotel but has some major problems, mostly with their staff. We were given a room with two Queen beds on arrival. After we went on a tour we checked our reservation which clearly said King. We advised the front desk of this only to be told this was a request and no King rooms were available. He advised us we could try tomorrow morning but there was no guarantee then either. In any event when we booked the travel, the King room was a more expensive option than "room allocated at check-in" and was also a non-refundable rate. My wife and I returned to our room to collect the reservation and returned to the lobby. This time a different staff member was at the desk and actually knew how to treat a customer. He checked with house keeping and what do you know? They did have a King Room available meaning the original people at check-in had short changed us and the second person had lied to us. The King room is substantially better in more ways than the bed itself. The other negatives are the internet prices ($14 for "standard" and $20 for express broadband). This set a new record in my experience - not even Vegas hotels had the hide to charge that much. Also the lobby is basically on the second floor. To get to ground level you have to use the car park lift. The bridge linking the hotel to Petco Park/Gaslamp seems some way off being completed. It's only a five minute walk to the Trolley stop but there are other hotels better location. And unless you fork out for the bay view, the "bridge view" is actually a truck park with the bridge in the distance. On the plus side, the King room is very nice, especially the bathroom which thankfully has a shower not located over a bath. There is also a nice day bed. The woman at the concierge desk was very helpful in giving advice although she told us to get off at Seaport Village to go to the cruise ship terminal when (as I discovered later) American Plaza is closer.

We stayed here on a weekend trip to Chicago last May. The lobby is indeed gorgeous but beyond that the hotel seemed a bit shabby. The room was decent with updated upholsteries and decorating but it still seemed a bit rough and the bathroom was horribly small. I've stayed in historic hotels before that were remodeled much better - I was hoping for more and was somewhat disappointed. Also, although our room was at the very end of the hall, the other guests were extremely noisy, or the walls were paper thin - not sure which but between the other guests and the train a few floors below I got little sleep even with earplugs. Overall, it was a decent value and if you're at all curious about the historic hotel you should try it for a night or two - perhaps your experience will be better? We're returning to Chicago for another visit soon but will be staying at a different hotel.

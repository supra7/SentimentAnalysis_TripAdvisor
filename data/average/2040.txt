possible the friendliest staff in Dubai and definitely the most helpful. A credit to the hotel its a no fuss cheap hotel in Dubai, rooms are okay, shower is old and a little naff , rooms can be hit and miss, they have a basic standard room and a superior, always go for the superior, its a nice apartment with a balcony, has a little kitchen and a better space (maybe 100 AED a night difference ). Bfast is included in your rate but dont bother, go for the no bfast option and get something in one of the malls, its packed every morning in the restaurant and i didnt like the food. Dinner there is good value though but check the buffet selection first, doesnt deal with Veggies. Its a dry hotel and operates a strict seperation policy in the gym and pool, so you cant swim with your wife etc. basically good value for money, reception can take an age and they are funny about early check in and will try to charge you for that. Good for Deira but as you are near the airport, taxis sometimes dont want to take you there so at peak times they just drive past you ( its 15aed ) try and book one early, the concierges are very helpful and sometimes there is a limo driver but he wants 40 AED, okay its fair enough if you leave it late to go to the airport, there is a nice restaurant across the street from the hotel and the Irish village is 14 AED away in a taxi. good central spot and good for people who will be out all the time during their stay, i have stayed there about 25 nights and apart from doors being knocked 4 times a day ( leave your do no disturb sign on all the time ) and kids running up and down the corridor ad your phone ringing at 3am every morning its very quiet. The gym is very small, and the pool is nice.

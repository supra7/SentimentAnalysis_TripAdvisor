An amazing location for a hotel. Just a stones throw from the Avenue of the Stars, Kodak Theatre and Mann's Chinese Theatre. A 3 mile drive to Universal Studios and just a hop skip and a jump to the free ways. Hastings North Avenue is a traffic nightmare in the evenings so if you are coming in from the airport, be prepared to wait. Better yet plan so that flights arrive late enabling you to miss the horrible traffic. Rooms are very large, bathrooms, functional and housekeeping good. I left them a $3 tip everyday on my pillow, just to say thank you and to ensure they paid extra attention. Breakfast was free and abundant. Quality left much to be desired but hey, so long as it filled 5 stomachs, who am I to complain. We went with our three children and stayed three nights. It was worthwhile. Would I go again? Probably!

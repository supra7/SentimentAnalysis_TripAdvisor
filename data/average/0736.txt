Check-in staff "upgraded" street level room to partial bay view room on second floor. The room, unfortunately, was the last one on the hall and served as the very early morning entry for cleaning staff. This meant repeated door openings and closings, conversation, and movement of bedding carts for almost two hours every morning. This would have been a perfect wake-up call for business travelers with early AM appointments but not for tired tourists who needed just a little more sleep. After check-in, one lamp needed a light bulb. Called down to replace the 60-watt bulb but staff left 40-warr bulb. It seems like a small thing but the overall lightling was dim, and uncomfortable for reading. The nightstand had a complimentary Book of Buddha but nothing else; desk staff stated that were not aware of this policy. The mattresses need to be replaced. Hall carpets darkly patterned; room decor and halls could benefit from ligher colorsMy concerns were voiced to the manager; Tiny business center; opening the doors barely misses the back of chairs. I was offered a complimentary cup of coffee and pastry on the morning of check-out.

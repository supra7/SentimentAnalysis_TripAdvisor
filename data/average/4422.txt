A lovely, charming, traditional hotel with tasteful and welcoming decor. Suites offer a living room and bedroom separated by French doors. My suite had a foyer and a closet-sized room with sink and fridge. The highlight of the decor was the bathroom with magnificent marble and elegant sconces. If the service and facilities had been commensurate with the cultured ambience, I would have been staying at this hotel monthly for business travel for the next two years. The reasons I will not return are as follows: 1) no shampoo present the first night, 2) no local or network channels on the living room tv, 3) sagging mattress, 4) sheets that are 40% polyester, 5) room service Thai noodle dinner filled with grease and served in a tiny covered bowl with no accompaniment save rolls (not very well-balanced!), 6) no ice (requested the first night, but never materialized),and 7) when these issues were reported on a comment card, I was never contacted by any hotel staff.

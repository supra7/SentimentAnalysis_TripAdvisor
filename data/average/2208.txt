Well some people mentioned the train and yes it does go by a few times in the middle of the night. We stayed on the 51st floor and the noise was very noticeable. The reason it sounds so loud is that the window vents don't close properly and there is no insulation to dampen the noise coming in, so yes the helicopters, cars and train come through like they are in your room. The location is a bit off the strip, but plenty of shuttles and the walk does you good after big meals. There is a very good mall across the street with lots of good stores, a food court for snacks, and is a great cut though to the strip as well. Staff are very good, courteous, helpful and fun. If they could fix their one problem (noise coming into the room), the Hotel would be a great deal it would be a four star at least, very clean through out.

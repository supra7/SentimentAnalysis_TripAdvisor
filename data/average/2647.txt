We stayed @ the Hilton during Labor Day weekend. I booked the room thru the hotel website(good deal) and it was nonrefundable so no complaining and no changes. I booked the 1 bedroom suite. The suite was comfortable, large, nice views and decently maintained although the sofa bed wasn't ready, it was pretty uncomfortable and it was stained. The nighttime maid blamed the daytime maids for the whole thing and told us that the maids do a very poor job,cleaning the rooms oh well. Overall it was a good experience. The staff was very nice and the breakfast buffet was good. I saw the regular room and they looked pretty standard to me. Travel is quite affordable these days so if you can afford a better room go ahead and book it. I know is only for sleeping but if is going to make your trip more comfortable it's worth the extra expense. In my case it was only $20.00 more per night so it was worth it. I read many complaints regarding the internet charges I asked front desk manager and he gave me the internet complimentary I think it was a nice gesture plus of course I was paying for the upgrade...least he can do. Hilton gives complimentary internet in the lobby.

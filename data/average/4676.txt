We've stayed at the Hampton Inn, downtown Chicago, from march 25 to 31, 2007. Generally, we liked our stay. Although the hotel was clean, well located, with very comfortable rooms (the beds are awsome!) and good service, it has a few bad sides worth mentionning. First: the presence, just across the street, of a firefighter station. And let me tell you there are lots of fires in Chicago and that sirens and lights are the rule to get there. Second, the breakfasts. The concept is very convenient, the food is fresh, but unless a bad coffee and some doughnuts is a breakfast to you, you might be a little disappointed. In conclusion: not a bad choice, but bring ear plugs!

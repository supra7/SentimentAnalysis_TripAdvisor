I was traveling from Florida to Amarillo, Texas and stayed at the Homestead Studio Suites Dallas-Plano. I booked this hotel on priceline on Name your own price and got it for 20 dollars a night. I know, I know I shouldn't complain. However, the bed wich was a FULL not a queen was hard as the tile in the bathroom. It did, indeed have a full kitchen but no oven. The bathroom was nice and big. The housekeeping could hav been a little better. Dust in the corners of the room. The carpet looks like it needs a good cleaning. I was looking forward to having a good night sleep after driving for 14 hours. The bed had 2 pillows. When my husband went and asked for an extra he was told they didn't have any. The hotel looks like a new hotel, very clean and pretty on the outside, nice and close to everything. The breakfast is a joke. There were stale bagles, cream cheese and coffee. Thats it, no cereal or anything...The room served its purpose and for 20 dollars I can't complain...but the staff could have been more helful.

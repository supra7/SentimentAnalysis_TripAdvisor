We stayed at this hotel for a night. Positive points: location is great, 2 mins from Art Institute, Millenium park etc. We got the room on hotwire for 89 + taxes, so it was a good value. Otherwise, this is a type of a hotel which pretends to be expensive, but (virtually) everything is done with rather bad taste. So, it is not worth its 'standard' 200-smth price, at least from my pov. Anyway, rooms were clean, beds were convenient, no noise, so no real complaints. Service was also OK. Breakfast was not particularly good and somewhat pricey (smth like 15 for an omlette), but you can go to smaller places around. There is an official parking for the hotel, one block from the hotel, $25 a night. Again, if you are not going to use your car when in Chicago, you can probably find a cheaper parking around (but you will not be able to re-enter it). Internet, as you would expect in upper range hotels in US, is not free too -- about 16 and no wifi (cable). Maybe you can find rooms with a nice view, but our room did not have one (probably if you pay full fee you will get better rooms?).

i went with hundreds of people to Boston for a volleyball tournament end first long weekend of September, 2010. Not everyone stayed at this hotel though. Overall, the hotel was nice, spacious lobby, and it's a big hotel. We had four people in our room, and we had TWO washrooms, but each washroom was as small as your aparemtn closet. It felt it was made for children. I'm petite, 5'4, and I couldn't even comfortably move around in the shower, let alone majority of the people that are even silghtly bigger than I am. I'm sure these were not most of the rooms format, as the hotel picutres on the webiste looked totally different, and other team mates' bathrooms were a bit more spacious. Don't get me wrong either, the rooms were HUGE. There were no mini fridges either, so that was a downer. We didn't get a chance to use any of the amenities in the hotel, so I can't comment on it, but if you are considering this hotel, I would recommend it, just make sure if you are travelling with family members or a group, remember to ask the conceige to not put you in the rooms with the tiny washrooms.

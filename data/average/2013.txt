stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend 4 days ago. I am aware that the rooms are small but still, I was shocked on how small it is. The superior room is only good for 1 person! This is the smallest room that I ever stayed in a hotel (so far), my room is even bigger! but nevertheless, the staff are friendly. they even gave us a room with windows. we have extra pillows and blanket for free. though, wi-fi is merely S$5 for 2 hours. overall, it was an average hotel for you to sleep with for a long tiring day exploriing the country,

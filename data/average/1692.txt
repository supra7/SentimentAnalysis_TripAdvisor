Mixed feelings over this hotel. Interior and exterior architecture are superb, service was average but prices were outrageous (WiFi was $19/day and water in the vending machines $3.50 a bottle!). The room was very clean with a nice water view, but for what I was paying a night ( north of $300) I felt it was poor value, should have been more like $100 night. Overall I liked this place, but just felt like it was very poor value for the money I paid.

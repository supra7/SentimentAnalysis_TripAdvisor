Have stayed here a couple of other times in past few years. They recentlt added this bogus $39 "Housecleaning Fee" and a $12 per day "Resort Fee". Sorry, but that is total BS in my opinion! If a hotel wants to charge more for a room- just raise the rates!! Don't surprise a guest with these bogus fees when they check in exhausted after a day in Disney! It's not right! The property is ideally located to get to disney in a hurry. The rooms are woefully under-soundproofed!. You can hear the highway noise, and every little noise from adjoining rooms. The other night when we stayed there- it was breezy. We were kept up by a rumbling sound on and off all night. Its sounded like a jackhammer. It turns out it was the wind vibrating the gutters that drain rainwater off the roof. When I was at the front desk the next morning, another guest was complaining about the same thing.The bedroom and bathroom doors all squeaked and would wake family members if someone had to go to the bathroom at night or woke early and tried to leave a bedroom. I don't care for these bogus add-on fees but my biggest gripe is the poor soundproofing there.

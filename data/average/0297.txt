This hotel is in a older building across the street from the Seattle Public Library. There is a Seattle's Best Coffee shop inside the hotel which is great. The staff are pleasant and very helpful. Unfortunately that isn't the issue. We stayed here Saturday night in a Queen Room. The walls are so think I could hear someone next door coughing every 2-3 minutes. Then the person on the other side of us came in from a night on the town very loud and drunk. Coughing on one side, talking on the other..needless to say we couldn't get to sleep. In fairness, I don't think the people talking were talking that loud but it was still very annoying. We called the front desk and they graciously moved us to another room at 1 a.m. This room was a King and much nicer than the queen. I would only stay here again if I had a King room and asked for a corner unit. The decor has been updated but you can see that they only upgraded the essentials. The bathroom in the Queen was small and cramped.

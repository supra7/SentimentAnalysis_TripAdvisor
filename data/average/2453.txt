The Hotel is pretty Good, typical Marriott Courtyard, Clean neat room. No frills, this one is one of the closest to the Philly Airport, they offer Free Shuttle for pick up & Drop. At the lobby you can enjoy good French vanilla Coffee, use their business centre. If you want to go to the City then book some hotel in Downtown.

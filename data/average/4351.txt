My fiance and I stayed at the hotel for a conference. I can't say enough about the location and the concierge! By the way, may I add that the concierge was impressive? I am not easily won over, but the only mediocre meal we had during our stay was the one time we didn't consult the concierge. He truly knows the area! The room, although somewhat small (but we knew we had booked a smaller room) was neatly updated. The bathroom was quite cramped for space, but it is an historic hotel. The doors reminded me of a safe, but these details aside, the hotel was a wonderful bargain in an excellent area of Boston. Our only complaint was the service at the lobby restaurant. In fact, I'm not sure we even had service. Perhaps this is why the concierge never seemed to recommend the hotel restaurants......

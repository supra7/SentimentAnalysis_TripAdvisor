This is fun looking hotel, very funkily decorated with a different theme for each floor. Our room had everything we expected of a quality hotel but there was just a feel of it being ever so slightly cheap. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and functional, there was a TV and a large window let in plenty of natural light. The room was an average size and it's difficult to say anything bad about it but also nothing too exceptional either apart from the funky decor, which was PINK with Marilyn Monroe silhouette's above the bed, and small, sparkly pink and pale green tiles in the bathroom. Location wise Hotel Re! is a little way from being bang in the middle of everything but there is Metro station about a 5 minute walk away across a small park, so it's easy enough to get around and although we didn't try it, I don't think it's too far to walk to Chinatown or Clarke Quay. For value and cheeriness this hotel is definitely recommendable if the larger hotels of Singapore are outside your budget.

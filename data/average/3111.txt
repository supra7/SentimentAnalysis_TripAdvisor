I spent 5 nights in W Hong Kong last year November 2011. As my 1st experience in W Taipei was really good and awesome, i thought I'll be getting the same experience here in W Hong Kong. To my expectation, there's no 'automatic toilet' and the rooms are slightly smaller and old compared but if you talk about Hong Kong, the size of the spectacular room is alright and this hotel is better than my previous stay' in Panorama Hotel TST. Location wise, it's alright. Just next to the mall and getting to MTR is within 8minutes walk but there's nothing much to shop or walk around. I will not consider to stay due to location wise but definitely worth to give a try @ W Hotel. Oh yes, staff is very kind and helpful. A must to compliment.

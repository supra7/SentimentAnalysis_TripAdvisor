I've never written a review on Trip Advisor, but felt obligated since I rely on it so heavily for my pre-trip planning. The hotel grounds were beautiful. Swan Court, where the breakfast buffet is, was stunning. The rooms---not so much. They really are dated. My brother, who works in the hospitality business and came over to visit one day, completely agreed. The bed was older and very low to the ground, the coffee table was dinged, the bathroom was dated, etc. It's time for a refresh Hyatt. One other item. I have some mobility issues. Access to the pool has not been updated since prior to ADA compliance laws. Therefore, there are two flights of stairs to climb up and down in order to get to the pool. I wasn't aware of this prior to booking our stay. Just be warned if you're traveling with someone who has any sort of disability.

This hotel is located conveniently in downtown Seattle with several good restaurants steps away, but the brusque manager was not welcoming at check-in, and when our car was returned from valet parking ($39 !) at departure time with a flat tire, the directive from the manager after the hotel pump was not found was to "go down the street to get it fixed," with no apology or acceptance of responsibility. He needs to learn a bit of Pacific Northwest cordiality.

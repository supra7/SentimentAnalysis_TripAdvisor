excellent value I booked 2 roooms for 5 nights through Hotel.com at total cost (including taxes) of $44/room. Both rooms were large, clean. quiet and well equipped (with fridge and microwave, iron, etc. Ask for inside first floor rooms near entrances and you should be fine. Front desk staff very helpful, even printed out MapQuest directions for us. Only inconvenience was that the much maligned hotel resturant was often closed and except for a mediocre coffee shop a mile away there are no restaurants nearby (or even grocery stores). We eventually stocked up at Costco and ate breakfast and dinner in room and lunch outside. This worked fine and saved a bunch of money.

I travel to the Rivera May quite a bit and found great hotels, this unfortunatly was not one of them. Pro's Very clean! Most of the staff were friendly and ready to serve! Concierge were very helpful! Food was good Steak House, Italian, Japanese were all good ! But buffet-see con's Bed was comforatable! Good matress with thick pillowtop Con's Buffet- not much there- very limited selection. breakfast lunch and dinner. staff- most were really great some were not. there is always bad apples... get rid of them 95% Good 5% Not ocean water not pretty - but what can you do? they tried to keep it clean. one cenote was pretty nice others not so much. Shows at night were not good... buffet and a show. horrible, one night the show was karoke in the sports bar. this place is nice, don't get me wrong, but no where near a place you'll come home from and say WOW what a trip. I was bummed, but I live and learn.

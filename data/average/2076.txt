the grounds were quite lovely and tranquil, getting to the hotel you really needed a jeep, BEWARE the road is unpaved and full of wholes, if you like hereing a generator all night, like you live in MANHATTON, is unexeceptible. if you are a foodie, you will definately be disappointed, however the food was fine and tasty. the service was good. the weather was perfect. the rooms are very small. and please be sure to swat the mosquitos in your bedroom. i got six HUGE bites. and some of the other guests as well. would i go back... hmmm. if they had a king size bed!!! maybe.

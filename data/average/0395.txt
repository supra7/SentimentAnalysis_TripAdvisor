Stayed at this hotel during our family vacation to Seattle/Vancouver area for 2 nights. Overall the hotel is not bad consider the fact that we got a good deal to stay there for 2 nights during our trip. The hotel is nice and spacious, the room was spacious as well, clean and the beds were very soft and comfy. We ate out at the upstairs restaurant for dinner the second night, the food was not so bad but could've been much better. The service was supar and there was nobody to greet us for few minutes. I would expect better service for this type quality hotel or restaurant. I can see why the place looked empty. If you are here for a family trip, this place is somewhat close to the shopping and restaurants area nearby. However, it is not the most convenient place to stay due to the uphill climb if you are out of shape. My kids were complaining due to the walking and the shops/restaurants is a good 10 minutes away which is not so bad. I would stay at the Red Lion hotel which was our second leg of the trip, a much better location, when you step out of Red Lion, you will be with the crowd and all the coffee shops and stores and the mall too. Overall, I would rate this a 3 star, would probably not stay here next time.

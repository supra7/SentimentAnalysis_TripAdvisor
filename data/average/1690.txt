Hi, usually Hilton are a good choice when i'm travelling for business. The Hilton Bayfront surprised me for several reasons: - The cost of additional services: you have to pay to get in to the fitness center or to the pool (this is really unusual) - I haven't got room service for two days! And they just said me "ok, sorry!" ... this is not what you expect from a 4 stars ... There are better hotels in the neighbours

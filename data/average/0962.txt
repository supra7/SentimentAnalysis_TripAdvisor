We decided to travel to the states and upon our journey realized a lot of hotels were booked out. We had a coupon book called roomsaver and noticed the travelodge with a good price. It was getting on 11pm, so we contacted the hotel and got availability. The hotel is in a good location, beside a lot of great shops. The hotel itself seems a bit dated. Front staff was decent enough (being it 12:30AM by the time we got there). Got keys and into room. Room was a bit small but okay. We are used to staying in all sorts of hotels, this one was clean. Mattress was comfy and bathroom though a bit small, shower was nice and spacious. There is a hot/pool outside but it looked like it had a bit of scummy/yucky stuff on top. ugh..Free wi-fi, continental breakfast was decent enough. Cold cereals, muffins, yogourt and bars. Kept us going for most of the morning. Decent enough to just sleep in...don't expect too much more!

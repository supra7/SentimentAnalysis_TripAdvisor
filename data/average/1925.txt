While the reviews are true the staff is wonderful the hotel leaves something to be desired. I made our reservations months in advance so we could get into the newer building but was put in the older wing. They did upgrade us to the suite. The room was old, ugly and anything but peaceful. The bed coverings are polyester, kelly green wild hawaiin print - I turned them over to expose the white underside, as there were 2 beds of too much print. A few upgrades and this place would be a gem. The location was fabulous, we loved that there were chairs all over the property and chaise rentals right on the beach which is feet in front of the hotel. Everything was OK, the view from our room and the location of the hotel and once again the staff were all excellent. We would not stay here again, I am not a hotel snob but this place is just a bit too old for me.

My husband and I have just returned from a short break at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. I must say that after reading the mixed reviews on this site, I was apprehensive about stopping here. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. The plus sides of the hotel were: - the main areas of the hotel are beautifully decorated; very ornate - price; very good value - location; it's very central and close to brilliant shops / restaurants / Boston Common / Cheers, etc - our room was comfortable (the bed was great) and large (room 1009) - MJ O'Connors Irish Bar; well, we were there over Paddy's Day! The downsides to the hotel were: - it's very busy (it appears to host lots of conferences); check-in took a whole and the general phone numbers weren't answered quickly - it was noisy first thing in the morning; we were at the back of the hotel right above the loading bays - the staff weren't particularly friendly - they didn't have a UK - US adapter (despite telling us that they had), and we were unable to locate one in town. Lesson learnt - if you're planning to use UK electrical equipment, don't forget to bring an adapter with you!

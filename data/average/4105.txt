I stayed here for business and extended my stay by a day for sightseeing. The hotel is fairly typical as large convention hotels go -- very large, lots of amenities and conveniences, easy to get a cab, etc. A few problems: - Ridiculously slow elevators - No free Internet access anywhere in the hotel, ridiculous in this day and age, especially in a hotel that purports to cater to conferences and business travelers - Small and very average rooms for the price I realize Boston is a more expensive city than some, but $300 for a room that could have been in any hotel in any city was too much. All that said, the hotel staff was EXTREMELY nice, accommodating, friendly and helpful at all times.

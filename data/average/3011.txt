i'd rather stay on a park bench than suffer this dive again,walls of paper cleanliness a new concept and bed linen that the local working girls would scoff at.saying that they are handy for directions but take care by the irish bar in concepion avenue,(hope that's spelt right),there's a metro station there where lots of homeless boys live and they will find a way of parting you from your $$$$.be under no illusions they have nothing so have nothing to lose.i met a guy from chile who'd lost his passport and was having problems and he wised me up to this fact,for which i gave him some clothes bought him food and a few beers.gran via is a lively place with lots of fun to be had just keep your wits about you and do not get to drunk.

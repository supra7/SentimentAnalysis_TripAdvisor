we stayed 2 nights after a cruise using some frequent stay points and paying a lower rate. the rooms were spacious, lacks much closet space for hanging clothes. in our room the sink plug didn't have the up/down stem so you had to remove the plug unit manually. don't like the half shower door for the tub, things still get wet. didn't mind the location as Llacuna metro station is 3 zig-sag blocks away but if i visit barcelona again i might consider staying at a place closer to La Rambla. The sleep quality was excellent, not noisy in the area. breakfast was excellent, plenty of options. did appreciate allowing us to check in early. had top floor (6th) room so no possible noise above us.

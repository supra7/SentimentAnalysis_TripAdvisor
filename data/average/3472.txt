At over $800 per night at the Four Seasons Bosporus, we were disappointed to find that our room did not have a river view. When we arrived we were told that such views are available mainly in the main building Palace Bosporus rooms at more than $1,000 per night! As we were led to our room in one of the side wings, the receptionist pointed to the hallway window framing the river view and said Isnt it beautiful, then led us halfway down the hall to a room overlooking a scruffy vacant lot where the only glimpse of the river could be had by sitting on the bay window seat and stretching to look out. The room itself was spacious and comfortable, but decorated in a bland, modern manner that could have been anywhere in the world. Earlier in the trip we spent five nights at the Four Seasons Sultanahmet in Istanbuls old city and were delighted with its Turkish charm. There we had a suite with separate sitting area and powder room (as well as a full bathroom) for $100 less per night. As always, the Four Seasons staff was charming and professional with good English skills. The ample buffet breakfast on a geranium lined terrace overlooking the river was delightful. The pool area and spa are quite beautiful. It was great fun to sit by the pool and watch the busy river traffic go by.

I may be a bit partial because I came straight from a night at the W Hotel, which was amazing, but I was a little underwhelmed with The Westin. Front desk services was great - early check in was a breeze, and late check out was good, too. Hotel was clean and nice, but it seemed a bit dated to me - decor was a little older, and elevators seemed to take a long time. Amenities were also nice - great to have the option to work out, and a dip in the pool/hot tub was nice... Not impressed with having to pay for wifi, though! One thing that I was pretty annoyed with was that even though we had requested late check out we had a service employee actually enter our room at 8 am (while we were in bed, sleeping) and another try to enter again at 12! But the thing that redeemed this hotel was the LOCATION. It was super close to shopping, not far away from Pike Pace and close enough to have a great view/walk to the Space Needle. With all that being said, if the price is right, I'd stay here again.

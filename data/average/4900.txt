This is a magnificent hotel lobby, but once you get to your rooms, not as magnificent. The hotel is showing its age - and the rooms are still small. The beds and pillows really need to be replaced as they're old and worn out. Suprisingly, there were no coffee/tea makers in the rooms - not like the other grand Chicago Hilton or other hotels in town. The staff was really great and freindly, but if you want to stay there, be sure to get a room far away from the "loop". That train rattles the room when it zips by. As far as recommending the Palmer - there are better hotels in Chicago than this one, but you have to at least stop by and see the ornate lobby. It's a block away from the Art Institute of Chicago - a must see as well. I'd not recommend this due to its age and small rooms/value.

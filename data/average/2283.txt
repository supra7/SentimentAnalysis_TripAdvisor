My husband and I recently stayed at Parrot Key for some much needed R&R. The Hotel is Lushly Landscaped (beautiful), advertised as a Resort with Several Pools, Fitness Center and Restaurant/Lounge. Set up more similar to a Small Community with Townhouses & White Picket Fences, you do get the feeling of seclusion at night, despite being adjacent to a Walgreen's (this hotel shares the parking lot) and directly off a very busy road. Located @ 2 miles from Duval, we actually found the walk do-able during the day. Our hotel room was beachy in decor and spacious, though sparsely decorated with a no frills feel. The bathroom was tiny (shower only/single vanity). The bed was comfortable; however, the room temperature is regulated by the hotel and we found the room rather stuffy and too warm at night. Leaving the window open was not an option as there are many cats and roosters on the island. (i.e. 3am...cock-a-doodle-doo...meow...etc...) The restaurant is an outdoor cafe serving breakfast and lunch during certain hours only, closing at 7pm. The Fitness Center was a joke...a closet with 3 treadmills, 1 eliptical trainer and 1 rack of dumbbells - hardly what you'd expect at a resort. Although we enjoyed our stay and visit to Key West, we would not stay at this average hotel again.

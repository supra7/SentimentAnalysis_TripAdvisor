This novotel is not at the best location if you're a tourist. Next time, I'd prefer to stay close to tourist area, although tram 4 is just next to the hotel and in 20 min you're in the main streets of Amsterdam. So if was not a huge problem after all. The only thing is that it has no restaurants around and you get to eat at the restaurant of the hotel, which was reaaly nice. Too crowded because there is a conference center nearby, but they managed to serve very efficiently. The staff eas very helpful. We arrived in the middle of a blackout in he whole block and they did their best to accomodate us. The elevators worked and we just stayed in our rooms until the lights were on again. My niece was sick when we arrived and one of the staff people, jayme was very nice trying to help us. He was very concerned and asked how she was the othe days and offered to help if we needed anything. Very nice of him. Also a Brazilian man of the staff, Ruy I think, was very nice and helpful. The blanket of the pull-out sofa bed where my nephew slept was very dirty, obvioulsy not changed since the last guest. I complained with him and took note of that to verify it. I think they should pay attention more carefully to the cleaning of the rooms because of this. I'm sure this is not a regular event in this hotel. Wifi internet was free of charge which was very nice and unusual for a novotel. I'd like if other novotels would do the same. Breakfast was very good!

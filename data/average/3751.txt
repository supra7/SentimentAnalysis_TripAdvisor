My husband and I stayed here for 1 night during the state fair. The absolute stand out thing about this hotel was the staff. They were all friendly, helpful and really made our stay here. The room was large and clean. A pretty standard suite, nothing special but great value for money. Breakfast offered a good selection. The only thing we didn't like about this hotel was the area. We had booked thinking we could walk to restaurants in the West End district but the area directly around this hotel did not feel safe. It was dark and deserted apart from a couple of homeless people and 2 guys we saw obviously selling drugs. I would recommend using taxis if staying here.

We were directed to this new, and allegedly hip, hotel in downtown Chicago as members of a wedding party over the 4th of July weekend. The staff, ALL IN BLACK and ALL YOUNG, are under the delusion that they are doing hotel guests a favor, thus their demeanor is uppity, disengaged and impersonal to the point where they look at their computer screens more than the guests. The rooms were amply furnished but given the refurbished nature of the hotel, they have left the ceilings in raw concrete (to add to the "rustic" character?), the wall plugs do not work and lighting is totally inadequate to the point of not being able to even read a newspaper! I had to threaten Room Service in order to have drinking water bottles in the room fridge and coffee packets to be replenished (maybe the Room Service people decided to celebrate the 4th of July at home?!). What was incredulous, however, was when we got on the elevator and were joined by a young lady with a huge bowl of salad destined for the wedding reception at the top floor bar of the hotel; the bowl was uncovered, the young lady was joyfully using the guest elevator -instead of the service one- and any of the other ten passengers could have spat on the salad in the bowl with potentially disastrous infectious results! What took the cake, of course, was that I did not pay any attention until I got home but I was charged for parking at the hotel for two nights instead of only one at an additional charge of $40 which I am still owed! So, although very weel located in the downtown area of Chicago with easy access to great restaurants and other visitor delights, this hotel tries to pretend being a Philip Stark hotel (young and hip) but fails miserably in the execution of the intent. Management better get with it or else DANA HOTEL will not last too long as a visitor destination, at least not for my family and friends.

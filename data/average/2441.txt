Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while seeing the sights and waiting for other families to fly in for a 2 week trip on the east coast. We found the staff to be friendly & helpful. The rooms were very nice and quiet for being so close to the airport. It is only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown and had easy access to and from the freeway. Would recommend for a short trip to anyone.

We cannot understand the amazing reviews for this hotel. The staff at this hotel was very friendly, but it did not make up for the poor quality of the food, the uncomfortable beds and the awful location. The room service meal we ordered was cold and tasteless (they also forgot something and asked us to come down and get it!) The breakfast buffet, which cost $12, was worse than the complimentary meals we usually receive at comparable hotels; my husband and I both thought the eggs were the worst we ever had. Moreover, the beds were not very comfortable and the compressor on our mini-refrigerator was so loud that it woke us up several times in the night. Also, the location of the hotel is only good if you need to be at the airport very early in the morning, but it sounds at though the shuttle is not reliable. The hotel is right in the landing path of the airport. Planes fly directly over the hotel (only a couple hundred of feet above the building). Finally, the hotel is not that close to any nice area, it is also not well marked from the road and it is dangerous to get in and out of; you risk life and limb trying to walk anywhere. Other than the great desk staff, we found the hotel sub-par. Sorry guys.

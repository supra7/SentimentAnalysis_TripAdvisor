Hotel has great location and great feel, but falls short of expectaions for a W property. Lobby is crazy....never seemed to be enough desk staff to handle hoards of people with luggage everywhere. Staff was nice and helpful, just needed more of them. Lounge area in downstairs lobby was generally unkempt with lots of trash and our room looked a little tired and could have used some paint touch up, etc. On the positive side, room amenities...Bliss products...were awesome!

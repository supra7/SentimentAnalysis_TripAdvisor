If you are on a budget and don't want to stay in a newer hotel I would def recommend the trump, hide your valuables though because my iPad got stolen from my room and the security team did nothing to help me out. They never offered to check the security cameras and when I asked them to do so they refused. We decided to stay here because we found a discount rate on a website, overall the hotel is nice, the rooms are ok - the bathroom is big, however we were stuck with a room that had views to the highway and had to deal with the annoying train horn every hour. The hotel location isn't bad and they have a free shuttle to the Wynn and Caesars Palace.

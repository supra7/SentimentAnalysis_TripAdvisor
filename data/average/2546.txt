The hotel is in an excellent location right outside Euston station and it is extremely easy to reach all the main sites quickly on either the tube or buses . The room was pretty basic , what you would expect from a Travelodge , but again for the price we paid and it's location excellent value . We had a room on the lower ground floor and unlike other reports we had little noise from outside ... so try and get one of those . Now the bad bit , there was a large rowdy group staying at the hotel and these caused a real nuisance with noise . We asked to move rooms but were told the only other available room was also near other parts of the party so we stayed put . The staff could have been much more efficient in helping to sort out the problem and they seemed pretty disinterested . The bed had also certainly seen better days and was very uncomfortble . All in all if you get a good rate it's ok for one or two nights .

We stayed here for 2 nights in May for our sons birthday. Took in the M's vs. Yankees games both Saturday & Sunday. The room was clean, looked like it had been recently updated. The beds were comfortable, only complaint is that the room had 2 double beds instead of 2 Queen beds. Double is a little small for 2 especially when you are used to a King, but we survived. The parking is crazy expensive for $28/night, so since we knew we would not need our car for the entire weekend, we parked at the convention center for $17 a night and walked to the hotel, which is only a few blocks. The elevators are very, very slow. My husband and son went to the breakfast buffet and said it was very expensive for what they got. For the price we paid $85.00/night, I would definately stay there again. For their published rack rate of over $200 a night, no way. We really enjoyed the location and were able to walk to all parts of the city. All in all we would stay again.

I had always thought that Sheraton hotels have a good reputation. We are disappointed with this AVERAGE hotel. Average service, no smiles, no pleasantries, average knowledge of area. We booked the Sheraton club room, our room was on the 34th floor, close to the Presidential suite . The room looked out straight into the block of offices across the road. So a view of people's offices! The concierge was at times short and not helpful. Service was worse at the front desk, they have to be retrained on how to serve customers with courtesy and pleasant attitude. The club lounge is again AVERAGE, no soft drinks were available, just water, tea and coffee. The waiter was more interested in getting tips, rather than serving. The breakfast was also AVERAGE. The hotel is dated, carpet was dirty and worn.the bathroom was old and dated, the shower/bath tap conversion did not work. The gym was again AVERAGE, the treadmills are on the mezzanine level of the gym, so you have a view of half of window and half of the wall! The equipment was AVERAGE and limited. The location is good for shopping, close to the major shopping centers. However, there are so many homeless people around, at almost every corner and around the hotel, I felt quite unsafe to be wondering around here. Even the concierge advised me to be weary of running by myself in the early morning. Pool was freezing, the spa was too hot!!!

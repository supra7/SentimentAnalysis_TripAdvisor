Friendly staff and nice size rooms but the building is a little run down. Also the lobby and other street level access is not wheelchair accessible from the elevator. The elevator opens on its own level and you have to walk up or down stairs to get out of the hotel. Strange set up. It was difficult getting a cab from in front of the hotel. It seemed a little expensive for the odler style rooms and building. One good note-it is attached to a Seattle's Best Coffee and across the street from a great Italian restaurant.

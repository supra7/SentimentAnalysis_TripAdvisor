Great location steps away from the Prudential Center. Low rise hotel meant you could hear street noise. Old building re-done in a modern style. Rooms were clean, down comforters that were too warm with AC that would not go below 65. Staff was extremely kind and welcoming and professional in every way. No vending machines in this hotel at all, so bring your own mixers. In the end we could have stayed at a few other hotels for the same money had had nicer room and better experience. Priceline lists this as a four star hotel. I'd say 2.5 stars. But again the hotel staff we interacted with were as nice as one could find. Great people, nothing great about the property itself. and, anticipate the $42 valet parking or $39 in the garage at the Pru.

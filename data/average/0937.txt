Rooms are small, middle of the road furnishings, adequately cleaned. Pool and hot tub area are nice. Exercise room has 3 stationary machines and large window looking out toward Space Needle. Lobby is small but nice. Breakfast area is nice with good selection of food. Price is too high. There are much nicer rooms in several other hotels in the same area that are the same price.

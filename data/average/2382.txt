We stayed in this hotel when we first went to HongKong last 2009. We were in connecting rooms and our room is much bigger than other typical hotel rooms in HongKong. So bad that I don't have much photos of it but all I can remember is that the location of Newton Place in Kowloon is quite far from the MongKok area which is the center of HongKong. We hardly find restaurants during late nights unlike in the Metropark and area. I guess, the hotel is near the residential area, that's why. We were not able to explore it since we are included in the tour group. When you are getting tour packages, I suggest that you ask your operator to confirm your hotel. We were advised to stay at Panda Hotel but for some reason, we were thrown in Newton Place as soon as we arrived in HongKong. While the hotel has good interior and the rooms are bigger, it's still really frustrating.

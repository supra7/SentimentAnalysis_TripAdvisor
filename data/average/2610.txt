Booking: I won a bid on Priceline.com. Give this option a try...if you know how to use the "Negotiator" tool, this could save you money. We got a "King Room", on a higher floor, away from the elevators. Area: This is not the "rich" side of Chelsea...still, it offers good dining options and the subway is nearby. Facilities: The hotel is new, clean...though very small. Room: The room is fine. All the furniture is new, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom (and the toiletries) are nice. Tiny...is an understatement for the overall size of the room(s) though. Good Surprises: All the diners in the area offer good food and quick delivery - they even deliver right to your room door. Strangely Missing: Rooms have everything except for the most important - TOOTHPASTE! Overall: We stayed only for 1 night...it was an average hotel experience...but the price was fair. Tip: Ask front desk for a set of menus from restaurants that deliver...this will save you money & effort. Have fun, be safe, and happy trip!

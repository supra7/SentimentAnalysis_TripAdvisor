We booked this hotel online at the 11th hour,as we were not sure if we would be making our flight to Maui. Upon arrival the booking could not be found...and our room wasn't ready. We had to fill in a few hours before coming back to check in. I must add that the hotel was really busy as there was a Hula competition on. Eventually after we checked into our room,we were pleasantly surprised. We had a garden view room,which you could see the ocean from. The room was very spacious,though the shower/toilet was tiny. The pillows were not fantastic and the hotel had no others to offer. I think the hotel is more suited to families on a budget. We were told the hotel is privately owned which to me added to the quaintness of the hotel...no big chain name..the hotel has truly been kept in sleepy Hawaiian style..which isn't a bad thing(maybe except for the pillows)

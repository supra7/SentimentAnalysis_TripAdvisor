We stayed here for 1 night prior to an Alaskan cruise. I'm satisfied with our choice because we got a decent rate. Granted the hotel is older and showing some wear, as does the room, but the room was good sized, clean and quiet, with a refrigerator. We faced the street, but didn't hear any noise at night. There didn't seem to be much traffic here at night. This area does have several other hotels, including a Holiday Inn across the street. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Space Needle, which we visited prior to the cruise. There didn't seem to be many restaurant choices in the immediate area; I believe there was an Italian one within a couple blocks, but not much else except a McDonald's. Didn't want to do too much walking at night, as the area was pretty deserted on a Friday night. The hotel breakfast is very good, with a lot of choices, even bacon. If the room is crowded, an adjoining conference room can be used, so space was not an issue. We took the hotel's $6pp shuttle to the cruise pier, which is about a mile away. This worked well as it was efficient and on time. This was a good reasonably priced chocie for a pre/post cruise stay.

Stayed here for a close friend's Navy wedding. Wedding was at the Naval Base across the street, rooms were nice, not cleaned very well in between our stay though. Our second night the fire alarm went off at 6 in the morning, because of "smoke in the kitchen". Overall had a good time, surrounding area is nice, places to go, things to do.

I stayed in fragrance sunflower for three nights . Staff is very rude especially receptionist at night duty Check in took one hour although we booked online in advance..Hotel provides only 2 glass of drinking water( 250 ml each) per day.You have to request for extra water(although they provide on repeated requests after threatening that you will be charged for it). Hotel must provide at least 2 bottles of drinking water as it is very hot in singapore.

The location is great for shopping and you can walk to pretty much any major tourist attraction in the central area of Seattle. We chose to take taxis twice when we were too tired to walk 20-25 minutes at the end of the day. Most places are under a 20 minute walk. However, I was disappointed with this Westin. This is normally one of our favorite chain hotels. The carpet in our room was quite dirty and bore multiple large stains throughout the room. Yuk! The bed was the awesome beds Westin is well known for. The room was otherwise clean, but the bathroom was not what I would call large. It was adequate for two people as long as one was in the shower while the other got ready. A quick peek into another room while being cleaned showed that it too had an old, dirty carpet. I've never had to use slippers in a Westin hotel room before, but this time I did. Also, even though we were on one of the higher floors (even though we'd requested a low floor) we could hear sirens, honking and the traffic below. I wear earplugs so no bother for me at night, but my family could hear it. Lastly, the two times we asked the valets or doormen for directions or information it was incorrect.

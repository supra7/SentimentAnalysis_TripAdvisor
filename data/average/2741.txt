We got a great deal on the room. So based on that alone I would probably stay here again if it was during the spring or fall. The hotel is no where near a subway stop. The closest one is the F train and that is about a 5 or 10 minute walk from the hotel. When I stayed there it was warm, so walking to the subway stop was no big deal, but I can imagine if it was 15 degrees out, I'd be singing a different tune. The hotel is underneath a bridge. So it can get pretty loud noise. I shut the bathroom door, which helped muffle the noise, and luckily my boyfriend and I are fairly deep sleepers. Overall clean hotel, but the bathroom seemed a little dated. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles to the place. It's in the middle of Chinatown, so if you don't like the smell of fish don't stay here. As there are Chinese markets with fish and dried fish galore. I didn't mind the smell because it reminds me of any big Asian metropolitan city. Is the best hotel to stay out in NYC? Probably not. Is it the worst? No.

Not that bad. I read the reviews AFTER I stayed there - had I read them before I would have avoided the Seattle Pacific Hotel. I have stayed in a lot top-end hotels and if you are after that experience, this isn't the hotel for you. But the rooms were clean, the price was great and the location was awesome. The clientele seemed to be mostly young people, an budget travellers. No one too sketchy. Some problems to expect: The room had a funky locking system, however. You had to insert your card into the door after leaving your room to lock it. No one told us that, we learned our second day there. There were some prostitutes advertising on the highway on the highway outside the hotel. I'll let you decide if this is a problem. You can't turn into the hotel if you are on the wrong side of the highway due to a media. There won't be a left turn for miles. So turn right and figure out a different route to the hotel. WiFi connection is pretty weak. But if you are staying there on a business trip, you're company is cheap. :0) ---------------------- It's a dive hotel - but I expected a dive hotel. But it wasn't a scary dive hotel and the staff were accomodating every time we dealt with them. I wouldn't want to spend a week there but it's perfect for a weekend in Seattle.

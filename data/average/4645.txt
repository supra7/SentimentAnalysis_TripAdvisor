My husband and I just returned from a weekend stay at the Fairmont Copley. He had a conference there, so at the conference rate, the price of the room/quality of the hotel was good. I would not stay there for the full rate. The lobby is huge and ornate. It was festively decorated for Christmas. Several companies were having their holiday parties there both nights in the rooms off the lobby, which meant we had to navigate through large groups of smokers outside the hotel and smaller groups of somewhat intoxicated partyers inside the hotel. Our floor was a non-smoking floor, however, the smell of smoke managed to work its way upstairs so that our hallway smelled like smoke. I agree with a previous poster about the lack of shelves/drawers to put belongings and clothes. The bathroom was a nice size, but I though the towels were poor quality. The gym is on the 1st floor with adequate equipment. It's rather small and one thing I thought was odd was that there was no bathroom. The room is too small for a bathroom, but I figured there must be one next door. When I asked where the closest bathroom room was, I was told downstairs in the lobby or up in my room. It just seemed strange. My last complaint - the costs of in-room internet access ($13 or $14) and the charge for use of the computer in the lobby, but the kicker was that to print something out there is a $1.05 charge per sheet of paper. $1.05 per sheet of paper???? Please. I recently stayed at a Marriott Courtyard in San Francisco and there was free wifi not only in the lobby but in the hotel rooms. urthermore, I needed to print an important document and they printed out the entire 22 pages for FREE. I don't want to be totally negative. The location is great if you plan to shop. Also, the concierge and front desk staff were friendly and efficient. I've stayed at several Fairmonts and am usually "wowed" by my stay. This didn't quite live up to my experiences at other Fairmonts.

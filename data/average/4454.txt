I am a Hilton Diamond member and I was disappointed with my recent stay at the Back Bay Hilton in Boston. Returning after living abroad for a couple of years and excited to be back in Boston for a quick visit, I booked the brand of hotel I know and trust and am most loyal to. The Hilton Back Bay reminded me of a Hampton Inn level of hotel. There are not many amenities for those in their loyalty program. Additionally, the room was not serviced one day (!) and the makeup of a previous guest was never removed from the telephone receiver in the bathroom. I was most surprised by the quality of the room given the hotel advertises that they have recently gone through a multi-million dollar renovation. The hotel room did not live up to the quality rooms I find in Hilton hotels around the world, including in Asia Pacific where I live. I try to stay in Hiltons each week when I travel. If central location is what you are seeking, this is a good choice amongst many hotels in the area.

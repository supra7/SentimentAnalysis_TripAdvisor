Staff was friendly. Room definitely had a dorm room feel to it. Within walking distance to most downtown Montreal shopping/attractions. No parking. Could use more lighting in bathroom and towel racks that didn't fall off wall. Hotel seemed to be on border with a good area of downtown and a bad area. Would stay here again.

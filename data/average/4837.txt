I was at this historic hotel for a 3 day business trip. After reading the hotel web-site I expected modern rooms situated within a historic hotel with old Chicago era flare. However, the recent renovation must have only included the bathroom sink, mirror and bed. The rest of the room was dated (like 1960's), pale green tiles, old looking carpet, black lacquer furniture and extremely small rooms (think European). I am a Hilton honors member and I was not acknowledged as such upon check in. Normally, I receive a bottle of water or free internet, not the case at this hotel. During my second day, the fire alarm went off in my room. After I scrambled to get dressed and left, I realized it was only MY room. I went to the front desk to address the issue later that day and they laughed at me (after hearing my story) and told me not to worry about it. I was unsatisfied with this response and I called the desk back later and was transferred to security. This person was very hard to understand because of his heavy accent. He informed me that the fire alarm in my room had been replaced earlier in the day and the problem should be fixed. I wouldn't have mentioned this incident, if it weren't for the fact that no one came to my room or called when the alarm was going off or informed me that the faulty alarm was fixed. I had to initiate the requests. What if it was a real fire? As I mentioned earlier, this hotel was a historic hotel. The lobby was beautiful with hand painted ceilings and gilded lights. Additionally, the conference rooms were ornately decorated and had huge chandeliers throughout. There were so many antique features in the hotel; it felt like you stepped back in time. Overall, it was tolerable for a short business trip. However, if you are looking for luxury this may not be the place for you. The staff was not very helpful and some of them had heavy accents that made them difficult to understand.

I stayed at this hotel for one night in August 2011. The hotel was uncomfortable hot in the public areas and our hallway had a funny smell. We were able to turn the AC down when we entered our room so our room was comfortable. The room was clean and in a decent location. Breakfast was typical but there was minimal seating available. Overall it was an ok hotel but you get what you pay for.

Went with my wife and 3 month old. Got a smokin deal and was takin back by how nice it was inside. Didn't pay $40 for the parking and parked on the street, beacause it was a long weekend we didn't have to plug parking meters. It was fairly close to all amenities of down town. Some crazy hills outside. I would recomend zig zagging up streets to avoid one constant hill climb. Would stay there again if was to get the same good deal. They had a beautiful fireplace down stairs where you could kick back and sip some cocktails. Food was a little over priced in the Hotel and would strongly recommend taking a two minute stroll around the block for restaurants.

Room (#146, 18th floor) left much to be desired: broken shower head, broken towel rack, no coffee service, carpet dirty. Puzzled that the cost of the "Continental Breakfast Buffet" in the lobby restaurant was more expensive than ordering a full American breakfast through room service.... Poor soundproofing between rooms and between room and hall.

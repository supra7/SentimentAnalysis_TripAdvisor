Decided last minute to stay in town after getting tickets to the Celtics game.. I must say this wasnt our first choice, most hotels were full, but I am so glad that we stayed here. first off, couldnt beat the price..the location was perfect, near Newbury St. ect.. After reading some of the reivews I was a little leary, but for $200. a nte last minute we decided to book.. Yes this is an older hotel, which we knew going in, I think some people just expect too much. the room on the 15th floor was very nice, yes the bath was small, but so what it was very clean which is the most important thing. nice vview, great bedding..we got to hotel at around 12:30 in the afternoon, front desk was very nice, got right into room....had a drink in bar then took cab to the Garden...less than $10.00...cant beat that.. after game (which was incrediable by the way), back to hotel, went to the Conceirge who got us last minute dinner reservations at Mcormicks and Schmidts...very nice.. the hotel is very beautiful, staff very nice, and th best location, and great price, not sure what all the complaints are all about. If you realize from the get go that this is an older hotel with great character flaws you will love it..I would definatley go back again...perfect for couples and families....

We had already checked about five motels in the area of the Space Needle; all were either sold out or about $35-40/night more than the Vagabond Inn. We saw the 'vacancy" sign, and pulled in. The young woman at the desk was courteous and helpful. We registered for one night, but ended up staying for two. Parking costs $10/day, but so does parking in the City, so we just left our car and walked. And unlike parking lots, you can come and go as many times a day as you want. The room was a bit dreary, but adequate, with TV, refrigerator and microwave. All worked as they should. Someone else wrote in TripAdvisor that the bathroom floor was sticky, but it seemed to me that that was due to adhesive left over when some floor coverning was removed. The bath was clean and the shower worked fine. The complimentary "continental breakfast" in the small lobby comprised juice or bananas, excellent blueberry muffins, and coffee. One computer was available for free in the lobby for e-mails and Internet, and the wireless Internet in the lobby worked without a hitch. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my budget-conscious friends, but I would also suggest that they read the other Tripadvisor reviews.

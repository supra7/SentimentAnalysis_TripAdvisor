We stayed at the KBH on our first trip to Maui, an must admit that although the rooms were okay, nothing special, a bit old, I would not have minded if I had payed $80 per night, but for the $200/night without breakfast which I indeed payed, that was a ripoff in terms of price/benefit....First the hotel did not have a king size bed, it was 2 sepparate beds....the bed was Ok, a bit worn-out, there is a little balcony with a lateral view to teh ocean, and the bathroom was really old, shower did not work properly (there was very little water running) and walls needed a new painting. the hotel is located at the Kanapali strip, which is a great location, but compared to the other resorts (Sheraton, Westin, Marriott0, the KBH is definitelly among the worst ! I only recomend this hotel if you manage a very good deal, but I read other reviews of fellow travelers who managed a rate of $150 at the Westin on priceline, so probably I'd search other hotels first. If you are on a budget trip and don't mind a hotel which has not recently been renovated, the KBH will fit your needs. Be ready to pay a "resort fee" which indeed only grants you access to their own paid parking lot.

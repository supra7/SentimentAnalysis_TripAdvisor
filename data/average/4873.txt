We stayed at this hotel in Dec2010, we booked it for its location and location was really great if you want to enjoy the downtown strolls, though there are no scenic views from hotel rooms,most of the Malls , and theaters are at walking distance, and you can visit Navy Pier and shed aquarium within $10 taxi fare...

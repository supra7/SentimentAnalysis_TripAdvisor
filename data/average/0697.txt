After a friend recommended this place to us for the best view in Seattle we went ahead and booked the room. The location is conveniently located near downtown and areas of interest. Of course this also includes being next to train tracks. That if your room is not facing the water will most likely hear the noise. Upon first arrival please first know that it is a valet only parking, and do not have public parking. For valet parking it is $36/day which will be added to your bill later. The lobby, staff, and lounge are all nice and noteworthy. They placed used in on the 4th floor facing the street. Hmmmm...was hoping for water front but OK. The room was extremely small, so small that we could barely fit our luggage in the room and get it past the bed. I seen bigger rooms in Manhattan. We did hear what ever noise machinery was on the room and train throughout the night. The flatscreen TV in the room was old and had bad static. The phone seemed like it had not been clean for a few years. As well as the clock in the room was off by about 5 hours. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room with a upscale contemporary look and rock shower. After 2 days we decided to ask for a room facing the water and a bigger room. They were about to say no, but luckily they found a room on the first floor. Upon entry into the room it was definitely bigger. The funny thing is the lady said "oooooh yeah you are in our smallest room available". The room did face the water, but faced the pier side with a giant crane in front of the room. Not exactly what I was looking for but atleast its bigger, and our last 2 nights went smoothly. So overall..make sure you ask when staying for a waterfront room that is a good size and not on the fourth floor.

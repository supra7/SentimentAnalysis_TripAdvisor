Stayed here 4 times summer of 2011 if it was that terrible i wouldnt have went back. Hotel offers nothing but good location on the boards and decent rates. Outdated terrible beds but if you can get efficiency room very big with full kitchen and lots of windows. If you just need a room to rest your eyes after a day in the ocean or a night on the town this is the place. If you need anything more look elsewhere

When I spend 200+ dollars a night for a hotel room I expect to be treated well. The customer service in this hotel is lacking. And there is no coffee maker in the room. When I called the front desk at 1015 am I was told there was coffee in the lobby but only until 10, so no I could not have a cup of coffee. They said they could send up a coffee maker but they did not have any ground coffee. I stayed at the hotel 1000 a little less than a year ago and would highly recommend every to stay there instead. Better rooms and better/friendlier staff.

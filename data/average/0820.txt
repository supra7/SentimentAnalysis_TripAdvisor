We stay here quite often while in Seattle as we like the location, and I get a really good rate. Otherwise, we probably would not stay at the Westin while in Seattle. Very long line at checkin (18 people in line); but we moved to the SPG preferred check in (hidden in the room to the right) and check in was much, much faster. This is an older hotel, and it shows. The rooms are OK but you can tell they are well worn. Standard Westin beds, and bathroom goodies. The location is good (unless you are heading towards one of the stadiums ... then the W or Sheraton are closer). I prefer the North tower as you have a better chance of water view. Parking is expensive; we park up the street about four blocks in a paid lot and walk (Was $6 for the evening until 7am. We moved the car in the AM to free street parking-Sunday. Total $6 for parking). I would say I do prefer the W and Sheraton over the Westin but we stayed here only because of the lower rate. If you can get a low rate, the Westin is OK otherwise look for something else in town.

I just got back from a week long stay at Tres Rios...This is a very beautiful resort and the food was good but I would not recommend this place to anyone..Lets start with check-in..it was a nightmare we were taken to the sports bar where a lady was suppose to tell us about the resort she did a terrible job and after an hour we were able to go to our room which was wrong but we got that staightened out quickley..The staff that checked us in really had no idea what they were doing..We did not attend the time share thing so we could not take advantage of the free taxi to Playa..The pool area was a big maze and there was only one bathroom outside and it seemed like everytime we went to use it someone was in there cleaning it. The resort was like a ghost town at night very little to do and the shows were over by 9:30.The sports bar was more like a meeting room. There were no activities or music during the day around the pool..very boring. It was also a little strict..We got yelled at for bringing our lunch into the sports bar told u could not eat in there but the had a buffet set up in there on saturday...The shows were ok..would not recommend going to see Millissa..They really need to use the theater for more activities..The food was really good but the buffets were kinda boring..The other restuarant required men to wear long pants and they would not let u in if you had shorts on..I found this silly b/c the restuarant was right with the buffett.. The staff was really nice although you had to wait awhile for things around the pool..Our room was always clean and room service was quick..all and all it was a nice trip.

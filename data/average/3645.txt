This is a typical Super8 hotel- no thrills but good value. Check-in efficent. Room clean and tidy. Good wireless internet access. We found a local mexican restaurant in the Wal-mart centre on the opposite side of the freeway. Area is dry, so be prepared to show your driving licence if you want a beer! Like many of these hotels (other brands as well) proximity to freeway means traffic noise at night, so don't plan on a full sleep! Overall, no major complaints for the money.

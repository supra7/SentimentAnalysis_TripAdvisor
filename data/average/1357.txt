Stayed for a night This is a large business/conference hotel across from the airport. Parking was expensive, especially when theres options on the same street with free parking (Coast Inn, Radisson, Comfort Inn). If you can walk, theres free parking in the residential neighborhood behind the hotel. But its quite a hike, uphill to get there. Hotel is typical for a large chain. Front desk staff were in very limited supply when I arrived at about 10:00pm. Only one person working the desk for a line of people about 10 deep. Another clerk finally arrives and the line started to move. Rooms are typical Hilton, nothing all too remarkable about them. Hotel is oddly layed out, so may be hard to get your bearings. Recommended if you can get a very good rate, like on Priceline.

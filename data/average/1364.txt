Paris must need a new pair of shoes - this place will nickel and dime you beyond a good value! The price for parking and internet is outrageous. It's an airport inn, come on, pony up and include parking AND internet. Ridiculous to pay huge fees for a free service most other places. You are not the only game in town, in fact, many other choices very nearby. In fact, we used the FREE connection for the hotel across the parking lot. Good things - the staff was probably the most helpful people we have come into contact with as a whole. Everyone went above and beyond to ensure we were informed or accommodated.

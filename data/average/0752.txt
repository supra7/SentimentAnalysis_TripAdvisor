We booked a water view room with Expedia to find that for $30 more we could have full water view. The room had some good view of bay and ferries. Cute balcony but odor of fuel from said ferries made it useless. Room nice and adequate but noisy, doors slamming, heard talking next door. More walking than we would have liked but did have complimentary van service. All in all not a 4 star hotel.

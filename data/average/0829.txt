We stayed at the Seattle Westin for one night prior to a cruise. The hotel is in a great location in downtown Seattle, within walking distance to many shops and restaurants. The beds were very comfortable. The hotel staff members were friendly and helpful. However, the decor was dated and the upholstery of the furniture in the rooms and in the public spaces was dirty.

Good *Room decor was contemporary *Bed / room was very comfortable *Pleasant stay overall *Close by to Downtown Nightclubs, Bicentennial Park,Bayfront Park Amphitheater, A.A. Arena(Concerts,Sport Events). *Atmosphere in Lounge /Lobby area is Cool *Staff was better than expected(for Miami!) Not Good *Parking,Parking,p a r k i n g!!! I think it was $28 a day to valet park.Self parking fee was not much cheaper either and finding your car might be a bit of a challenge.Taxi or other means of transport might be the best if You are unwilling to pay over $20 dollars for parking. *Room was clean but some more attention to details are needed.

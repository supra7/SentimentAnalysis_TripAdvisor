The hyatt is currently being remodeled. The public spaces are 1992 Hawaii cliche. The beds are comfortable bu too low to the ground. The pool area is way too crowded. There is no beach and if you want an ocean view lawn chair you must pay extra for it. The service was great, but not worth the price. One comment on the Kaanapali area my wife made was that she was very uncomfortable walking the beach side promenade was that it was too narrow.

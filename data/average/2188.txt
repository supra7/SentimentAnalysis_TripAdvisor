I stayed at the Trump this past weekend. This was my second trip to Vegas; my last stay was that the New York, New York, and I like that hotel so much better. The best things about the Trump International were its close proximity to the Fashion Show Mall and the fragrant lobby. Our room was just average, very small to be a city view suite. The sofa bed was the worst mattress Ive every slept on. I would have been better off sleeping on a sleeping bag. The hotel management was not very accommodating with upgrading our room. They did however offer us a mattress topper. We had a rental car and the valet kept listing the care under the wrong name. We stayed on the 34th floor and rarely got a cell signal. The only way we got a good signal is by standing right in front of the window. The bellmen were very friendly but overall I was very disappointed with my stay at this hotel.

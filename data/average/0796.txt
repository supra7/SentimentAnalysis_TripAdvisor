Stayed at the Westin on our last night in Seattle, we had left to visit Portland Org. for a few nights and decided to check out the Westin on our return... mostly due to the views that would be found. The views were great... can't fault them there... but beyond that... it is a very disjointed hotel, parking and checkin is a mess unless you are aware that you are to go to parking prior to checking in. The rooms are ok, we had a suite, but very dated, bathrooms are something out of a Holiday express and yet older and in worse shape. The breakfast was at a nook in the corner of the lobby... now this was very much like a Holiday Express... can't imagine why they do not have a dining room to eat at.. Coffee maker in room was fine, yet no mugs as is typical in upscale hotels,,, they provide paper cups, I wonder if the Gen. manager has training at Express type hotels... as with all the perceived ambiance... at it's core beat the heart of a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn express. If you were to buy a bottle of water while walking around Seattle... and thought you might utilize the in room refrigerator to keep it cold... a blunt sign on the refrigerator states that a $7.00 charged will be levied if it is used for storage of items.. Not a very quite hotel either... on the 41st floor certainly no street noises , yet the walls must be paper thin, as we could all above and around us. The cold air coming in from the window was just another reminder of the state of this hotel. I am sure we will visit Seattle again... yet not the Westin.

The hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood with a food court with a wide variety of fast food stalls located a block away. Marina Bay is within leisurely walking distance through the Kallang Water Park. There is another Fragrance Hotel in the block so make sure you have the complete hotel address to avoid confusion. The room I reserved was a standard room. Room is generally clean and space is ample for one or two persons, except that the standard room I was given was without windows. It was not really a problem since I only stayed overnight.. . But for those who are claustrophobic and staying for more than 1 day, make sure you ask for a room with a window. Unlike in other similar hotels, the bathroom of Fragrance Imperial is large enough that the shower is separate from the toilet. The room comes with hot pot and complimentary drinks like bottled water and 3 in 1 coffee mix and basic toiletries like toothbrush, soap and shower cap. The room is equipped with a flat screen TV , fridge and bedside lamp A light switch is also provided by the bedside, so no need to stand up to turn off the lights. The room is generously provided with power outlets which is very convenient for recharging all the electronic gizmos all at the same time. It also has a swimming pool at the roof top. The front desk staff is really friendly and helpful. I have no reservations about staying in this hotel again during my future trips to Singapore.

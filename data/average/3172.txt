Booked late via Cities Direct (who are excellent and I have used before). Wanted to visit Amsterdam, Easter week so not much choice left. Novotel is approx 25 minute tram ride up to Amsterdam City/Central Station so quite far out. The hotel was like a slightly better travel lodge but still 4Star prices for drinks and food. Pleasant staff in restaurant bit stuffy in bar. Tram was approx 400 meters walk to left of front door, next to RAI metro station. Overall OK for hotel but not great location for enjoying the city - especially as weather was cold and wet.

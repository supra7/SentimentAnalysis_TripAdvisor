Twenty bucks a day for self parking? Guess I am just not "with it". The parking spaces are small. The parking garage is quite a ways from the elevators to the rooms. Don't normally mind a walk but this is inconvenient toting a suitcase and a backpack. Business hotel? Unable to access internet without paying. Thought that was a thing of the past. Never have had a problem with that at the Hilton Garden Inns. "Not free for guests unless you are silver or platinum" I was told after having to call for internet support. I try to save my company money by finding good values, not spend more. My room was on the busy street side. Could hear the traffic from time to time. Just a couple of extra business traveling hassels. Will not stay there again.

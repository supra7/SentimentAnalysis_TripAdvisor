Room was tiny but OK for sharing with my daughter. Compact is about right. However, we had Sterling cash stolen from our room. Before you say more fool you, we asked specifically about safe deposit boxes, hotel safe or other secure stroage and were assured by the hotel that it was perfectly safe to leave valuables in the room as all the staff were trustworthy, and there had never been a problem. Some charmer rifled our bags and stole some of the money leaving some so if you casually looked you probably wouldn't notice. Despite that the staff were friendly and helpful, and it is 2 minutes walk from Lavender MRT.

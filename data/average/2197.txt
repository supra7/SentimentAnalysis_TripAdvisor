The hotel looks luxurious. However, our room wasn't cleaned for days , so dirt all over the decorated cabinet. There are stove and half kitchen in the room , but the stove in our room didn't work while my mom's room did. Be aware for people like casino, there is no in this hotel . Only valet parking as well , if you don't want to pay parking , you may park in the shopping mall across the street , but your own risk . Overall , it was good trip.

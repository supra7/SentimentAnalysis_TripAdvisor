I had booked on other users recommendations and when we arrived we were placed in a new area of the hotel (across the road in another building in fact) which was recently completed. The room was new and of typical size for Rome 3star; everything worked and we also had a little balcony onto the street. Price was good so we would be happy to stay here again for a short time.

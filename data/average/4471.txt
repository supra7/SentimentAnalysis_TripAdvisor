a very nice hotel with large attractive rooms and very comfortable beds but unfortunately the first night of our stay was marred by being in smoking rooms. I had booked non smoking but apparently these are not guaranteed. The hotel could not change our booking until the next day. Other than this the stay was excellent The eighth floor is definitely smoking - not sure how many more! 21st floor isn't - and has fabulous views

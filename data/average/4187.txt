The Park Plaza Hotel & Towers is an amazing property if you account for its historical aspects, and fantastic location. Given the generally high cost of accommodations in Boston, the Park Plaza is usually priced towards the mid-tier properties. The location is mostly unbeatable. There is a McCormick & Schmick's attached to the property, in the lobby basically. You're a quick walk to the commons, and a short cab ride away from downtown Boston proper. The rooms, at least the selection I wound up with, were quite small. My room had a double bed, small desk/credenza with a 37" LCD, and a small armoire. There was room to maneuver around the bed and walk towards the bathroom. For the price, it seemed tiny. I also wound up with a view of the building across the street, so be friendly and be dressed! The bed was comfortable, and the room, in spite of being downtown, was quiet. The bathroom also lacked soap. I had to call down and wait almost 20 minutes for soap to be delivered, which made an already tight schedule even tighter. Thought the lack of soap was odd. Other than being older, the fixtures were functional, clean, and the property was being kept up. Parking is only available via Valet, $44 plus gratuity. The staff was ambivalent to us, and apparently only responded with a smile and friendliness if you greeted them with a tip. Poor taste IMHO. Overall, if you can find this property for the right price, and can tolerate the small rooms, the tradeoff is the fantastic location.

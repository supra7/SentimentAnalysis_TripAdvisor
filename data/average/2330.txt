I was expecting more from this place. The buffet was good except it was the same every day; for breakfast that is. A bit overlooked. The Mexican food on any buffet was great tasting. The waiters and waitresses need more training in their assigned duties. It seemed sometimes they were falling over each other to get things done. Looked a bit disorganized. They seemed to be trying to do a good job though. Each day they got a bit better. My son sort of liked the kids program. Other than that, the hotel was good but my son thought the pool was too cold.

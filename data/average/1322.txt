Attended a convention at this hotel so we were somewhat a captive audience. PROS: the catering staff were fantastic! Thank you Keith Anderson! And thanks go to Anna for my Dr. Peppers! CONS: pool noise was awful (the staff did not honor the curfew hours of the pool), internet fee ($15 per day is outrageous and to make it worse the fee doesn't apply in the convention area) and the valet/self-parking fee ($26.00 to $22.00 per day) is a rip-off. One of the convention attendees had their car stolen and another attendee had their car broken into with items stolen. Why do hotel guests get charged such high parking fees only to have safety issues?? Shame on the Marriott!!!

The hotel itself was really nice, but we felt it was a little out of the way from everything. The hotel has a modern feel, mostly decorated with Ikea stuff, which was ok buy us. Unfortunately we didn't really know which area would be the best to stay in and we ended up picking Hotel Aniene for its price and its look. Don't get me wrong, if you don't mind taking a bus, which is only at the end of the block maybe a 8 to 10 minute walk to the Termini Station and the from there you will most likely take the Metro then it is ok, but we felt we spent way too much time doing this. The other problem is that if you plan on staying out after midnight you have to find another form of transportation to get back to the hotel as the Metro stops at midnight but there are night buses just they are a little trickier to figure out and don't run all the frequently. The breakfast was great, not a lot of stuff but tasty, scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, fruit, cereal, toast and such. They did have free internet which is always a plus. The bathroom was good, a big shower which you don't find all that often in Italy. The bed was ok, but the room was kinda tight, not that that really matters cause who really spends lots of time in their room anyways! Would I stay there again, probably not just due to the fact of the location and there is not much around it when it comes time to eating and entertainment.

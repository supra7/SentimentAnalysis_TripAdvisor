Mid-60-70's hotel of circular towers with rooms surrounding the core of elevators. Rooms and interior corridors in need of refurbishing, but bed and linens were very comfy. Service was adequate, great coffee shop that I wish had been open for dinner. Lobby seems to be one big bar area that did not have any allure. Good fitness center and nice pool for the business traveller.

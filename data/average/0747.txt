My husband and I had stayed at the Edgewater to celebrate our anniversary. The room we were in was right across from the bathroom for the conference rooms and right above the lounge. They were having a big wedding and the music and guests were very loud. We were getting the music from the wedding reception and the music from the lounge and the wedding guests going in and out of the bathroom laughing and yelling at each other until about 1 am. It sounded like they were in the room with us, which did not make for a relaxing evening. I had also ordered a gift for my husband which they had forgotten and it took them awhile to bring it up. The way the room was decorated was really cool, and the view was amazing. I thought the room was expensive for what we got. If you can find a quieter room, it might be worth staying there.

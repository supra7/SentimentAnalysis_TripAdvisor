We stayed here for 5 nights this month and although the service was OK it is nothing to rave about. The Lobby is very grand but the rooms are very small and housekeeping was not very reliable and even although the room was cleaned coffee tea not replenished. The situation of the hotel is great just a short walk to Millenium Park, Art Institute etc. Don't have breakfast in the hotel as very pricey, go to the Corner Bakery jut outside hotel.

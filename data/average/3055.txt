Good hotel in a decent location, right next to the main railway station and was perfect for the bus to and from Ciampino Airport. We walked to many of the sights all over the city from the hotel, a fair bit of walking. Don't let that put you off. On arrival at hotel at midday our room was ready. The staff at reception were efficient and well mannered. We had a corner room on the fourth floor looking out onto adjoining street. Double glazing cut out lots of noise (Rome is noisy with traffic and they like sounding their horns !). The room was medium size with comfy bed. The room was very clean as was the bathroom, the only minor complaint was the layout of the bathroom, the shower door open onto the toilet and restricted access a bit, but not a major problem. The buffet breakfast was pretty good with the usual cold selections and some hot choices. The hotel only had a small bar area and no other amenities, but that said we were sightseeing so the hotel choice was good. We stayed for five nights and other than the bathroom design, we had no complaints and would definately recommend this hotel.

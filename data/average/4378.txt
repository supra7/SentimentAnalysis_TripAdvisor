My wife and I stayed at this Hotel for four nights at the start of July. We had booked a standard Botique queen but paid an extra $10 per night for an upgrade. The room was very small but cosy. Our room was located to the front of the Hotel and we found it to be quite noisey with passing traffick during the night. The decor was very modern and the housekeeping service seemed on the ball.Breakfast in the Hotel was good but a bit pricey.The location was great, within walking distance of most attractions. Mini bar was quiet but could have had better opening times.We had a bad experience with one member of staff in the mini bar. My pregnant wife was told to finish a bottle of water she had with her or bin it, even though we were still ordering other drinks in the bar.This could have been handled better , and the particular member of staff seemed to have an attitude problem.Overall front house staff were helpful, overall our stay was good but not great.

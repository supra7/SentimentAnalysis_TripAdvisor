11-27-11 We had Brunch at the pool site wich was not the usual place.I have been comming to brunch for over 30 years and never had a bad experience until today, we had very poor service and the food was not up to paar, cold meat and very few selection. Also there is no workable link/place to contact anyone on the marriot webpage

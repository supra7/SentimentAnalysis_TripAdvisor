When I made reservations at the W it was because of a very good rate I found on line - however, I hadn't had personal knowledge of the "W" hotels. Almost everyone I told I had made reservations was impressed and said how "in" the W hotels are. We had a wonderful view and great bedding, but I was not impressed with the hotel itself. Maybe I'm not young and "in" enough myself. I was expecting special and felt like it was at most typical of a hotel room. No in room coffee or amenities I would have anticipated in a place that seemed to get so much attention. The staff was excellent. We had a nice time. I just don't get the hype.

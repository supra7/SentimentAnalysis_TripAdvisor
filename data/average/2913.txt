I believe the first error on our part was booking this hotel through Priceline. My family is from Chicago, however, I'd never stayed at this particular hotel before. This was my boyfriends first trip to Chicago for a long weekend... St. Patrick's Day weekend. After booking the hotel, we called and asked if there was a way to reserve a king room. We were told we had to wait until the day of our reservations, but it shouldn't be a problem since they had plenty of rooms available. We waited. My boyfriend was flying in from the east coast and wouldn't be arriving until late... like nearly 9:30 p.m. We called the day of our reservation only to be told that we couldn't request a king room. Okay...Would it be possible for an early check in by me, his girlfriend, to ensure that we got the room we wanted? Not possible. The name was reserved in my boyfriends name, not mine and we would have to switch it by contacting Priceline. Big hassle. So, we decided to take our chances and wait until we arrived late. We got a basic room with two queen beds and a terrific view of air conditioning units. We generally stay in a 4 star or better hotels, but this fell far below our expectations. The bathroom was small and it didn't have a fan. That was inconvenient due to the steam from the shower... The door had a large gap under it and we shoved a bath towel under the door to keep the noise down from the cleaning staff or other hotel guests. The thermostat was difficult to use too. It ran constantly... either blowing cold air or hot. We ordered room service the first morning which was pretty good, so no problems there. Pricey, but it usually is. All in all... we won't stay in this hotel again. It wasn't a great enough experience for us to want to do it or recommend it to family/friends.

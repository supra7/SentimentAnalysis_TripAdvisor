The hotel's site marked it as a 4star LUXURY hotel. It is a clean hotel but no different than a moderate chain hotel. The details and pictures are gravely decieving. The lobby is basically an office elevator corridor with podiums serving as you ck in/out. A closet literaly serves as the hotel office. There is no curb appeal or interior ambience. The rooms are old but refurbished and the beds with down alternative are a plus. I'm not sure where the 1st picture of the exercise room is but the 7th floor one could use some light, hand weights, and larger towels. It is very minimal. If you just want a decent place to sleep then book here. If you want a feeling of ahhhh from the front door to your room and for the same price keep looking. The location is good for Michigan Av activities but so are a dozen others.I wish I had chosen a different one. To me a hotel is rated LUXURY when the rooms, staff and amenities are above average. For example, when there was a problem at ck in (confirmed 2 rooms hotel only had 1 listed) the agent fixed it but she never communicated what she was doing. She just kept staring at her computer and typing. She was not a people person and I was a calm/tired customer. Frankly I don't think she knew what she was doing. After 45 minutes wait @ 10pm we got rooms. Why the wait?? I was never told but I found out. The heat was not working (-5 outside) and all 5 weary travelers had to stay in other room for 2 1/2 hours until warm enough to sleep in. The other was the bellman. I've determined that he must not need his job b/c he didn't do it. We (5) crawled out of the taxi retreived our luggage, paid the driver and got a receipt and NEVER saw the bellman. He was inside leaning against a wall. He never moved even after 3 groups ck'd in while we waited for our rooms. He did not help at ck out either. We hailed our own cabs everyday. Like I said the hotels just OK.

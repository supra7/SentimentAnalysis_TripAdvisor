This hotel is in a perfect location in the trendy Harbor East area with the harbor a couple blocks away and a wide range of shops of restaurants right outside the door. The hotel has nice, clean, contemporary decor. The rooms are a VERY tight squeeze though so if you value alot of floor space it's not so great. I certainly would have appreciated more room to move around. Attached is a FULL SERVICE fitness center that you can enter directly from the hotel and use for free while staying. Let me say, this fitness center is the real deal; you won't be disappointed. The hours are the downside - opens at 5:30am but closes at 10pm. That's just too early. They need to stay open until at least 11pm, if not midnight these days. The biggest weakness is the valet service. Both days, we had MAJOR PROBLEMS retrieving our car. Both times, we called down to front desk 20 min ahead of time but no car was there when we got down and we had to wait another 20min the 1st day and 10min the 2nd day (after complaining since we were checking out and heading for flight) to get car. Appears to be a combination of poor communications process, weak training, and lackluster employees. So just be warned; you'll likely wait quite awhile to get your car here. Looks like others there were having similar experiences.

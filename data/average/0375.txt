The Seattle Renaissance is a fine hotel for the business traveler. It is clean, comfortable, and centrally located to downtown businesses. However, if you are a tourist, I would suggest finding a hotel that is cheaper, offers free wi-fi and breakfast, and doesn't involve a steep hill. (Although the latter seems to be a given in Seattle -- it feels like everything is uphill both ways!) Overall this hotel is great if someone else (like your company) is footing the bill. If it's your own dime, I am sure you can find clean, comfortable and a central location for less.

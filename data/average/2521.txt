Stayed at this hotel on business. Location was convenient to airport and the places I had to get to. Newer building in good condition, but elevator was painfully slow. Also painfully slow was the internet access, with many drop-outs. 20th century technology, I suspect. Good thing it was free. Did not get a chance to use restaurant; it was closed the only night of my stay that I was going to use it. Not too far from Little Italy, so it worked out OK.

I stayed here for a conference, for which the rates were knocked down to $160 a night. Reasons for the selection: the proximity and distance (Sheraton was a bit close for comfort-- the event spanned the Hynes center and parts of the Sheraton) for a first-timer in Boston. Since I'm more of a Best Western fan, the amenities were all right, but nothing really better. Sure, the polished marble, fancy chairs, and internet access were nice (glad that the company was paying for the internet access as it wasn't free). There was an issue with the toilet not flushing properly and the fact that the maid who serviced the rooms cleaned out the trashcans by dumping the contents and wiping the inner surface before rearranging the linens (no she didn't not wash her hands between handling the trash and freshening up the beds). If I were to return to the area I'd certainly opt for another hotel after paying close attention to recommendations on TripAdvisor!

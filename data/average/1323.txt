This review is written by a business traveler who frequents many Marriott and Hilton-brand hotels throughout the year. During a two-night stay in February 2009, I found this hotel to meet the standards set for a full-line Marriott hotel. This property looks as if it was older property that was updated relatively recently - perhaps in the last couple of years. Pros: - friendly staff. - wireless internet connection (but it costs $12.95/night like other Marriotts). - newer lights, desks, beds, lamps. - newer linens, toiletries, shower curtains, picture frames, decor. - curved shower bars. - standard comfortable Marriott Revive beds / bedding. - interesting hotel design of having the pool and hottub in the middle / courtyard between four towers (all of it is covered space). - close proximity to the airport. Cons: - older 32" Philips CRT TV. - a look around easily reveals it was an older hotel that they tried to renovate. - cost ($200/night) was a little much for the quality and location. - lack of nearby restaurants; the AquaTerra restaurant in the lobby and associated bar were expensive for the quality of food. I would reocmmend sticking the the burgers, which were the best bets on the menu - each is about $13-$15. - Not the best bet if your destination is not close to the airport. - elevators are far from the Reception area. - frwquent travelers who have Concierge Lounge privleges will find the food selection slim here in the evenings; breakfast was standard fare. While I would believe this hotel is good in that it meets the Marriott standard fro full-line hotels; I would personally look for another property first when returning to the area. I base this decision primarily on price/value as well as convenience when within the hotel.

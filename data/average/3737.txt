Overall I liked this place; however, there were some issues. I will list them below: Good stuff: * Great location, beautiful old hotel, wonderful views of Dallas * Service was very friendly, pretty helpful * Cookies and milk! Yessss! * Good (and free) breakfast * Starbucks downstairs * Free drinks between 5:30-6:30 - wish it were a bit longer though. * The room was very cute and clean (water stain on ceiling but it didn't bother me), loved the huge shower. The hallways were like something out of the 1920s, very detective mystery-ish. Negatives: * No free internet?!? I can get that at Holiday Inn Express! $9.95 charge.... :( * No ice machine on floor - had to go to the CREEPY 25th floor for ice - just one strange little room with exposed pipes, a coke machine, and some washing machines. So wierd. * Those elevators are cool & authentic - but very slow - and when you're running late to check out the last think you need is slowwwww elevators! Allow at least 20 minutes to get downstairs, no kidding - if it's close to checkout time those slow elevators are also FULL of other people trying to get down to check out. * No parking at all! And valet parking is $22 per night! Wow wish I'd been told about this before I got there.

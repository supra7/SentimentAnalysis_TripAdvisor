The rooms here are nice, but with couch cushions missing (nowhere to be found!), floor having stains, and no extra blankets in the room, I question how it remains a 5 star. The room was clean and the hotel staff was courteous. We ordered room service and the food was good, not exceptional, but good. The location is off the strip, so you do have to walk, but it's not too bad. To me, when I'm in Vegas, I expect to walk a bit. As a 5 star hotel, I expect that rating to be upheld in all areas. Staff should ensure that when staying at a 5 star hotel, I'm getting what I pay for. If I wanted couch cushions missing, I can go down the street to a dump and get what I pay for.

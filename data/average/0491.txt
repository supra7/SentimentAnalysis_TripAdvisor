We stay here often on weekend getaways to Seattle. We love the location of this hotel. We walk alot, and everything is within walking distance. This is a no-frills hotel, but the service is excellent and great value. We would rather save $$ on hotels, which gives us more $$ to spend on the wonderful restaurants in Seattle.

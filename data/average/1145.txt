We stayed here for one night last Friday, we paid $100 for a room. This included valet parking (at least 20 bucks at other downtown Seattle hotels). So we decided to ignore the bad reviews and go with it. Staff were friendly and the lobby was funky. We had a room overlooking Stewart on the 8th floor. People seem to complain about the size of the room, and to be honest they are small, but if you've traveled a lot outside the States they are not that small (especially compared with Europe, Japan, Hong Kong etc). What is an issue is the lack of soundproofing between rooms, but it was only a problem with a room on one side. It probably just the way the original rooms have been subdivided and the partition wall was paper thin. We were tired and didn't hear them until we woke the next morning. The room was freezing because the air con/heater unit wasn't sealed into the window properly - very poor. Another strange thing was that the toilet/sink and shower were essentially in separate cupboards - an issue if you are claustrophobic (not all the rooms are like this). I'd ask for a room away from the lift and not overlooking Stewart for less noise. We went to Red Fin for 'happy hour', which gets you a dollar off some menu items and $3 Sapporos. The food was fine, but the service was a bit cranky and the white wine hadn't been in the fridge. There was a strange mix of people staying here, conference-goers, couples (of all ages) on weekends away, and yep, the pot smokers on floor 3 (it stunk when the lift doors opened). Perhaps the pot smokers were making an appearance at the nearby Seattle Court House (about 50 metres from the hotel).

First impressions, nice entrance and kept really clean in the reception area. The lady in the reception could do with learning how to smile. Moving on, room was to a decent standard. It was clean fresh. Then from here things went a little down hill. My gf went the toilet as soon as we got in our room, she shoutef "no toilet roll". So she was stuck in the bathroom until the maid came hand in toe with a loo roll. Basic error by the maids. The strange part... after our night out we came back to the room and pretty much went to sleep. At around 2pm i was woken up by the sound of someone entering the room. This strange person left straight away after they must have realised we were in the room. I didn't make out who it was as it was pitch black. Now this is the interesting part... The only other people who have enterance to the room is staff who hold the master fobs... i will touch back on this. Breakfast.. don't expect much. Cheap white bread with smart price wafer thin ham and cheese. Along with smart price juice. There was also cereals a mixture if jams and marmelade on offer to with the usual tea and coffee. Upon checking out, i mentioned to the reception lady about what happened in the night with regards to someone entering our room. She didn't seem at all alarmed by this. Which i found worrying and strange. overall... we only paid 50 for one night through a 3rd party website saving us 35. We chose this hotel as it was the cheapest and only needed a hotel that was close to the round house venue and litterally just a place to put our heads down for the night. it done the job and if it wasn't for someone gaining entery in to the room we would go back again should i be going some place in that area. But now im not to sure. If you want to take the risk of sleeping there then let me tell you abou the location. 10 minutes walk from hotel to camden town underground and 15 minute walk to camden markets approx.

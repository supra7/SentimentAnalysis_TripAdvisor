We stayed at Le Crystal for New Years for two nights, it has a great location to crescent street and is one of the newer, more hip hotels in the area. The deluxe suite was great, providing us with all of the necessities with great little touches. Although the rooms were nice and modern, there is a bit of a cold, business like feel to them. The bathroom was wonderful and big with a separate deep tub that fits two, as well as a stand up shower. The bedroom is closed off to the living area and has a great fake fur blanket for extra comfort. There is ample closet and drawer space, which I imagine is great for longer stays. The little kitchenette area is more than sufficient. The only complaint I have about this hotel is the service. We were greatly displeased by the valet parking, understandably parking downtown is expensive, but to have to pay each time you want something out of your car is just ridiculous. The front desk as well was rude and unhelpful, I can only imagine what a sour image they portray to tourists from other countries. I hope this doesn't make people think less of Montrealers and our friendly attitudes. Room service was deplorable, we ordered two hamburgers, a fry and a sandwich for $65+, I didn't mind the price, but you figure that they could at least be friendly when bringing it to your room. The man who delivered was the most miserable person I have seen. The outdoor hot tub was a nice touch, especially in the cold weather! Would I recommend this hotel? I would, but more to business travelers, there is something lacking from this hotel, it's missing the charm that is Montreal. The service made you feel like you were a bother to them, and for that reason I wouldn't recommend to families or romantic getaways.

We stayed at the Omni with our young son the beginning of June. I will say that I am a hotel snob, so my standards are pretty high. The first thing I was surprised about was that for a suite the room was actually quite small. Really no bigger than any other hotel room and was just called a suite because the doors separate the bedroom and sitting room. The bathroom was likewise quite small in my opinion. Bathroom extras were not anything to write home about, just generic hotel shampoo etc. The closet was pretty tiny, we couldn't really fit both our suitcases in there. Also, there is no small convenience store in the building (that I could find at least) so that you either had to walk several blocks to the walgreens or suffer the stiff prices of the mini bar if you wanted a drink or snack. That would be a nice addition. On a good note, the hotel breakfast was excellent, the rooms were clean and housekeeping was prompt. We arrived quite late and they had made sure a crib was waiting in the room so that we could get the little one to bed ASAP. We had a lovely view of the lake and the city from our 23rd floor room. The location was outstanding as well, pretty much right in the heart of everything. We were easily able to walk to Navy Pier and the river as well as take advantate of all the fantastic shopping in the area. Small note: sign up for the Omni guest program and get free internet in the room and perhaps a better room at check in. All in all, it was a pleasant experience, but I was far from blown away by the Omni.

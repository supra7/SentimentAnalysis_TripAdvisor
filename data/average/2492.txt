We have stay mainly at the Westin on Michigan Ave in Chicago, but this time we decided to give Dana Hotel a try. Great location, rooms are very nice, clean and modern. On the down side: the lounge on the top floor was just that, a lounge. No bar you could sit at, only couches, and most of them had "reserved" signs, and all others were occupied. So we headed down to the bar on the ground floor, where we were charged $11 per glass of Bailey's which we thought was a bit steep. As for the sleeping, well the neighbors slammed their doors at all hours, and then decided to play loud music at night. This compounded with the street noise had us wishing we were at the Westin. So overall not much noise insulation in the walls or windows. Overall for $200 per night, you can find a better deal else where. But it was worth the try.

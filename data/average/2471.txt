Room was clean enough but the hotel is a little tired . We requested the 2 bedroom suite for 4 of us, arrived at 3:00pm and had to wait 90 minutes to check in as apparently the room needed a "deep clean". Not a great location other than its 10 minutes from the airport, note this hotel is directly on the flight path vs its sister hotel over at Blue Lagoon which is more modern and the rooms updated and seemed to be a little larger for the same cost. Staff friendly, breakfast was fine. Ok for a 1 or 2 night stay.

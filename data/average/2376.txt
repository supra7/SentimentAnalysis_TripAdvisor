Everything you read from reviews is right. I found the service is too much, waiters queue up to remove plates before you've finished eating, coffee is refilled before you've finished drinking, couldn't move without someone trying to help. The tipping culture is so developed that you feel intimidated into giving money, constantly reminded that wages are low and tipping is required. The hotel is very nice but so far away from anywhere of interest that taxis are always needed, you can't walk into town for a diversion. I felt claustrophobic, almost like a barracks with a beach. Buffet restaurant (for that quick meal) was closed at random and without prior warning so palns made had to be changed at the last minute. If you like lying on the beach or by a pool and then being ferried around in taxis on a tourist agenda then fine. It might be what most people like but not for me.

This hotel used to be an apartment building and is very old. Pro's: My room was more like a suite, with kitchen, bedroom, bath, and sitting room. Bed was comfortable. Rooms were cleaned every day. Staff was very friendly. Interesting area with many restaurants and a lot going on. Bus stop only a block away. I was not bothered by late-night noise, as some people have written they were. There is a coffee maker in the kitchen of the apartment/ room, and a full-size refrigerator. Microwave, no stove; Iron and ironing board. Free Wi-Fi. Con's: The lobby looks a little tired, and had the smell of an OLD building. There is NO ELEVATOR, and so either you need to carry your bag to the 2nd or 3rd floor, or you need the bellhop to do this. Going up and down the stairs several times each day was wearing. For many people, the hotel is perceived as charming and quaint - I saw many positive, even raving, comments in the guest book at checkout. I found it too old and drab for my taste. The breakfast was not good - croissants that looked as though they came from a discount supermarket, apples, and coffee/tea. No business center with computers, though the gracious staff are willing to print out boarding passes for guests, if that is all you need a computer for.

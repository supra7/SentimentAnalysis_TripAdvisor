Four colleagues and I all commented that we can never remember having smaller rooms. It was difficult to open the closet door since it hit the bed. I tried to iron something and wound up with half the ironing board hanging over the bed. The place was bustling with convention-goers which made the wait for elevators at least ten minutes at all times of the day. Even with modern soundproofing, the rumble of the elevated train was present and the hallway noise was particularly irritating. The main lobby in beautiful, that cannot be denied, but a hotel needs more than that to be good.

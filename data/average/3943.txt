Lovely Hotel, Rooms very clean, Maid service every day. Breakfast unbelievably poor. Tables not laid, had to ask for more food and utencils. Rest of the staff were excellent. Easy to get to Ramblas by Metro just around the corner. 15 Minute walk to Nou Camp to watch them play Would stay there again as the location was fine. Would probably look for breakfast outside the Hotel.

My boyfriend and I stayed here in mid-June for a wedding in downtown Seattle. The location can't be beat - a third of a mile to Pike Place market, and tons of restaurants and the Space Needle within easy walking distance. Although the service was typical Westin and very conscientious, I would say that the hotel itself beyond the lobby is falling a bit behind the standard set by all of the other Westin properties in my experience. We were initially given a room in the South tower on the 25th floor (although there are 40+ floors, apparently the 25th floor is one of the exclusive Starwood Preferred Guest floors). We were a little dismayed that the room was visibly dusty (even in the bathroom), and that the couch and chest of drawers were visibly dingy. Although tired from a 6-hour flight, we asked downstairs at the front desk for a better room, and were given the key to a room in the North Tower on the 24th floor. This tower and level were a bit better - the common area itself upon exiting the elevator was better, and room #2 was cleaner, and had a better shower. The bed was awesome (typical Westin), and the view was awesome. My advice about the parking is NOT to park in Westin's hotel-owned deck, but to park in the public deck (that - confusingly enough - has a blue Westin sign on the 5th Ave. entrance). it costs $22 per night and is connected to the hotel via a covered aerial walkway. Parking in the Westin-owned deck on Stewart St. is double the price of the private deck. By the way, the front desk representative (Marissa - very nice and knowledgeable) mentioned that the rooms were dur for renovations sometime this year. That should really improve the quality of this property!

Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in April 2011 while attending a gig. Found the double room to be quite small, especially when compared with similar rooms offered by Premier Inn. The air conditioning did not seem to work and the cushions were poor. First morning's sleep was disturbed by a policeman shouting in at some guests 3 or 4 doors down. Looked like some form of negotiation was going on? On the good side it is conveniently located across the road from Euston tube and was easy to find.

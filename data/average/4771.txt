Stayed here for two nights on a business trip. While not bad by any means, the decent-sized suite is fairly characterless and in fact a little cold (style, not temperature.) Thought the food at 646 on the fourth floor was terrific. I had a late night snack with a salad; flat-bread pizza was fantastic with a great glass of wine. Our big complaint was valet parking. They require 30 minutes notice to bring your car around, and then did not deliver in that time frame several times - didn't even have record of our request once. All in all, don't think you can go wrong in this great downtown location, but you could certainly find more interesting places to stay, if that matters to you. Given how much I travel for business, I like to be pampered a little more and be in more interesting surroundings.

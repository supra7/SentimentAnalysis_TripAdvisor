The location of the hotel is not in the middle of the city and thats an advantage because u can find cheap shops and restaurants around it. Metro station (llacuna) is about 5 minutes away if walking.. The hotel is clean.. Breakfast includes a good variety but not for people who dont eat pork like me so i didnt enjoy it. They give u 6 bottles of water for free daily.. Be careful because room cleaners suddenly open the rooms door without any notice.. That happened with me! There is no water cattle, no iron for the clothes, you have to pay for washing or ironong and thats very expensive.. The place there is quiet.. If i didnt have much money i would stay at it again, but if i did i will choose another hotel.. Hope u all enjoy :) The room doesnt contain iron, water cattle, tea, coffee,

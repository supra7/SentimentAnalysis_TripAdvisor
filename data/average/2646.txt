When I booked the reservation the website stated that the "self parking" was a flat rate of $25.00 with in and out privileges...That was not true, No in and out privileges. We paid $18.00 for 2 hours!! So the next alternative was to valet park for $28.00, which with this we could go in and out whenever we wanted. This was just mediocre. On the second day the valet employees ignored me when I went to drop my car off, they left my car running while they sat there and talked, wasting my gas. The thing that made me upset the most is on the last day when we got into my personal vehicle (not a rental) it smelled like a homeless person slept in there!!! My car had been rummaged through, and I really felt violated since I had personal effects in there. I am now taking it to get the car detailed since it smells so bad. So just beware of parking at this location, since in Miami you have to valet or park for an insane amount of money. Overall the hotel itself was just ok, I will not stay here again.

I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times since 2010, its very nicely located in Al barsha near to my places of intrest. Easy to get a cab and near the metro station as well. The Front desk staff is sometimes attentive and sometimes very busy ! The rooms can be more clean and i felt that the housekeeping does not clean them properly ! would stay there for the cheap price but prefer to stay somewhere else for quality!

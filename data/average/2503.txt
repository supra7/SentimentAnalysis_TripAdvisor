Hotel was fine, rooms were clean and seemed well maintained, they were a reasonable size and had somewhat of a European feel about them although I don't know that I would want to stay for longer than a couple of nights as closet and drawer space are very limited, every thing just seemed to be little cubby holes. Found the staff at the hotel bar very friendly hand out a nice tip and the free pour drinks just keep getting better and better, problem here is if you want to eat something, the bar does have snack food which is not that bad but if you would like a nice meal you are out of luck, another reason you really don't want to stay for more than two nights as you are a good drive to any reasonable restaurant Real close to the airport so really handy for early morning flights or if you have meetings close by. Would I stay here again ? Yes I guess but only for location and no more than two nights.

Check-in is on the second floor and then you take additional elevators to get to your room, so bring a suitcase with wheels. The bed was amazing, although they only gave you 2 pillows per bed, which made reading a little cumbersome. The room is set up very weird; you can't see the TV from the bed. Its an amazing flat screen televion which is bolted to the wall and the only way to see it is by sitting on the 2 chairs near the window. We rented a movie and actually moved the bed so we could see the TV. The concierge was very helpful and knowledgable. The front desk was not polite to say the least. I asked for a wine opener and it took 2 days before I finally got one, after asking 3 times. I guess I wasn't a priority in their eyes. The desk did not have an extra plug for my computer so I had to use it on another seat. They do have wireless internet. The location is excellent for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. The bathroom was good but the closet was in the bathroom, which again was a little weird. Overall I'd say the location was excellent but the hotel needs someone to make some ergonomic changes.

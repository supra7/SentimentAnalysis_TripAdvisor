This hotel has reasonable amenities -- free wi-fi, coffee in the room, bar/cafe, pool and fitness room. It's quiet enough for an airport hotel, and it's well-located right across from the airport (and next to 13 Coins restaurant). The decor seems a little down at heel, especially once you get past the first floor. It's great for that one-night stay before you fly out, but it's just not a place you want to spend more than one night. Also, we didn't care for the Sleep Number beds, unfortunately.

We just returned from Boston, a first-time visit for teen-aged son. We stay 3 nights at The Marriott Copley Place, and overall had a decent experience. The staff was inconsistent; one Concierge was very knowledgeable, and another was borderline rude and gave inaccurate directions. One bedroom was nice, but small. No refrigerator, mini-bar, etc. Room was clean, but had to ask for towels late one night, as they had not been replaced when room was cleaned. Valet parking was incredibly expensive (even for Boston), and as we were checking out, valet did not even offer to put our bags in the car. Twice, valet gave inaccurate instructions as to how to get on to a major highway. With all the available hotels in Boston, not sure if we would stay there again, even though it was in a good location at not-exorbitant rates. We could get similar rates at other hotels, and would likely do so on the next trip.

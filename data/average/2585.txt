We booked a double room for 3 nights in December paying 19.00 a night. The hotel seemed pretty new, not one of the old grubby Travelodges. We were in room 115, it was pretty small but was fine for us, it had make up area, plenty of storage space and although the wash room was small, the shower was really powerful and always had hot water. There was a flat screen TV and kettle in the room. The room was cleaned everyday. The bed was quite comfy though sloped a bit towards the middle. The main disturbance was the noise from the road outside. Buses. They run until about 2 in the morning and start up again at 6, if youre a light sleeper DONT BOTHER STAYING HERE, the first night for me wasnt brilliant but for the rest of the stay I was fine and seemed just to get used to it. The main reason for staying here was the convenience, its a 1 minute walk to Euston station and underground. All in all I would have no problem going back to this hotel but wouldnt pay the full price 90 per night for it, you best just keeping an eye on the website and dropping on a deal.

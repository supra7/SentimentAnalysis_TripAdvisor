Crowne Plaza Changi is very conveniently located from the Airport terminals. The Hotel though close to the Airport is relatively quiet from inside. The rooms offer good views of the terminal building. I was impressed at the fact that the room did offer a good quiet sleep. The rooms are clean & spacious. The restaurant menu could get some help. Breakfast was nice & the service was appreciative. The staff are indeed helpful. I am a vegetarian and the staff was very glad to help me with options for my dinner. I would no Wi-Fi little bit upsetting. Since they are a transit hotel, there is a constant rush at the check in counters. The wait for me was longer and would have loved if there were more staff during peak check in time. But certainly a good transit hotel. You'll avoid the long drive to the city.

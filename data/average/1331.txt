We stayed over one night before a flight out of SeaTac. We arrived late, but front desk was friendly and we were checked in efficiently. However, there were no more parking spaces. The clerk came out to tell us which cars we could park behind; I guess there were some cars parked there for an extended period. The room itself is motel like, very no frills and utilitarian. The decor seemed a little tired and worn out, but for the most part clean. Breakfast was not bad, with scrambled eggs and sausages in addition to the usual waffles and pastries other hotels offer. The line up to use the waffle maker was too long for us to wait though since we had to catch a flight. Overall an ok place to stay for one night, especially if you need to catch a flight, but I wouldn't want to stay longer than that.

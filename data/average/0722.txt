Don't stay at this hotel if you want above average (let alone outstanding) service. Pros: Stayed in a executive suite. Decor is ok, had this wood cabin thing going on. Bed is comfortable and the view on the waterfront is beautiful as the room had 3 sliding doors with a balcony that ran the length of the room. Location of the hotel is great as it is close to a lot of the sights in Seattle. If not within walking distance, the cab fare is pretty low. Cons: The A/C in the room is not sufficient to cool down the room. The room was steaming hot when we got there and the cleaning service was constantly turning it up after we would turn it down. The service was average. No one went out of their way to accommodate special needs or ask if we needed anything. Food was lousy. Room service sucked. Asked to have breakfast served 15 minutes earlier than normal due to an early cruise departure and was told no. Over-all - It would not be my first choice to stay again on a family vacation. Maybe business, but when I am on vacation, I want to relax and service expectations are much higher.

I am extremely disappointed with the Seattle Sheraton. The hotel room was adequate, however the pool was disgusting with dead bugs on the window sill and an unheated pool and a "hot tub" of about 65 degrees. We purchased a holiday package and were supposed to receive an Amazon gift card after our stay, but was told after our stay that it won't be available for up to six weeks. Very misleading, as the hotel apparently knows this is the case, but makes no attempt to alert customers to this fact. We had a ho hum breakfast at the Daily Grill with two kids meals, two adult meals, 2 kids juices and 2 coffees for $65 and paid $45 for parking. All in all, not worth a $500 night downtown!

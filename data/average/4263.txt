If you book this hotel at a decent rate and understand that you are not going to be staying in the 4 Seasons, then you will be satisfied. The hotel is located close to what most people would like to do in Boston....either by walk or a quick cab ride. The rooms are OK. Definitely outdated and a bit dingy. Service by reservations as well as by the concierge was great!

Pretty good hotel, nice big rooms, very clean and comfy bed, large windows, not too noisy considering it's central location.... very good location! great for walking to the sights in seattle metro area... the only thing is the rooms could use a fridge.. we only stayed here because the hostels in seattle are so expensive and it was basically the same price to stay at this hotel.

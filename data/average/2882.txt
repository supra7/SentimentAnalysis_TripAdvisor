I travel for business combined with pleasure, my wife & 5 year old always come with, we stay in hotels almost every week for 2-4 nights across the country so we have experienced the good, the bad & the ugly & we are picky within reason (hate dirt, mold & or stench). My 5-year-old takes his shoes & socks off the minute we hit the room and believe me if the carpet is a little dirty we will know within minutes (I have checked out of hotels because his feet were black with dirt). Overall this place is clean. The room did not come with microwave, or small refrigerator. Breakfast just OK 9would expect better from a F airfield)! Also has a pool OK. The front desk staff is friendly. If you need to stay in the Memphis, TN area this place is OK for a short stay, but you can do a lot better for the price. Price line gives it 21/2 stars, it's 2 star at best! The beds were very soft (mushy) would have preferred a little more support! Very noisy at 4:30 am it sounded like we were under a flight path.Although this is not considered the airport area. The area is run down and the parking lot is dark seemed OK but may prove scary for some. The hotels and some of the business's around this property had 6 foot fences surrounding their parking lots & facilities some of these were secured some were open and you could just drive in giving you one point of entrance. I am not sure of the purpose or reason!

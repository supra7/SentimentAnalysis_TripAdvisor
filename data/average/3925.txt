We needed a reasonably priced room for a conference in Monteral, and the Zero 1 was the lowest price option available for 3*+. The entire hotel had only been open a week or so, and the place was rank with the smell of paint. They painted the whole place black, including the rooms.. which is a bit of a downer in the dark hallways. The hotel only has two elevators, each at opposite ends of the hotel. Only one was operational when we were there, and was full of construction dirt and dust. The room itself was a decent size, with IKEA-esq furniture. It had a good sized mini-fridge and a flat screen tv, which was a plus. The downside to this hotel is the front desk staff and the location. The front desk is VERY small, even for a small hotel. There is only the ability to check one guest in at a time because they only had one computer at the small desk. We had to wait 20 minutes in line to check-in. The location of the hotel is just odd. Its far from the rail station, but "in between" in terms of areas you would want to be. Its a somewhat short walk to the Latin Quarter, but kind of a seedy walk at the same time. We ended up moving to the Hyatt Regency for the final days in Montreal as it was marginally more expensive but a much better option.

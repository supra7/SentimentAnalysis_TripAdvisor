We have been there for 2 nights and probably we've been unlucky because we had the last room available, which was in front of the road......very busy road!!!!! The room was big, basic but clean, and so the bathroom, even if the shower had a strange plastic carpet floor..... breakfast was very basic, and self service but abundant. The personal was very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is far from the city centre, but the tube station is 4 min walk!

We recently spent one night at this hotel and stayed in a King Deluxe room. Nothing deluxe about the room, but it was clean and the bed was comfortable enough. The bathroom was large, with open shelves under the sink, and a coffee pot on the counter. The breakfast buffet was ok, except for some mushy fruit, with free newspapers and plenty of seating. It was in a convenient location for us.

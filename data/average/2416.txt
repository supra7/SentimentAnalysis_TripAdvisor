Stayed one night at the Residence Inn Airport on 09/27/2004. While my experience was not bad like the others on here, this is obviously one of the earlier Residence Inns built. The furnishings and cabinetry in this location looks to be about 10-15 years old. My room was clean and quiet, but smelled like a typical smoking room. Bed was comfortable, water pressure good. However, at $159 a night, you can get a nicer place elsewhere. The Renaissance (also a Marriott property) had rates of $152 for the same night, but I opted for Residence because of their full breakfast (definitely worth the $7 differnence). Upon check-in, I had to sign a form stating that I would not have any loud parties or bring kegs on the premisis, which I thought was strange. Upon reading the other reviews, I realize now that it may have been needed.

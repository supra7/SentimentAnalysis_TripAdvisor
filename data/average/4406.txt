The hotel and room were very nice, but we experienced several problems during our stay. One: the AC unit was not functioning properly and was stuck on 74 degrees for 12 hours. Eventually, a repairman was sent to fix it very late in the evening. Also, the wireless internet connection was not good. We had to request a router, though we were still charged for the time that was not connected. The shuttle service is great. I don't feel the price accurately reflects the value of the hotel, however.

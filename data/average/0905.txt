My husband and I got the Westin Seattle for one night on a Priceline bid. We got a great rate and I was excited to get the Westin since Frommers Seattle marked it as one of the best hotels in the city. We were very dissapointed with the Westin. The hotel is HUGE and not laid out well at all. It is very much geared toward the business traveler and there was always a ton of activity going on in the massive lobby. When I checked in at the front desk the person helping me was not friendly at all. The person who was checking in next to me got an upgraded room and friendly conversation, and all I got was someone who wanted to check me in as quickly as possible and get on his way. Our room was right next to the elevator, which most of the rooms are because of the poor layout. I had requested a high floor because I read that the views were incredible, but we really had no view from our room. The bed was comfy, as are all Westin beds and overall the room was a nice size with a basic bathroom. Heavenly shower was nice. I would not stay here again. The rooms were nice, but the staff was unfriendly and the atmosphere in the hotel was really geared toward conference attendees and business travelers.

We stayed there for 3 days. Its an old hotel but they have remodeled the bathrooms and the outside. It is right above the boardwalk and the beach. The balcony was nice. But the portable a/c unit kept leaking water and they gave us towels to put under it. The room with 2 doubles is tiny and there is not enough room for suitcases. So if you have more then 2 people get one of the bigger rooms. If you are on a budget its okay, but don't expect the Ritz. I think its the cheapest hotel that's on the ocean front. Parking can be a problem though.

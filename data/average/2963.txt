A clean and well maintained building. Basic cold buffet breakfast. Staff are helpful but not very informative. Very far from attractions had to keep using public transport to get around. Not many places near by to eat. Although I would say the beach is a nice ten min walk.. So goo if you want to go to the beach every day. Rooms are small.

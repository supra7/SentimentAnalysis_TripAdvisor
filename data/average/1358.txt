I really liked the hotel. Great location, nice room, wonderful restaurant. Why does the Hilton ruin it all by niggling on every service offered? Twenty dollars a day for self-parking, four dollars for a bottled water, expensive hook up fees for internet. It goes on and on but the end result is that they made me feel used by the end of my stay.

This hotel is pretty old and low quality. For the price it is ok to stay here. The reception area is nice but the rooms are low standard. The receptionists are friendly, but one gave wrong information about the buses, which made me walk unnecessarily with a luggage. The hotel are is not pleasant, but it is 5 minutes walk from the lively Istiklal street. Rooms facing the street might be noisy, but I chose a room facing rear, so I had silence in the room. Shower is open, so the bathroom will mess after taking shower.

The wife and I just returned from Rome last week and stayed at the ALP. Not terribly impressed, but not completely disappointed. The Good: Location is GREAT. Termini station is just a few blocks away. Subway station entrance is even closer. Even when the subways close, the walk from any/all of the sights is not bad. Our room was relatively clean, and unlike some of the previous posters, it was relatively large. The Bad: Staff was remarkably unfriendly, and not particularly helpful when it came to obtaining information. Some of the staff spoke little to no English, which is fine, but is contrary to what I have read from others. The shower is poorly designed unless you're at least 6'6". One staff member came into our room without knocking in order to address a safe that was not malfunctioning. Turns out he had the wrong floor.

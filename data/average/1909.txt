You seem to get what you pay for at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel and you are paying for the location. Billed as the most "Hawaiian Hotel", I believe it lives up to its billing. Having said that, it is not the "Best Hotel". Every person will tell you that the rooms are a bit worn and there is no doubt. We stayed in a "renovated room" and I would not want to see a non-renovated room! However, this is an excellent budget friendly option. The location is unbeatable sandwiched between the Whaler shops and restaurants, the Westin, the Hilton and the Ka'anapali golf courses and of course the ocean. The staff are quite friendly and I would recommend it for families. I do not believe there is any where better in this price range directly on the beach. So just know what to expect and you shouldn't be disappointed.

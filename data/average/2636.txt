When we arrived for a one night stay, (we were catching a cruise ship the next morning) the one bell hop at the entrance did not greet us, or offer to help, or open a door. He seemed to be busy counting his tips. The young man at the check in desk was very helpful but was new, as he sounded so scripted as if he had memorised all his lines. The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas. We had a snack in the lounge as that's all that was available. It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry. The next day they compt our snack after explaning it all to the front desk people. The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one. The hotel is near the ski train that will take you right downtown for free. Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society. There is tansit police around but not everywhere.

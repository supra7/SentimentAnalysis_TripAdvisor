I spent a week in the Chicago area and had two separate stays at the Palmer House. (Spent a night in Oak Park for a wedding) The first stay was disappointing but the second made up for it. The first time my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel we were not offered any help with our luggage. I had three heavy bags and was clearly struggling. The staff was standing around in front of the door but no one could actually open it. It was very windy and the doors were heavy and the effort to open the door made me drop my suitcases. For the age of the hotel the room size was generous. The only problem was that the room was dirty. The dresser was sticky and one of the decorative pillows had a stain on it. The concierge was rude but the dinner recommendation she gave was good. The second time I arrived at the hotel valet immediately greeted us, the bellmen helped with the baggage and there was someone to open the door. My party arrived at 11am, but were able to check in early. (the rooms weren't on the same floor but we opted not to wait for closer rooms.) My boyfriend and I received an e-standby upgrade so for an additional $74 a night we got a HUGE room. There was a dining room, wet bar, large living room, two flat screen tvs, and one and a half baths. We had dinner in Lockwood one night and it was pretty good. They had run out of the sparkling wine I wanted but there were plenty of other options. Overall my biggest disappointment was the gift shop (which I think was operated by an independent group...) The hotel has such a rich history and a beautiful logo but there weren't any souvenir options that reflected this. The only hotel specific items were one out dated postcard and a tee shirt. The picture on the post card did not show the current furnishings and decor of the lobby and the shirt was very plain and over priced. I would have liked a hotel magnet or something with the peacock logo.

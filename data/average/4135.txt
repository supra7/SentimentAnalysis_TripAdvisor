We went to Boston to tour the city and stayed here. Overall, this is a nice hotel with a great location. Very close to Quincy Market, NE Aquarium, the waterfront and the Italian section of Boston. Rooms were clean and the pool and gym are excellent. Only complaints are relatively minor...we expect that for the price you would get queen beds instead of twins. Also, service by the bartenders in the restaurant and one of the bellhops did not meet my expectations for a hotel of this calibre. Otherwise, would definitely stay there again due to location and cleanliness of the hotel.

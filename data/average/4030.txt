Location can't be beat if you like to dine and shop! The bed and pillows were my favorite part...so comfy and clean. We had an OK stay here...I was in Boston for a baptism and most of my family stayed at this hotel. The first night, my in-laws said that the hotel had given their room away, and were awoken in the middle of the night to other guests! They had a room key to the room and my in-laws had to kick them out of the room! We did contact the manager of the hotel, and they were very apologetic about it....but STILL! Would I stay here again? Yes, because of the location.

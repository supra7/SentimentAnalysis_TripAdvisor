Prior to this trip, I had not stayed here in about 10 years. It used to be "the" place...everything used to be just so. Not anymore. Other than the excellent location, the place is not what it used to be. Everything is just routine. From the check in, to the room, to the departure, its just plain routine. No one goes out of their way and the rooms could stand some updating. We did have a room with nice views of Copley Square. At this level, one expects a higher level of service, but there is nothing special here. I probably will stay here again, due mainly to the location, but I'm sure there are nicer properties out there.

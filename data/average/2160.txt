We got in very late. Went to our room and found maid supplies by our door. Walking in, we encountered a small garbage bag. The restroom had a couple of dirty towels. Could this be how the Trump is being maintained? I called the front desk. After waiting for about 5 minutes, which felt like an eternity, being to tired after the delayed flight, someone finally came on and upgraded our room after many apologies. Now our upgraded room was better but the quality of the room was mixed with good and poor materials. Whoever is maintaining these rooms are missing details: like a handle on a bathroom door. Being a Trump brand, we expected better quality. The employees were great and helpful when they did help.

This is an older property that has been rehabbed as space permitted. Rooms are tight but doable. The biggest problem for us was lack of handicap accessibility. The lower floor is actually 3 levels and one has a full fight of stairs to get to the elevators from the outside entrances. Staff was friendly and helpful. Ok place to overnight but not for a long stay.

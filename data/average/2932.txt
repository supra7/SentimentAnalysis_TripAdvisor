Our very large room had a microwave, fridge, bar area, pull out couch, and two well spaced beds. The bathroom layout was strange, with the sink out in the room and a tiny enclosure for the toilet & shower. The room was cleaned very late (after 4:00) on Saturday, but it was cleaned well every day of our visit. The outdoor pool is really too tiny to do anything but get wet up to the waist, and it was very full on our visit. Don't book this hotel over one without a pool - it really isn't worth it. The breakfast was passable on Saturday and Sunday morning, but there was hardly anything to eat on Monday. The owners were friendly and helpful with local information. The location is fine. We do not feel unsafe in this section of Memphis.

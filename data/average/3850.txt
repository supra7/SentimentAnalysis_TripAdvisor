The Belltown is very close to transportation. The bus stops right in front of the hotel. If you are not used to city noise - the bus stops right in front of the hotel all night long. The hotel itself was pretty nice. The biggest drawbacks were that it had no wireless internet and no air conditioning. If it is warm, you are forced to open the windows and if you have a room that faces the street, it is very loud. The staff was very friendly and helped us change to a courtyard room. That was a little quieter. Many local people we talked to said that the location was a couple of blocks over from where tourists really want to be. It is just a short walk, but there was a significant number of homeless people near the hotel and in the dog park which is across the street.

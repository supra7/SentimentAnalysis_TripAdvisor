We travel to Seattle several times a year. Generally we are viewing welcome new additions to the family. A doggish addition to OUR family prompted a new direction in hotel accomodations...the search for pet friendly hotels. The Hotel Max, a cutting edge, Euro-funk addition to the Seattle hotel roster would not have been my first choice. Our son puts his business clients up there and he made the choice. Grandpa, grandma, nine year old Isabella and 12 pound Octavia all found the staff to be pleasant and accomodating. Isabella particularly found the room keys with the naked mannikins enchanting and I am sure they will be a hit with the 4th grade in Mesa AZ. I know she pocketed them as a souvineer. Pros: Excellent location, superb beds, great pillows,accomodating staff and very friendly ambience. The car was always there when requested..Semi-clever art and a good restaurant for breakfast. Cons: very small rooms, awkward and unsafe bathrooms. noisy with poor soundproofing. Extremely dark hallways. The cleaning staff is hit and miss and over a 4 night stay, the bathroom and dusting were sporadic in nature. Not quite clean but no filth...perhaps a bit of Euro-grunge. Dog amenities were delivered in a sporadic fashion also. Petrified dog treats which were decline by five different pooches. (We offered them around thinking Octavia was being picky and got no takers.) It is a toss up whether we would stay there again if it were not for the dog and the corporate rate. I have found better deals. Everyone is very nice, but it isn't a great bang for the buck.

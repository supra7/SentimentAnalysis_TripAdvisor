I stayed here in January 2005 and I thought the rooms were beautiful. I had an upgraded room for around $200/night and it was always clean and the furniture and linens were in great shape. However, I was not pleased with the valet and bell service. The guy standing at the door never opened it for us... even when it was raining and we had our hands full... He also did not once offer to help us as we struggled with our luggage when we left. Our room was quiet, the front desk was pleasant... but their internet service was not reliable. It only worked for 2 of our 4 days there and we were constantly on the phone with the customer service to find out why we couldn't connect. Overall I was pleased with the experience, but felt that the customer service, especially with regard to the bell hop could have been better.

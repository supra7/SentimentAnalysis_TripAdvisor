My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights in March 2005. This was our second visit to this resort. We stayed here in May 2002 as well. Since our visit in May 2002, we noticed the rooms have suffered alot of wear-and-tear. We don't love this resort, but Kaanapali doesn't have the type of resorts that Wailea has. However, what we love about Kaanapali is that you have so many restaurants within walking distance, whereas in Wailea, you have to drive to most restaurants. We also like the little town of Lahaina. We've already booked our vacation to Hawaii for March 2006 and we will be staying at the Hyatt again. It's not the best value but it's our favorite hotel in Kaanapali.

This was a very well placed hotel for both the shopping areas and the historic areas of Boston. The lobby is impressive and we were welcomed by a nice staff especially the gentleman on reception. The room however was small and although it was adequate, it wasn't anything special. It was clean and the house keeping staff were very good. The concierge was too busy to help us and when we checked out, the bell staff and doormen were very unhelpful.I would like to go back to Boston sometime, but I don't think we would stay here again.

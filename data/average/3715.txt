The hotel asthetics were beautiful, the room was nice (although not enough drawer space), the FULL BREAKFAST is fantastic, and the valet team was AWESOME (they made great recommendations, and would take you nearly where ever you needed/wanted to go). And because all of our meeting activites were at the Convention Center, the location was very good. But the front dest staff was standoff-ish, the elevators were slow, and the exta food service they instituted for our group was slower than slow. It's a great place for you solo, but maybe not for the larger groups and more business minded. There weren't adequate meeting or banquet rooms.

Room was nice and modern. Had reasonable size bedroom large tv, kitchen, big fridge so of for extended stay. There was construction of building next door and noise was an issue but it stopped at nightfall. Dont like these Dubai hotels wanting to hold passports. I have stayed at 2 4 points and they scanned passports and returned them in 5 min so I dont understand why others take hours and complain when you ask for them back right qaway. Dont really know about the location. It was opposite direction to central hotels I normally stay at and probably 15 - 20 min from main terminals. I stayed as a Dubai stopover as I had a long connection and my wife needed visa so ended up here. Good point was the free shuttle to the airport.

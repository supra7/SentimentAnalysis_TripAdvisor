Pretty average place only really worthy of a 3 diamond rating. my wife was annoyed with the concierge on multiple occasions because of snobbishness. expect to pay an extra 30 dollars on top of your room rate for nightly parking. as with most hotels now everything is an extra and costs money. for the cost we would likely stay at the fairmont or hyatt next time

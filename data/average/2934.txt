Comfort inn, 1335 McRee St. Memphis, TN. This hotel is ok. The night manager was not happy to be there. When I entered the hotel, she was sitting in the lobby area watching TV. She looked up at me, like what do you want. She finally said something like yea? I told her I had a reservation and she got up and went behind the desk. She asked my name. She handed me a room key, told me the room was upstairs. Not another word. She didn't ask for my credit card to copy or anything. The hotel has no elevator and the hallways are dirty. The room was clean.

The hotel staff were all very friendly and the room was clean, tidy and spacious. Lacking inroom tea and coffee making facilities was a slight downside. Sleep during the day was a no go due to the ongoing local building work. But come night time it was peaceful and ideal. Cracking location for La Rambla and all the local attractions. Breakfast was again easy and adequate for a hard days looking around the city sights.

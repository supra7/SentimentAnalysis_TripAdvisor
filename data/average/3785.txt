Could not believe the location, a reasonable distance from downtown and airport and right next to the Men's Club in red light district. All the taxi drivers new the location by this reference marker. Having said that it was very clean, well appointed and good value. Breakfast is typically low-cost US Style- reasonable range of self help cooked food and continental ingredients, but with styrofoam plates, plastic KFS and cups. Staff were pleasant.

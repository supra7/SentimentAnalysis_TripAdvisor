Overall, a disappointing experience. Definitely not at the standards of a 4 star hotel. The room was very dingy with old carpeting. The bathroom was in need of a revamp. The bed was very uncomfortable; we would wake up with sore backs every morning. Worst thing was that the walls were paper thin, so EVERYTHING could be heard in the next room. As for the location, very good. Right on George street and close to the Central station. Buses close as well. Friendly enough staff. Don't agree with charging to store our luggage since our flight was in the afternoon and we had to check out by 10 so we carried our bags with us. Ok for 1-2 nights but try something else for a longer stay.

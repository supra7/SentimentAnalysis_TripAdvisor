Stayed here 3 nights over easter weekend.Staff very friendly and accomodating,rooms were typical h/inn express,nothing to shout about,clean and modern,.....bed wasnt to comfortable and the shower pressure was terrible,other than that it was ok. Hotel is "out of the way" of the main drag which is fine,good transport links to the city,yellow line "Llacuna" metro station 5 minutes walk away,also there is the tram about 10 mins walk away,just turn left out of the hotel and walk all the way down llacuna street,u cant miss it!There is also a "glorious" shopping centre near the tram stop,it has a starbucks where we went each morning for our dose of caffine!!!!!,staff were friendly and understood english no problem.Also when u arrive at barcelona airport,get the train into the city,its cheap and fast,purchase a T-10 ticket which u can use on all the metro,trams and trains to/from airport, a bargain at 9.85 Euros. Overall we had a great time in Barca,.......one note of caution,be aware of pickpockets,keep your wallet/purse close to hand,be sensible and you will have no problems.

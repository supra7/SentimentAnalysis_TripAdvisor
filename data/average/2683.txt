I booked this hotel online, feeling I had gotten a great deal. But being told upon arrival that I have to pay $28 a night for parking (plus tips for valet) really made me feel like I had been reeled in at a low price, then gouged once I got here. I've never heard of paying that much for parking. While it's not a fortune, the principle of the thing just upset me and kind of soured my experience at an otherwise great hotel. After the initial shock of the parking, the hotel was great - clean and comfortable, big room, nice view. But the location isn't the greatest; the area seems pretty sketchy at night. We thought we'd avoid the parking fees by parking on the streets nearby, but after driving around the blocks between Biscayne and 2nd Ave NE and seeing a couple of guys slinging drugs on the corners, we thought it best to just pay. Also, I wouldn't recommend going to the Checkers across the street after 10pm or so - we did our first night, and there were some pretty shady characters hanging around. Great burgers and wings there though!

A typical large Westin, the check-in is up an escalator which is not ideal but the biggest issue of mine was the room. Although a decent size I was very annoyed to be given what was obviously part of a bigger suite with a pull down bed (large single size) rather than the king size bed that I had booked months previously and as I specify as my preference on their Starwoods loyalty scheme. On complaining I was told my room had been given away earlier as I'd checked in towards the end of the day (having previously informed them that I'd arrive after midnight) which I don't think is acceptable. As I was on a business trip alone it wasn't too much of an issue but had I been with my 6ft 5 husband there is no way either of us would have got any sleep. As an apology I was offered breakfast vouchers, usually a bonus as Westin breakfasts can be great but there was only a Starbucks style cafe which was pretty dire. The location is good and the pool (although tiny) was very clean with well kept changing rooms but I was pretty fed up by the time I checked out of this hotel. Best thing was Lola's cafe for breakfast just up the road - not to be missed!

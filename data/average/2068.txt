Great location and very good value for a one bedroom suite. The front desk people were very helpful and courteous. That said, it is getting a bit run down. Our sofa was truly a throw away and rather ratty. Sit in the middle and you sank into a hole. As a sofa bed it was useless. The missing mattress on the sofa bed was retrieved by the night manager at 11 when we decided to go to bed and discovered this oversight. The sofa bed springs were broken and simply tied together so we just put the mattress on the floor. Note to management. Replace this sofa. The kitchen was functional; the stove was showing its age with a warped burner and the electric kettle was corroded and unusable. It's time for the owners to invest some money in an otherwise decent accommodation.

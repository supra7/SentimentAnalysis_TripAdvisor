For $60, this is a fine place to spend a night. I was originally a little concerned about the neighborhood, but unless you are willing to pay $200+ a night, it appears that all of your hotel choices are in "iffy" neighborhoods. Turns out, the concern was misplaced-- there were no problems and we didn't even hear any sirens, which is better than home! The staff was great-- very attentive and helpful. The breakfast was average. The breakfast area and rooms were very clean. (Bedding and linens appear new.) However, the rest of the hotel is in need of MAJOR renovations. The hallways are dingy and dirty-- yuck! I wouldn't want to stay here for an extended visit to Memphis, but it is just fine for a quick stop.

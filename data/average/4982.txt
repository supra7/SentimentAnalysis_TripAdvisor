I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton Jan 13 and Jan 14. It was the best location for food and shopping, but it was so "ritzy" that our children couldn't walk arround in their jammies or run in the halls and play. Then we were put on the 16th floor! (as we all know, a fire latter doesn't reach 16 floors!) Our room was avarage it had rust arround the bathroom door, but the room was pretty big. Instead of Mr.Hilton donating his money to charity, he should make sure his hotels are up to par! Although the hotel was very interesting, it was 25.00 for 2 eggs,bacon and toast. If your planning on eating, there is a great little place about a block away called BP's Pub (i think) It's cheap and VERY good.

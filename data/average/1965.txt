Just returned from our stay at the KBH. Overall, it was a very good place to stay. It's located in Ka'anapali, along a strip of about 8-10 different hotels and condos along the beach. The main thing holding me back from giving it a higher rating is that several of the other hotels along that strip appeared more luxurious and impressive. That said, KBH was more reasonably priced than the others. Pros: (1) great location -- five minute walk to the Whaler's Village shopping area and its fun outdoor bars/restaurants; could also easily walk to several other hotels; (2) great beach -- along with the Sheraton next door, it appeared to be one of the best beach locations in Ka'anapali, with wide beaches and safe swimming; (3) room placement -- it appeared that every room has at least a marginal view of the ocean; we stayed in a "partial ocean view" room on the third floor in the Maui wing, and we had a very niceview of the pool and ocean; (4) nightly entertainment -- although we never made the nightly hotel entertainment our main event, it was very nice that every evening, while we had cocktails on our balcony and got ready to go out to dinner, there was a live band playing Hawaiian music; (5) pretty big room -- not huge and nothing fancy, but plenty of room to spread out; also, large shower/bath; (6) easy and close parking -- no need for valet; (7) decent bar and grill outside, which was nice and convenient for beach days; (8) room was pretty clean. Cons: (1) not fancy; we had a little bit of "hotel envy" towards some of the neighboring hotels like the Sheraton, Westin, Marriott, and Ka'anapali Alli; (2) pool is weak (although we went more for the beach, so it didn't bother us too much); (3) we did not find the staff to be as exceptionally friendly as their reputation on these boards and in some travel guides; that said, they were not bad either; but, with a few exceptions, we generally did not find the staff overly nice or accommodating, especially compared to the place we stayed next in Kauai; in particular, the people at the towel station outside were relatively unhelpful and unfriendly; (4) "free" breakfast at the Mixed Plate restaurant was pretty bad and basically felt like a school/dorm cafeteria; if you can, skip the room w/ breakfast deal and find yourself a cheaper, better, and less gross breakfast somewhere off-grounds; (5) bus into nearby town of Lahaina only ran once an hour and stopped running at 9:20 pm; however, this may be a common issue for every hotel in Ka'anapali unless other hotels/condos have their own shuttles into Lahaina, which most don't seem to. Overall: price was pretty good, but it's not some fantastic out-of-this-world deal; we pretty much felt like we got what we paid for: a decent hotel at a mid-range price with a great location. We'd probably stay there again, although we'd be tempted to check out another place if the cost weren't too much higher.

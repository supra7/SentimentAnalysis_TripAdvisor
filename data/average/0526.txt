Convient Location to Seattle attractions. I have the highest level of status with SPG (platinum), so spend quite a few nights a year with Westins and Sheratons. This was the worst lounge I saw. The tables were not cleared, the food, beverages, snacks were not properly stocked. The remenants that were out were not stored at safe temperatures (Milk, Yogurt, Cream Cheese, Mozzarella were not placed on ice and were just left in the open). Furthermore the lounge charges for alcohol. Most lounges have complimentary beer and wine. During the three times we were in the lounge, the lounge attendant never once greated us or offered to clean a table so we didnt have to sit in other people leftovers. Beyond the lounge, when we arrived, we walked into our room, the cleaning crew was still there. I would recommend that you do not send guests to rooms that are not ready.

For your $25/DAY resort fee, you get free wi-fi. Good thing, it's worth nothing. Never seen anything so slow since I had dial-up. Don't plan on getting any computer work done while there. Take lots of money--$4 cup of coffee, drinks at poolside are $15ea, cold hot dogs at poolside are $8, Closed off the kiddie pool early so private party could have it---what are we, chopped liver? We paid $400/night isn't that enough? Housekeeping wasn't getting done until 4 PM, but we addressed that. Another afternoon, part of the lagoon was roped off for yet another party. Hotel definately showing it's age.Keith was the only lifeguard on duty that cared about the kids at the kiddie pool. Be sure to work with Jeff at check-in, he's he greatest. Stay was our 2nd there in 10 years. Still nice, but for the money we'll stay somewhere else next visit.

This is not a hotel for someone who wants to relax in the comfort of their room for hours. It is a clean, basic hotel ideal for anyone coming in from Euston which is 2 minutes away. We paid 32 for a Sunday night and felt that it was good value. I would not pay the 100 I have been quoted before, as the rooms are small compared to other Travelodges, and the Kings Cross hotel is much more pleasant. You are given one thin pillow each, but you can go and ask for extra pillows at reception without any problem. We did not notice too much noise from the railway station. Definitely bearable for a couple of nights at the right price.

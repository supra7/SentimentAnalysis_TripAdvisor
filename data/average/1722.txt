Just returned from a 5day stay at the Hyatt, Maui Hi. Check in was easy but they forgot to give us a daily activites sheet. The room was large but dark. All wood seemed chipped. Past guest dirty towel in bath. Bed was on a wood frame with just the mattress. Very low and difficult to get in and out of. They brag about their thread count on the sheets, but our sheets had a tag that said 250. This side of muslin. Rust around tub drain. We unnpacked then open the drapes. Our view was of a roof and in the far distance some trees. There was debris on the roof, fork, cigarette butts and bottle caps. This room is 1403. Avoid this one for sure! I had to adjust the cords on the TV to get a clear picture and one of the phones had problems. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful with well kept flower beds and water interests. They had penquins, swans and other wildlife. I guess the $25 per day extra fee was for food. We ate at Son'z, great quiet happy hour, Umalu bar and Japengo. The waite staff was great everywhere and the help very curteous. Wood everywhere around the hotel is in need of repair but from the room door out it was a wonderful stay. Beware, before you unpack check out your room. A change may be in the cards.

There for a weekend seminar. Two towered, large property in a good location, fairly quiet neighborhood, the retro-cool monorail going right by. Very pleasant lobby, generally friendly front desk staff ( I lost my cellphone and when I reported it, I kept being asked if I knew where I lost it...), nicely done rooms given odd shape (towers). Had couch and lots windows. Meeting room fine; yummy smoked salmon and pastries there! Had a hot tub and pool with a balcony-neat. Could have been cleaner, though- stained carpet, obvious dust and the bathroom floor needed a scrub brush. Sorry, but for the price ($250/night), I don't think it's too much to ask.

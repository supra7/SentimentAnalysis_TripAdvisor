$99 per night on Hotwire. We were told we couldn't have a TWIN room because there were none available however we know it's really because we're on the Hotwire super saver deal. Staff on reception were nice & very helpful. Doormen / bell boys watched us try to lift our cases out the back of a cab so ZERO potential tip for them. Great location however and you really are in a safe area of town. We were allocated a room on level 12 and the shower took something like 10 minutes to get hot. I think this place has sme plumbing issues. The rooms are nice though. Ours is HUGE and very well appointed. Great photos of Boston all over the walls, clean and well maintained. They are doing the room up over the hall however and the work men are singing as they work. Other than that it's a good place to stay. Do ask about the water / plumbing situation and don't expect too much help from the bell boys.

After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump. That was not the case although this is not a hotel you want to book for a special occasion. The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds. Nothing special though. Our room had a balcony that we couldn't use because of all the construction going on. Tools and debris were lying on the balcony. The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel. Tip for runners: It's a nice run from the hotel towards Miami Beach (which is only 4k away).

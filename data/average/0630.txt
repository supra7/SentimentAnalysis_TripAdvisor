I really liked the Sixth Avenue Inn. The price was very reasonable and the location was great. Close to various bus lines so you can get anywhere you want and close to shopping and tons of restaurants within walking distance. The room itself was very simple and by no means the best place I've ever stayed in but it was great for the money. Nice television but it didn't have all the cable channels that I like to watch. Another downside was that the shower was pretty small. I had a room on the top floor and it was quiet and pleasant. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again!

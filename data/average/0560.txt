This is a beautiful hotel in downtown and the room was very spacious with a desk and amenities. I was disappointed with the mold in the bathroom caused from the shower curtain allowing water to leak onto the floor. Thought that housekeeping should have taken care of this situation. Linens are wonderful but bed could have been more comfortable. Very close to car rental.

I've stayed at the Palmer House Hilton many times. It always seemed like a nice, grand hotel but this grand dame is showing her age. The room I was in was very small and a bit shabby. I understand a lot of rooms at these old, traditional hotels can be small but the room seemed very tired and in need of an update. For exploring the loop, Millinium Park, and the Art Institute, the location is great. The lobby is lovely but I believe I will stay elsewhere next time.

We booked 2 rooms for two nights and were told we would have to move from one room after the first night to get ajoining rooms. Had written confirmation. When we arrived 1 room was booked for 7 days?? and one booking was not there?? They fixed this. After checking in, we went to dinner. Came back to find one room had been canceled and our keys did not work. They fixed this. In the morning went to move rooms and found they had again canceled one room, the wrong one, and our reserveation for the new was gone. They fixed this. Then we were overcharged. Spent over 4 hours of a two day stay dealing with their registration problems. Rooms were nice....when we could get in them. Also they never told us parking was $25 per day til we arrived.

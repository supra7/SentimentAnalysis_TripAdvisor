Found the classic room we stayed in was a bit small for us and there was no full length mirror and little storage space in the room. Had a problem with the bath which seemed to be blocked and the water wasn't going down properly. Did ask to get this fixed but no one did fix this as it remained blocked for the rest of out stay. However the bedroom was clean and the hotel is convenient for location. Maybe if you are planning to stay here upgrade on the room. Found it quite expensive for what we got in comparison to other hotels. Would call it 3 stars.

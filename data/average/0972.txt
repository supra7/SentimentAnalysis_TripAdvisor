The staff at University Inn were very helpful, and there are nice perks with a stay like free breakfast and a shuttle to the major attractions in downtown Seattle. Surrounding the hotel are also some great restaurants (check out Little Thai and Portage Bay). The rooms are a decent size, as are the bathrooms, but no full length mirrors or even large mirrors in the room. It was three women in the room, so this proved to be an issue. I might stay again, but more for simple convenience.

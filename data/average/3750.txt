Hotel is in a nice location and is your basic Marriot.. My room was in good condition, not dirty, not beat up etc. Breakfast was OK, your basic Springhill breakfast. Lots of good resturants to walk too. Front desk staff was always very helpful "Wifi" is BAD! The only place it worked in my suite was at the desk by the door and even then signal strength was "low' Luckily there was a wired connection, but it meant I could not use my IPAD at all! BOO! Also, while it has a kitchentte there are not plates, utinsels etc.. maybe you can get them but at other Springhills I have stayed in they were waiting on me! Valet parking is ther real problem! First it's $22 which is probably reasonable for a big city, but a little steep for a "value" chain. Second, it appears they park the cars miles away and only have ONE valet. Waits were VERY long for the car, just not acceptable for a $22 "fee". Service gets a poor rating because of this. Hard to recommend this one, but it's not bad for the price.

I stayed here for a conference that my work was paying for. I must agree with pervious individuals that remarked about the rooms. My room was small, but had large bulky furniture that seemed to have lots of marks on it. My bed took up most of the room. The carpet seemed a bit worn. The bathroom was small and needed to be updated. The floor tiles didnt match at all the wall tiles. I know a lot of people at the conference I attended were also disappointment. The one thing I can say, it is in a great location!!!! If this hotel would renovate their rooms, it would be an amazing hotel. I do recommend staying on Towers Level Concierge, as it has a very nice breakfast.

Stayed a couple nights to a business seminar and didnt want to pay $300+ per night to be on the waterfront. This one ended up being $155 per night + $15 per night parking. The room had a queen bed that was comfortable. A flat screen TV which was nice. The rest of the room seemed older. The carpet was at best so so. The bathroom, specifically the shower was horrible. No bathtub at all, was a stand up shower with OLD tile. It looked like an old Gym shower. On the morning I was leaving I just skipped the shower. The wallpaper was starting to peel back in spots in the bathroom and there was black mold forming underneath it. The toilet seemed newer. The sink seemed newer but the handles on the sink where odd. One would face East/west when on or off and the other faced North/south. Its like whoever installed it didnt know how to put the handles on. Going back to the bed. It was decently comfortable but I found it odd that there was no comforter on it at all. It was 1 Sheet, 1 very thin blanket and then another sheet on top of that which I suppose was acting as the comforter. Was wierd. They did offer free internet that was VERY slow. Dialup slow. I was able to connect to the building across the streets internet which was much faster. Dont count on the hotels internet if you actually want to do anything. Overall, you are paying for location. 20 Minute walk to the waterfront, reasonable walk to the space needle. If all you are worried about is location and need somewhere to crash after bar hoping this is probably fine. Romantic getaway? No way. This is like a $65 hotel along I-5 that your paying $155+parking fees for.

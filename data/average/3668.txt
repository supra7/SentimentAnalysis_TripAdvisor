Not exactly bad but not at all memorable either, this fits perfectly into its North Tollway/Dallas environs (slight dis intended). Competent service, a sprawling marble-y lobby, slightly dated though comfortable rooms and lots of people who look like they just got out of a medical sales convention (or nearby research/focus groups, in our case). As mentioned by someone else, the lobby level is home to the worst Starbucks ever. In a word, "meh." For the money I prefer to stay a little farther down the Tollway at the Westin Galleria, which though still generic at least has some degree of soul and a multi-level mall to distract you.

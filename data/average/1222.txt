This is a very large hotel and it's easy to get lost. As Hilton Honors members we had a room in the tower on the 10th floor. The room was looking a little worn but was reasonably clean. We had no issues with noise. There is a Denny's across the street if you choose not to eat in the hotel restaurant. The free shuttle to the airport left right on time.

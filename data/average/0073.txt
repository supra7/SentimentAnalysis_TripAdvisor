I stayed at the Warwick hotel 26-28 Jan. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center where I was attending the Travel Convention. The hotel is ok. Nothing spectalular. The front desk people are friendly though twice when my sister and I asked for directions, the ladies we asked had to go find the manager to ask her. The room we stayed in on the 17th floor was clean. It had a gorgous view of downtown Seattle. The only problem with the room was the lighting was very poor in the bathroom and the handle on the toliet fell off when I flushed so you had to be very careful. But the room was quiet and comfortable. The only other problem we encounter was in our search for a working ice machine. This hotel has 19 floors but only 4 ice machines..17th, 15th, 8th and 4th floor. The one on the 17th floor was out of order, the one on the 15th floor was out of order but Eureka! the one on the 8th floor was working so all wasn't lost. In summary, for the price I paid, it was an adequate hotel with a good location.

I stayed here for two nights on business. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are small. The bathroom was tiny. Very, very tiny. I'm seen bigger showers in motor homes. The hotel is trying for a cool, hip, boutique feel but not quite hitting the mark. Everything was clean though, and the staff were pleasant. The lounge next door has good drinks and looked like good food too. It's fine for a short stay but the lack of space and amenities gets old real quick.

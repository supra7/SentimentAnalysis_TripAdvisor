Never stayed in a Travelodge before and it was a good experience.. staff v helpful friendly and accommodating.. for the cost it was amazing value. Location for the university ideal. A great experience.. only possible complaint would be the breakfast ! perhaps why bother.. when good places around but other than that it was excellent ! Would recommend it !

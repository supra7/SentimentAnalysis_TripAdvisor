Love the vibe at this hotel. Felt very European. Awesome shower, simple closet, big bench for luggage instead of silly dressers and drawers. No restaurant, but short walk across the street to get to the Sheraton. Calling the front desk for a new wireless code everyday was a pain...but the one thing that annoyed me was the lack of additional toilet tissue. After I called and asked for more - they neglected to bring it up. Funny how hotel satisfaction comes down to the smallest details!

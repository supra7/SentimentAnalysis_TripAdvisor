This hotel is often less expensive and may be a cheaper option than others in the area if this is where you want to stay. Personally, I had forgotten that there is very little in the area and would prefer to stay further south or north. Rooms are avg. for mid priced 3* Hilton, but service is pretty poor from the front desk to the wait staff to the valet. Just remember that despite the fancy lobby etc. this is still only a 3* hotel and there is a reason for that. On the contrary, the lounge staff was excellent, but the food was typical. There is virtually or at least VERY few places to walk to here. So, if you want to get out and wander around or walk to dinner stay further north or south.

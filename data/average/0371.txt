We stayed here over the New Years weekend. We had planned to do some working out to offset the Holiday's food, so we were a bit disappointed to find out that the pool and the fitness center were closed. It would have been better if they had announced in or near the elevator that the whole top floor (where the fitness facilities are) was inaccessible, but instead we found out by finding the exit from the elevator blocked after going to the top floor. On the good side, the hotel was nice enough to offer us free Internet for the inconvenience, which we very much appreciated.

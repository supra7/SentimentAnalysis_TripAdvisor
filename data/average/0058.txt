I had read in the reviews that rooms that they allocate for some "best-rates" in the internet can face a wall. This is exactly what happened to us in our weekend get-away. We booked our room on expedia for 99$ and we were given a room on the 4th floor which they said was a "corner room": facing the wall of the parking garage next door. Well, we had to go and ask for another room and we did get another one on the sixth floor, this time, facing not the wall of the garage, but the garage itself.. So, it might be better to spend a bit more and get a Space needle view room. Otherwise as you check in you might want to ask for a room on level 7 or above. Otherwise, the hotel staff was helpful and they did end up changing our room. The room itself was clean and spacious enough. The bathroom was also nice, it was all marble. No mini-bar but a refrigerator if you want to keep some food in there. Walking distance to pretty much everything unless you are lazy. And if you are lazy, there is always a cab waiting in front of the hotel for a 5 bucks ride to Space Needle. They charge $11 for using the internet (24 hours period). So, if you can avoid one of those rooms facing the wall (levels 4 and 5) or almost at the same level with the parking garage (level 6) then you should be fine. We would probably stay here again.

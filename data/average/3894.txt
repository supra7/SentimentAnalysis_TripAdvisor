This property is new, clean, large and VERY reasonably priced. The rooms come in various sizes - studio, one bedroom and two bedroom. All have at least partial kitchens (studios) and plenty of room. The staff is friendly and helpful. To really enjoy staying here you need a car. There is really nothing within walking distance, including restaurants. While the breakfast is quite adequate, the dinner is NOT. It's referred to as 'tapas', but really it's a very abbreviated bar menu. Great pool area (didn't use it because it never got above 40 degrees while I was there).

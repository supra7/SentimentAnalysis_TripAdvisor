My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel during a trip in Boston. The room was spacious and clean, but a tiny old. The hall is very large, with several restaurants. There is no parking at this hotel, we use a public parking next to the hotel but it was very expensive (32$ / 24h). This hotel is very well located, you are a quick walk to the commons and to the subway. So I recommend this hotel, if you want to stay downtown Boston.

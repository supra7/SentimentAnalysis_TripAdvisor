We stayed here twice in may, and stayed in two different rooms. The first one was the biggest and less noisiest (you are nearly IN the Manhattan bridge), the other one was smaller (still OK and clean), but very noisy. We heard and felt every train going by. I liked the neighbourhood, it was funny to have our first steps into NYC in Chinatown. The location in Manhattan was OK too, near nice neighbourhoods and restaurants/bars in Lower east side. In short: good location and nice rooms, but noisy. They charge for storing your bags, $ 2 a piece.

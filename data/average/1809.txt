My wife and I honeymooned at the Maui Hyatt in 1989. When we were invited to a wedding on Maui, we decided to stay at the Hyatt again even though the wedding was at the Ritz Carlton. The Hyatt was mostly a disappointment, however. The hotel was pretty much exactly as we remembered it from 20 years ago. Well maintained, but really nothing new that we noticed. I had mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne to our room--a very nice touch! I did get a great AAA rate that purported to include a category upgrade and breakfast. Our "partial ocean view" required standing on the balcony and ignoring a very large flat roof immediately below, however. Looking the other way, the mountains were pretty and we saw several rainbows, but if I had been paying for the "partial ocean view," I'd have been upset and probably demanded to be moved. Knowing that the hotel was at 100% occupancy and that we would not be spending much time in the room other than sleeping, I didn't bother. Also, the room was clean, but not spotless. My wife noticed dust on the furniture and the maid had missed a dirty towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door. The breakfast was a problem too. Our included AAA breakfast should have been the breakfast buffet in the Swan Court restaurant, but the line to get in was so long every morning that we passed and went to the smaller breakfast buffet in the pool side cafe. The food there was good, but not what I would have expected in the Swan Court. The staff was friendly, but seemed to be struggling a little with the capacity crowd. Bottom line: We got a good price at the Hyatt, but I wish I had spent the extra money to stay at the Ritz Carlton.

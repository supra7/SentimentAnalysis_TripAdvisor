I love the location of the Coprthorne, it is close to the Deira City Mall, the train. The staff are all delightful and more than happy to help you with anything you want. The lobby area is nice and the restaurant is very reasonably priced. I feel the standard of the rooms has gone down hill since last time. They just had an old worn out feel to them and I do hope that they do reburish the rooms as the hotel has alot going for it

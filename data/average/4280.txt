The location of this hotel was the best part. It was near lots of what we wanted to do in Boston. Parking was an issue. Couldn't find a good place to unload luggage and was glad we dropped off rental car for our stay here. Booked this room on hotels.com so maybe that's why we ended up with the room we got. It looked onto the gravel roof of another part of the hotel. Some of these rooms had a sofa, but ours did not even though I requested one. The bathroom was really small so for our group it was a very tight fit. Looked like they tried to update this room to be larger but didn't bother making the bathroom bigger. The concierge was very limited in their help, talked down to us and didn't offer any tips or help unless you specifically asked. Odd, since helping you is their job. One night an alarm and warning to evacuate the hotel sounded at 4:30 in the morning. After listening to the alarm and trying to figure out what to do, they cancelled it and said it was a false alarm. When we got our bill, it was an amount that was lower than what we prepaid on hotels.com and the staff wouldn't help or offer any explanation. There are probably a lot nicer rooms in this hotel than what we stayed in, but our deal with hotels.com was not a deal after all and wouldn't do that again. Would only stay here again for location, not for the service or rooms.

first of hotel hotel is good neat and clean with all the basic facilities like tea coffee maker etc. however locker in the room was missing the hotel is located far from the city centre and one can find some decent hotels in near la ramblas as the place becomes deserted after 11 pm. breakfast was on poorer side as eggs were not available staff was very good and explained all the locations and gave lots of time to us

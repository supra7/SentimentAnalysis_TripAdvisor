This hotel was arranged for business, good value price in a great location, within walking distance to the Mall Of the Emirates. They have different style rooms, mine was basic 2 twin beds pushed together to make a bed with a tiny bathroom with shower. Watch out for the doorstop placed in front of the toliet, banged my foot on that every time. The kitchen was nice granite and appliances but with only 2 plates, couple of pots and several utensils there wasnt much cooking going on. My freezer never worked and since the hotels icemachine was broken, having a cold drink wasnt happening. I did not have a washingmachine as promised but they did very promptly install one. Only used a couple of times, way too noisy and u could only put in a couple pieces of clothing. No laptop either provided in room, didnt really matter, the internet signal was hit or miss. Had to ask daily for washcloths, towels rather hard and scratchy and often ragged. Rooftop pool was very nice, the gym had everything I needed and the attendants were very courteous and always quick with a towel. The breakfast buffet was good, I often asked for fresh eggs or an omelette and these requests were delivered upon quickly by the friendly staff. The hotel was hot in the hallways and also very noisy when familes arrived. They stay up late, making it hard to sleep for those who have an early wakeup call, which was delivered by a human and accurate everyday.

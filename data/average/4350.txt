I have stayed at the Park Plaza about a dozen times for business travel. It is shockingly cheap for Boston, and one of the only hotels that can actually offer a real government rate (I think I pay about $80, vs. >$250 in Cambridge). It is less than 1 block from the T (green line), right next to the park, and near a lot of good food. In other words, location is terrific. The hotel _is_ very old and worn (circa 20's). That's part of it's charm - it has lots of "character". If you read the literature they provide there is a detailed history of the hotel. This is not a luxury hotel by modern standards, but was in the past. Today it is clinging to the remains of that, like an old man. And the rooms are all very different. I have often been in the original rooms for tradesmen and I will agree, they are quite small. I have also been in other rooms that had separate sitting rooms and bedrooms, exercise gear, etc. I have no idea how they decide what rooms to put people in. All in all, an excellent deal, but worn and a bit spotty.

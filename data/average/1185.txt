Hotel is well located. I usually like older hotels but the room that I had was nothing to brag about. Probably there were better rooms in that in hotels of this vintage normally have a variety. I was unable to note any rude staff. I found all to be pleasant and helpful. I would say to forget considering breakfast in house. A small and unattractive buffet is set up on the hotels bar. Overpriced. There are not many places near-by but the bellman gave me a good suggestion which was one block away.

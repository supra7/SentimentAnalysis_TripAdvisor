I was a little disappointed with our stay at the Hyatt. The rooms are in dire need of renovation. In saying that, they were clean and comfortable and the soft furnishings have been replaced. We had a flat screen tv and a very comfortable bed. It is just an older decor style and looks very worn and tired. It is a very busy hotel with most people spending the day lined up on sun lounges in rows around the pool and on the grass. If you are looking for a quiet romantic holiday then this is not the place for you! We swam with turtles at the beach in front of the hotel which was pretty amazing. The hotel is only about a 5 minute drive from Lahaina. The mahi mahi at Lahaina Fish Company was great. I would not recommend Cheesburger in Paradise.

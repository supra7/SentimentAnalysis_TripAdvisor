Just returned from our stay at the Beautiful Hyatt Regency in Maui. Although the hotel is beautiful and the staff was friendly (accept for the lady making the omelets at Son'z Maui at Swan Court - my husband likes to refer to her as the Omelet Nazi) this hotel is WAY OVER PRICED. Glad our package included the breakfast buffet. Had breakfast not been included with our package the buffet would have been $62.50 a day for breakfast! That is just plain ridiculous and the food was nothing special. The breakfast at the Marriott in Kauai was much much better! There is also a $25.00 a day resort fee which we knew about in advance. This fee was also ridiculous. I would not stay here again. I would much rather stay in South Maui. We spoke to a couple on the beach that have been renting a condo every other year in South Maui on the beach for $110.00 a night. This includes a washer and drier in their room as well as beach chairs and coolers which they can take right out to the beach. Much better value

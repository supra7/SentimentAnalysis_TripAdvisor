As non-smokers, we were among the minority of the guests at this hotel. All though we were supposedly on a non-smoking floor, smoke from the balconies next to us and below us was constantly drifting into our room, stinking up our clothes and suitcases. The staff half-heartedly offered to move us, but the question was to where? The entire hotel is dingy and run down, HOWEVER, the location is perfect -- central to everything, right on the beach and the famous Kaanapali beach path. That being said, the hotel is VERY noisy until quite late at night. The nightly entertainment seemed sort of sad, one night consisted of young children who appeared very tired, with forced smiles (seemed vaguely creepy....we left.... wondering why they were out so late on a school night)

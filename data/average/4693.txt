I stayed here after a friends weekend on my final night, after staying in a more upscale hotel. It is true you get what you pay for! Though the staff was friendly their presence was absent. The hallways were dirty and the rooms uninteresting and very small. It was convenient for transportation to the airport, which is why I chose it. Good and cheap enough to stay for convenience only, but if your looking for anything else, look elsewhere.

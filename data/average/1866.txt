The Hyatt appealed to us as it has a lovely kids pool and easy access to the beach, restaurants and shops. The car/breakfast package was great. Unfortunately the night we arrived (after 11pm) our room was not ready and we spent an uncomfortable night in a room with one bed for 4 of us. The situation was corrected the next day and we were given a much more suitable room. The breakfast at Swan Court was very good. The spa and fitness facility are well done. The resort fee makes little sense, fitness room access, newspaper and coffee are often standard in hotels that charge 400USD+ per night. Some nights were noisy due to outside events that went on until 10PM. All complaints were handled well. Tennis lessons were a pleasure, thank you to Frank Salvatore! Cascade Grill and Sushi was our favorite on site restaurant and there is easy access to other excellent places to eat. You will need a car if you stay here. The self parking was very convenient. Overall we enjoyed our stay with our two young children, 4 years and 5 months, however it did feel like we were paying too much for average service and surroundings.

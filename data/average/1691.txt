I stayed here one night with my GF on part of Our California tour on June 2010. Pros: + Good location near the Gaslamp Quarter. + Nice view from the room. + Greak breakfast at the Vela and the view was great too. + Easy self-parking. + After a long discussion get free upgrade, free breakfast and Starbucks drinks. Cons: - Check-in takes forever - Why theres only soap at the bathroom? - Pool area tries to be hot spot, but it is not. - Staff dont appreciate your diamond status. - Bed was quite hard to sleep. Overall nice one night stay. Id propably give Hilton a second chance.

We didn't expect to have to climb a steep flight of stairs to reach our first floor and then another flight inside for the second bedroom.And those eaves - gotta watch out for your head! Those with bad knees beware! especially after a long day. It's also away from everything and have to take a taxi or bus to get there. It's a nice setting once you are on the property...breakfast was nice. But the "kitchenette" that was offered was a tiny refrigerator without a freezer, a microwave and coffee pot. We get that in any hotel room. We had thought we could avoid paying for breakfast. There wasn't even a table to eat at or play cards. There was only a 3 seater sofa and one easy chair. Not great for us to spread out on. I wouldn't recommend.

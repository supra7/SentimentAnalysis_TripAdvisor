I'll say this first - the view of the Space Needle from our room was a 'WOW' and the bed was incredibly comfortable. But - when we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded to one of their "newly remodeled Executive Suites" I was excited, until I saw the room. The carpet, and furniture were new, but they hadn't done anything in the bathroom (door had big chunks missing out of the bottom, faucet had obvious signs of wear, water stains on the marble tile) and, worst of all, the sliding glas door opening to the balcony was so poorly hung, we didn't dare open it again once we got it shut the first time. Additionally - while the floor-to-celing windows provide a great view, they are poorly insulated and the noise coming up from the street during the night made it difficult to sleep - and we were exhausted from our trip. The Warwick is in a great location, but Hotel Andra is right next door and the Warwick suffers in comparison. If the view is most important to you, stay at Warwick; if its the quality of the room, go to Andra.

It's a travelodge. Reception efficient, room clean and basically equipped. Breakfast was a full English with not much choice but everything done ok. Great location for British Museum, Library, stations to the North (if you must), etc, etc. If you can get a cheap deal then good no-frills value. Rooms a little noisy at night but then, this is London...

A great hotel in a great location: steps to the shopping district. If youre going further afield the regular bus service stops can be found within a block. The lobby and reception area of the Omni were modern and tastefully appointed, a theme which was followed through to the bar and restaurant areas. The hotel room itself was spacious, clean and fairly well appointed with nice decor, a modern flat screen LCD TV and cordless phone. The only negative point was the construction going on right next door. They are completely re-doing the area next to the hotel. So don't think about sleeping in. Apart from that, the service given by the rest of the Omnis staff was first class. Highly recommended.

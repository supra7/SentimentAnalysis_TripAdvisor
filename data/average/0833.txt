Having stayed at the Westin in Bellevue a few times, I decided to try the Seattle one again and was slightly dissapointed. The Westin in Bellevue is much nicer! The first time I visited the Westin Seattle hotel was in 1995, and it has definitely lost its glory since then. The lifts seem old, and everything is quite dated. You definitely see that in all the detail (door handles, bathroom etc). The rooms are equipped with the wonderful heavenly beds and the signature Westin showers, but apart from that the rooms makes you feel that you go back in time. The valet parking is extremely expensive. The highest I've ever seen at $43. The gym is also split between two rooms, and with no windows, so felt stuffy. The gym was packed at 6am in the morning, and not a spare treadmill or crosstrainer to find.

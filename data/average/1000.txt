Visited Seattle on business. Spent 4 nights in the Vintage Park. Great location. Room was nice. Bathroom was nice and clean. Thermostat didn't work-had to open the windows to cool the room off. Upon check-in, they asked if I wanted turn-down service. I said yes. Never happened. Asked front desk for a local Seattle restaurant on my first night. She suggested two cookie-cutter wine bars and a mall restaurant. Not a big deal, but as I became familiar with downtown Seattle, I couldn't believe she didn't recommend The Brooklyn or one of the many other restaurants with true local flavor. Joined the Kimpton loyalty club upon arriving. Was supposed to get the WSJ. Never even received USA Today. But I did get free internet, which saved me some money. No pool. I knew this before I made the reservation, but it was not immediately clear--had to do some searching.

Sixth Avenue had just about everything we were looking for in a hotel. Good location, clean comfortable rooms, and price well within our budget. The restaurant/ bar staff were friendly and made it good place to recap the day. It is located so that can you walk to space needle area and you are a block away from free ride bus zone of downtown. Grab the bus and you are at pioneer square or the Public Market in ten minutes. Nordstrom's is only two blocks away. A great place for breakfast or a couple of beers at 9 in the morning or 11 at night is the 5 Point Cafe.

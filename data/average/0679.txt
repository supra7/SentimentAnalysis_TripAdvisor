I stayed at this hotel in mid October for 5 nights. Initially I was put in a room on the Virginia Street side where there is a huge apartment building going up. The first night I was woken up at 6:45 AM due to extremely loud construction drilling, banging, trucks driving, & men at work. I asked to have my room changed immediately & the staff was accommodating. I was moved to the 4th Avenue side of the hotel & able to sleep undisturbed. The hotel location is great. The rooms were fine, but I would say that the lights were very dim. Brighter lighting would be helpful. I second some of the comments here about the mildew in bathrooms & small size of the bathrooms. However, the closets were quite large. The hotel gym was quite small & had only 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical machine & 1 stairmaster. The business center was also small-with only 2 computers, but free internet access & printing. The lobby is nice with the fireplace & Scandinavian decor. I would definitely stay here again.

The staff were friendly and helpful and our room was clean and spacious. However the thermostat in our room did not work which we did not discover until late on the first night. The staff were good at quickly finding us another room however when we moved into the room we found that it had had a very strong smell of smoke. So back to the reception again and we were told that there were no other rooms that we could take at the back of the hotel which is where we wanted to stay as it has a view of the canal. So we went back to our original room and were given a small portable heater to keep us warm. Location wise it's about 20 minutes out of central amsterdam and there are 2 trams or a bus you can take which take you to different locations in Amsterdam. A word of warning, we missed our shuttle bus back to the airport on our last night and we had to get a taxi organised by the hotel which cost 40 euros - so not cheap.

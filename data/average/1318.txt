My BF, his brother and I were traveling to Anchorage, AK for Thanksgiving Holiday. We had a long layover (8.5) hours overnight so instead of roughing it in the airport made reservations for this hotel to just get some food and sleep. This hotel was also convenient because they had a comped shuttle to and from the airport. This hotel is absolutely stunning!! Looks like a ski lodge but its in the middle of downtown seattle!! Beautiful indoor pool and atrium and guest beds were so so comfy. Rooms were clean as could be. Only wished we could have stayed longer. ON THE OTHER HAND.... when we checked in we asked about the comlimentary lounge for Platinum Marriott Rewards members and were told it was closed "for the holiday"....4 days before the "holiday" Kind of strange right? So then when we got to the room we were all trying to decide if we just wanted to order room service or go down to the restaurant. Boys decided restaurant would be good. Called the front desk to ask what time the restaurant closed, they said 10 pm. Well being that it was 8:40pm we made our way down to the restaurant only to find out that it was closed "for the holiday" ...again 4 days before the holiday. After explaining that we had just called and they told us it was open until 10 they recommend that we sit in the bar (with a 14 yr old). Bar told us go to the restaurant because 14 yr olds are not permitted in bar(DUH). FINALLY, they agreed to seat us and after all that BS we had a VERY good steak dinner. One of the BEST I had had in a while. All in all beautiful hotel, great food, crappy staff. Seemed like laziness if you ask me... closing for the holiday 4 days before the date. Disappointing

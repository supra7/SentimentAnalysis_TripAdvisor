Very conveniently located, but this is not really a 4 star hotel. The rooms are tiny - hopeless if there are two of you, at best just about OK for single occupancy. I like a hard bed but these are rock hard and not conducive to a good night's sleep. Very small bathrooms with no bathtub, and an old, small lift inadequate for the number of guests, so you need to be fit if on the 7th floor. The staff were helpful and friendly, but gave incorrect information about transport to the airport. Overall I was disappointed. On my next trip to Istanbul I shall be going back to the Central Palace - much the same price but in a totally different class altogether!

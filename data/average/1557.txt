Here are the pros and cons: Pros: Convenient to harbor amenities, James Joyce Pub (excellent food) across the street, ice cream and movies next door, shopping one block behind. Clean bathroom with large shower area. Nice restaurant for breakfast inside. Housekeeping was prompt when called. Staff helpful. Valet parking. Cons: Lost water for the day (not their fault) because of a city main break, vent popped out of wall, carpet very worn in areas, beds average comfortability, vanity in bathroom is small--broke a glass that fell off when I tried to pull a towel down from rack. Not a lot of area to sit toiletries in bathroom--in fact, dryer hanging from bag on door! Lots of wasted space here. Not family friendly pool--this is a spa that everyone in the city uses--hotel guests are treated as second citizens--in fact my family was told they probably didn't have space. They make you walk past all of the exercisers to a small pool area for families and a large lap area for exercisers. It felt like the walk of shame.

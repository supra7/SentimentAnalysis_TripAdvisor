There are plenty of other good quality 4 star hotels near the Termini Roma station to chose from if this particular location is important to you. We would not stay here again as, for a 4 star hotel, the room was incredibly small and quite claustrophobic, the breakfast selection was more like "school dinners" and the range of facilities was poor ( e.g. a small uncomfortable hotel lounge and no evening restaurant ). We stayed here before catching the train to Civitavecchia for a cruise back to Southampton. If we stayed in Rome again, we would still stay close to the Termini Station, but not here.

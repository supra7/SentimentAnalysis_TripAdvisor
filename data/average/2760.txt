About 45minutes to walk into Barcelona city centre. Underground near by, also buses. Trouble is if you want a late night out you'll need a taxi if you don't fancy the walk. Nearest tour bus stop is about 15minute walk away. Area around the hotel is a bit rough, but seams to be progressing, but very slowly. Maybe in 5-10years the area maybe better. Very quiet though, if you don't want the noise. Free Internet very good in hotel, but i recommend that you take your own laptop, as the computers in the hotel are all in Spanish writting, including the keyboard setup. Excellent restaurant, if you don't mind pizza and pasta or burgers. Staff can be friendly and helpful, as long as you get the right member of staff. Some staff seam to have little knowledge of Barcelona, when we asked how to get somewhere, they didn't seam to know. The bed in our room has wheels on it, so if you tried to sit up to read a book or watch the very limited TV, you'll row down the room.

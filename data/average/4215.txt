I decided to stay at this hotel as part of a road trip with friends. I had my own room which suited me well. THe bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean even if the toilet paper was far from the toilet. I ordered room service twice. The first time I ordered wine and the person, who was just filling in for someone, was very nice and helpful. I also ordered breakfast which kind of dissapointed me for the price I paid. The worst part of my stay was definetly the valet parking. I have an old car which has an issue with the handle on the drivers' side. It someone gets stuck so the door doesnt latch. I forgot to mention it to the valet and the light inside the car comes on if the door is open but apparently has he was backing it up the door swung open and hit another car. I got a call in my room and went downstairs. When I got there, the valet was pissed off at me and blaming ME for the damage to the other car. He even said that it had damaged a NEW car in a tone that was like they're better than you. My car had some damage as well even if it isn't new. I can understand being told you should have mentionned it or something but not taking the blame for the whole thing. Being a student in this domain and working in the F and B department of a hotel that has valet parking, I felt like the incident should have been handled with more professionalism instead of pointing fingers at me. Even, the supervisor said, at one time, that it was my fault in front of the person who's car they it. At least they didn't charge me for the parking. I'm not sure if I'll stay there in the future or recommended it to anyone just because of a small incident that was handled badly.

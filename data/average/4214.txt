As other reviews suggest, great location, older hotel, decent rooms, etc. I am a very frequent travel and was stuck by how aggressive the bell men and valet were in making sure they got their tip. When I arrived late, sleeping child in arms, the bell man at the door expained that they would have to call the valet over from another location and made it seem like a "big deal" to do so. Then, the valet came around and explained to me that he would take my car, but it would be somebody else that would be bringing it back to me in the morning - again...hint hint. Same deal in the morning when we checked out and left our baggage with the bell man - he made sure to tell me that a "different person" would be on duty when we came back to get our things in the afternoon. It was LOUD AND CLEAR that they expected a tip at both ends of any transaction. And I'm all for tipping, but they were so aggressive - it was very off-putting.

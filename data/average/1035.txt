Hotel was alright. I am not sure if it was because I used points, but had no maid serice, we were only a couple of nights so it wasn't a big deal, but curious none the less. The hotel is a little off the beaten track but still close to walk to lots of things. I really enjoyed Seattle and how easy it was to get around. Found most things reasonably priced, meals, transportation, etc. Would definitely plan a trip back. I would probably try the Westin or the Sheraton next time, just a little closer to things and appeared to hae more ammenities.

The wife and I stayed here on minivacation. The service was really nice, from check in to check out. The location is great, pleanty to see and do nearby. Be prepared for a VERY crowded pool deck area. Folks go down around 7-8am to throw towels on chairs and reserve a spot. Good luck finding a poolchair after 10am. The pool is very cool and even has a deep end. 9ft I think, Theyalso have a water slide for the kids and kids at heart. Good times.

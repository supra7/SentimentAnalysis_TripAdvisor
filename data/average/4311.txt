We stayed in Park Plaza Boston in July, rate 120 $ from Hotwire. We came from Connecticut and the driving directions printed from hotel website were very helpful, better than map (there are sevaral tunnels and oneway streets). Chek in was fast, the only down side was that we were told valet parking was the only parking option and there was no self parking nearby. We found (much cheaper) self parking in the next block (info from TA forum), it was probably the same Park Plaza uses for valet parking. Room was not very big, but spacious enough for us and our two big luggage. Room was clean and in good condition. Location was good, easy to walk everyhere in lovely central Boston. We especially liked Boston common, North beach, Charles street and Newbury street. Loved also Local seafoods few blocks from hotel. While waiting for husband to pick up the car from garage I stood by the front door & watched and listened to the doorman. He was very unfriendly to the visitors who asked for some advice and also to cab drivers. Was it just a bad day for him or the normal behaviour? I wanted to ask for driving directions out of town, but didn't like to discuss with him.

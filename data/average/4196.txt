Stayed at this hotel for a quick weekend trip to the city. From the photos and description on the website it seemed like it would be a really classy hotel. We arrived and found what we expected until we got to our floor. The rooms seriously need a face lift. The bathrooms are old, the TVs are tube style from the 90's and it just felt dated. Our rooms were not ready until 5p after being told numerous times before our arrival that they would be ready by 3p. Once we finally got settled the location of the hotel was found to be great but the breakfast options at the hotel the next morning were limited and expensive - do yourself a favor go to Au Bon Pain. Maybe they'll update the rooms in the future.

Stayed for 6 days, hotel is far from the city centre and taxis a must to get to & fro hotel. Cons- rooms quite basic & small, bathroom with basic shower & limited hot water, sink with only cold water, even though rooms were cleaned daily, the towels & bedsheets were worn & pillow cases stained. Early morning woken up by dogs constantly barking, though seeing monkeys on the trees nearby was a novelty. Breakfast was unexciting- basic for western type food though served cold for most food Pros- Nearby french cafe restaurant Picotin served great pizzas; Overall ok for short stays if you want to be away from the city.

The hotel is not brand new, but it was good for the money and location. It could stand an updating, but overall I found it to be clean. The staff was super friendly and very helpful. We didn't get a chance to check out the pool or the breakfast, so I can't comment on those features. The hotel has wi-fi in the lobby and dial-up in the room, for those folks who are slaves to their computers. The hotel is located three blocks from Seattle Center (Space Needle, Sci-Fi Museum, Experience the Music Project and carnival rides.) The monorail is at the Seattle Center as well, which means you can ride to downtown shopping area and near Pike's Place Market without having to worry about traffic and parking.

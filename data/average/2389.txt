Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel from 31/12/08 for 3 nights. It is in a great location on a quiet street and about a 2 minute walk from Kings Cross/St Pancras stations so ideal for the underground. We had a basic double room and I was expecting it to be small but it was quite large and had a washbasin in it. The room also had a fridge with a small freezer compartment in! This was ideal for keeping our drinks in. The room also has a tv with a dvd player built in too. We didnt manage to have any breakfast so I can't comment on what that was like. Overall it is a nice hotel and it was cheap considering we went over new year. It is not a luxury hotel but it is in a good, quiet location and I would stay again.

It is a nice hotel on Monroe Street, close to the art institute of Chicago, and to the magnificent mile, the lobby is precious, the rooms are very comfortable, the best is the people on the conserje course, they had all the information on CTA and the most important places to go. The bad, it is not a free hotel, and they charge you for fitness $18 every day and $ 30 for internet access.

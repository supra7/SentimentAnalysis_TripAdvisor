I have stayed here several times and this hotel is nice and in a great location with a great restaurant attached. However, I have noticed as the rates have dropped at this HGI due to the economic downturn I suppose you get the "in town to party" crowd and they are noisy coming and going all hours of the nights. If this wasn't enough noise, we were on the 22nd floor and you could hear people in the street wooping it up until the wee hours. There were many many sirens and you could hear traffic noise especially motorcycles. This is a very noisy hotel.

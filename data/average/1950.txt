We stayed at this hotel for only 2 nights, but thought it was good value for money. Its an older hotel which could use a face lift, but the rooms are clean, large and comfortable. Its right on the beach, which was great, the pool area is big and has plenty of deck chairs. Breakfast is included each morning, with a large range of fruit & hot food to choose from. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a clean hotel that isnt over priced. I wouldnt stay at this hotel if you wanted something luxurious. Hotel staff are friendly and hotel grounds are well kept. There is parking available for US $8.00 per day. Rooms have air-conditioning, hairdryer, cable TV and inroom safe for US $1.50 per day.

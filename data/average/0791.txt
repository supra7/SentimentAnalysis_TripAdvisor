Overall, a disappointing experience for a Westin. I booked here for a few reasons: I was curious about the hotel, I'm an SPG gold, was hoping to get one of the newly renovated rooms, and I wanted to see the view which I read a lot about. The Good: The staff was very friendly, the location was convenient, it smelled nice and the beds were comfortable (as with all Westin's), wireless internet was pretty fast, good view from the room. The room was good size. The OK: The food and wine list at the main bar in the lobby was ok. Not bad, not great, just ok. Carpeting in the common areas and room were pretty worn. The headboards on the beds were uncomfortable (too short and had a moulding that jutted out making it uncomfortable to rest my head against). They use the newer sensor activated dispensers for the mini bar which means that if you pick up any item to look at it - bingo - you are now charged for it and you have to tell the front desk to remove the charge...annoying. The Bad: The hotel is surprisingly worn for a Westin. The elevators look like they are from the 1970's not to mention pretty beat up and worn (the door had dents in it and the walls were scratched), my alarm clock was filthy, the TV in the room had a poor picture on most channels, tile in the bathroom was really worn. I didn't get a renovated room, so my experience would have been better if I did, however the elevators and common areas are still pretty worn.

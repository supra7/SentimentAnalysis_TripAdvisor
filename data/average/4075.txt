Cleanliness: As with most Marriott properties that I have stayed at, this is a very clean hotel. Considering the renovations going on, the hotel was kept in great shape and dust free. Our room was generally clean overall and no problems there. Location: One of the best locations and centrally located to put you in the middle of everything to do in Boston. Within a short walk to Fenway Park, a few steps to the Duck Tour pickup, and easy access to subway system which will take you anywhere thoughough the city. You can take a short walk and pick up the freedom trail or just lounge around Boston Common...about 10-15 minute walk. Service: Didn't utilize service other than check-in/check-out but they were relatively efficient; no problems with the staff. Rooms;Value: We expect more for a $250-$300 / night hotel. There are more amenities in small mom and pop hotels than this one offered. No in-room refridgerator. I had to go down a floor just to get ice. Our room was next to the elevator and we could hear the elevator going up and down all night. Instead of two queen-sized beds, they have two regular beds, which is cramped for two average sized people. There was no internet access unless you want to pay an additional $12.95/day. If I don't get internet, then what does my $300 cover??

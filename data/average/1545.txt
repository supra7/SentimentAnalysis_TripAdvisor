We recently visited the East Houston Hotel for a stay of 3 nights.The location is great; great shopping, great restaurants (kanoyama!) and great bars (Mocha on 2nd Av, great for breakfast) within walking distance. The people at the reception are also very very nice and helpful. Our room (303) wasn't big but very nicely decorated. Good shower (always important) and free wifi. The main problem with the room was the location in the building. It was pointed directly at East Houston street. This is a very VERY busy street and the reasonable good isolated windows only stopt some of the noise. There is a constant noise of cars honking, trucks, people going out, etc. Maybe some of the other rooms don't have this problem, but the hotel was fully booked so a different room was no option. We paid around $320 per night. Maybe next time we'll be staying at the Thompson LES (around the corner on Allen Street) again, same price and much more quiet.

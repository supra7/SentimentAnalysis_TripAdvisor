I stayed at the Edgewater on the recommendation of a friend. I loved the location, the rustic feel to the lobby and the views; A nice change of scenery from my East Coast stomping grounds. My room was clean and charming, alebit a bit dated and I didn't really understand the Teddy Bear thing until I asked-- at first I thought a serial killer loomed behind the bathroom door! Service was also excellent. Concierge assisted with a few different requests and the people were very friendly. My only real complaint relates to value. My room was roughly $300 with breakfast and tax, which is a hefty price by most standards. I asked for a King and instead received 2 doubles with a "partial view." Described as an upgrade, it was really a view of the loading dock next door. Cramped and not the top of the line, which I noticed peering into other rooms the next morning during housekeeping. For $300, I had hoped for more. My recommendation is to either do a bit better with the pricing or ask for one of the cream of the crop rooms. That said, I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast - probably the best "hotel" breakfast I've ever had anywhere, hands down.

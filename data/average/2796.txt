We booked a room here for the first two nights of our honeymoon before our cruise left out of New Orleans and we were a little surprised at what we received for our money. First of all the room we booked was SMALL. It had one queen bed, an itty bitty bathroom, a desk, mini fridge and closet, all shoved into a really tight space. I felt like while we were in the room, there was no privacy for either of us, whether we wanted it or not. The view from the room was the top of a shorter side of the hotel which was quite honestly gross to look at. When we walked into the room it was hot, the air had not been running at all. The next morning when we woke up (at about 7am) there was absolutely no hot water. For us, it really wasn't a huge deal since we weren't planning on leaving to see the city yet, but it was a work day and there were business men staying in the hotel as well. They clearly did not get a hot shower that morning - I'm sure they didn't leave happy! We aren't sure if the hot water is a typical problem for them or not, but just beware! They had it fixed and HOT within 2-3 hours, but the whole ordeal was a pain. The included breakfast is nothing to get excited about...but at least it was something! Parking is in the lot across the street...I think it was $14/day (self-park in a lot just for Clarion guests). Felt safe leaving our car there. This hotel is a few blocks down from Bourbon St (a very short walk)...overall felt like it was a safe area and we had no problems at all.

I am someone who stays as Hilton Hotels nearly 20 times per year. Most are very high quality and great value for cost. The Hilton Seattle Hotel appears to be a bit substandard. First the entrance lobby is very ugly. Second the breakfast dining area on the top floor is gray brown and the breakfast is something like a Hampton Inn. The rooms are very nice. The common areas are the problem confined and gray- brown. They should make some improvements to bring it up to the Hilton standard I agree with many of the comments below that it is in need of a rennovation

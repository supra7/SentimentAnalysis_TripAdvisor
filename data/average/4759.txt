The Omni is a nice hotel, but our room was VERY noisy! We paid extra for a corner room - pretty room, but definately not worth the extra money. We were on the 20th floor and had a nice view on 1 side of the room (facing Michigan Ave), but the other 2 windows just looked at a building that was NOT exciting at all. The big TV and DVD player were in the "living room" of the 2 room suite, the TV in the bedroom (the only one we watched) was very tiny and old with a "sticky" remote. WARNING - if you are staying at the Omni, do NOT get a room anywhere near Michigan Ave!!! Ambulances and fire trucks run up Michigan Ave with their sirens blaring about every 20 minutes ALL DAY AND NIGHT! Even on the 20th floor we couldn't sleep because of the constant sirens - we were up most of the night and finally gave up at 5:00 am (the taxi drivers also started blaring their horns around 6:00 AM). We've never stayed in Chicago before, but after taking very long walks and checking out the area, we definately would have looked into staying at some other hotels that looked much newer and were in seemingly quieter areas (not on Michigan Ave). The staff at the Omni was very friendly and extended our check-out until 2:00 PM so that we didn't have to check out before we had to leave for the airport - we really appreciated that! The stay was "OK," but we've stayed at other hotels in other cities for less money that were much more comfortable and spacious (and had a better room service menu - $15 for a bagel and coffee - NOT!).

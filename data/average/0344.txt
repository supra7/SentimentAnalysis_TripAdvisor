The Executive Pacific is well placed in the centre of Seattle. Prices are reasonable for downtown, but the facilities are poor. While the hotel is clean, rooms are quite small, and apart from wireless internet, there isn't much that stands out. Desk staff don't seem particularly enthusiastic about their work, and the hotel is a little old fashioned in places (bathrooms for example). But given the good location, the Executive is not a bad choice if you are only looking for somewhere to lay your head down.

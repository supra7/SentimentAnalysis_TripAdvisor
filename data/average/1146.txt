My family (2 adults and 2 11yr olds) took an overnight trip to Seattle to kick off Spring Break. We got a great rate on the room that included parking too ($120/weekend night)! The location is excellent-walking distance to downtown shopping, Pike Place market, etc. The staff was very attentive and the place was clean. The decor was very artistic and interesting. My shock was the size of the rooms...even more so was the minute bathroom. I'm not a large person and it was tough to move around, get dressed ,etc in there. In fact, I didn't think it was possible, but it reminded me of an airline bathroom! Also, the elevators were very small and slow. It seemed like +50% of the time when we were waiting for the elevator, the door would finally open and it would be a staff member w/ a laundry cart or other large piece of equiment. Not one of us could fit in the elevator w/ the staff member and we'd have to wait another couple of minutes for it to return (hopefully w/o any people so that we could fit in there!). I would definitely not bring kids to the hotel as the rooms are just too small.

The room was nice but the location wasn't the best. It was right next to the freeway so you had the constant noise of traffic since our room was on that side of the building. Next time we are in Seattle we will book something a little closer to all of the sights. It was quite a walk to go to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market (which was down a very steep hill). Our room was very clean and comfortable. Parking is pretty expensive so be prepared for that. Not a lot of restaruants are within walking distance of the hotel which is bad if you do not have a car.

We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and have to say that it was quite unremarkable as a hotel. The service was poor at best with sullan and unhelpfull staff. Avoid using the minibar and go to the mini supermarket on the corner of the road (1 minute away) and get all your comforts, waters etc. as you will be gauged if you use the minibar. The only positive for this hotel is the location, far enough from Taksim square to not have the noise but close enough to make it a walkable distance. I noticed the rack rates on display where 450 per night!!!! if I had paid that much per night for my stay I would now be crying... I was told all the rooms came with a queen bed and a single bed. Although I have ticked that I would not recommend this hotel to a friend if I got a really good price I would stay here again, knowing that I could not expect a good level of service. It would be based on price and location only.

Great location, and worthy of a stay based on the history of the hotel alone. But whatever you pay, add about 3/4 of the price to your expected daily bill. Parking (self, not valet) is half the price. Internet is another daily fee. I needed to use the business center, and was nailed for another $5 to figure out their internet wasn't working. No service for that and the front desk was too busy. Maybe good thing -- if I could have accessed my document and printed it the charge would have been over $20. So, not saying these charges only occur at the Palmer House, just that you need to be fully informed and expect nothing but a nice room, great location and historic ambiance. You will be bled dry for everything else. This is important to know because the hotel is a frequent Priceline and Hotwire seller, and if you go that route, the price you pay isn't nearly as attractive as many other comparable area hotels when you get to an apples to apples comparison. Other issues: Front desk staff less than helpful. Hot tub not working. No Queen beds, when you get two beds you get doubles. All in all, though, the inherent positives of the property itself make the visit average, if much more pricey than it would appear at face value.

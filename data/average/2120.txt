We spent 4 nights in this hotel and I would not go back... The nice things about this hotel are the location (quite central and located in quite area but next to lots of restaurants and the night life) & the interior of the hotel that is simply stylish and very nicely decorated... What really was disappointing was the room... you could barely walk in there... there's hardly the space for the luggage... you better travel light!!! People complains about London room sizes but I never slept in something that small.... I felt claustrophobic in there! Also... the breakfast was another bad experience... there wasn't enough cutlery for everybody and you had to beg to get some coffee from the waiters... Bad experience in my opinion but maybe it was just the wrong room...

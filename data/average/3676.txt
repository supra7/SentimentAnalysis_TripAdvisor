We recently got a rate of $66.00 per night through hotwire, and stayed 2 nights. The hotel lobby was a bit outdated, but the rooms were very nice. The had all of the amentites of a 4 star hotel, but, the overall feel was about a 3 and 1/2. The location was excellent, right off of the tollway, just north of the Galleria. For the same price, I would stay at this property again. You can barely get a Motel 6 in Dallas, Tx for $66.00. Had I paid the rack rate of $189 and up, I would not have been pleased.

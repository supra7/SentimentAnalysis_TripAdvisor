The corner suite on the 16th floor was beautiful. The problem was freeway noise that went on all night long. Even on the 16th floor with the air conditioner running, it could not be drowned out. I asked to be moved to the west side of the hotel which faces Puget Sound, but those rooms are saved for Marriott Gold and Platinum elite Rewards members. Unless, you are elite, stay elsewhere. If you are elite, then stay here. Fitness room is very nice and corner lounge on the top floor (28th) is beautiful. As a business traveler, I do not like having to pay for basic business services such as internet to check email and print jobs.

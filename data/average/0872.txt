Comfortable rooms with Very Nice Views of Seattle space needle. Heavenly bed was good, but could use newer bedding. The rooms were a bit small, but comfortable. The Heavenly Shower was Great! 2 Thumbs up for the Double Shower heads. The bathroom was a bit small, felt tight. You had to move out of the way to open the door. Nice Central Location. Pacific Place, Pike Market, are all nearby. An Easy monorail ride to the Space Needle as well. Got a great deal from hotwire at $89. Plus got an upgrade to a Space Needle View Room. A really great deal. But next time, i'd rather book early and find the hotel i really want. (and not random from hotwire), All in all a good stay.

I was very excited to be staying at the Trump for my working visit to Vegas. What was really appealing was that it's a non-gaming hotel. First, there is no shuttle to and from the hotel, you have to take a cab or rent a car. Second the dining flows out to the lobby area so when you are sitting at breakfast every time the doors open...the cold air hits you in the face and cooled off our $50 breakfast pretty quick...suggest you insist to eating in the separate dining room beyond the foyer. My daughter flew in to get her bridal portaits done by a photographer that was traveling with her she immediately got off the plane and went directly to the salon..after getting the bags settled into the room; I went to meet her at the salon...the place was empty and the hairdresser was WASHING her hair. The result was curls that did not stay...so I returned to the salon and they didn't have any hairspray for me to buy so I could do her hair on our own. I did get some from the concierge (she had some of everything)..I was very grateful for the hotel for that ability. We had adjoining suites with the photographers and they were very nice. Full kitchens (pot and pan provided) but with only one place setting...thought their should be two. The elevator is the second fastest in the city...never had to wait more than a minute. Would I book there again? No.

I felt as though the price didn't reflect the accomodations. The service was good-to-great, and the hotel was very clean ... but for the amount of money you're putting down it just didn't seem that schnazy. I think you're paying for location more than anything. The internal restaurant was over priced, and the food was average. If I were to go back, I wouldn't stay here. And the fitness center was poor. And the charge for internet was overly priced. ... I did like the chocolates at the end of the day though!

Stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early Jan 2007 for 2 nights with my husband. We arrived at the hotel at the time advised to hotel by our travel agent to be greeted in a very unfriendly manner by the receptionist. We had pre-paid for rooms but there was a tense moment when apparently no free rooms could be found; this apparently was our fault as "all the other guests have checked in"???!! Anyway, we were allocated a room but it was not really of the standard I was anticipating - very small and musty smelling (probably not a room that's used often) with a view of the internal courtyard. I imagine we would have got a better room if booked direct with hotel. Facilities in the room are okay - nice toiletries, tea and coffee facilities (though these were not replaced during our stay) and minibar (water was $3 though I think! Usually free now in most good hotels...) Aside from teh receptionist, other staff encountered were very friendly and exceptionally helpful - as were the locals in general! The hotel has a reputation for its beautiful lobby and it certainly lives up to that particular expectation. It's also reputed to be the longest operating hotel in the US... it's starting to show its age in some aspects!! The location is good however (though not as lively as hotels located around Michigan Avenue); reasonably close to Monroe El stop (we came from airport by train as it's so cheap - only $2!) and within walking distance of the Art Institute and Millennium Park. Chicago is a fantastic city - I loved it and will definitely return sooner rather than later, but I'll be looking for a different hotel!

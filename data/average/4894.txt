I thought that this hotel was OK, and do not recommend it to anyone who wishes to stay here. For one thing when you first walk in it looks amazing and grand, but really everything in there that looks like it's a real antique is just a piece of plastic with some faded paint on it. The service was average and the man who checked us in didn't seem to care that we wanted our room key. All he was doing was slacking off with his co-worker having a good old time completely ignoring my family and I. But overall the service was average. The rooms were very, very small. Not even my family of four could fit in the so called "queen beds". My poor son and I had to take turns to sleep on the floor. That was very inconvenient. We stayed on the Executive Floor which was pretty nice to have continental breakfast in the morning, but sadly the breakfast was not that great, so don't expect much of it. The staff working in there were rude as my son told me there wasn't anymore cereal left, the lady handling the food told him in an irritated voice that "SHE'S WORKIN' ON IT". Both of my children are very well mannered and surprised that the lady was so mad. The location was good and bad; the good thing about it was that it was only one block away from Michigan Avenue, and Millennium Park. The bad thing about the location was that it was located in an alley with a train right above the sidewalk that was very noisy. You could also smell sewage while walking down the street, so it felt like I had to walk to through the slums just to get to the nice part of town. Overall my stay was not the best, so I recommend you DO NOT stay here.

The people at the front desk are really nice. The hotel is all decked out reflecting the old charm of Hawaii. Luckily we had a room facing the main area of the hotel (courtyard/pool area) with an open air hallway (RM 453) because in going to the elevators you could see the other part of the hotel which looks older and darker. The hallway is enclosed and smelled a bit musty so I was happy we weren't staying in that section. The hotel could use some updating but we still had a great time. It has the BEST BEACH in Kaanapali although you need to rent the cabanas & umbrellas. We rented a cabana twice and it is so worth it if you want to hang out on the beach all day comfortably. ($30 allday) I loved the food at the Tiki Grill by the bar !! The bar is fun if Dale is there, the other bartender is slow and not very friendly. The drinks are good but expensive unless you drink the special of the day choice. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast using the hotel food voucher. I thought it was expensive since we still wound up spending another 20 bucks each morning beyond our voucher ?!? Luckily the food was good. The Whaler's Village is right next door and has a bunch of restaurants and shops to go to so it was a very convenient location for us. We didn't participate in any of the hotel activities except the leaving ceremony where they give you a lei and sing a Hawaiian song which was nice.

The inn is billed as a boutique hotel, however the room lacked charm. It was so generic, it felt like we were at a Holiday Inn (but for $300+ a night). It would be so easy for the hotel to add a few prints of the Public Market or original paintings sold at Pike Place...something that had to do with Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. Our room had a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. The Tempur Pedic bed was very comfortable, however the sales brochures for the mattress in the nightstand was a big turn-off. The bathroom was very large and stocked with top notch products. The front lobby and housekeeping staff were very helpful and room service arrived in record speed.

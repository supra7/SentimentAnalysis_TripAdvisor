The hotel room is so very dark - it is the hotel's style but we found it depressing. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space for clothes. The bar is located in space normally a corridor, quite off-putting. The bar furniture is very tired, I wouldn't want to entertain there. The restaurant although highly rated and award winning was very quiet, we didn't try it as it was expensive and there is so much choice nearby at more affordable rates; including a Starbucks across the road for breakfast. The hotel staff were helpful and polite at all times. I feel sure for there are better choices in Downtown Seattle.

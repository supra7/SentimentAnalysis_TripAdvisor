This is exactly the sort of hotel that I love to stay in when I'm traveling for business - old world charm, attention-to-detail services, unique decor. But there was a persistent mustiness, a near-nursing-home odor to my room and the entire 5th floor that overpowered my otherwise complete sensory enjoyment of the experience. The staff is lovely. The room was beautifully appointed. The food in the restaurant was delicious. But olfactorily speaking, it was a bit of a stinker.

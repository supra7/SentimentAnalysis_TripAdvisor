I stayed at this boutique hotel recently and at first was very impressed with the hotel and the room. The hotel was clean and had a nice, classic feel to it. It was classic but not run down. The room was a decent size and well appointed. The bathroom was lined with marble and was clean and modern. The room was not without it's problems though. Half the outlets were lose and didn't hold the plug in the socket well. My Blackberry and laptop chargers were constantly slipping out of the outlets. This problem also plagued their own lamps. The TV didn't work at first and required servicing by the technician before it would turn on. The furnace in the room didn't work either and had the technician in and out of my room all afternoon until it was partially resolved. The heat would work but I was instructed not to adjust the temperature up or down because it could cause the heater to malfunction again. While the bathroom looked and felt nice, the shower was another story. There was no threshold between the shower and the floor for the bathroom so I had to use most of the towels to build a makeshift dike to keep from flooding the rest of the bathroom. The shower enclosure was built with glass but they never installed a shower door so the glass juts out of the wall enclosing about 70% of the shower but then there's this big opening between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. Very bizarre and poorly designed. The hotel's restaurant is prohibitively expensive and if you order anything up to the room, you are charged an annoying service fee. You're better off going to a nearby restaurant or just ordering food from an outside option. If you can score a good price for this hotel (i.e. through Priceline) then it's definitely worth staying here. It's not worth it if you're paying regular price. Prior to this trip, I've stayed at the Back Bay Hotel and the Lenox Hotel and dollar for dollar, those are much better options.

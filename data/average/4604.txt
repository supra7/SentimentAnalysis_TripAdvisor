I stayed here with my girlfriend on Sat. night Sept.3, 2011. She was in town to bring her son to college. I have stayed at 5-6 different hotels in Boston, but never at the Copley Plaza. It always was too expensive. I will admit my friend did pay for the room. First off the Lobby in pictures looks beautiful, but is worn in real life. there is not enough seating and the couches are terribly uncomfortable. I had to wait for my girlfriend to arrive and did not find the lobby comfortable at all. The conceirge was very accomodating as I did leave my luggage as i strolled around the city. The room was ok. I though it was kind of small. We were on the 4th floor GOLD Concierge level. I thought the gold chandelier above the bed was tacky. Bathroom was samll. Hair dryer looked like it was from 1980. Waited 1/2 hour for shampoo to be delivered to the room because there was non left in the room. I wanted to write this review just to let people know that for the money, not worth it. I have stayed at the Fairmont Battery Wharf in Boston and that is well worth the money. Waterfront location, smaller more intimate hotel. Rooms are better.

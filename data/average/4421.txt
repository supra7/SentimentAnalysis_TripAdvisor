Arrived at hotel on Friday and was greeted by doorman who took bags to room. The front desk upgraded us to a suite, however, don't be fooled as there are more suites in the hotel than deluxe rooms. First impressions of the room were nice, the view however couldn't have been any worse. Opening the dark curtains revealed a wonderful view of an alley full of dumpsters and trash. The mini fridge was cool at best and full of outrageously priced items. The living room featured a love seat and half couch with a small tv. There was also a desk with computer which had links to local attractions but it kept saying invalid login requiring a call to the front desk to reboot. The bedroom featured a king size bed but you'd be better off sleeping on the floor as it would be more comfortable. The bathroom seemed like an afterthought in our room as it was tiny, had no tub, and no counter space. Cheap towels finish off the bathroom. No matter how much we cranked up the AC the room remained warm. The people at the front desk were useless, rude, and barely spoke English. Overall I'm not sure how this hotel gets away with calling itself a luxury hotel. I've stayed in nicer Marriotts.

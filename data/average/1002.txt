I recently stayed at the hotel for the recent Picasso exhibit at the SAM. The hotel is in a good location across from the library. For $8 I upgraded my room to a corner room with couch/sitting area. Its not luxurious, but for the total price of $160 found it was reasonably priced for the location. The bathroom is a little small, but all in all was a good value. Downside: Cost of valet parking was too high.

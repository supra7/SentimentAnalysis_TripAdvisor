We stayed here June29/30, 2007. At first we were offered a room on the 12th floor, but asked for a higher one. This was then 'bettered' by a room on the 14th floor. I asked the lady if it had a good view of the city and she said it should. Needless to say, we were looking straight at the side of the other hotel beside it... although it did have some impressive gargoyles on it's structure..lol Double bed room was quite small compared to others we've stayed in. The carpet (I couldn't help but notice) was quite worn and the a/c was loud. Luckily it was at the w/e, so there wasn't much traffic noise to deal with but you could still hear it (I used my earplugs this weekend). For $89, it was nothing to complain about and we aren't the type of travellers who spend the whole time in the room. Although we were in the downtown area (note: majority of stores, cafes, etc. within a short distance are closed), walking to the other tourist areas was easy, eg, 6th Floor Museum, JFK Memorial, Deep Ellum, Uptown (with its vast array of restaurants/cafes). Next time, we'll try a different location/hotel. Not too impressed with this Magnolia.

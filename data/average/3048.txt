I was on a solo trip to Rome to unwind and explore... for the first time. Found this hotel to be fairly basic, but clean enough. It was expensive I thought for what it was, but you're paying for the central location. Was glad I was solo as my double room was pretty small. Also, wi fi in the room was out of order for the whole time I was there with little effort to do anything about it. The staff in the lobby were professional but not really that friendly. They weren't trying at all, one got the sense, but then does anyone need to pull out the stops in Rome! In conclusion, it's a good base, to explore from and has okay places to eat out nearby if you're taking a break on your own, but it's a base, not something at all to languish in.

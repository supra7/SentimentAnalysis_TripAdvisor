The Burnham is a lovely smaller hotel in an historic buliding right smack-bang in the middle of Chicago, great for shopping (right across the road from Marshall Fields) and access to the theatres. You can't beat the location, and the staff were friendly and attentive. My room was tiny (as you would expect from the location) but very well appointed and all the furnishings were extremely comfortable. Unfortunately at the time I was staying there they were ripping up State Street, so Taxi access was difficult and the subway station at State and Washington is closed for much of this year. It also took ten minutes to diagonally cross the road to get to Marshall Fields due to the roadworks - not the hotel's fault. On the whole a very pleasant stay all round.

The Maui Eldorado is in a GREAT Location and many of the units have been very nicely upgraded. The thing that bugged me was that the services promised such as great concierge service are practically non existent Front desk peoplr are very nice but the desk is severely understaffed. The grounds were once beautiful but now seem to be in need of expert care and god forbid you should try to barbacue by the large pool. The barbacues are so old nd under maintained that I would not cook food for my dog on any of them!.Not to mention that they are almost impossible to light. Too bad , because many of the owners have done a marvelous job at upgrading their units

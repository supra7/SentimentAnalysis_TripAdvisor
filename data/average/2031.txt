first stayed in room 100 but noise level high as next to kitchen so shifted, but this is the biggest room in the motel. Shifted to second floor, noise level lower, be advised staff only mop the toilet and as ventilation is poor, you'll be hit by strong pong of urine smell. Also as price is low you'll get a lot of school groups staying and teenagers do make a bit of noise. there are no road signs on the roads outside the metro nor maps inside the metro, make sure you check out the hotel map before setting off. once you leave the metro gates, take the right side steps heading up. ahead of you is the mini bus station. walk all the way to the traffic light. cross the light and walk 50m pass the car rental place. after tat you'll see the motel which is hidden behind an apartment block.

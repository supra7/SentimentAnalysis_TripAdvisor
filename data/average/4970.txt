Fabulous Location near Millenium Park and State Street shopping. Stayed here twice for business. First time, my room was a "closet" - the bathroom , closet and the room were so small I barely had room for my suitcase. There was no counter space in the bathroom. 2 people would not have fit in that room. For my last visit, I specially asked for a room NOT like my last stay and bigger than a closet. My room during my latest visit was perfectly fine with 2 beds, nice closet. The bathrooms were still small, but at least there was counter space. It's a dice roll on what kind of room you'll get. Be specific on your request. There are many closet sized rooms in the inventory. Common areas are very beautiful, but the layout of the lobby is awkward. Check in is on the second floor. The proximity to the El can bother light sleepers as I could hear the trains. Convenient to Corner Bakery on same block. CVS across the street. State street shopping around the corner. Rooms were pricey. I would stay here again only if I received a better deal than a Mag Mile hotel. I would prefer to stay on Michigan Ave for the same price.

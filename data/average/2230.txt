My wife and I just got back from a three day stay at the Trump Las Vegas. While the hotel suite is beautiful and well worth the 5 star rating, we could not believe the overall poor service we received. We chose to stay at the Trump after a two week trip to Alaska and we were looking to relax and recharge our batteries. We arrived with several bags, the valet did not assist us in unloading the car - there was no bell hop present and no door man so we basically had to handle all of our luggage without anyone even raising an eye to offer to call for assistance. During the check in process, the hotel clerk loudly announced that since we booked our reservation through priceline.com we would be receiving the lowest quality suite grade in their hotel. He was clearly grandstanding as we caught startled glances from the couple checking in besides us. This was completely unnecessary. The suites are great and contain every amenity possible, but it was hard for us to ignore the poor service we received. Even after our check in experience we tried to keep an open mind, but the staff had an air of arrogance with the exception of the valet staff (minus our initial check in). There was never a door man present (occasionally the valets would open the door if they were available). We have stayed at all the other 5 star hotels in Las Vegas and we received far superior treatment in each of them. Also, for those not very familiar with vegas - the Trump does not have a casino and is located slightly off the strip by the wynn hotel and the fashion mall so it is not as accessible as most of the other hotels.

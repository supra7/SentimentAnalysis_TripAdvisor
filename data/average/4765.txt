The best part of my stay at the Omni (for a conference held at the hotel) was by far the hotel staff: the front desk clerks were cheerful and efficient, the concierge pleasant and helpful, and the housekeepers responsive to requests. On the other hand, the Omni is both the noisiest and dustiest hotel I have ever stayed in. It apparently is located directly on the hospital route...ambulances screamed by at all hours of the day and night. One night there was a weird drumming (I am was on the 11th floor) that lasted about 90 minutes; during the day there was lots of drilling noise, which presumably will go away once the reno is finished. The upside of the noise was that it provided unexpected entertainment--sitting on the toilet, with a vent directly above, it is possible to hear every single word of the conversations taking place in an adjacent room. An eavesdropper's delight! Aside from the noise, the hotel was dusty--everywhere. In my room; in the conference meetings room; the the bar; in the business center--in short, every facility I used at this hotel needed a thorough cleaning. When I checked into my room, I opened the curtain behind the bed, and to my disgust, it seemed as if every previous tenant of the room had left his or her hand, nose or lip print on the window. It was so gross I asked housekeeping to clean it up--which to their credit they did promptly. What others have said about the weird layout of the rooms was true for me, although it was not a major inconvenience or distraction. It did seem odd, though, that there was no light switch in the bathroom adjacent to the entry door from the bedroom side of the suite. The location of this hotel is superb, and it's fine for what it is--a fair-to-middlin' hotel. It is not four-star and it is not luxe, but it gets the job done.

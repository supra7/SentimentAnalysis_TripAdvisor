The staff at the Trump greeted me with a cryptic, sleazy form containing a "resort fee" and refused to give me accommodation without paying this fee. Since I paid for my room in advance I was not impressed with the Donald's business ethics. Otherwise, it's not a terrible hotel. It's just very hard to get over that awful first impression.

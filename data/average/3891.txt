We booked this hotel on hotels.com for 84 per night knowing it was expensive for Orlando out of season however after reading the reviews on tripadvisor figured it was worth the extra. The location is perfect just off International Drive and minutes from Universal Studios however the rooms are mediocre and for us the worst part being the creaky, bad quality bed. As soon as we sat on the bed we knew it wasn't right - it was very creaky and dipped in the middle. It felt like we were on a noisy waterbed! We asked to be moved but as the hotel was full the lady on reception offered to send up the maintenance man to repair it. He admitted the beds were cheap and poor quaity - in fact they were two single beds fixed together and the whole thing looked very bad. Someone had broken the wooden slat which explained the dip and feeling of being on a waterbed! As the maintenace men struggled to repair the bed we were allocated a room across the hall which although the bed wasn't broken was equally uncomfortable and squishy. The bottom line is the beds are cheap and not what you expect of a hotel of this standard. The carpets in the corridors were dirty and looked like they hadn't been vacummed for a long time. I think it would be better to forget the kitchenette (unnecessary in Orlando with the multitude of restaurants and food outlets) and invest in good quality beds. A fridge is always handy for drinks etc but the supersize microwave and sink seemed like a poor choice. The staff were friendly and courteous but our overall impression was that this is a minus 3* property trying to be a 4* and falling far short of the grade. Next time we will stay elsewhere as unless you get a very cheap deal here be prepared for a restless night in a very uncomfortable bed.

We stayed in Augusta Lucilla for two nights, and I must say I am a bit disappointed. The hotel itself is fine, but it definitely does not rise to 4 star standard. The room was very small - it was really difficult to move between bed and wardrobe.. The service was very average. I have ordered a bucket of ice to the room twice. Once I got it immediately, once I was given a small bowl with ice and I have been told that next time I need to pay for that.. Also no iron or laundry services available - a bit low standard for this price and supposed quality of 4 star hotel. Not mentioning the breakfast served in the morning. The worst coffee I ever had in Rome or Italy...Overall the stay was OK, the location of this hotel is an advantage, but the rest is disappointing.

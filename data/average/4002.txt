This is not a bad hotel, but not great either. The good points about this hotel are: its location, at the quiet end of a mostly pedestrianised area off Taksim square; the overall design and decor is modern and works well; the breakfast offers a great range of food; overall the staff are friendly and try to be helpful. What lets it down is the details you don't see on the internet, which make it less than a 4 star in my opinion: very poor soundproofing between rooms (if you enjoy listening to your neighbors talking, hanging up their clothes, moving their furniture around and their crying baby this is the place for you!); the quality of bed linen and towels is poor - sheets thin and torn, basic towels; the aircon worked but only on a very cold, high fan setting; the tea, coffee and water in the room are not replaced after the first night, even if you happen to be there for several days; there is no concierge or information service (for example, the front desk "guest relations" personnel seemed to be unaware of the Istanbul Modern art museum just down the hill at Tophane or the Istanbul Biennal, which was on when I was there). There are a number of hotels of a similar rating in this area, superficially this one looks the best and is relatively expensive, next time I would try another.

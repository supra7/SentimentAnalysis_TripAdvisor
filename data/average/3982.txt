This hotel is located in the red light district but away from the main street so you don't actually hear the hustle and bustle. My husband and I had a pleasant, quiet stay in this hotel for 5 days. The staff are very friendly especially the one at the reception. He really made us feel very welcome and like old friends, not just guests. We stayed at the 8th floor and there was daily cleaning of the room if you request. They won't clean if you don't request which is not a problem because we just had to tell the reception to clean our room every time we go out in the morning. The room is old but clean and comfortable. So if you just want a cheap comfortable stay in Singapore with very welcoming staff, consider this hotel. The location is also excellent as it is near a bus stop and 2 train stations. There are lots of nearby eating places to choose from and there is a mini grocery across the road which is open 24 hrs.

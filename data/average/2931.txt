I have stayed at 8 of the more than dozen motels located at this exit (Sycamore View). My stays have ranged from the pathetic (Red Roof Inn) to the superior (Drury Inn). The Comfort Inn was an above average experience for me on this multi-night stay. A significant discount on this chain prompted me to make a reservation on a "newer" room. The newer features included comfortable bedding/linens, carpet, most furnishings and a bathroom renovation. It was very clean (I check everything!) and odor free. The negatives included a broken window seal (fogged/etched insulated glass), a 20 year old 20" Zenith TV with the inability to hold color, a bad back-up battery that allowed the smoke detector to continously beep when the power failed for 5 hours, a bad shower assembly mixer cartridge that leaked hot water to the rate of about a gallon per hour, peeling wall paper above the tub (I've never seen wallpaper in any bathroom that stays adhered above a tub) and finally I was surprised with a safe fee that I didn't realize was even in the room ($6 stealth fee!). The breakfast had a good selection, was well laid out and was tasty. The coffee, both in the lobby and in the room, was surprisingly very good. I encountered no safety incidents during my visit. Overall, this was a decent experience for me...I've had much worse and I've had better. With a good rate, I would recommend this location.

After reading reviews we booked this hotel expecting to get something really special. We had a room with a view of a blank wall - not what I was expecting. No sign of chocolates or anything "extra" in the room. It was comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Although we enjoyed the wine hour the "snacks" were taken by the first people there and not replaced. The "Living Room" looks good but was short of comfortable seats for sitting reading the papers. Sunday Brunch in the Southwater Kitchen was excellent and dinner was good but breakfast the following morning was quite disappointing. The location is ideal for exploring the area and if we return to Chicago we may well stay there again. However, we wouldn't be expecting anything out of the ordinary.

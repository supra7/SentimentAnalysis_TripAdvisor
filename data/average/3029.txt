Positives were cleanliness, large and spacious rooms & location. Negatives are no breakfast included in the already expensive room rate, nor was wi-fi included (had to pay 3/hour). Also, very cold & unhelpful staff. No positive vibes coming from them. When asked to have a double bed instead of 2 singles, got a sarcastic reception...and a blunt no.

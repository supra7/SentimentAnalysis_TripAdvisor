On a whole our stay at the Warwick was pretty nice. I think the best part of the hotel is the location (walking distance to most attractions downtown) and the fact that they are a little cheaper than most other hotels in the area. If you go, don't expect a large fancy hotel. Request a high floor (7th or higher) for a view. The food and room service aren't really that great but there are some eating options that are very close.

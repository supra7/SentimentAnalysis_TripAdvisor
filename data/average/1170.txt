My boyfriend and I were so excited about our trip to seattle and really looked forward to staying at this hotel -- the website and photos looked awesome and there were great reviews. However, we weren't impressed. Right when we entered our room, we noticed there was a big stain on the window (looked like someone threw an egg a while ago and nobody cleaned it so it just dried). The King bed was nice, but there was absolutely no space in the room for other stuff like luggage! My pillow also had a funny smell. The closet was so cramped you can barely hang clothes - I had to hang stuff sideways! Also, there is no parking, unless you valet for $25 a day. So we parked across the street in an outdoor public parking lot for $17. For almost U$200 a night, I'd expect at least some water bottles, turndown, or something else, but nothing really impressed us other than the neat interior decor (but cheaply constructed)! We'd definitely stay elsewhere next time.

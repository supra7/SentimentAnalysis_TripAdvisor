We lived at the KBH for 7 nights during our honeymoon to Hawaii and we were generlally satisfied with our stay. The hotel's location is stunning, just by the famous Ka'anapali Beach and close to the beautiful but ridiculously over-crowded snorkle spot by the Black Rock. The hotel buildings were a lot less personal and inviting than we'd thought and are very much in need of a renovation. The tiny whale-shaped pool might have been impressing in the 60's but for today's standars simply to small and also a little dirty. We only swam there once. The hotel garden, however, was large, well groomed and really inviting with plenty of place either in the sun or in the shade. In comparison to the other artificially landscaped hotels neighbouring the KBH, this was a real treat. The staff was alright, but we didn't notice that much of their self-proclaimed "aloha spirit." In our opinion, the most aloha-spirit is to be found at the Outrigger Reef on the Beach in Waikiki. We'd paid extra for breakfast buffet which was meagre at the best. We advice future travelers to save their money for the hotel breakfast and instead have breakfast either in Waling village which is just around the corner, or drive to Lahaina. The hotel charged us $10 a day for internet access (no WiFi), $9 a day for parking and $1.50 for using the safe (!?). The room was old but serving its purpose and the balcony was large enough and we had a really beautiful view. The best parts with this hotel is the garden, the Tiki Bar by the pool, and that it is relatively cheap compared to its huge neighbours. For people searching for luxury and comfort, this is not the right place. Otherwise, you'll be fine here, though not great.

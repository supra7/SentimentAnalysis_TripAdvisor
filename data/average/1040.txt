I have stayed at this hotel many times. The room was nice, clean and the robes were fabulous. I did not like the gym which I used daily. The gym looked like it had not been cleaned in months. There were no bacterial wipes to clean off machines after use. It was very hot in the gym with no ceiling fans or good ventilation. Staff was great and very helpful. They messed up my bill and could not remedy it when I checked out because the person in charge was off on Saturday.

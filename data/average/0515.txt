The Sheraton is located right in the heart of downtown Seattle, close to shopping, restaurants and all the action. The rooms are very average - comfortable but not very big. Check in is at 3pm - so don't arrive early. Good rates are available through the hotel directly and through Starwood Hotels...but no matter how good your room rate - you will be dinged $45 per night for parking! This seems to be the going rate at downtown hotels.

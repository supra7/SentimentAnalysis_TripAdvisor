We stayed at the University Inn in Seattle for two nights. Upon arrival, you can park your car in the back where there is a big parking lot, but almost all places are taken all the time. You need to put a flyer on your dashboard to make clear you are a visitor staying at the hotel. When entering the room with two beds, it was almost immediately clear that the main problem with the room was the bathroom. It is very very small. To make things worse: the door opens to the bathtub with shower and right in front of you when you enter the bathroom is the toilet, so you have to get in, hardly have any space to close the door and get in the tub. We did not find this very comfortable at all. When going to the lobby to ask for another room, they were very friendly but told us they were fully booked and all rooms in that wing had the same layout. The only thing they could do was move us to the handicapped room, which had a big bathroom, but that could only be arranged for the second night of our stay. And so they did. Room was as big as the first one, but the bathroom was very big, like 4 times the size of the regular room. The rooms are very clean, but there is no special vibe. This could be any hotel anywhere in the world. Breakfast was OK. You can bake your own waffles, toast your muffins, get some cereal, yoghurt, fruit, ... I believe there was also an afternoon snack or drink, but we were out on the town, so missed that. OK hotel, but would not stay here again.

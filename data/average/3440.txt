I had only less than 12 hrs in Singapore and chose the Crowne Plaza for its location at the airport. I arrived tired late at night and wanted to sleep for a few hours. I woke up at 4 a.m. by a strange noise outside on the hallway. I first thought it is a fire alarm and heard people outside my room talking. I got up and realized eventually that it was an aircraft parked not far away who had the engine on for quite long. The windows are soundproofed but the noise was coming in from a gap under the door. The hotel itself is fine, stylish and I enjoyed a nice swimm in the pool early in the morning. You can walk from the gate to the hotel but I expected a restful night which I didn't get.

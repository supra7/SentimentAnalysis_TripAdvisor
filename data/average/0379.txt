I thought this was a decent hotel. I stayed here with my boyfriend for a weekend getaway. I used hot wire's hot rate for a downtown 4 star hotel, and this is what I got. I wouldn't pay full price for this hotel, but it was ok since I got a deal. I like that they provide Aveda toiletries. Parking is $30 per night and wifi is $13 per night. The pool and hot tub are nothing special, the gets in the hot tub are poorly placed and not very soothing. It is literally right off the highway, I did not notice noise because my room was not on that side of the hotel, but i have heard of others complaining of the noise. It is close enough for younger people to walk to the attractions downtown (we are in our 20s), but it you can't handle hills, then you may want to drive to your attractions. The only reason that I gave this three stars rather than four or five stars is because nothing really WOW-ed me with this stay.

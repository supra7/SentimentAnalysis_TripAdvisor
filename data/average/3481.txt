I was happy with Corner House as far as a budget option in London goes. While the staff were not particularly friendly the room was small but comfortable and the centre of London easy to access with a short bus trip to Camden Town station and then a couple of tube stops in to town. The continental breakfast was also quite good considering the price of the hotel. Beware of the long climb up the stairs though if you get one of the higher floors!

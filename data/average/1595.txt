Good convenient location for seeing everything that Barcelona has to offer. Overall the hotel is very modern but not very practical or comfortable, a lot of noise at night which was annoying, could hear doors opening and closing and people walking in corridor. Strange bathroom with glass door! Food in morning could have a better selection. Staff had good restaurant suggestions.

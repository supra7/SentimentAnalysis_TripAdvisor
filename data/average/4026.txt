Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by union members picketing the hotel for not using union labor to remodel the hotel, which is how we learned they are remodelling. No problem...we get angry when people try to influence businesses to make business decisions that go against basic business principles. But we really are here to review the hotel...and the main point is that this hotel, which we have stayed at a few times over several years, is starting to need some updating. It is still a comfortable hotel, better than the nearby Westin where we also stayed recently, but in some areas such as the bathrooms, the hotel is not up to current standards of quality. The rooms themselves are better, and one notable feature is the speed of the Internet connection...it was better than most chain hotels provide. We did not experience too much of the hotel's service on this trip, but the interactions we did have were all handled very professionally and to our satisfaction.

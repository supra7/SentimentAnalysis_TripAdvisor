Had a standard room for 4 nights (went to see Formula1 race). We choosed this hotel since we had a car and we needed parking in resounable price and quick exit to the high way. For this purpose the hotel was excelent. It is far from city center (5 subway stations, ~20minutes including walking from the hotel to the nearest subway station, 3 blocks). The hotel have good rooms, the breakfast is very basic.

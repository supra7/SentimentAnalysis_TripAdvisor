We booked into this hotel as we came through from Edinburgh on the train and was arriving at Kings Cross Station so needed somewhere close by to be able to just crash for a night before flying out the following day. Although the hotel is very new we enjoyed it here, although not here long enough to comment - but found the staff helpful and found out everything that we needed to know. I don't think I would be happy about paying extra money to store luggage as we were on an around the world trip that would of annoyed me (as per other comments) - but fortunately we did check in after 3pm so did not expierence this problem. Would stay here again, but only as a stop over, as rooms very small but then you have to expect that for London hotels unless paying big $$$$.

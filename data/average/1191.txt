I have stayed at the Roosevelt a few times and it is a hotel I like to recommend to people. Location is great and the price is usually a little lower than other hotels in the neighbourhood. HOWEVER, there is a bit of a catch. The hotel is dated, but clean and does not have that sad shabby feeling. Rooms are relatively small. This time I had a room smaller than I have ever seen in the US, it was a size of a London hotel room. Bathroom was a size of a closet. Anybody approaching 6 ft would have had major issues trying to get clean. But I did have a Sound view and with a location like that I was not planning to spend much time in my room. Most likely I will be back. However, if I were to share a room, I would make sure it is one of the larger ones (or should we say, less small) before signing on the dotted line.

We stayed at the Renaissance while in Seattle to move our son into the dorms at Seattle Pacific University. We booked the rooms on Priceline and were very happy with the rate for a hotel chain that has a reputation of quality rooms and great service. We were please with the service that we received from the staff, although i am annoyed when guests are not allowed to use a luggage cart (a number of carts were parked near the front door) and must use the services of a bell hop. We have two strong sons that are more than capable of managing our luggage, but instead we are required to tip a bell hop. I also found the parking prices to be ridiculous, even for Seattle...$28 per day. We have never paid even close to this amount for parking at a hotel, even in San Francisco and New York City. Charging $13 per day for internet access was the last straw. Our room was very nice, with comfortable bedding and a convenient charging station for electronics. One small room complaint...the bathroom doors are sliders that have no latch or lock.

This hotel is well located and walking distance from the exciting iksikal st and the nightlife of Taksim. Very Near the Tunel metro and vernicular. The place is a bit run down and the website suggests views and facilities that are not actually there. The pool on the website is a glamourous thing, not the hole filled with water in the basement with broken lights and water features that it actually is. The views and roof top restaurant suggested is not actually at the hotel, the curbside restaurant is now windowless inside the hotel. Someone did play the grand piano the other morning at breakfast. Staff are friendly and do try. The renovation is now rundown and grubby. needs a clean and to offer something with a view or feeling that one is there in exciting and fabulous Istanbul.

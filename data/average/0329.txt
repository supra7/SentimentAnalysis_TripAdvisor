You can't beat the price given the great downtown location - but this place is definitely more "motel 6' than 'executive'. They've tried hard to 'charm up' the tiny, old rooms, but it still looks kind of cheap and dingy. Room was unbearably hot (in November(!) but the AC didn't work. Luckily the window opens a bit - fresh air was great, city noise was not. Comfortable bed, but room wasn't super-clean. Free internet was definitely a big plus. If you are visiting downtown Seattle on a budget, this is a great place for you - but don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

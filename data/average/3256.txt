It's rate 4* but it's better a a 3*, practically only a tiny bar with a small reception 4x4 m2, 1 elevator and 5 floor rooms. Our was said queen size bed was only a french size (1 and 1/2). price was  95 x night four nights stay.They said maybe was possible to have larger bed, but didn't eve show up. Wireless INTERNET connection non existent: 2 days broken and the other two was functioning at a 2400 baud modem rate!! Not even possible to read standard email via their connection. The restaurant nice as location on the roof looking at blue moschea and Hagia Sofia, but the food was just below a cafeteria. Breakfast was selfserve with hibrid turkish and continental. In a scale between 1 and 10 I'll rate it 5 because of service to be improved a lot.

The Magnolia is a beautiful place. It appears to be an older hotel. The parking was inconvenient as you could not self park and it would take the valet about 20 minutes to get your car. The area of the city did not seem to be the best part of town. There were not many shops near by to browse at. Only two of the elevators were in working condition while four of them never worked during our stay. The rooms were nice, but overall we would have to get a great deal in order to stay there again.

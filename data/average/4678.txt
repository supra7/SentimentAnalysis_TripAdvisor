The Hilton Garden Inn is located at the corner of State Street and East Grand Avenue in downtown Chicago right at the red-line metro stop. The room on the 16th floor was spacious and clean with adequate toiletries and comfort. There was a mini-fridge and microwave as well as large flat-screen TV with plenty of channels. The staff were very friendly with easy check-in and check-out. Unfortunately, the hotel was extremely noisy. There was a large amount of hallway noise all night long as well as lots of street noise transmitted through the windows. The gym was small but clean and had the basic amenities. An indoor pool is also onsite. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and a Weber grill within the hotel. The meeting facilities and complementary business lounge are clean and provide the needed amenities. Free wifi throughout the hotel is a definite plus.

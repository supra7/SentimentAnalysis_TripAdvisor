This hotel has a great location in Coply Square, across the street right in between the Marriot and Westin. It has a hip, small boutique hotel feel and has been beautifully rennovated. I stayed in one of the Edge rooms which outstanding windows in all directions. The only problem and it was a significant one was the noise. The first night it was simply "city" noise and very understandable if just a big magnified by the position of the room in the hotel. If you like it very quiet, be sure to ask for a room that will be quiet. The second night there was a fire alarm at 2am, pulled by someone in the night club downstairs. The third night, a Friday night, it was as if there was a party in the room and there was no getting away from it. I had memories of frat house row in college. Young people from the night club were in the street yelling and playing until well past three. I will say that the night club is not owned or managed by the hotel owners and when I complained in the morning, the staff was very empathetic. They suggested that they are trying to work on the problem and assured me that there are quieter rooms in the building to try next time. I think this place has great potential and I am likely to give the promise of a "quiet" room a chance next time I am in the area.

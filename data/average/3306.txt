We were stuck in Holland over the Easter weekend. We decided to leave our industrial town and head to Amsterdam. Trying to be mindful of our company's expense we decided to stay outside of the city. We chose Ble Square because it sounded like a good alternative. Not so. The neighborhood is very diverse to say the least. There were NO resteraunts at all. The hotel resteraunt is ok but limited. Our rooms were on the street and it was very noisy. I would not recommend this hotel as an alternative to staying in city center. Do your research and you can find something downton for sure. We actually didn't save any money because we had to take the bus back and forth.

This hotel does live up to what other reviews have said. The staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a great location right on Kaanapali beach. The on site Tiki Terrace restaurant is good and decently priced compared to the restaurants at the Whalers Village next door which are more trendy and busy. They cost more but the food is not any better. Your best bet for food is in Lahaina, which is a few minutes down the road, where they have better food at gentler prices in most cases (but not all). I have stayed at other 3* hotels on the Big Island and in Waikiki and I would have to say that this hotel is not up to par with them. Our room was in the "Molokai Wing" and really was at the level of a cheap motel. My wife and I are not picky people but we do like a clean, somwhat current room when paying for a 3* hotel. Our room had not been updated in sometime and the toilet/shower portion of the washroom contained various colours of mold, yellowed caulking, peeling wallpaper and cracked drywall. There were pictures on tripadvisor of one of these washrooms but they seem to have been removed. The bed and the pillows (tiny) were not comfortable and I can sleep on anything. I went to the front desk upon arrival (Thursday) to see if we could be moved to a different room. I was told there would be nothing available until Sunday and to comeback then between 10 & 6. We were not around the hotel on the Sunday and I never heard back from the staff about a room change. I think they are used to complaints about this wing and just try to grin and bear it. They seem to use it as overflow space for when they are most busy. If you do stay at this hotel I would make sure that you are in the newer wing. Otherwise I would recomend staying elsewhere.

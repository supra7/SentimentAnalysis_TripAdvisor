Unfortunately, in Dallas Christmas Eve was a mess with all the ice. After I had been asleep, I that my daughter's finace had gotten stranded at DFW. I called the front desk to add a room. Even though the rate was the same and my ID and credit card had been reviewed and were on file, I had to get up, get dressed and go initial the rate of the room. WHY? policy...Then I got stuck in the lobby elevator! The worst part was yet to come. My daughter spent 4+ hrs on the roads covered in ice to retrieve him. The next morning I get a call from Maverick-for whatever reason, cars were being moved around and when the valet hit a ice in the garage, it slammed into the wall. He assured me it was drive-able and that the valet company accepted liability and called Enterprise Rental. Hours later we checked out and began to make our way to our relatives' Christmas celebration. The car overheated.Stranded on Christmas...by a hotel mistake. There were no cars available and no wreckers to come assist. On Saturday, wrecker said the underside of the car was damanged--no cooling fluid and a rip in the radiator. The car rental manager gave us a grim predication: we'd be liable since the hotel had a 3rd party vendor, the valet service. They said the hotel would probably not help and blame the valet service and visa versa. My daughter has stayed at Magnolia twice before and loved it. She has recommened it to her friends in DC (where she lives). I realized on Saturday that my future son in law got the parking fee on his room bill (although I requested it on mine at check-in). I called back...why? policy. I asked for a credit and hope it made it to the correct credit card. I remain cautiously optomist. Pam Lovell

Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2008, on our way down to Key West. Got a great deal on the room through priceline. Room was great, very large corner room, nice flat panel TV, fridge, the 2 outer walls were basically floor to ceiling windows with amazing views. Service was good, nothing to complain about. Hotel is clean and nicely decorated. Now the things that ticked us off, and I know some of this isn't the fault of the hotel. When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore. To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal. I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else. I know that the hotel had recently changed ownership but they should have had the hotel information changed with the various booking agents.

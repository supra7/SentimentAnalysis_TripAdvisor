This hotel has a great location. We wanted to be near some shopping and it definitely met our needs in this regard. In fact, given the current construction along the waterfront, this is really the best area to stay for tourists. We were a bit disappointed with the room. It was non-smoking, but the designation must have been in effect just for that day because it was definitely a smoker's room. The room itself was average. It was small, and the bathroom was small. This is not good for families who need to "multi-task" in the bathroom! My biggest complaint about the hotel was the fact that room service must have gone on strike when asked to clean up the dirty trays in the hallway. We checked in at about 5 p.m. and there were probably 10 different breakfast trays laying in the hallway. Scrambled eggs everywhere. It was terrible. We went out to dinner, came back late, and they were still there! Thankfully, they had been removed by the next morning. So to anyone who reads this, I like the Copley Place area, but would suggest a different hotel.

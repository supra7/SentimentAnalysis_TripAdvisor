My husband and I stayed here and were given a corner room on the 19th floor. The room was very nice. The bed was extremely comfortable. While the location is walking distance to everything you want to go to, as well as close to the T, the area is dead at night. Downtown is smelly and filled with homeless people sleeping in the streets. The pool was cold, but the exercise room and steamroom were nice. Overall, this hotel would be a lot nicer if it were 2 blocks away.

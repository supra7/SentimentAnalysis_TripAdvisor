We stayed for 3 nights choosing this hotel because of the pool and reviews. Whilst our 'cool corner' room was well appointed one could not help but feel a bit hemmed in by the newly completed ICC mega-tower. Pool was indeed special but so-called guest executives failed to mention the wonderful steam, jacuzzi and spa facilities on offer as well. Breakfast in The Kitchen was excellent. Will avoid staying there again however because of the very slack checkout service (we had to call 3 times for a porter before giving up) and the fact that despite leaving a designer item behind in the room it was mysteriously never found. Would choose the nearby Ritz Carlton in the ICC, better view and superior service.

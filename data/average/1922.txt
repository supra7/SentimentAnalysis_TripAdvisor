Our stay at this property was very enjoyable. The best part is the location on the beach. It is right next to Black Rock (in front of Sheraton) where you can swim, snorkel (frequent turtle sightings) and jump off the rock into the sea. The beach itself is long, wide and not at all crowded even with the hotels that line the shore...plenty of room for everyone. And, the ocean was calm and inviting, of course. The hotel claims to be the "most Hawaiian hotel" which may be the case. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful at every opportunity. The rooms are a bit dated and nothing fancy, so if you're looking for luxury this probably isn't ideal. That said, the rooms were clean, beds comfortable and water pressure great (no tub, just standing shower). And, we were upgraded at no fee to a room that had a nice ocean view (all rooms have patios too). The pool is a little crowded with families and the bar scene was a little cheesy, although the beer and drinks were very fairly priced as compared to other spots we visited. Worth noting, they have a couple of restaurants with descent food, nothing great. And, no room service. They also have a hut on the beach where you can rent any thing you want for the water, and charge it to your room. Again, the beach was just wonderful. You can also walk along the beach or walkway to other places to eat and shop, like Whaler's Village. All in all, this was a clean, friendly place with a beautiful beach. I would say it is best for families and "chill" couples, like us. It's not The Four Seasons, but sun, sand and the warm ocean are all free so don't forget that. :)

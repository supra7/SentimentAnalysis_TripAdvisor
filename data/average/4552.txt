The Hyatt is a good hotel - not a 4 star - but a solid 3 star. Location is very good, walk 2-4 blocks to theater district, 2 blocks to Boston Common, 10-15 min walk to State House, 15 min walk to Fanieul Hall. Subway stop is 5 minutes away (Green Line/Red Line). Hotel has a little age showing - but rooms were clean, comfy beds. Rooms were average city rooms (smallish). Check in was easy, staff was very good with one exception . A mix up with room service - order wasn't complete, no condiments and a call from room service that there wasn't a credit card on file??? - were ultimately resolved but unnecessary. Gym was average with 5 bikes/5 treadmills/5 elliptical and good selection of weight machines etc. Pool was average size, but shallow which worked well with kids. Not enough chairs around pool. Booked thru Priceline for $75 plus tax. The hotel was well worth it and if it weren't for the cold it would be a very good place to see the city from.

I stayed at the Hotel Lawrence for a conference. Since I'm a walker, it was within easy walking distance of the Convention Center. The DART station is also nearby. My room was small, and the colors and furniture style reminded me of the apartment I grew up in back in the '60s (avocado/Danish "modern"), but the bed was comfortable, and (like another reviewer) I could see the site of the Kennedy shooting out my window. The restaurant was very good--friendly waitstaff, tasty and reasonably priced food. The complimentary breakfast was just adequate: cereals, various pastries,a do-it-yourself waffle maker. There were juices (or juice products), but no orange juice; the coffee was lukewarm, and on one morning the carafe ran out and was not replaced speedily. There were periodic loud noises from what I'm guessing was the plumbing, which woke me up several times during the night. Worst of all, on a morning when I had several meetings coming up there was no hot water in the shower; the desk staff took care of it, but refused to give me any sort of refund for the inconvenience of not being able to shower properly on a day when I was concerned with making a good impression on quite a few people. With a serious update, the hotel has the potential to be pretty good.

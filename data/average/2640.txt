Stay here if you enjoy sleeping with loud music. We had very loud booming music until 1:00am, not easy to fall asleep with that going on. $28 for valet parking, really???? I hate being fleeced for parking and this seems to be a trend in Miami. No bar fridge in the room if you want to keep something cold. Not impressed.

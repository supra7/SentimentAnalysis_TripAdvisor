Hotel is located in Little India district. It feels like India which means that there are shops that sell traditional Indian clothes and jewelery as well as fruit and vegetables market and 24/7 shops and of course all kinds of traditional Indian restaurants on your every step. The hotel is located about 5-10 min walking from subway station. I saw workers painting the walls of some of the rooms so I guess they are renovating the rooms. Bathroom shower has no curtain so prepare to have flood in your bathroom every time someone takes a shower. They change towels and bed sheets daily. Breakfast is included in the price. They offer toast, butter, marmalade, eggs, bananas and coffee or tea. The staff was quite helpful.

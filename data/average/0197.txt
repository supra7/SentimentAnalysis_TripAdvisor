This is an old property with that historical charm. The garden is lovely, and the rooms are spacious. The hotel could do with a renovation, but it's still serviceable. The proximity to the Seattle Center is very nice, especially for the price. The surrounding neighborhood is an odd mix of vagrants and trendy restaurants/shops.

Reservations: easy online at Starwood.com Room Rate: excellent: $209 per night Room: Nice size, nice furniture, and excellent bed. Huge bathroom. Check-in: efficient friendly and fast. Check-out: accurate and fast. Hotel Gym: very nice with an excellent pool and weight room. Location: Right in Midtown Seattle; not the most exciting neighborhood but there is plenty of shopping and dining options close by. PROBLEM: Internet service was not working in my room. Despite repeated telephone calls it was NEVER fixed during my stay. Overall Impression: A fairly standard large hotel, with nice furnishings but nothing about this hotel is memorable.

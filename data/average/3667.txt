I have only one horrible memory of our stay here, an employee by the name of Nabila. She apparently claims to be a manager but works in the flower shop in the lobby. Our soccer team was at the hotel for a prestigious tournament and had over 50 rooms in the hotel for our group. Another mom and I were in the lobby waiting for our team to return from a game and we had two coolers with us to pass out Gatorade and water to our team. Nabila saw us there and told us we can't stand in the lobby as there were two weddings coming. I explained what we were doing and she said we cannot be there, we had to move. I again explained that we were paying guests at the hotel and had every right to stand in the lobby waiting for our team and she then proceeded to accuse us of selling our water and Gatorade. At this point we moved closer to the elevator and a father went to speak to the front desk manager. Nabila followed him there and tried to argue with this dad and even tried to call security. The front desk manager even told her to be quiet so he could address our concerns. Not once did she apologize for her rude behavior and accusations. This type of service is unacceptable at a hotel of this price and supposed four-star rating.

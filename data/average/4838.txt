This mammoth hotel is in need of a major overhaul as it pertains to the rooms. They are small and dated. The bathroom doors (plural as I requested a second room) are split from water damage. The first room I was assigned had torn wall paper and smudges on the wall. The overall experience of the rooms is unpleasant though clean for the most part. The positives are the beds are comfortable, location, on site restaurants and amenities. Shops etc if you forget anything. Check in does what they can with what they have. The room assigment process is comical due to the number of stipulations around the type of room you can pay for. Overall not worth the trouble, not a good experience and I would not go back.

My boyfriend and I just returned from a fantastic trip to Seattle. We found the staff extremely pleasant and helpful--explaining map and pointing us in the right direction. We walked EVERYWHERE! Pike's Place, Chinatown, Pioneer Square, and of course Seattle Center. We were a bit apprehensive when we saw the room, but easily got used to it. Huge closet helped us keep the room clutter free. No a/c was a little frightening, but Seattle in May is not exactly steamy so we were fine. Plus during these tough times, saving some costs by staying at the Inn at Queen Anne allowed us to book a 4-Star Hotel in Vancouver. If I was doing another trip on a budget, I would gladly stay at Inn at Queen Anne again.

To premise this review I would like to say that my friend and I have extensively travelled the world on a right budget being early twenty year old students but even for the low price and good location we won't be back. As other reviewers have said the staff don't really speak English which although isn't their fault it is expected in order to own a "hotel". The breakfast also isn't flash but hey we still didn't really mind it was cheap an we are young! However the elevator is literally the size of a shoebox and hideously unsafe with NO DOOR! again we breathed in and relaxed and thought it's not that bad. The rooms are tiny, if one person wants to walk around the room the other must sit on the bed, literally as one reviewer said 2m by 2m. Again I thought it's cheap. It got worse, they only occasionally make up the rooms, we had it done once in 5 days, by day three we had no towels and no TOILET PAPER! trying to secure some required a complex and rather R18 version of charades due to the language barrier. But it got worse, they spend every night renovating until at least one am, jack hammers and nail guns on the floor we were on. To be honest I could go on all day, the truth is we are young and cheap and don't mind most things but the basics are missing here and the uneasy stares in the lobby even creeped me out a 24yr old guy. There are 3 nice places 100m away for exactly the same price, under 30 euro a night for two people. STAY THERE! this place is just not worth the stress and turmoil.

we stayed at the elliot hotel ove rlabor day weekend. we were up graded to a sutie on the 9th level (top floor) b/c it was our anniversary. Which was nice! The location was great for shopping, the prudential center, and even to walk the freedom trail. The ugly.... this hotel is old. All night long even being in the 9th floor at we heard was traffic noise, sirens, horns blasting, ambulances, ect. we thought it would stop but it continued all night. i can't imagine how noisey it must be on lower levels. The bed was hard as a rock. (the worst i have ever slept on) and we had our AC on 65 degrees the entire time we were there but the room never got below 80. There are nicer hotels in this area for the money. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and overly accomedation, printed out mapquest directions for me to dinner.

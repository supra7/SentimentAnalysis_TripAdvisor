Stayed here for a conference at the adjacent Hynes center. Hotel was fine since I wasnt paying for it. Had I been I would have been very unhappy. Very average room for $300...no value whatsoever, if they could figure out how to do it, they would charge you for the air in your room. Plus very noisy renovations in lobby, which was closed for part of our stay...not acceptable at this price point. Stay was nonexistent literally not one interaction in 6 days.

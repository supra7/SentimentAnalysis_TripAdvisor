I stayed at the Moore Hotel on Dec 3rd, 4th and 5th, 2004 and I have to say the Moore Hotel had it's positives and some negatives. If you are a tourist and want to check out some of Seattle's downtown famous attractions like The Space Needle, Pike's Place Market and Pioneer Square then the Moore is a great hotel to stay in because you can walk to all three of these locations from the hotel. The Moore Hotel has clean rooms, they are kind of old, but it's a clean place to sleep and shower. The staff are very friendly, but the only bad side is, you won't get the nice bathroom amneties in a Holiday Inn or a Hilton. The Moore Hotel's bathrooms are small (they are clean) but small, the towels are very thin and not full bath size, so bring your own. Other than that, it's a nice place to sleep and stay for a short period of time. We had a room facing Elliot's Bay, and it was a beautiful view. There is a large mall about 3 blocks from the hotel. Pike's Place market is 2 blocks from the Moore Hotel, the space needle is about 8 blocks away, and you can catch the free city bus to Pioneer Square if you don't feel like walking 10 blocks. Basically, the Moore Hotel is a clean place to sleep at night, it's clean and the rates are very reasonable for a hotel in downtown Seattle. I'd stay there again, for a short time. If you are arriving in Seattle from Sea-Tac International Airport, use the transportation company 'Shuttle Express', they have vans that take you from the airport to the hotel for about $20 bucks...they are efficient, on-time, friendly, and affordable...they dropped us off and picked us up from the Moore Hotel perfectly.

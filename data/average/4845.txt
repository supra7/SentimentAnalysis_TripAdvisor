This famous hotel is in a great location and is a pleasant old-timer in many ways. But it doesn't have the little things that justify it's rates...no wireless in the rooms (ever heard of iPad?), tiny bathroom counter space, no coffee maker, very weak lineup of cable tv stations, minimal room service menu. Comfortable rooms but not really worth the price.

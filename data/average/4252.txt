As a holiday gift, someone gave us 2 nights at the Boston Park Plaza and Towers. We had lovely time in Boston - the weather was gorgeous, and we walked all over town - from the MFA to the waterfront. It's also a good thing that the weather was so perfect, because we would have been miserable if we'd been stuck inside. Our room was tiny - so small that we were constantly in each other's way. We had a view of a construction site. The bed was very comfy, but there are not many amenities in the rooms (TV and reception poor, no conditioner, one bar of soap for the sink and the shower, no way to heat water for coffee/tea). The high speed internet, for which we paid $10.45/day, was not wireless, so you were tethered to the desk. No, these are not a big deal, but in a luxury hotel one has certain expectations! The bathroom was also very small, and not particularly nice - perfectly acceptable, but not luxury hotel quality. Also, we could hear everything that happened in the adjoining bath - so were awakened several times to hear the vomiting of the person next door who drank too much on Saturday night - which we could hear in bed, on the other side of a wall and a door. Not very restful, and just plain gross. All in all, this hotel did not ruin our weekend or anything, but if we'd been paying full price for the room we would have been extremely disappointed. It needs to be remodeled, and perhaps better insulated between baths. In the end, this hotel's pretensions of grandeur (and the lobby is lovely) are not matched by what you find in the rooms - not even close. And since it is expensive - parking is over $40/day, for example - and every "extra" is charged at very high rates - it really needs to live up to its reputation. The staff was very nice and very friendly - they get top honors for that.

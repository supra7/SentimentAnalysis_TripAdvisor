Given major construction in the street just outside that continued until 11 p.m., I did not have the most pleasant stay at the Magnolia, although surely the hotel can't be faulted for that. Whereas the staff is quite gracious, this hotel is old and a bit dirty, The baseboards and carpet in my queen bed room were actually fairly grimy. Still, the bed was comfortable, the linens were clean, the towels were plush, and the shampoo/conditioner/lotion/body wash high quality. I also liked the mini-fridge in the room. I did not take advantage of the breakfast, happy hour and late night cookies & milk that were included in the room charge, but some of my traveling companions did and provided thumbs up feedback. The fitness room was rather pathetic and the ancient elevators are creepy.

Things I liked ------------------- a) Included Breakfast buffet was good. They had a variety of food. Service was good. Gotta try omelette. b) Food at Sonz was very very good..Yummy...I guess I had best ravioli at Sonz c) Pool was nice, as well as beach was good. We saw whale too which was icing on the top. d) Luau was very good, a treat for eyes... but food was ordinary. Things which let us down ------------------------------------- a) We mentioned that we were visiting Maui to celebrate our anniversary and we were given a room facing cemetery (how thoughtful)...after calling the front desk we were moved to a different room b) We had a last minute change and wanted to have dinner at Sonz restaurant, we were first denied a table cause they said they are fully booked, later they said we can sit at the bar and eat. Later after requesting again, they said they have one reservation for 8:00 PM (it was 6:00 PM) and we can take that table. c) After seated, waiter was nice, but Kitchen kept getting our order wrong and also final bill was completely wrong...it just made the whole evening really bad d) None of the staff member seemed to have in a good mood and seems to be greeting the guest with smile or was remotely interested in finding out how is the stay with hotel. It lack that warmth of hospitality e) There was not much discount offered to guest for playing golf at Ka'anapali golf course, whereas I found there were gift vouchers available at different place for 50% off for the same golf course... f) Free WiFi was the slowest WiFi I have seen in my life... Overall I feel the warmth of hospitality was clearly missing and I felt that we were just staying in a 2 star hotel... I would not stay in this hotel...

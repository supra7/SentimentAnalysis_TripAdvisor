We stayed at the Edgewater for 1 night this March. I would have to say overall, I wouldnt stay here again. The room was fine and was the best part of the stay. Bathroom was redone and very nice. Room was somewhat updated. On the downside...the corridors etc felt very old and tired. Also, we were woken several times throughout the night by a train traveling past the hotel. And finally the distance from the hotel to the downtown core was just too far. They did have a shuttle that took us downtown and that was great, but we had to cab it back after a night out at the theater. The staff was neither overly friendly nor rude etc., but nothing memorable either way. We visit Seattle 2-3 times a year and this was our first visit to the Edgewater. For us, there are much better choices downtown with better quality facilities and better location.

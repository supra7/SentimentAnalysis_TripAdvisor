THe hotel is pretty much brand new. Take a strip view on an upper floor if you stay there. The hotel is very overpriced when it comes to food and general expenses, with an unfortunate useless resort fee. We didn't even get the bottles of water and coffees!!!! Anyway not a bit deal. In the past, I stayed at the Wynn, Bellagio, Monte carlo ( to avoid) and I don't think I will stay at the Trump again du to the location. The only good point is the fact that there's no casino in it. I recommend it for about 100$ a night. not more

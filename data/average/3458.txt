The rooms are a very good size and very comfortable..no bells and and whistles, but nice. This hotel is nestled in a Venitian neighborhood...we went to a neighborhood restaurant and a park right on the water..It was very relaxing. We were there as part of a tour and there was one dinner included, and breakfast. The breakfast was fine, normal for what you expect with a tour...The dinner would have been fine, except, hard to believe, as flavoful as the rice was, you could not eat it because it was so undercooked. All in all, I think it was a great value. You could still walk to St. Marks and to all the action, but at the end of the day, you got to experience a quiet Venitian neighborhood.

Went for an overnight stay this week. Staff is very friendly. Food was interesting but not spectacular during meeting. The room is tired. No outlets for computer - had to unplug wall lamp - room becomes very dark. Bathroom not completely cleaned - stains on counter. Went to use public bathroom on meeting level and it was worse than a baseball stadium or beach bathroom. No soap in dispenser.. Clearly not cleaned or checked.

We had a reasonably nice stay at the Hotel Monaco but did not find it to be as phenomenal as some reviews might suggest. The room was nice, but not extraordinary. The room did not have adequate drawer space, particularly for a stay of more than a couple of days. The service was generally excellent. Although Kimpton InTouch members have free wireless Internet, in our case, the free Internet was more than offset by the ridiculously high cost of the Kimpton business center. We used the computers in the business center for a total of approximately 10 minutes and printed approximately 10-15 pages, which ended up costing us somewhere in the range of $23. This is a significant contrast to many other hotels where we have stayed in Chicago, where the front desk has printed out documents for us. Next time, we will stay elsewhere or go to FedEx Office.

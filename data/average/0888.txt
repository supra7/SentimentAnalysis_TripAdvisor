My Wife and I stayed at the Westin for a couple nights and we enjoyed the place! We had a room on the 6th floor and the room was great...clean, spacious, well decorated and the bed was awesome! We had a chance to go up to the pool one night and it was good, don't expect a water park but for a downtown hotel it was totally fine!! Also we had a couple drinks on the lobby...great! The lobby is super comfortable (at times a little busy, but, most hotel are!) you can get wifi for free at the lobby, we didn't want to pay $16 for wifi in the room! The service was great to get a drink while we were hanging out! The only major issue that I had with the hotel was the elevators!!! 3 elevator for 40 floor!!! Not enough, especially in the morning, a couple times we took the stairs since we didn't want to wait 10 minutes to get into one!! Also parking is expensive, $36, ouch!!! Overall I would go back to the Westin, although I wouldn't park there!! ps: One more thing, BEST location ever!!!

Very nice location (close to 5th Street), right beside Petco Park - baseball, good rooms, good fitness centre. Was there for a convention ... good meeting/conference rooms. Main peeve was that the wifi was $15-$20/day. The Business Centre was even more expensive! The convention had to set up an 'Internet Cafe' so that attendees did not get dinged, but that was only for day use. Even in this day and age, Hotel 8 has free wifi!!! Everything was set at gouge prices. A Coke can in a machine was $4.50. Parking was $25/self-park; $30/valet per day. Did not expect that from a 'class' organization that caters to business/convention crowd.

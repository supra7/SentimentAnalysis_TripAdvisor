Excellent location (but no views to speak off), satisfactory rooms although quite small for a new hotel, with a modernist theme. The free breakfast, high speed wireless and laptop were a nice touch. The staff spoke English which was a relief because not many people do, despite the heavy tourist presence. On the average side were the small things such as tiny bottles of cheap shampoo, the aircon wasn't cold (and quite noisy) and breakfast (7.30 - 10.30) was not replenished. Get there by 9.30 if you want hot foods. Although there was a mini bar in the room it was expensive (Euro 4.80 for a small beer that sells for 0.50 in the supermarket) and there was no bottle opener to be had for love nor money in the whole hotel. Madrid loves their corked wine so this can be a problem: If you want to BYO and don't mind looking like a wino, ask the shop to open it before going home or buy your own corkscrew (although none to be had in the local supermarkets or souvenir shops! Despite the double glazing the lower floors suffer some traffic noise (particularly out the back where the road paving is lifting) The heavy internal doors all close with a slam so quite a bit of hallway noise too. The staff were reasonably helpful but not as good as some we have seen. So, not bad, and can't fault the location but not deserving of the five star rating yet.

I just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. The location is definitely ideal, but was not impressed with the overall quality of the rooms. We paid $250 a night for waterfront (which we got and was beautiful) and $350 for NYE night. For the price I would have thought the room would have been a little nicer, ie the armoire, tv, art on the walls, and thicker pillows on the bed. The walls in our bathroom were dirty with black scuff marks. Also, our heat blew cooler air for some reason and we only actually felt heat maybe once an hour. The staff was nice and the valets were excellent. I wasn't expecting 5 star, but just nicer finishes overall for the money. I am not a high maintenance traveler, but will spend my money elsewhere next time.

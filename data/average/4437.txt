This is a standard (i.e., boring) hotel in a great location for the Boston conference center. The breakfast for Hilton Honors is below average as compared to many other Hilton propoerties. The room was not overly clean with hair in the drawers and on the bathroom floor. I did not get mich sleep during my stay. The walls are so thin, I could her EVERY word that was spoken in the room next door. I could her them opening/closing drawers, gointo to the bathroom, snoring etc.

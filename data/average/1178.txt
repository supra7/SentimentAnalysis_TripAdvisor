I stayed at this hotel with three other guests for a national conference at the convention center accross the street. The location was fabulous...the room not so much. The staff could have been friendlier. They messed up our reservation. We were on pins and needles wondering if they could secure us a room for our last evening. Our room heater was broken. We were given a cheap space heater instead of a different room. Also bathroom was extremely tiny, especially for four women.

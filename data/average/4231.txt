This hotel has very nice public areas and is probably in the most central location you could ask for in Boston with a huge choice of nearby restaurants and other attractions. However, although clean with comfortable beds, the hotel's rooms are from a different era and let down by a lack of major renovation. Rooms are small with Victorian bathrooms and somewhat eccentric heating. Worst feature is the paper thin walls where you can easily hear next door conversations and the TV. I had to call my neighbor at midnight to ask her to turn the TV down. Make sure you bring earplugs if you stay here.

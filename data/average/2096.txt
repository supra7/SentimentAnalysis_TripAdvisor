We were 3 couples and stayed there on January 2011 for 5 days. The place was quite cheap for us. We got nice clean rooms, they were small, but this wasn't a problem for us, we had just a place to sleep. The staff was friendly and welcome, no problem here. The hotel located not far from the centre of historical part of the town and from tram station. It is also not far from the shore, so you can go down and buy a fresh fish and ask a nearby restraunt to cook it for you. The hotel isn't far from many shops and food courts where you can have cheap and tasty dishes. We found only two minuses of this place: 1. Breakfasts in the hotel weren't good, we all didn't like it, don't use. 2. They have thin walls there, so you can hear what your neighborhoods do, but luckily there weren't many guests that time. Anyway, we had good time and warm memories about Istanbul and the hotel also, I can recommend it.

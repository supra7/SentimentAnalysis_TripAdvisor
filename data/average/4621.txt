We booked the fairmont gold and had high expectations. We expected the workd after a previous stay at the Fairmont Battery Wharf - one of the best rooms we have ever stayed at. the Copley got so much wrong and so little right. First, they did not have the king room that we booked and paid for on the gold floor. They were not very apologetic. they offered us a downgrade to a queen that was not eemn made up and half the size. they next offered us a non gold room, the room faced a building site with somebodt using an earth driller.......horrible. We asked to speak to the duty manager, Brigitta. They said she would call. she never did. The room we ended up with was faded glory, all the way back on the "gold" floor. Carpets had seen better days as had the plasma TV's. they say this hotel is the sister of the Plaza hotel in NY. The plaza just had $500m spent on it, they must be dreaming. This hotel does not deliver and they need to learn to better serve their guests. Avoid at all cost and choose Fairmont Battery Wharf

I was in venice during the carnival. The hotel was ideally located from St. Marks Square, and the room was great. The hotel has two impressive old antique rooms, which are common areas, but with no real usage to the traveller. There is an nice breakfast served but the location could not be worse. Next to the lobby are four tables and at any given time we were coming and had to wait or being stared at from other travellers to wait for a seat to open up. Its really not understandable why a owner would create such a felt like 5 sq m breakfast area, where such great old impressive rooms are left to no usage at all. I asked the reception and the answer why such a decision was made was: because we do not have a kitchen there. Coming myself fom the hotel business this seems a lame excuse, italian breakfast includes an hot beverage and croissants, no egg dish has to be prepared, and even though no kitchen is available, enough tableware and coffee could be provided. Under the current circumstances I can not recommend to stay there, or only if you give the breakfast a miss.

I will start out like this...I am a crazy researcher,I love to travel and I am not overly picky.When you first enter the hyatt you are in awe,if only they could continue that awe they would be headed in the right direction.The rooms....now remember i am not overly picky.........dirty,spending 400 plus a night at this hotel you do not expect dirt,example dirty curtains. I am talking dirty finger prints from food on the curtains...gross dirty finger prints on the wall ,just generally an un clean.A hotel of this standard should not be like this.The grounds are spotless that is correct and beautiful,but why slack off in the rooms?Food...super expensive and I am talking 17 american for a cheeseburger without fries,14 dollars for a drink.I understand this is maui,but robbing people blind just because they can is unreasonable.Breakfat buffet for a family of 4 was 120 not including tip and there were birds flying in and out of the dining area pooping on the seats.I actually was seated on one of them.If you decide to go to Whalers village that is near by it is about 15 min walk....nice but in the middle of the afternoon while enjoying the pool,do you really want to get up and walk 15 min to stand in line to get lunch?If I came back to Maui,I would book the Westin,it was right next door to whalers village,it also had a beautiful beach.So if you didn't want to pay crazy prices for meals at the hotel you wouldn't feel like you had too.Also at check out they had many mistakes on our check out bill.I don't want to come across as a nag......but I would honestly hope you would reconsider your decision about staying here....I would not return

Stayed in this hotel for a week with my partner on a business trip. Excellent location, close to tube and Kensignton High Street, as well as conference centres. Room was very small, although by London standards it wasn't so bad - just enough room to move around the bed, and you could pull the chair out from the table and sit down, which a friend staying in another room said you could not. We stayed in the town house across the road, whcih I thought would be excellent for coming and going etc. Unfortunately, everytime we left the hotel our room card stopped working, so we would have to traipse back across to the main hotel and have it reset. Not a problem the first time, but by the fifth time I was getting annoyed - especially late at night etc. The reception didn't seem to think it was a problem, although clearly it was happening to a LOT of guests. They suggested keeping the card away from mobile phones and credit cards etc - when that failed, they suggested it was because I had been on the tube! Not a single apology for inconvenience, ever. I ended up just having it reset each time I walked past to the town house, to save time. Note also, the rooms are very noisy, pretty much all day. I don't think this is the case if you stay at the main hotel - but you also don't get a choice. Gym is good, breakfast is standard. I'd recommend the hotel and would stay again, if they get the room key problem fixed!

The hotel overall was ok but we struck quite a few problems, firstly we were surprised when we arrived that the porter did not offer to take our bags to our room, he just dumped them at the elevator, on the second night I was quite ill after eating seafood at the hotel and also that night I found out the walls are very thin and I could hear the guest next door snoring most of the night. The quality of the furnishings in the room is quite good and the staff are generally friendly, I would rate the hotel as just average overall.

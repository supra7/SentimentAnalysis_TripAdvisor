We booked this hotel for a spur of the moment get away to Memphis. The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked very good. The room was quite. All of these are things I expect at a minimum from a hotel. These were the best parts of the hotel experience at the Courtyard by Marriot Memphis East/ Lenox Corporate Park. The hotel seemed old. The furniture was dated and in need of replacement. The TV was the old tube style television. The entire room could use a refurbishement and the hotel in general could use a refurbishement. The soap and shampoo provided did not smell good. It was bad, just not good. I do not think this Hotel is up to Marriot standards. I am a gold elite member of the Marriott rewards program, so I have stayed numerous times at Marriott properites. If there is another Hotel available, I will not return. Nothing bad -- there are just better places to stay.

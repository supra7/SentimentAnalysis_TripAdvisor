Decent hotel. Stayed here early February for 1 night (booked via priceline), having to catch an early flight (around 7:30 am) the next morning. There's a free hotel shuttle service that picks you up for the 10 minute drive to the hotel. We asked at the arrival information desk next to the airport exit to call the shuttle for us. The first shuttle starts at 5 am the next morning (free donuts & coffee available, free breakfast starts at 7 am), and they were also happy to bring us to the train station (5 minute drive) with the free shuttle. The train will get you to the city center in roughly 20 minutes for a few dollars. Room with bed, living area with tv, kitchen, and bathroom.

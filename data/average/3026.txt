The hotel was close to the metro station and can walk to Fredrichstase station, we actually walked most places. Clean large rooms, fairly basic facilities, there is no fridge or tea/coffe but is good for the price! much better than staying in a hostel. This hotel is part of an appartment building (it is not just a hotel building) Staff dont speak much english but we got by fine, chose to eat out for breakfast rather than get the hotel breakfast Make sure you check out the restaurants and bars on Oranienburger Str just down the read! Would stay here again or something on Oranienburger Str

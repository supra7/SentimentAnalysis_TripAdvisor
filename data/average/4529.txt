I stayed in this hotel for a week for business reasons and only got one really good night's sleep. The doors on the guest rooms are extremely loud when they shut and I could hear the folks around me in other rooms. Since Chinatown is so close, I understand that this is the hotel of choice after a night of clubbing. It is in a very good location and the staff was extremely attentive. The steps going down to get to the registration area was no big deal, odd ...but was told it was for safety reasons. The breakfast was delicious, Deirdre makes a great omlette. Not sure I would stay here again until they replace the doors with something more quiet.

Located on the second floor of a building located in the cat's-cradle of alleyways running between Via Arenula and Piazza Farnese, this hotel is a step up from a hostel but otherwise is fairly basic. Our room had once upon a time opened directly onto the main stairwell, and though that door is now completely sealed, the smell of rubbish from the communal garbage cans at the bottom, along with people's conversations, did carry up into the room from time to time. As this July was very hot (temps in the mid-30s up) this meant choosing between fresh (but hot) air from the open window, or keeping it cool with the aircon with the risk of occasional smells. That really was the only negative, however. Otherwise, it was great to be in such a handy location, right in the middle of Rome, and the lack of pretension was a nice change from more up-market hotels. The room was spacious, with attractive rafters on the ceiling, and the minibar fridge can be reorganised to accommodate your own water bottles etc. Breakfast is basic, but delivered to your room, which is nice, and the place felt generally pretty secure. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They also provide a 50 transport service to/from either airport, but if you are traveling light then you might also want to consider getting a cab from the taxi rank up the road at Torre Argentina, which could work out cheaper...

I booked a 3 night stay through E-bookers, and somehow when I checked in, they did not have my booking. However, it was sorted out while I went out to dinner and I was accomodated. The rooms are large apart-hotel type rooms with a two TVs, a kitchen, a large bed, a sitting room etc. Iron & Ironing board available, wifi (not free) and the bathroom was decent. The shower pressure and temperature was dodgy as was the overall decor of the room. However, it did its job. I was there for a brief weekend and I did not spend a hole lot of time there. The staff were very friendly and efficient (despite the initial issue with the booking). I did not eat there and it did not look like many people do but it seems to have a full restaurant service. Location: I do not know Dubai that well but will be as descriptive as possible: It is a five minute taxi journey or a 5 minute metro ride to the Dubai Marina. On the other hand, it is approximately 10-15 minutes in a taxi to the CBD i.e. where the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall are etc. The access to the Metro has to be a plus if you are not prepared to use taxis all the time (right beside the Internet City Metro), however, there is not a whole lot to do in the area which is called "Dubai Internet City". It was approximately 60 D's from the airport, which works out at about 12. My overall opinion of this place can be summed up as follows: If you are a business traveller and the company is paying for you: Don't go here. If you are a tourist and you are not too fussed on your accomodation but like a clean, safe and handy hotel, then this place is not too bad. I'd recommend it on that basis.

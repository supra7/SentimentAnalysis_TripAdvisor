this is a value priced hotel, and there are some inconveniences. however, some are to be expected when staying downtown in an older hotel in a large city. parking is around the corner, and will only allow for a normal height SUV at most. there are some stairs in both the parking structure and hotel before you get to the elevator, inconvenient when you have large bags. the rooms, albeit very small, have most of the modern conveniences. the air circulation, heating, cooling are not the best. the brite side is that the staff is wonderful, and the location is convenient to walk to the best shopping and embibing the city has to offer.

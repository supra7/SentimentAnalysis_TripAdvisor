Well this was a bargain break for me and my mother we had always wanted to come to Dubai but it was always coming up quite pricey. When i saw this deal with Thomas Cook 399 pounds 5 nights BB flying from Manchester on a scheduled flight on KLM via Amsterdam thought it was a good deal - Hotel was what i would class as a business hotel 2/3 star ,we were upgraded to a suite and thank god as my mum snores so i was able to make use of the lounge area while she took the bedroom location was downtown Dubai right across from a mosc so thoughtout the day and early evening could hear the chanting , it was ramadan when we went so you can imagine it was quite intense times of prayer there is a handy little supermarket next to it that you can get bottled water, fruit and most snacks that you get back home to put you over between meals i would alway suggest that August is avoided to go to Dubai on arriving at the very luxurous airport the heat at 06.30am hit me as was 30c in the 90f and increased as the day went on but most hotels taxis and shopping centres are air conditioned so its not so bad Hotel wise there is a roof top pool , bit grotty but for a hardened sun worshipper was great and empty !there was a small restaurant that provided a small and basic breakfast and definatly not 4" standard more like 2" but in contex for us for the price. 1st visit couldnt beat it - getting around and about is done very easily by taxi and that can be provided from reception or just standing outside the hotel's front door and the large shopping malls -dubai and khalifa are always good places to head for both shopping but also to eat as the food malls such a wide selection of diffrent cuisines did 2 special things went on out last day to the 6" burj al arab for a amazing afternoon tea booked via the internet about 50 pounds non alcoholic due to it being ramadan but it was amazing and i would recommend it to anyone to experience and be able to go and see the hotel also went to the tallest tower in the world booked on the internet again as works out cheaper and both worked out very interested and well worth the price want to go to dubai again but would like to try the beach area

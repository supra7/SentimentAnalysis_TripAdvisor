The hotel was good in this sense. 5-10 minutes from the hotel, it's and Embassy so the room is huge, the breakfast is great. If you need anything there are a ton of retail outlets and a Westfield mall right in the area. My saturday night stay was filled with a ton of kids roaming the hotel and parties in many rooms. Sunday after the extreamly large breakfast line started to open up space. By Sunday night and Monday morning the hotel was back to normal, very plesant after Sunday morning. My negative comments would come with $8 parking and an options for $9.95 or $14.95 Wi Fi. Take the $9.95 either way it is so slow. The resturant is not bad, not great but good price and will hit the spot. The room was very confortable> Overall it fit my needs very well. I would recomend.

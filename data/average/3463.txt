This hotel was very nice and clean but it was quite far from the centre, to far to walk. Same of the staff were nice some were not ,the food in the hotel was not great., The rooms and bathrooms were nice the hotel was out of the way. i would prob give this hotel for location a 3 out of ten, for cleaness a 9 and for the stafff an 7.

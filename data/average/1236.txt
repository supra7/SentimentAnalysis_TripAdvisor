We had the penthouse suite, 2 rooms with a kitchenette. The shuttle getting from the airport to the hotel was very croweded and hot (yes hot for Seattle) and smelled. We had planned to eat at the hotel restaurant but it was not open. So we had to order a pizza. Strange for such a large hotel not to have a restaurant or two. They told us to go across the street. They did have warm cookies at check-in. The room was done up in buttery soft yellows. The bathroom was huge. Larger then some hotel rooms I've stayed in. It had a sunken in tub, huge walk-in shower, robes & full line of Neutrogena beauty products. Two flat screen TV's-sitting room w/ leather sofa, tables and chairs. There was a huge wrap around balcony with a view of the glass elavators and a view of the Cascade Mts. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. The room was very sound prrof, as I did not hear anyone in the halls or other rooms. No b-fast was offered. The shuttle only runs on the hour, not every half an hour like you would assume from an airport hotel. So we almost missed our flight. By the time the shuttle was prepared to leave on the hour there were to many people to fit in the shuttle(they could have run there & back in that time ). The shuttle was hot and smelly again and people were mad. If you are not using the airport shuttle this hotel is great.

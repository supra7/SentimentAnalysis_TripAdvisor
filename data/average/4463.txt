I have stayed at the Back Bay Hilton about 20 times since last Fall for business. I think I have stayed in every type of room they offer over that period of time. My favorite by far is the Deluxe rooms on the corners (rooms xx15 and xx16) - they are a bit small in size, but are removed from the main hallway, which helps with the hallway noise. That is my main issue with this hotel - it is VERY noisy. You hear everything in the hallways, your neighbors, and every toilet flushing and shower running. The rooms themselves are very clean and renovated - fantastic TVs and beds. However, all that being said, I still can't get over the noise. The location is fantastic, and my company has a corporate rate, so I have decided to just keep staying there instead of finding a less noisy alternative. The front desk and doormen are also fantastic, and the food at the restaurant is good as well. All in all - I would rate this hotel much higher if it wasn't for the noise.

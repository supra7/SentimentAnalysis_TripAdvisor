Hotel is not quite as it appears on the pictures - the front is nothing like. It serves the purpose - it has airconditioning, and good shower, basically everything you need. The breakfast is also fine. We went to another hotel on our return and actually wished we'd booked this one again. It is quite near the MRT - and you need to use it to get to Centre. It is not a close walk to centre as some of the dialogue indicates. The MRT is absolutely fabulous though and makes travel to and from hotel really easy. The staff on reception were helpful.

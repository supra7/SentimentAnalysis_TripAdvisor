I had to chuckle when I read about the garish carpet. It was one of the first things I noticed too in the hallways. It really detracted from the hotel. In any event, the room was nice but very small. Having gone from the Embassy Suite with a huge room to this tiny room was a shock--tiny closet, small bathroom but clean. A number of things didn't work, however, when pointed out to staff, they were right there immediately to fix it and probably other traveler's hadn't mentioned it. Did like that they have recycling. Also, liked the social consciousness of the hotel chain. It had a large TV screen which was great. Parking is very expensive. The parking fellow/bellboy/etc. person was great and made sure we had a map and was very friendly. (Much friendlier than the woman who checked us in who gave us a bad initial feeling about the place). The attached restaurant was good.

This was a good hotel for the price. Walking distance to the shopping area, helpful staff, and decent rooms. Like other reviewers mentioned though, the noise was way too much. Not only was there loud construction going on in the early morning, but I could hear people walking past our room at all hours. The door and walls are so thin that sometimes it sounded like they were in the room with us! If this problem is resolved, I would stay here again.

What a shock when the taxi driver dropped us off . it looked like concrete jungle. But once inside our apartment was much better than expected,2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms large kitchen and large lounge .The whole place was very clean and breakfast was adequate. This was are first time to Dubai but this hotel would not put us off coming again .You need taxis to take you everywhere and a nice place to go for any english / irish people is the Irish village which is about 4.00 in a taxi really good english food .another place to go is The Karama but you must barter with them .

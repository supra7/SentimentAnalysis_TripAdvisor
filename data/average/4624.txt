We have been going to this hotel for 30 years and had our wedding receoption here. After a lapse of 4 years we returned to a hotel with sloppy maid service, carpets and really, really overpriced room service for the quality. The exercise area lacked air conditioning durng this extremely hot week. Concierge desk slow and unhelpful. What a disappointment. With rates at $300+ for an upcomng conference, we are sure there are better options. Especially disappointed that the "Fairmont" touch seems lacking here!!

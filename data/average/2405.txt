I stayed 2 nights with no regrets. Yes the room was small as was the elevator but overall it was clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a working jacuzzi, plenty of towels and some nice extras like shaving cream, razor, toothbrush and toothpaste, pocket comb, and of course, soaps and shampoo. The room had a large screen TV with at least 50 channels of cable and also a new fridge, microwave, coffee machine, clothes iron and ironing board. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location ideal. Sure I could have stayed at a more grand hotel for a extra few hundred dollars, but the money I saved by staying here was better spent on sightseeing and dining. I would recommend this property to family and friends who are looking for a place to stay in Philly who don't need all the glitz and extra cost of a luxury hotel.

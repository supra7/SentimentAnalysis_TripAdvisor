Hotel Max is in a good location, right downtown in just a few minutes from Pike Place Market, great restaurants, etc. It's got a cool rock/music theme, and is a good value. Just be aware, the hotel is a boutique hotel, and has a bit of European sizing, i.e. smaller than Americans may be used to. Depending on the floor you're on, you might have a very, very small bathroom. I was on the 5th floor, but my colleagues on 9th and 10th floors said their bathrooms were small, but not quite as small as mine. All in all, good price, good location, just be prepared for smaller dimensions.

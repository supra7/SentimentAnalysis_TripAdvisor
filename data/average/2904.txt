This is my second visit to this Hotel. After the first visit I thought I found my hotel for my visits to chicago. I did get an upgrade to an executive suite but not a two room like before. the room and maid staff were very good. We did hear sirens on and off all night but this not the hotels fault. However the rest of the staff, something was missing The last time the staff greeted me and always had a smile and went out of the way to help. I would tell other hotels to send their staff to this property to see how to treat guests. I will have to rethink this. Instead of going out of their way to make me feel welcome it seemed that they wanted to avoid any unnecessary guest contact. I was not offered help with my luggage and bags when I was going to the car even after the bellhop asked me if I called for my car. The last visit I would have to fight them off from helping me.

The beach is stunning. The layout of the resort lends itself to tranquility so that even when the resort is at full capacity it does not feel crowded. The entire staff, from housekeeping to reception, the wait staff and grounds keepers are very friendly. We never felt uncomfortable; everyone had a smile and hello to share. With all the restaurants, bar, lounges and daily activity there was so much to do we never felt board with our surroundings.

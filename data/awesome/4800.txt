We could not have picked a better place to have our Honeymoon. The staff was AMAZING, it was so so clean, very nice and elegant. The beach was the whitest, cleanest sand I have ever seen. The food was delish. Anything you needed, they had it. I would recommend a visit to the spa (it was like one of those you see on TV). They had activities everyday and night, we were never bored, however we were the most relaxed we have ever been. If we could have fit that mattress in our suitcase, we would have. The best sleep of our life! This is hands down one of the best!

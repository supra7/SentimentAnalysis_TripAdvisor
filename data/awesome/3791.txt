This resort was by far the best choice for a week long stay in Riviera Maya! We were greeted outside by the shuttle by a number of gentleman who said "Hola and Welcome Home". Very clever. The check in service was efficient, professional and very exclusive. Each time you went in and out of the resort there were always greeters and people to open the doors for you. I felt like a queen. The restaurants were awesome and the entertainment team was outstanding. Very interactive, creative and friendly as they welcomed each guest to join in on the festivities. Quality night time entertainment at the Show Time Theatre. I would definitely recommend this resort for anyone looking for a romantic, beautiful, white sandy beach place.

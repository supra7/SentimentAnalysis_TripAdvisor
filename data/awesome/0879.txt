Agree with previous posts about this hotel's elevators. I stayed 4 nights 8/5 - 8/9. Checked into room early, was given a corner Club room on 34th floor with fabulous views of Elliott Bay, Space Needle, Lake Union. The bed was great. I think I slept better than I had in weeks! The morning Club Level continental breakfast and afternoon snacks were very good. I ordered room service twice, just pizza or sandwich and they arrived promptly. Pizza was actually pretty good! I was impressed with the desk personnel who called me by name each time they saw me. The only mishap I had was locking myself out of my room . . . in my gown when I was putting the room service tray out for housekeeping to pick up. Duh! I went down the hall and heard some people in one of the rooms and knocked. They let me use the phone to call the front desk. A security guard showed up in 3 - 4 minutes! He used the service elevator which apparently is never freed up for the public. The elevators were the only complaint I had during my stay there. We have more business in Seattle and I will definitely stay at Crowne Plaza again! Like the other poster, I will just plan to leave early to catch an elevator!

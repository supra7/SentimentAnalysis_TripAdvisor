Secrets Maroma Beach was the most perfect way to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Romance was easily rekindled amidst pristine beaches, with the softest sands your toes could imagine...dining in the moonlight at Oceans restaurant, while gazing at the lit up pools...and hearing the waves in the near distance. We even got to witness two beautiful weddings! Love is in the air at Secrets! And, it's truly contagious. Expect to be pampered to the max! I highly recommend the couples massage. What a perfect way to begin our Secrets journey. I would highly recommend bug spray...if your not mosquito friendly! They're not terrible...but it might make you more comfortable on nights when they're buzzing. I would also take note that the hotel does not include all non motorized sports as free...which is what we were told. There is a cost. So bring plently of American cash in the event you want to try snorkeling, etc. Aside from this, we were extremely pleased! It was the best way to celebrate our 10 year! Book it now, while the hotel is still new and luxurious! You will not be disappointed. PS...the Miami vice is the perfect cocktail! Enjoy and cheers to you!

I loved my stay at Hotel Vintage Park! I got upgraded at no charge to a King Deluxe Room (the bed was so comfortable! And my friend loved the sofa, but I didn't try it out as a bed). The robes are a very cozy touch, as was the two chocolate chip cookies and sparkling water waiting for me with a hand written note! Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The only thing I did notice in my haze of sleep was the doors of other guest rooms slamming, I guess if you just let the door close it does make a bit of noise. I was on the 8th floor and didn't hear any traffic noise. Ate breakfast two mornings and their belgian waffle was fantastic (I wish they had soft butter vs. pats of cold butter though). They even have a computer you can use by the front desk at no charge.

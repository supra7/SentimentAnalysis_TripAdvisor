Great location within view or shuttle ride from the airport. Princess has the contract for cruise passengers so you'll meet a lot of people coming and going on trips in the lobby or restaurant. Breakfast was delicious in the coffee shop, hot scones with jam and coffee. Other restaurants were withing walking distance of the hotel. There's a concierge desk which I found to be very helpful with questions. Free internet usage in the lobby too! I reserved off Priceline and got a great rate.

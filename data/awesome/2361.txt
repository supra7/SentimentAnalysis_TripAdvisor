We stayed here on our way back home (Anchorage at the time) from our Honey Moon, to look at houses and condos for our future move to Seattle. The hotel was great!!! The location is perfect for shopping and going out, the views were breathtaking from our 38th floor, and our room was squeaky clean. Housekeeping also did a great job at coming in while were gone everyday to clean everything up for us. Of course since this is a premium downtown hotel in Seattle expect to pay to use the WiFi in your room and over $20 to park for a 24 hour period. My only minor complain is when we were checking in and out we had 6 suit cases with us, and not a single person offered to help us out...

When I checked in, I upgraded to a suite with a wonderful view. I was also given access to the lounge, which served some great snacks in the evenings. The breakfast there wasn't bad either. My room was very comfortable and had a great view. The staff here are fantastic! This is a very great location for tourists, you can walk to just about anywhere in downtown. I highly recommend staying at this Crowne Plaza for your next visit to Seattle!

As my boyfriend said..."this is a gamechanger"! I can't imagine going elsewhere - literally everything was top-notch and fabulous. The beach, the food, the drinks, the room, the service. You name it -- it was outstanding. Breakfast buffett can't be beat (I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true), I've never seen one like it. We each gained 5 pounds (Gasp) and are working to lose it so we can come back - next up, Secrets Punta Cana, we think - but would go back to Maroma in a heartbeat!!!

My husband and I chose The Inn at the Market as the place to stay in Seattle for 10 nights. Lengthy stay, so excellent room and good value were priorities. We found the room, and the value was incomparable. Front desk staff was exceptional throughout our visit and made sure we were comfortable upon our early arrival while waiting for our marvelous room on the 7th floor. The location is perfectly central, which means it's noisy, so take ear plugs; however, you'll find the bed very comfortable with its cozy down comforter. Be sure to dine at Cafe Campagne, so French, so delicious, such warm service. There is no question we will return to The Inn every time we visit Seattle!

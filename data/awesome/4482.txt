I have no complaints. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. The employees seem to love their jobs and were always smiling. All the food was delicious especially the steaks at the Seaside Grill. Our drinks were never empty and we had a very relaxing time. Our room was beautiful...would give it 5 stars. We had the swim out room and the weather was a little cool a couple nights but we still managed to use the pool a few times. I read reviews on a lot of resorts and this one had very positive reviews, so that is why I chose this one. It was my first all inclusive ever ( usually we cruise) and we were very satisfied. They set the standards high for any other all inclusive we go on. Stay here and you will be glad you did. Also the beach was beautiful. We took a snorkeling trip that we booked on the property which took us out for an hour to the second largest reef in the world. What a great experience. We enjoyed the entertainment at night, the entertainment staff was great. Some day I would love to go back.

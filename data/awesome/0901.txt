I have stayed at this hotel three times, each time for 5 days or more, and I will definitely be back. The hotel is very, very reasonably priced, in a nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants and coffee shops, and well connected to downtown or the Seattle Center. Best of all the service is AWESOME: the front desk is extraordinarily helpful with requests small and large. The rooms are basic but they are extremely clean, and the kitchenettes are a big plus. The hotel doesn't do continental breakfast any more, but there is always coffee available in the lobby, and with the kitchenettes and nearby grocery stores it is no problem to do-it-yourself. The one downside is that on Friday and Saturday nights it can sometimes be noisy when the bars let out. I recommend calling the hotel directly to reserve as you can get better rates than what is available on-line.

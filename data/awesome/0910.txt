I chose the Inn at Queen Anne for location, because it is literally across the street from the Key Arena where I was attending an event. It is also smack in the middle of the Lower Queen Anne district of Seattle with its excellent range of inexpensive, decent restaurants. With the wildly contradictory reviews recorded here I just had to find out for myself. I was 100% satisfied with the friendly staff, clean room and level of comfort. It is a budget hotel, so of course it is going to a little dated. If you want creature comforts pay for them somewhere else. But if you want a pleasant atmosphere in a lovely neighbourhood, at a very reasonable price I highly recommend this place. A continental breakfast was included, with 24-hour tea and coffee. There was parking on the street or in the hotel's nearby lot. The rooms are equipped with a simple kitchenette, and there is air conditioning. The only drawback is lack of elevators. Their sister hotel the MarQueen is one street over and little more upscale, but for the money the Inn at Queen Anne exceeded expectations.

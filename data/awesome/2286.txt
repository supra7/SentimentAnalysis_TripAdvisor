My wife and I stayed a night in one of the suites. All the basics met or exceeded our expectations and there were plenty of fun extras as well (french press for making coffee, rather than a typical coffee maker; good quality coffee from a small roaster, rather than the typical S***bucks crap; two large-screen TVs; plenty of seating in the sitting room). One thing to bear in mind is that (as far as we could tell), there's only one very small and very slow elevator. My wife and I are stairs people, so we weren't particularly troubled, but I can see how this might be an inconvenience for obligate elevator users.

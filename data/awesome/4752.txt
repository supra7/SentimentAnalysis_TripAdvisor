My wife and I just spent our honeymoon at Secrets Maroma, and it was outstanding. I guess I would best describe it as a cruise on land. Everything is included (except spa and some other stuff that we didn't get) and that makes it so enjoyable. We were pretty dead-set on honeymooning in NYC, but we decided that having everything paid for up front would be a better idea. We were very impressed with the quality of service and attention to detail. The resort had a "Honeymooners" banner on the door and a bottle of champagne waiting in the room. The food was good, but not great. I would recommend eating a big breakfast at the buffet and grabbing lunch at the grill. The beach is ridiculous with the clearest water I've ever seen. Overall, I would highly recommend Secrets Maroma and would definitely consider staying at another Secrets Resort.

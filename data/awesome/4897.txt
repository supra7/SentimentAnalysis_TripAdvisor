Just got back from a 4 day trip to Secrets for a friends 40th birthday celebration. I cannot say enough about the service at this resort, the staff is wonderful. The beach is gorgeous and the sand is as fine as baby power. If you get a chance to go to Himitsu and book the teppanyaki table, the show and food were amazing. Take advantage of the spa credits you receive when you check in, the back,neck and shoulders massage was great. I will be going back to Secrets one day, hopefully soon. One note: bring bug spray, if you do get rain at night the mosquitos are out in full force.

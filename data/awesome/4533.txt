My husband and I visited Secrets Maroma for our honeymoon in late Oct/Nov. I had done a TON of research before I choose Secrets Maroma all over the Carribean and I am SO happy we choose SMB. The place is IMPECCIBLE. Clean, modern, sophisticated, intimate etc. We stayed in 2 rooms (we upgraded to the preferred club) and they were both fantastic. The 14 building was private and secluded and the 26 building was beachfront. Both were beyond my expectations. The restaurants were all very good. Take it from a jaded NY'r, this was GREAT vacation food for a resort. Shrimp cocktail by the pool daily..yum! Although the Italian resto seems to get a bad review on here, I would try it. We had a nice meal there. The Mexican resto was also a fave. A tip- ask for double's for all drinks OR drink beer. The alcohol is watered down and ritefully so. People would be bombed all over the place. The pools were fantastic and we had NO problem getting a chair EVER. Kevin, the pool concierge is a one of kind. He deserves every tip he gets. Dont miss the beach. Take a day or 2 and lay out there - you wont regret it. The ocean is warm and clear. We spa'd daily. It was MUCH needed and was SUPER clean and very relaxing. Last, but not least is the staff here. They are the hardest working people I have ever seen. They are all so happy and kind to the guests. The entertainment crew is fun and not pushy or cheesy. I dont know how the staff remember names, but they do. We never got a NO to anythign we asked. TIP THEM! They deserve it. We miss our Secrets Maroma!! Cant wait to go back!!!!

We stayed here one night en route to a land tour in Alaska. Also stayed last year for one night. This is an excellent hotel. Very comfortable rooms after a long flight from UK. Free wi fi. We were given excellent help and assistance for our trip to the airport in the morning. The 'welcomer' arranged a special transport which was greatly appreciated. Best service anywhere yet . Chocolate chip cookies are good too!

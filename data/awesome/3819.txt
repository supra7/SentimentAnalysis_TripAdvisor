I've never written a review before but having visited this hotel off the back of the reviews here I thought I should. All I will say is this...I've been travelling for years and I have never before left anywhere having already planned how we can return to the same hotel - we've always felt you should try something different. There is nothing that we could come up with for the hotel to improve. Worth every penny, cannot recommend highly enough.

I cannot say enough about Secrets Maroma Beach. I went into this trip with high expectations and they were met and exceeded. The staff members at Secrets Maroma Beach are helpful, extremely friendly, many remember you by name and any information you share about yourself, and sincere. In particular, Cecilia Reyes (our wedding planner/coordinator) was truly a gem. Throughout the year long planning process she was responsive to emails, organized, and very friendly. Upon our arrival she had everything under control and the wedding was exactly how I envisioned it. Even when a surprise storm came in after the ceremony Cecilia and her team were able to disassemble our outdoor reception and setup everything again in one of the private rooms inside one of the restaurants. This was accomplished without any stress or decisions to be made by me or the bridal party. In the rating of other aspects of the hotel, the food was served in small portions but was generally good, the beaches were pristine, the rooms were comfortable and clean, and the other areas of the hotel were spotless and comfortable. This is truly a place where I cannot wait to return!

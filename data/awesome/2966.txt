We stayed at Hotel Max for one night and wished we were there for a week! THE TEAM is wonderful, they helped us navigate and the directions were simple and brought us right to the front door where the valet greeted us and had an energizing conversation with my fianc about soccer -it was the perfect welcome, everyone at Hotel Max is genuinely friendly. THE ROOM we stayed in was a king room -they did a fantastic job with the space in the room, it was stylish, simple and had beautiful artwork. The best part the robes, you could live in them, they are so comfortable and I have it on my Christmas wish list! The bed was a CLOUD and the room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, we slept like rocks. THE HOTEL corridors are very sexy with black and white prints on the doors. They did a great job synergizing their concept and really offering a unique experience. The lobby is comfortable as well as modern and outside they have lounge furniture: kind of like an urban resort feel. THE RESTAURANT, Red Fin was perfect we had the late night menu, great menu! we had edamame beans and chilli toasted cashews delicious perfect late night snack with some wine ;) I am not a fan of cookie cutter chain hotels and aim to stay at interesting and passionate properties and will stay at Hotel Max every time I visit Seattle, as well we will recommend Hotel Max to any friends or family that are taking trips to the city.

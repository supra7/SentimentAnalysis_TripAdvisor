We stayed here for 6 nights to celebrate our honeymoon. We had never been to an all inclusive resort before and this place was better than we could have ever imagined. All the staff, from the pool attendants to the concierge went out of their way and bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed. The food at all the restaurants was wonderful. The Seaside Grille was our favorite. You need to get to the pool early to get good chairs. We never had a problem finding chairs on the beach and went mostly in the afternoons. The maid service and turn-down service was great. I can't emphasize how friendly and helpful the entire staff was. Since it was our honeymoon we decided to go for the preferred club, swim out suite. We always seemed to have the swim out pool to ourselves and the preferred club bar was definitely worth it. Exclusive bar with 3 computers and internet, lounge area, continental breakfast in the mornings, drinks all day and snacks throughout the day. All in all, we were VERY impressed with our experience and would absolutely recommend this resort to anyone headed to Playa del Carmen.

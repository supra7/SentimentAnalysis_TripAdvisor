My wife and I just got back from our trip at Cancun, staying at the Secrets Maroma. All I have to say is WOW! We were truly amazed. We read all the reviews, and they were right on. This place ROCKS! Everyone, and I mean everyone is so friendly, they really make you feel at home. And go out of their way for you. We had the Ocean view front swim out and it was amazing. Great room, spacious, clean, secluded with a great view. Their is water everywhere you turn. It's gorgeous. Like any place, there are always a few cons. I hate to even list them...but maybe these tips will help you out. The food unfortunately was hit or miss. They have many restaurants and mostly are very good. Funny thing, the Mexican was not that great. And the French place, from what he heard from other guests was not great either. But the Italian place was great. The buffet by the pool was not great. TIP, order food from the waiter, it's much better. The breakfast buffet was the best. I still miss that buffet! The entertainment crew were great! There was always something to do. Or you could just chill out with a drink by the pool or ocean. And the ocean was the most gorgeous I've seen. Clear water, white/warm plush sand. You can even feed the starfish. They will come right up to you for some bread. The drinks were always good also. If you want top shelf, just ask for it. NO questions asked. I highly recommend this place for any romantic get away. We'll be back!

We stayed at this hotel for 1 night arriving Saturday and departing Sunday. We chose the hotel because of the central location. It is one block away from the monorail station to the Seattle Center (including the space needle). It is also close walking distance to many of the downtown stores as well as the tourist attractions like the Pike Place Market. I've included pictures below which offer some perspective on the location. The hotel has 2 round towers (north and south). We were on the 26th floor with a view out of the city towards the bay and the space needle. We were able to see our cruise ship when it docked that morning. However, since the hotel is round the views will vary greatly from room to room. There are also a number of new high rise buildngs in the area so these can also block the view. We noticed noise from several of the adjoining rooms, at one point, just as we were falling asleep, the best description was someone threw there shoe against the wall. But this quieted down soon afterwards. We also noticed the elevator going up and down but it was more of a "feeling" than an "irritation". We had to wait often for the elevators, athough it seems that maybe at least one wasn't working properly. We advised the hotel and it seemed to improve after that. One thing we did notice is that they do not allow luggage to be taken on the escalator (they had an employee stationed there) and you had to go up a level from the parking level to the lobby (and vice versa). These elevators also serviced the south tower. When we arrived, there was a very long line of people waiting for the elevator. Not sure if this is just an occurance when large groups are arriving/leaving but you should plan time just in case. Also, if you come by car, they offer 2 parking options, self park ($36) and valet ($39) per day with in and out privileges and these are both located on the 6th avenue side of the hotel.

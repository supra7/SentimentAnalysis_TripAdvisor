I had a great time staying at the Hotel Max. I paid to park in a lot a few blocks away, which was cheaper. The staff was helpful and friendly. Had dinner in the bar and got dry cleaning done. Room was small, but didn't feel that way. No real view from my window but within walking distance to Pikes and other attractions. Close to the space needle and monorail, also.

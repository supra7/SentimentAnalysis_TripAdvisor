My girlfriend and I spent 2 nights over the long weekend (American Thanksgiving) in Nov here. We found it to be hip and modern - if you are a Holiday Inn or Traveller's Lodge type of "vacationer", this place is probably not the place for you. The hotel is in a lovely historic building - which puts some obvious space constraints to the rooms, etc. However, its no different than your modern European hotels (this is what this place reminded me of). We had an awesome corner room on the 9th floor, and street noise was not an issue (as previous reviews suggested). The bed was amazingly comfortable, reminded me of the "Heavenly Beds" you get at the Westin. I highly would recommend this hotel if you want a unique, modern, hip experience in Seattle. Its good value too. The front desk staff was amazingly friendly, and the valet parking is a nice touch ($25/day w/in-out privileges is not bad for downtown). The restaurant beside it is convenient for quick breakfast bites (good) or a drink, but if you are in Seattle on vacation, not sure why anyone would eat at a hotel restaurant period when there are so many great places around (i.e. Pike Market). The location is pretty central to all the shopping and to Pike (about 3-4 blocks). The next time I am Seattle, I would definitely stay here again (and recommend it to friends too). Pros: - modern, hip and "different" - friendly front desk staff - valet parking - very comfortable queen bed Cons: - small bathrooms, but functional

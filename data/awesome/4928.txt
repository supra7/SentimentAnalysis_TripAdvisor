Great resort!!!! Fabulous food and service. The security was tight and I always felt extremely safe. The resort is deceiving at first glance when you arrive. You drive down a long dirt road, and the initial entrance is nothing much, but once you pass the second checkpoint and enter the compound it is very evident that the resort is 5+ star! This is on one of the nicest beaches I have ever been on. We are scuba divers and it was really great to be able to arrange dives on-site through aquaworld, and then leave directly from our beach. We will be returning for sure!

The Hotel Monaco in Downtown Seattle is an exceptional hotel; not just for its great location in the heart of the city, not just for the excellent and clean facility, price and room quality but primarily for its staff. From doorman to manager the Monaco excels in delivering an exceptional customer experience in making you feel welcome everytime you step through the front door. When visiting it is a must to experience the wine reception or a beverage in the bar and to take the time to get to know the staff.

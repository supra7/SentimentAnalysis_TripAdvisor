This was a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal. Steps to shopping and many restaurants. Staff was very friendly, we arrived at noon and they let us have our room right away, which was appreciated. The room was immaculate. The little kitchen area was convenient and beautiful, grantie countertops, equipped with microwave, stove, sink, coffee/espresso/cappucino machine. The bedroom was a separate room, closed off from the rest of the suite with sliding doors. The living area was nice and spacious as was the balcony, furnished with tables and chairs to sit outside. Bathroom was beautiful but didn't have a bath tub, just a large shower. Would definitely stay here again!

I booked this hotel through a discount website service and called the hotel chain 4 days prior to the booking to reconfirm. The agent on the phone was very helpful as was the reception staff when I checked in. Although the hotel does not have waterfront views, I was offered a room higher up in the hotel to provide the best views of the city possible. This type of service continued throughout my visit. Staff at the concierge desk and reception desk tried their hardest to help me resolve my WiFi connection problems in the lobby; it turned out I needed to physically move myself closer to their lobby computer center which also provided free internet access. The room was attractive and spacious. Elevator service was plentiful and speedy. I would definitely stay here again.

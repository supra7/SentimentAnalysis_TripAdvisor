From the moment our car pulled up to the sidewalk, to the check in which took less than one minute, service at this hotel was something sweet. Room was comfortable and nice, great amenities, excellent room service breakfast without having to go to an ATM machine or getting a mortgage on the house, this place is a great value. Close to downtown shopping and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again!

Picked this hotel for its location. We were able to take the Link from the airport to within one block on the hotel. The hotel is connected to a mall which is also connected to the monorail which goes to the Space Needle. We were within close walking distance to Pike's Market and the downtown shopping area. The hotel staff was extremely helpful in guiding us around. I was very happy I choose this hotel.

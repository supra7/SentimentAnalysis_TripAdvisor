The registration staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Antonio. Our room was wonderful and housekeeping was prompt and professional. We had no problem finding chairs at the pool despite the annoying people who saved chairs at the crack of dawn and never showed up. I found it interesting that signs were posted and yet the guests never thought it pertained to them. The food served poolside was also terrific. I did not enjoy watching other people practically wash their hands in the serving dishes trying to get more to eat. I'm sure the resort has never run out of food so I don't know why these people acted like they were going to. I would also like to see the resort become smoke free.

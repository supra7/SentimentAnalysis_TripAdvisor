A large group (20+) stated at Hotel Andra. There staff should hold classes on customer service to other in the hotel industry. The shuttle service recommended by the hotel TOWNCAR PLEASE LLC is very friendly and have great prices. You should use them to for airport transportion. The bathroom is small but clean and functional. Rooms are larger than normal. Location could not be any better. Truely walking distance to everything and I hate walking.

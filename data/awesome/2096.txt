My wife and I recently stayed two nights at the Edgewater. We chose a water view room with the king bed. We had only been to Seattle one time previously; on our Honeymoon 18 years ago. When we chose the Edgewater we did so due to its close proximity to the Bell Harbor Marina since we were meeting my father there to join his for a few days of sailing. So when we arrived to the Edgewater we were impressed with the great service and relaxing dcor. Our room was clean, beautiful, and had an outstanding view of Puget Sound AND a great view of part of the city. Yes the room was a little more expensive than some others around Seattle, but it was worth it for several reasons; cleanliness, service, comfort, dcor, and location. We really enjoyed our stay at the Edgewater and we will stay there next time we go to Seattle, we highly recommend the Edgewater.

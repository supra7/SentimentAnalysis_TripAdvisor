My husband and I have stayed here on several occasions. We live in Seattle but this is our favorite in town getaway. They have a great bar, with excellent drinks. I have had great service everytime I have been there. It is a little dark in the hallways but I feel like that is a W thing that is common with most W's. My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary and somehow somone found out and they sent us chocolate cover strawberries, a very nice touch on our special evening. The only downfall is vallet parking there is 50 dollars!!! but for an every once in awhile spludge its ok but if you are comoing from out of town i would recomend getting a taxi here. The location is excellent, it is walking distance to everything: shopping, Pike Place Market, and the Stadiums. I highly recomend this hotel.

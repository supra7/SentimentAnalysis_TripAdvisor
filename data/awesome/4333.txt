Everything was great with the exception that 3 mornings we had no hot water to take a shower, the best we could do was lukewarm, which was unpleasant. I am not sure what the problem was, but we reported it before we left. The service was wonderful, the food was great, the atmosphere was good and we enjoyed our stay. The spa was an experience to have, it was outstanding.

The room was lovely - lots of space and plenty of comfort. The rooftop deck provided spectacular views of Puget Sound, the Olympic Mountains and surrounding attractions. The staff was friendly and welcoming; they really made us feel right at home, and the location was perfect, of course! We will definitely stay here anytime we return to Seattle.

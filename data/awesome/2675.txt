The good: just very friendly service, and a clean, comfortable hotel. Nice bed, great sheets, strong shower. All the things I look for in a hotel. Liked the extra amenities, and the selection in the mini-bar was almost enough to draw me in. I am fussy, so here are things that didn't quite measure up. I think I was in a smaller room but it did feel... cozy. Had I not been alone, I suspect it would have felt a bit crowded. There was no view to speak of, and the noise from the alley was annoying, as was the noise of slamming hotel doors. Nothing that made me reach for my earplugs. Safe was locked when I checked in, but they came up immediately to open it when I mentioned it. The faucet was strangely lacking in flow, and I was relieved that this wasn't the case for the shower. In all, eminently forgivable offences. Overall, if you are looking for a smaller hotel, this is a good way to go, and an excellent value.

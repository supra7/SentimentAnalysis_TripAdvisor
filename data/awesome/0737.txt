We stayed in the hotel over Easter and throughly enjoyed our time there. It is superably located for exploring Seattle especially the Market and the rooms were of a good size. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and the reception area is very welcoming. Our only 'criticism' would be that our room was next to a fire exit stairwell and at night we could hear the rumbling of what I assume was something like the air conditioning pipes.

This is a gem of a place. It's the one clean, upscale Hotel I could find in the heart of downtown Seattle that had double rooms for under $100 a night. The booking staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and made it easy for me to unexpectedly extend my stay. There is free access to a computer in the Hotel lobby - so if you don't have a Wi-Fi ready computer with you, you still have Internet access here. There is no breakfast served in the Hotel, but you are within walking distance of many coffee/bakery shops and of a 24-hour McDonald's. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I would definitely book into the Moore!

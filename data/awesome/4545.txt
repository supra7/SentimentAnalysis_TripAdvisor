This place was amazing. The staff were so incredibly friendly and willing to service your every wish. We upgraded our stay to the "preferred club" and I think it was well worth it. The soaker tub on the balcony was nice and the view was unbelievable. We did tip all staff (spent about $100 in 7 days) but it was because we wanted to not because we had to. Staff don't expect it and don't treat you differently if you do or don't tip. The pool is very clean and it's not too cold. The beach is also very clean and the sand is soft. I love it here... and would go back.

We recently stayed here after coming back into Seattle after a cruise. We arrived much earlier in the morning than we expected on our check in date with luggage in hand. They were very helpful in taking our luggage, and getting us pre-checked in so we could begin our Seattle sightseeing. They also changed our room to accomodate us despite it being different than how we booked (changing from King size to two Queens). The room was very nice, and the beds very comfortable. We took advantage of the free wine tasting both evenings we were there and it was excellent. The wines from local vineyards were very good, and they were liberal with the refills. It was a nice time also to sit and talk with other people from around the country and get tips on local places to visit while in Seattle. Also great downtown location, within walking distance to most popular areas to see in Seattle, or if not within range of the free local bus (within a free zone). Only knock at all would be no free wifi, but not a big deal. If we return to Seattle we will definitely try to stay here again.

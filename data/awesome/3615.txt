This hotel was beautiful. The manager and staff were very friendly and extremely helpful by going out of their way to provide excellent customer service. The hotel was clean, the beds were soft and the pillows were very comfortable in contrast with most hotel pillows. The showers and bathroom areas were clean and everything was neat and tidy. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Great price, great service, would definitely come back!

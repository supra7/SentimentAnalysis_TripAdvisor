As an add-on to a work trip, I booked two days at the Andra for my birthday, based on the web-site and positive reviews here. I must say, I left being a little obsessed with the place. 1. I was upgraded to the suite, which of course is just a larger room with a couch. However, it was a very snazzy couch. I asked to see a regular room so I would be able to see what I paid for. It was a standard size room, but... 2. The blue and beige Scandanavian-inspired color scheme is quite striking. I understand that in five years it will need to be redone or it will look both dated and frayed, but for now it is a cut above similarly priced entries. 3. Fascinated by other problems with restaurant smells, I am almost disappointed to say I had no such problems. However, I did have breakfast at Lola. Expensive, but delicious. No octopus for me, but the smashed potatoes were scrumptuous. 4. I cannot abide a hotel that doesn't have a computer room with free acccess. The Lola provides. There is also a workout room. It's small, but I overheard a staff member saying they are planning to move it to a larger space. 5. My local friend told me they pumped a ton of money into this and it shows. But as always, it's the little things that make an impact. I liked the design of the paper coasters. 6. Have you noticed that many new hotel designs don't provide for much in the way of drawerspace? Is everyone living out of their suitcases? I'm sorry, but I like to unpack. 7. Parking is valet only, and quite high compared to the room cost. You can park across the street in a garage and save about $7 a day. But if you're like me and winging it carless, it's not an issue.

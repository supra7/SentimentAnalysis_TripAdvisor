Very nice hotel in Belltown next to downtown. Very nice rooms with comfortable beds and Frette sheets. Staff is very nice and helpful after all it's a relatively small hotel. Don't stay here though if you like big bathrooms - the hotel is a renovated older building and the bathrooms are tiny by modern standards. Still everything else is quite luxurious - the hotel is very clean, very quiet and the people are exceptionally nice.

Prepaid rate on hilton.com $84 a night. Excellent rate for 2 people 2 beds. Free shuttle from rental car drop off location. Decent wireless internet access. All staff extremely helpful: front desk, housekeeping, shuttle driver, bell person. Front desk let me use their printer to print some business docs, for free at 9pm. Prompt and free shuttle for early AM flight. Quiet and odor free room. Too many feather products, but the housekeeping staff was prompt at bringing replacements without feathers for the bed. Good in room coffee.

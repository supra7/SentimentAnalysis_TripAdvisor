What a place!!! We stayed in Building 15 and had a swimout suite. It was an outstanding place. Very relaxing!! Palo the guy at the pool was great!! He made sure we were taken care of everyday we were there!! Richardo at Bldg 15 checked with us everyday to see if there was anything he could do for us!! LOVED THE SWIMOUT SUITE!!!

From the moment we got out of the car infront of Secrets Maroma we were greeted with champagne and hot towels and the warmest welcome ever! We went inside and sat with the conciererge and check in. Than they personally walked us up to our room and walked us inside. The room was absolutely amazing our view from our balcony was ridicoulous! I think they walk you inside just to see your face when you see their beautiful rooms! I can't say enough about this resort. Our trip was absolutely magical. The food was the best i've ever had being away. The service was top notch. The staff can't do enough for you!! The beach and the pool were amazing. We never had a problem finding a chair no matter what time of day we went. The staff always made sure you had a drink in you hand and a smile on your face. We are definitely planning on coming back we had such a great time and truely were able to relax. I highly recommend this resort to anyone and everyone!!!!

The Westin Seattle, 1900 5th Avenue, Seattle, Washington, 98101, United States There is something about this city that captures your heart. Im not sure if it is Alaskan Highway or the absolutely delicious Dungeness crab, or simply, the Seattle street vibe. There is something about Seattle that makes you fall in love with the city from the first day on. We stayed at the Westin Seattle hotel downtown which is a twin tower high-rise hotel, 47-storey high. The hotel is very comfortable and the view from our room was absolutely breath taking. The hotel is just steps away from the Washington State Convention Center, Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. You can find great food in the lobby at the Coldwater Bar and Grill and free internet access (in the lobby of the hotel only). We arrived by air at the SeaTac Airport (featured in Greys Anatomy!) and took the Link Light Rail system that extends south from the city core to SeaTac Airport. Three companies headquartered in Seattle are on the Fortune 500 list of the United States largest companies: the Internet retailer Amazon.com, coffee chain Starbucks, and, my favourite, Nordstrom department store!

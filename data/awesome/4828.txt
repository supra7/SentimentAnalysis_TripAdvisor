My Husband and I went for a week to Secrets Maroma Beach to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. Since we arrived, we were surprised to discover how cordial the hotel staff was and how they all made us feel right at home. Service was outstanding, every person working at the hotel had a smile, a hello to say and a desire to help us with even the smallest thing we needed or wanted. The food in the many restaurants was superb! It was delicious! You can choose a different place to eat everyday ... some of them are fancy with gourmet quality. Very hard to believe for an "all inclusive" hotel. At times, it felt that we ate all day long! Before lunch, the pool staff pampers the guests with finger food, such as sushi, shrimp, etc. The night activities were great. We loved the "rock show", something you don't want to miss as well as the Caribbean and Mexican night! The day activities were a lot of fun. They usually start every 30 minutes (beach volleyball, beach soccer, bike riding, tennis, water aerobics, kayaking, etc.) If you wish, you can also be very relaxed and in a calm and quite environment Talking about the facilities, I can tell you that the hotel is less than 20 minutes from Playa del Carmen. It's located in the most beautiful beach you can ever visit and it's so relaxing, you won't want to go back home! The Hotel is of Mediterranean style, you will love it! The rooms are beautiful and are super clean (spotless) ..... a dream come true! We stayed in an ocean view suite. It was on the 4th floor and had a king size very comfortable bed, the bathtub and bedroom are barely separated from each other and in the balcony you have a little one person pool to cool-off and relax. We highly recommend this hotel. We loved it and we will definitely come back.

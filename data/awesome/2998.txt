Everything about the Hotel is awesome my only complaint was that upon arriving to check in I was told that there was going to be a $75 dollar charge to my card, that really seems extreme and missing leading. Coming to the city with only a certain about of money doesn't permit such charges,if I had known forehand I would have not come to Hotel Max. Thankfully the Agent was able to help me by cutting back the extra amenities. Thank you for that, my trip would have been ruined besides the fact I prepaid for the entire cost of the room. Will I return? Yes I want to say I will although a $75 charge after booking the room and paying all up front costs makes me hesitant to return...where is that policie written?

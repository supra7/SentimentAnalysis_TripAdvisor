Having stayed in Cancun several times at adult only all inclusives, I would say this was our favourite. The rooms are not as good as the Excellence rooms - they are more rustic and smaller but everything else is much better. Had I not been to the Excellence I would not have compared and therefore the rooms are pretty nice. 1. The pool is heated and the sunbeds are really comfy. 2. The service is amazing even if you don't tip and this includes the chefs who bring snacks to you at your sunbed every day at about noon. 3. The restaurants are fab. It is like eating in a gourmet restaurant every night. Faves were Italian and French. 4. The Xmas and New Year parties were out of this world and by far the best we have ever been to. 5. The grounds are lovely and peaceful it was total relaxation. The beach is beautiful the sand is like talcum powder. 6. The entertainment staff are really friendly and not pushy. Loved it but it is more a couples romantic resort than a groups resort.

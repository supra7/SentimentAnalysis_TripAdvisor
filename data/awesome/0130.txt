Love, love, love hotel Monaco in Seattle. This hotel went above and beyond. We were greeted with a friendly smile and hello. Our room was upgraded to the Monaco Suite due to it being my birthday; and they even sent up a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a birthday card. They have a wine coctail party in the lobby with free wine from 5-6 every evening and a free psychic card reader on W & Sat. evenings. The restaurant in the hotel (Sazarac) is a must try; they have happy hour from 4-8 M-F and great food. The chef here is incredible and a genius with food. The hotel is within walking distance to everything fun in Seattle. Pike place market, space needle, waterfront for ferries and you must stop into Kell's Irish Pub....it's a fvery fun place with live entertainment. Easy access from the airport using the LINK system monorail for $2.50 exit University street. Walk one block and you are at hotel Monoco! Can't wait to come back soon!!

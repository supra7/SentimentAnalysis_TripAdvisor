I chose the hotel because it is close to the airport and had a great parking package for my early morning flight. It was not just a great deal for the room but also a very nice hotel experience. The lobby and guest rooms have just been remodeled and are very clean and modern looking. The crew was actually finishing installing some internet lines while I was there and they said it was the last step in the million dollar investment. The place looks great and I would absolutely recommend it. The comments I see below must have come before the remodel as they do not even come close to fitting the hotel I saw and enjoyed. It is a great place to stay.

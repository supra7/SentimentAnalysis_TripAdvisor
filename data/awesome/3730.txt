We have just returned from 14 nights at Secrets. It wasnt a honeymoon nor were we celebrating anything so this is a review that is unclouded by feelings! Pros - Great staff - helpful and friendly and will do their utmost to solve any problems, all premium drinks are included - without exception apart from wine, beach is beautiful, pools are great, some are quiet and the main one is noisy according to how many guests are there, plenty of shade everywhere, sunbed reserving is NOT allowed so no arguing over them, clean rooms, service is excellent - they even get in a kayak and bring lunch to you!, hairdryer is adequate for the girls, shampoo, body cream and shower gel are provided - no hair conditioner though but all are Gilchrist and Soames. See Anali on the beach, Clayder at Tortuga Bar, Limbeth at Portofino and Alberto at Bldg 24 (concierge) for the best staff service that we encountered. We had a Swim up room which is def worth the money, a swim in the afternoon is a great way to end the day. Cons - Very few but the Barefoot Grill needs a larger grill to avoid queuing in the sun, people need to be told not to feed the lizards on the rocks (saw people giving them cake), air con to remain on all the time rather than being on a movement sensor - especially at night, maybe a run path all the way round the resort instead of being inside in the gym. Mexican restaurant could have a more 'Mexican' menu for me but I dont have alot of experience in true Mex food to compare. The Cons are very small things and overall our stay was probably one of the best we've had and we've had a lot, all over the world. This is a great resort and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, we will be back!

We stayed at the hotel from april 7 to the 14. The beach is very nice. You can walk for several kilometers on both sides of the hotel. Super important for us was the fact that no sales pleople bothered us at the hotel or on the beach. The food was excellent. The ambiance wonderfull. The decor in the restaurants really mimick the romantic essence of France, Italy and the Mexican Rriviera. We also appreciated the fact that a la carte restaurants where available for lunch. You eat much healthier and less.The romantic diners on the beach or by the pool are well worth the expense of a bottle of wine not included with this service. No need to get up early to find a seat by the pool or at the beach.They are well organized to accomodate all their guests. , Bravo .. a trip well worth the money spent.. They are all about the details.......

We had a room right on the water. Expensive, but worth it since we were only staying one night and the next day our Alaskan cruise departed from next door. We could see the cruise ship out our window and feed seagulls at the same time. My husband has Parkinson's so we asked for a room with grab bars in the bathroom. Our room was right off the lobby, quiet and convenient. The hotel reminded me of a smaller version of the Grand Teton Lodge in Wyoming. It had the same ambiance. Unique decoration that lends itself to the feeling of being in a classy hunting lodge. The Six Seven restaurant is outstanding in both decor and food. Would not hesitate to recommend it. If you're looking for a unique hotel experience, this is it. It is expensive and I wouldn't stay there for very long due to the price. When we returned from the cruise we stayed an additional 3 days in Seattle but switched to a less expensive hotel.

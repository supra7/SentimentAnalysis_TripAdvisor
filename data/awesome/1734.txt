I have been staying at Sixth Avenue Inn every month for 2+ years. I am an "older" graduate student at Antioch University, and this has been my home when in Seattle. The Belltown location is fantastic  lots of great restaurants, 5 blocks to Whole Foods, easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, Downtown, Seattle Center and the Space Needle, and a transit hub at Westlake to get anywhere in the city you need to go. But the most important quality is the staff  I cannot praise them highly enough! From my first stay there, everyone has gone out of their way to make sure I have everything I need. From the front desk, to the restaurant, to maintenance and housekeeping, to management, they provide 5-star (maybe 6-star) service  better than I often get in so-called luxury hotels (I travel a lot on business). If you want a modest, spotlessly clean, well-located city location for your Seattle stay, with a welcome that makes you know that they are TRULY glad you are there, check out the Sixth Avenue Inn!

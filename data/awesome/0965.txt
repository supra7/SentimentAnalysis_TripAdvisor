If you're looking for a great base to stay in Seattle, try the Marqueen. The rooms were formerly small apartments. Ours had a small sitting room, bedroom, bath, efficiency kitchen and breakfast room. The staff was terrific and the location in the Queen Anne neighborhood was excellent. An included small continental breakfast (granola bar and coffee) was a good quick bite. (Don't miss the weekday breakfast and happy hour across the street at Petit Toulouse and Pesos...awesome!) There is an entrance to Cafe Ladro (killer coffee) within the hotel, and room service is available from the cafe and two adjoining restaurants...perfect! Also, the hotel wine reception actually featured decent wines! Use the bus system for easy transport around the city. The rooms were ever so slightly down on the heel...think of it as character. Everything was very clean, though. I'd definitely stay there again.

From the warm greeting we received from Lane at the front desk, to the fabulous room, the wine tasting, the restaurant downstairs, it was all wonderful. We didn't want to leave the room the entire trip. What a great place! Quiet, clean, friendly, comfortable. There are more adjectives to describe Vintage Park and they're all good.

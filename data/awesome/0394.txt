Rather than choosing our conference hotel for our trip to Seattle, we opted for the Inn at the Market and we were totally thrilled. The Inn was not only strategically located within a block of Pike's Market and some of the best restaurants in Seattle, but was also within a few blocks walking distance to the Washington State Conference Center. We used the light-rail from the airport to West Lake Center (great shopping) and only walked 2 blocks to the hotel and the monorail is also very close by for easy access to the EMP and the theatres. We had a modest room on the 8th floor of city-side.The queen-size bed to luxurious with first quality linens and the bathroom was stocked with thick fluffy towels and warm bathrobes. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Although January is not an ideal time for scenic views, I recommend that everyone venture out for a spectacular view of the bay and mountains. We definitely plan to return and would not consider staying anywhere but The Inn on the Market.

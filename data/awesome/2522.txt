Long weekend that was made all the more memorable with an attentive and courteous staff. Great location. Stayed in the North tower with a room overlooking the bay. Others have commented about dated rooms but this one was clean. Do park next door for $18.00. There's a catwalk to the second floor of the hotel. $38.00 a day for self park is a little much even for Seattle.

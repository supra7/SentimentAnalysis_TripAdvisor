I called before I arrived and the staff was so friendly and helped me arrange dinner reservations for when I arrived. Hotel Monaco is only a couple blocks from the light rail, so from the Seattle Airport it is only $2.75pp. Get off at University. Just a 30 minute ride. Easy. When checking in again the staff was so nice and the room was good size and clean. The only negative is request another blanket for the bed. There is no bed covering. We just like the feel of a heavier blanket. Food at Sazar was good and reasonable. Busy at the bar at night. We really enjoyed our stay at the Monaco. You can walk to everything. Just if you go down to the pier it is a heavy climb back to the hotel, so just get a taxi, it is only $4. OH and the Seattle libary is right across the street. I would recommend this hotel if visiting Seattle.

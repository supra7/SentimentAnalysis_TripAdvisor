We felt very special. There was nothing we could have wanted-everything was there that we needed. We appreciate how hard everyone worked to make our vacation comfortable, fun and enjoyable. Everyone there was great! My favorite part is the beach. Not so favorite, is the lack of cool air in the lobby & theater. Thank you to Mr. Eric, Vianney and the entire staff. We will be back for sure!! Thank you!!

See the diference among the other hotels the same category and surprise yourself. More pleasant, more clean, close to parks WDW, several restaurants, Walmart, Target, Starbucks, etc. General Manager and others staff are very helpfull. I strongly recommend for everyone. If you wish to have great vacation with fair price, definitely it's the right place for you!

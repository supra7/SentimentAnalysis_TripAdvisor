I came to Seattle for a work conference being held in the Bell Harbor Conference Center. I stayed on longer and my husband met me for the weekend. We loved the experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was cozy and comfortable and I liked the location. We walked to Seattle Center, Pike Place Market and the retail core without a problem but they also have a shuttle. Yes, the train does go by at night but we didn't have a problem sleeping at all. It is a hotel in the middle of the city--not sure what people are thinking, especially if you've stayed in Seattle near the water before but if you are a light sleeper, the hotel provides ear plugs. I will stay here again.

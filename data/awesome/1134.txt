We took the Sound Transit Train from SEATAC to downtown. The train dumps out two blocks from the hotel. No expensive cab ride. The room was excellent. The lunch food in the downstairs bar was two thumbs up. My wife accidently left a small wrapped gift in the lobby. The staff found it and had it waiting at the desk when we returned. Lots of cabs nearby. Centrally located and highly recommended.

I was at secrets for my honeymoon and would totally recommend it. we had a junoir suite with ocean view-on 3rd floor-beautiful. Room was large and very comfortable-except nothing dries so bring alot of bathing suits. Yes water in shower took a while to warm up but we did not seem to care. Food was UNBELEIVABLE-one meal was better than the next-we ate at the oceana, french, japanese and mexican restaurants-ALL very good. We also had a romantic dinner on the beach which was gorgeous and our waiter was excellent took a ton of pictures of us and they came out beautifully. The coffee at the coco cafe was excellent and the drinks at the bar were also great. The bar in the lobby is very pretty and the shops are nice to look at. We also were there during hurrican rina-we were totally annoyed with the no alcohol policy as per the "mexican authorities" but it lasted only one day. overall it was a great honeymoon-weather could have been better but that is out of anyone control. Beach is gorgeous water is soo warm, blue and beautiful. Overall Secrets was everything I wanted in a honeymoon-totally relaxing (we went from jacuzzi to pool to beach back to jacuzzi), drinks by the pool/beach, great food and friendly people. I wish I could do it all over again...

In short... I LOVED my stay at this hotel. Now, some of the other reviewers did mention small rooms... yes, beware of room 212 if you can, LOL. We checked in very late on a Saturday evening and it was all that was left. I was somewhat taken aback by the size of the room. My fiance' is 6'7" and I know he likes "bigger" spaces, but this room we were in was so beautiful... It was small, but elegantly appointed. Very nicely furnished, and just beautifully designed. The next day we got up, and mentioned to our wonderful concierge (Anthony) that we were less than satisfied with the size of our room and we were immediately moved to such a huge beautiful spacious room instead. It was so comfortable, so well decorated and just beautiful. The Wine tastings were such a great addition. We had a great time at this hotel and the service was great. I've never had such great service and I can honestly say we do owe it all to Anthony. I let him know that it was my fiance's birthday, and Anthony showed up at our door with balloons, a birthday card signed by all the hotel staff, and a bottle of wine from a local winery (Hedges). Would definately stay again! This place really made our stay in Seattle. Definately worth checking them out!

I stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park with my 14-year-old daughter this month and absolutely loved it. We were treated so well. The concierge, Anthony was fantastic, he helped us plan our daytrips with ease. The rooms are spotless and the beds are extremely comfortable. I had to receive faxes and Fedex mail and that was handled in a timely manner. The location was ideal to walk to Pike Street Market, Pioneer Square and to the monorail where we hopped on to visit the Space Needle. The restaurant next door is a little pricey, but good. Don't go there for breakfast if you are in a hurry, they were slow with service. The restaurant is not open before 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, so if you're an early riser you may have to walk to Starbucks. I will definitely stay here again.

I travel the country weekly and stay in a variety of hotels and locations. The W Hotel in downtown Seattle is my favorites. The staff is exceptional. They are always more than willing to assist with anything needed. They even have a hot line phone extension in the room that you can ask for just about anything, and they will make it happen. Great location, great people, great atmosphere, bar and restaurant.........would recommend it to anyone going to Seattle................ 5 Star

We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The location was perfect. The staff was very kind and helpful. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The decor of our room gave it a very homey feel. Loved siting in the lobby in the morning by the window and watch the city wake up. The restaurant was very good with excellent wait staff, especially John. Very easy to walk to wherever we wanted to go. Pike Place, movie theaters and downtown shopping just a few blocks away. Several excellent restaurants also within easy walking distance.

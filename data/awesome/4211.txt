There has been so many great things said about Secrets Maroma here on TA that I wont waste your time with more.Instead I'll just say everything is true. The grounds are amazing but it's the people who push this place to the next level.The staff are fantastic. Enrique who helped us at breakfast/lunch and Lydia who was our beach waitress are two specific examples of this.If I was better at remembering names I could list quite a few. Just go, relax and enjoy!

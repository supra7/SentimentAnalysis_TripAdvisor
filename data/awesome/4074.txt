We really enjoyed the trip. Good things were the food, service, beach, drinks. There really wasn't much to complain about. Some improvements might be the comfort of the beds - they were relatively hard yet still somewhat comfortable. The room service was slow as well. We ordered room service one morning 45min before we had to be in the lobby for an excursion and had to leave before we even received it. The prices in the gift shop for sunscreen and bug repelent were extremely high especially for the U.S. I feel as if it was unbelievable. Other than those things the main things which counted the most were exceptional.

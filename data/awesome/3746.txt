This was one of the enjoyable vacations we have ever experienced. The staff, room, food, entertainment are top of the line. Everyone is so friendly, and every request is responded to immediately. We hope to be able to go for a return visit, and we are recommending it to all our friends. You will not be disappointed,this is a A-#1 hotel and staff. This is an amazing place and we loved it!!!

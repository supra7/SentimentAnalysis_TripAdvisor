I cannot say enough about this hotel. So beautiful and the service was excellent. I would definitely go the preferred status route as we did. Private check in, private lounge with constant appetizer style food, and free internet access. The beach was pristine with very swim-able waters and very warm. Heads up on the swim-up suites, they are NOT connected to the main pool. Knowing this we still did book the swim-up suite, but then were not in our room to enjoy it. At night, I felt it was too cold to enjoy. I was not as warm as the main pool. Probably because it does not get direct sun all day due to the building and all the greenery around it. Depending upon your preference, for less money you could book a room with an ocean view if you do not plan to be in your room much which is what we would do next time. It might have been the time of year, but during our stay all of the beach parties were moved indoors (Mexican fiesta, Caribbean buffet, and forth of July beach party) . Most nights the romantic dinner on the beach that you can sign up for (as we did) were moved indoors to one of the restaurants even if there was no rain. On the beach it would have been worth the money, in one of the restaurants, not really.

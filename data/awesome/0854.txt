I don't know that I would have stayed here if I had to pay for it. we stayed for thrree nights on reward points, and when I thought about what it would have cost in real currency, I realized it would cover about half my monthly mortgage. Having said that, if you can afford it then I would certainly recommend it. Everything you want to be good in a hotel is good here. And the location is perfect for venturing out and seeing what Seattle has to offer.

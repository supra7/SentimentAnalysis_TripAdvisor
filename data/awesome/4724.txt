My husband and I travel to out of the country every year. This year is hands-down the best year we have ever had. Secrets of Maroma is the best all inclusive beach resort we have ever been to. The staff, food, entertainment, beaches, pool, and overall atmosphere is five star!!! We have decided to make Secrets of Maroma an annual event!

My daughter and I stayed here for two nights in February 2012. My entire family also had a previous stay in October 2011. Both visits were excellent. This is a convenient location if you have business or pleasure activities involving the University of Washington, as it is only a few blocks from the campus. There are loads of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance, so no matter what you're craving, you should be able find it nearby. The property is really clean and well maintained. Staff is very friendly and accomodating. It is a very minor point, but the only thing I can think of to improve would be to make the parking spaces a little wider. It's hard to fit a full-size car into one of them without risking a door ding. I highly recommend this place.

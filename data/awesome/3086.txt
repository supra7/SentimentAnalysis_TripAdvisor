From the moment I walked in I knew there was something unique about this hotel. The ambiance set the mood which was both intriguing and satisfying. The bedroom was small, but intimate with everything a girl would want....voluminous pillows, the finest sheets, and a comforter that you wanted to wrap yourself in along side your bed mate. You will be extremely pleased with the decor, the comfort, and the "extras" that are found in the room.

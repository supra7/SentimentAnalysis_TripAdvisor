I checked with TripAdvisor before booking at the Inn at the Market. Like everyone else, I loved it. The valet/bell boys were very nice. You drive up to a little spot in front of a little sign and the bell boys quickly did everything perfectly including holding baggage after I checked out. Parking otherwise is quite a pain. I enjoyed the deck on top. I decided not to pay extra for a view room. I figured I'd look at the street and that would be fine. Be sure you don't get room #404. It is a lovely room but you look out on the building that is 5 feet away! It is probably the worst view room at the inn. But I still loved it there and will come again and get a view room.

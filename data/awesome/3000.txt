Loved this hotel. We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see. 15 min walk to the space needle, less than 10 min walk to pikes market place. The staf was great and had awesome advice/suggestions for visiting thier beautiful city. As for the price well my wife and I got a discount since she works for the gap inc, but we would go back even without it.

Secrets Maroma was a wonderful experience - just make sure it meets your requirements: - Room (upgraded) was five star quality - Check-in: a bit clunky as you check-in closer to upgraded room vs lobby - Staff: very attentive - Pool: ideal - Access: remote w/ long stretch of road (2mi) to hotel - Beach: clean, waters a bit rough (but Tortuga Bar was great) - Events: several wedding parties but not too annoying, theme events and shows - good - Restaurants: nice selection with decent menu's - Breakfast: wonderful - Demographics: 90+% couples - Scene: fairly quiet and suited to relaxing - Tennis: very sub-par courts - Billing: no issues - Feels like: a cruise ship on land (nice meals, shows, good staff, etc.) - Would I return: for the right occasion yes ... very clean, nice service, relaxing.... - All Inclusive: first time I have stayed at an all inclusive (part fan part foe) Overall positive experience....

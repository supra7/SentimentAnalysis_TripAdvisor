It was a short trip but we did a lot- walked all around Pike's,the waterfront and up to the spaceneedle. I would have liked to try the restaurant the food sounded fantastic and again what a view. Next time! We had a small problem with the fireplace, but the engineer came right away to fix it and we enjoyed sitting by the fire and seeing the space needle. I also enjoyed the Teddy Bear and we apprecaited the earplugs- we both had a great restful sleep.

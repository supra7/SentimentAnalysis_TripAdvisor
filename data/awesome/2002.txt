We stayed 4 nights in February 2012. I read Trip Advisor reviews and was aware of the possible noise from trains, so we upgraded to the water view. WOW! So nice and peaceful. It was cold & rainy out most of the time we were there, but the room was so cozy and relaxing with the fireplace on and watching the ferry come and go. The bathroom was also nice, the oversized stone-tile shower and separate soaking tub were awesome. Staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant and lounge were both excellent. If you go for happy hour in the lounge go early before the crowd so you can get a good seat and watch the sunset. It's on the edge of town, but an easy walk to the ferry and Pike's Place. We just loved it and will definitely be going back.

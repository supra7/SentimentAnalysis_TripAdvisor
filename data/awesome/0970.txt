My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in early February in a lovely third floor room. The room was quiet and quite large, with a comfortable bed, sitting area and kitchenette (full size refrigerator, microwave, dining table). Everything was well maintained. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome, and were willing to assist with every request - extra glassware, directions, baggage assitance, theater tickets, etc. The location was great; many nearby restaurants plus drug & grocery stores. Easy walk, bus ride or quick cab to downtown area. Very close to the Seattle Center. There is a very nice wine and appetizer reception mid-week. A few caveats: Another couple traveling with us had a room on the street side of the hotel and had quite a bit of street noise from a local bar/club on the weekend. The breakfast buffet had a very limited selection. There is no elevator.

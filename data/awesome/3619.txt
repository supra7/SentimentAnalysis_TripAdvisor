We found this hotel last year and have been going every other month since! As Disney annual pass holders we try and go every other month for 4 days and have been staying here - and love it! the staff is very helpful!!! Especially the on-site manager. The rooms may be a bit on the smaller side but my husband and 2 kids are perfect in them. The rooms included a toaster oven and mini-fridge at no extra cost. Being budget conscious and always on a schedule, we really enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast... we eat and head straight for the parks...no need to stop anywhere else or pay those extremely high Disney food prices (The hotel is about 10 minutes from Animal Kingdom). If you prefer, there is a McDonald's right in front of the property. If you are planning on being at the parks and need a nice place to sleep with the family we would really recommend this hotel! - See you next month!

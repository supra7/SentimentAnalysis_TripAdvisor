This has to be one of the best value hotels in the area.Just back from a 12 night stay and really can't fault it! This is a well run, clean and friendly hotel and worth much more than the 2 stars it has. The staff were helpful and friendly, especialy Alan who deserves a medal for coping with busy breakfast times! There was free wi-fi, free use of pc in lobby (including printing for boarding passes and maps), free coffee and tea on tap AND free breakfast included in the price!! The pool area was lovely with sunloungers, tables and chairs with sunshades. Do not hesitate to book rooms here, you will not be disappointed. A very warm welcome awaits you at the Destiny Palms.

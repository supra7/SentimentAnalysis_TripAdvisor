Stayed here from Dec 14~21, and I have to say this is the best all inclusive hotel I have ever stayed. The beach outside the hotel is one of the nicest beach I have been to. Water was clear, sand was clean, and the beach chairs and bed are very well maintained. When I was there it was a bit windy so they have some pretty amazing waves. Not big enough for surfing, but it was really fun playing the waves. It also has the most amazing pools and pool bars. The infinity pool was cold, but its perfect for swimming in sunny weathers. The bar pool has warm water, so its suitable for drinking and eating. It is about 40mins drive from the airport and 1 hr drive to Tulum where many of the excursions and tours took place. Quality of food and beverages should be one of the main reason why people choose this hotel. Unlike most all inclusive resort, this hotel really carefully prepare the food at high standards. All dishes are made with fresh, high quality ingredients. My personal favorites are World Cafe (breakfast), barefoot Grill (Lunch), and Sea side Grill (dinner). The service was outstanding also. Not only was every staff friendly and well mannered, the whole system and standard service procedure is very well in sync and put together. From the time you check in to the time you check out you can hardly find any flaws. The spa was nice too. But the management and service of the spa definitely has some room to improve. I would strongly recommend this hotel.

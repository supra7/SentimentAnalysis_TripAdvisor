Room super nice and clean. Loved the large tub, shower space, and private toliet. Balcony and view was super. Next time I would like pool outside my door. Stocked bar. Bartenders at swim up pool very friendly especially Jose. Crown my favorite drink, was in good supply. Loved that Loved having waiters and waitress' around the pool serving food. (Sprimp on a stick) the best!! The entire experience was outstanding. Look forward to returning next year.

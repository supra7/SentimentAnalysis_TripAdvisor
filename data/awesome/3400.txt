We have stayed at the Radisson Gateway Hotel twice and both experiences were great. The staff was friendly and efficient, the room was large, quiet, and comfortable and the bed was great. (How can you go wrong with a Sleep Number bed?). We ate dinner at the restaurant and it was good and the waitress was great. The hotel is directly across from the airport and the shuttle runs every half hour. The showers were lovely. We would absolutely stay here again.

Right on the water. Great plus is that hotel has a local shuttle for free. Don't need a car. Good service, great view of sound (must get a water view, though). Good happy hour, restaurant can be a little expensive though. Hint: you can get a cab to and from airport for the same price has a shuttle (that will make numerous stops). It is a fixed rate equal to the shuttles.

Awesome views, very nice and updated lobby/restaurant area. The food was excellent, try the fish and chips, and the wings off of the bar menu. Get a waterfront room, it is worth the price. The Location to the market, shopping, restaurants, space needle is all within walking distance, even for people who don't enjoy walking a lot! We rented a car and didn't even use it. Great hotel, definitely coming back.

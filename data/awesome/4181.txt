We have a 7 day swim up, honeymoon suite and it was absolutely perfect. Definitely worth the extra premium package to have the VIP room with unlimited internet access and 24 hr service. And definitely worth the extra honeymoon package with 2 massages, romantic dinner on the beach, and champagne welcome. My only complaint is the coupons they give you as part of the honeymoon package. They don't explain the terms of the coupon and we actually spent more by using the coupons. Not worth using... doesn't really save you money.

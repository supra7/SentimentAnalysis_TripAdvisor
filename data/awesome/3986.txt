We have just returned from six amazing days at the Secrets Maroma! We have traveled many times over the the last 20yrs to Mexico and this place so far is our favorite. We were there to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and my birthday and the staff made both of these events very special! Not only was the staff great, the food was the best we had ever had at a resort! We also loved the beach!! Amazing! I really only have one really small complaint. The pool and pool bar close WAY too early. I have never been to a resort that starts to close down the pool area at around 5! This would be the only thing that I would change. Our room was great and very comfortable. We had no problem with the room being cool enough as others have stated. The spa was also amazing and the best we had been to!!!! Wonderful trip and we would return!!!

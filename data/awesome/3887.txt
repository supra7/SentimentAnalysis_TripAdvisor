Beautiful property that was very well maintained. We stayed 1o nights from October 7 to the 17th.The service was by far the best weve ever had in an all-inclusive, and we have travelled to at least twenty resorts in the past ten years. The food around the pool was great, as I hate to leave the pool to get lunch. The restaurants were truly a fine dining experience, the food, service and ambiance excellent. I would recommend this hotel to any couple that is looking for a top notch, relaxing vacation.

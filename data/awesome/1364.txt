Mere blocks to the best of what downtown Seattle has to offer, the Executive Hotel Pacific is where I call home whenever I visit the US cousin of my hometown Vancouver, BC. Extremely reasonably priced with charming rooms and unbeatable location, it is perfect for those who is cost-conscious but unwilling to compromise on quality. I have recommended many friends and colleagues and the feedback has been unanimous -- two thumbs up for the perfect balance among cost, location and quality of accommodation.

The hotel is wonderful! The staff was very efficient. They welcomed me, got my room and were always there to assist. When I was leaving they always checked to see if I needed a taxi or assistance. Upon returning, they always welcomed me back. I cannot say enough about this hotel. In fact, I returned two weeks later for another visit and I have to say the service is consistent. Awesome hotel, nice rooms and wonderful staff

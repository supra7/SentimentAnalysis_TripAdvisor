I stayed here with a friend in one of the "classic" rooms. It was a lovely room, if a bit small, and very clean. The furnishings are also classic, in keeping with the heritage style of the charming hotel, but it had free wireless and a flat-screen lcd. One thing that we didn't like was that our neighbor had telephone conferences both mornings between 6-7am (East Coast hours?) and that woke us up due to very thin walls. We could hear every word, and she was being a bit loud, but not excessively so. That was the only annoying thing about our stay-but if I'd remembered earplugs that would've solved it easily. The bed was decent. The restaurant and bar were both fantastic. i would definitely stay here again.

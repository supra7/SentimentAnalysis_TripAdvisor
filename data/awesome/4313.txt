I just got back from Secrets Maroma in Playa del Carmen with my wife. We've stayed at many resorts over the years and Secrets Maroma is the best of them all. The service is great! The restaurants are also very good (espceially the demi-glazed beef tenderloin and lobster taco at the El Paso). The pool is a great place to relax and enjoy drinks. The beach is by far the nicest beach we have every been to (including Hawaii, Punta Cana, San Juan, and Jamaica). The sand is literally white-powdered sand. Apparently, the sand is actually calcium from years of errosion from the huge coral reef. Its acually very cool to the touch too. You will not burn your feet. The only downfall would be nightlife. There's shows aren't that entertaining and their nightclub is just okay, BUT we didn't go for that. Besides, the sun/beach make for an early night. BTW-24 hour room-service is also excellent. Basically, if you're looking to relax and enjoy great food, drinks and service, this is the resort you want to stay at. I HIGHLY RECOMMEDN IT even at the prices they charge. You definitely get what you pay for!!!

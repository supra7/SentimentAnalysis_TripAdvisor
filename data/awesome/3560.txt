Upon your first glance of the Le Crystal Hotel, you know you are in a very good stay. The outside is very sleek and modern looking with a very nice lobby to sit in and relax. The front desk staff, bellhops and car valet's are right on the mark everytime. Julien was an exceptional pleasure at check out this morning with his true 5 star service. The service in the entire hotel is excellent and extremely efficient. We stayed in a deluxe king suite (the entire hotel is suites) which had a real nice living area with a couch and 2 nice leather chairs which was very comfortable for viewing one of the two flat panel tv's in the room. There is a seperate bedroom with sliding doors and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. I have stayed at many of the finest hotels around the world during my extensive business travels and I can never recall a bed as confortable. The rooms are so quiet, we thought we were the only ones staying in the hotel and I knew the hotel was close to fully booked this weekend! The suite also has a Nespresso coffee maker in the room which is well stocked with different coffee's, espresso and teas. There is a small kitchenette area of the suite with stocked refridgerator, microwave, plates and utensils. We had a very nice view of downtown Montreal and the location is a stones throw away from the Bell Center, home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team. I was traveling with my wife and 2 young kids and they loved it as well. We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaraunt and it was excellent. The location is great for walking to shopping, the famed "uderground" shopping, restaraunts and night life. This hotel is true 5 star gem and it is not be missed while traveling to Montreal.

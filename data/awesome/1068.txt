We had stayed at the Mayflower for just one night and the service was outstanding. This is our 4th stay at this hotel and each time we have been treated very well. I tried to book online but experienced "technical" problems so I called. Mary- you were so helpful. She booked us in a standard queen and we arrived Richard had a great surprise. A lovely upgrade to the 12th floor suite...What can I say! The staff really made our anniversary the best... Many thanks to all. We will be back! And thank you for the signed card and chocolates!

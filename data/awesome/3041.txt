Decided on visiting Seattle as I had never been there before and I wanted to experience the Pacific North West as it seemed different to the two cities I had visited on the West Coast (San Fran & LAX) - I found the Hotel Max on the Expedia site - had a lot of hotels to choose from, but the Max seemed to be very very unique and it certainly was different and what I was expecting. I wont complain about the small rooms / bathrooms (we had a Queen of Art) because you only need to look at the pics on the hotel site and read reviews to know what you are booking - the rooms were extremely clean. You will fall asleep on the beds as soon as your head hits the pillow. Front desk staff were friendly and efficient and always smiled. I am not into art, but this hotel makes you appreciate what it offers. I would recommend a stay at the Hotel Max, it is right in the centre of downtown, a few minutes walk from the airport downtowner drop off point and it offers great value for money. If you want a GREAT EXPERIENCE try the MAX. I stayed two nights from 15 June 2009 to 17 June 2009. AAA+++

This is a great hotel in a great location. All rooms have a small kitchenette area with fridge and microwave, excellent for a quick breakfast before a big sight seeing day. Bathroom is large with excellent rain shower and twin sinks.The main shopping street, St Catherine Street, is at the end of the road and the subway/train station and underground city all within 5 minutes walk. Staff were very friendly and professional. There was no problem with looking after our case while we had an overnight stay in Quebec City. Would definitely return to this hotel and have no second thought about recommending this hotel.

This was our 2nd year for a holiday (sorry big dog) Vacation, everything was just divine food, beach, staff. My wife had a birthday over there we had a brilliant evening in the Japanese the best service we have ever had anywhere in the world. Edgar was good in the World Cafe although we thought the choice was a little down on last year. Room service was great for us Brits with jet lag at 5 am. The only pitfall was a the Americans\ Canadians got louder the more they drank and they drank loads by 5.pm the pool area was a no go zone for decibels. The Steak House brilliant 16oz T Bone was perfect, Italian again great choices with make up menus of pasta, The French and Mexican Restaurant really good. If you want a top class hotel with top class service in a top class location at reasonable cost I doubt if you will find anywhere to compare to Secrets Maroma in the world, Many thanks Secrets.

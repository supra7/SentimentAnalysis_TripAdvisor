Honeymoon suite ocean front, absolutely awesome. Comfortable bed, shower for two, dining room, private bar in room fully stocked with premium liquors, and private double wide terrace facing the ocean. We kept the doors open at night and went to sleep with the sound of the ocean, woke up ordered mimosa's and bloody mary's to the room for breakfast along with breakfast. Room service is great, food just as good as in the restaurants for when you want to just relax. Preferred club is the way to go. Private lounge and fancy food to eat all day long and at night. Premium drinks. Great Bartenders! Had a private 6 person tepannyaki dinner which was the best! and our favorite restaurant Portofino italian. Beach is beautiful, clean soft and you are waited on hand and foot for whatever you would like. We took turns at the beach and the pool where they cooked food out by the pool and served to us which was excellent. Made many new friends and was the best vacation we have taken to date. Will be back next year for certain. The grounds are beautiful and we didn't have one complaint......well worth whatever you pay.

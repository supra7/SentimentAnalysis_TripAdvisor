Back again as host of an evening event put on in this hotel. Though the conference area was under construction all round our meeting room, the staff worked around it very effectively and all came off successfully. Not even sure our attendees were aware of the construction the way it was decorated around in the one hallway just outside. Emily and other banquet staff were terrific! Attentive to every issue of a successful event. Bravo to them. The guest room was wonderful! What is it about Marriott beds? Was clean, very quiet and exquisitely comfortable. Will probably do it again right here next year.

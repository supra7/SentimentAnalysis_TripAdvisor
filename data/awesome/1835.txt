We are a family of 5 coming from NY. I made the booking a few months in advance. Upon our arrival, the morning hotel manager on 8/13 made an arrangement so all of us had a very comfortable stay. The rooms are very modern with latest LCD TVs. The location is the best within walking distance to the Market Place, Space Needle and Baseball stadium. Everyone in the hotel is extremely patient and courteous. P.S. I am not too impressed with the Tom Douglas Lola restaurant downstairs, the dishes are in very small potion and salty to my taste.

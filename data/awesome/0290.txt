Not a new mainstream hotel. It's older but tastefully remodeled. Service was excellent. It is in a good location if you want walking distance to Seattle Center (Space Needle). I picked it because we had tickets to a show at Jazz Alley, Seattles largest Jazz venue. Jazz Alley is a block away. Brassier Margaux ($$$) is an excellent restaraunt off the lobby of the hotel. They have a good breakfast menu too. We paid $10 more for a higher floor with a view of the Space needle. The balcony is small but it wrapped around the corner so we had an obstructed view of Elliot Bay. 2 computers in the business center. They couldn't get them online? The manager looked up what we needed in short order on his computer and would print boarding passes if needed. The swimming pool seems to be permanently out of order. If you have to swim the Westin next door lets the Warwick's guests use theirs.

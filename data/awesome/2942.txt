2011 was my third Christmas stay at the Hotel Max. They offer free wifi, half-off valet parking, and incredibly reasonable room rates around Christmas. I have a favorite room, and they have let me have it four times in a row! I stay at the Hotel Max because I can walk to Pike's Market, the EMP, Seattle Center, the Space Needle, the Seattle Museum of Art, and all the downtown shops carrying a camera and a big tripod. It's that centrally located. On Christmasy nights, under bright holiday decorations, you can see horse-drawn carriages, the merry-go-round, walk on safe, well-lit streets to Pike's Market accompanied by lots of friendly shoppers, and be entertained by street musicians. I am an amateur photographer. Day and night, I spend hour after hour shooting fascinating subjects within blocks of the Max. A review a few years go said it was not safe to walk around at night. That is ridiculous. I am 65 and go walking by myself every year. The hotel staff are considerate, attentive, smiling, and helpful. If you need anything special, you can talk to anyone at the reception desk, or ask for Mr. Travis Williams, one of the managers. He's a wonderful man, and he appreciates loyal customers, who love the Max and come back year after year to the best hotel in downtown Seattle. If you are looking for proximity to the heart of Seattle, an artistic, unique environment with great beds, bedding, bathrobes, and a safe for your valuables in the room, you're going to love this hotel. I can't wait to go back!

Was there 7/6-13 had 4 days with only 1 hr. sun but then we had 4 great days-the beach is fantastic, no rocks cool white sane and the water off the beach is 50 shades of turquios and the angel fish swim with you, had swim up room and the rainy days the mosquitos ate us up but enjoyed the luxury of 5 steps to water. Food was very good just salty shrimp (wonder why). The pool bar closes much too early, at 5 pm should remain open later most other resorts close it at 6 or 7. We had Regina as our concierge-she was fantastic-cordial, pleasant, accomodating and even tracked down our lost cellphone ( she found it on a van we took from airport). She went all out to make our stay fantastic-she is a gem. The service was great and Ana and Anali at the beach and pool were always smiling and there to get us food and drink promptly. I learned to scuba dive, not bad for a 56 year old, and want to thank Valentina and Sergio for their excellent teaching and exposing me to a fantastic new world. We will probably go back again. The only reason we might not is the early closing of the pool bar-we go away with friends and the ladies actually like it when the men stay at the bar as they leisurely get ready for dinner. Secrets is a great chain-have stayed at capri in the past.

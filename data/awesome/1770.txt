My husband and I stayed at the Sixth Avenue Inn after watching a Mariners game. To be honest we weren't expecting much, for only $104 a night we didn't really know what we were getting. We were suprised when we arrived, the lobby is very nice, the staff is nice and informative as well. Our room was clean and relaxing. After coming back from the baseball game we went to the lounge for a couple drinks, the bartender was excellent. She was very helpful and had offered very quick service. She didn't kick us out right at closing time either, she let us sit and enjoy our drinks with the other people that were there. I noticed that in another post it mentions the gentlemen's club just across the street. Well there was no noise from there, it was quiet. And if you pay much attention to the streets in Seattle there are actually quite a few of those places around, so it's not a reflection of the hotel itself. We are planning on staying there again in August for another Mariners game. It was a great place with pleasant staff and very clean! I would recommend it again to anyone :)

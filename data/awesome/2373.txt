I agonized where to stay in Seattle. I usually don't stay in this nice a hotel, but I said, why not? I could not have been more pleased. The room was great with a nice view, large couch an a really big picture window'. Best of all was the location. The monorail to the Space Needle was right outside the door. Downhill stroll of 10 minutes to Pike's Market. Bus stops everywhere. The concierges were fantastic and seemed to remember where we had been and asked how it went. For a quick breakfast, McDonalds out the back door as was a great food court which had fantastic Thai food. It was a wonderful experience and I would stay there again.

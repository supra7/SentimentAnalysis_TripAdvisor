We just got back from staying at Sheraton downtown Seattle. It is on 6th Ave and Pike, so it is extremely convenient to everywhere. You can walk down to Pike within 10 minutes. The rooms were spacious. Hotel staff was very friendly. To our pleasant surprise, they not only comp internet charges at the rooms, they also have a business center where you can access the internet AND use their printers for free. We were very impressed with that. They had a summer special and we were able to get the weekend rates for $145 a night. That's a good deal for this hotel. We'll definitely go back.

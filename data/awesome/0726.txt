We stayed for three nights as part of our Silver Wedding Anniversary trip around the West Coast. The hotel had kindly left a card and chocolate covered strawberries in our room, which was a lovely gesture. The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Pike Place Market, one of the best markets I've ever seen and made me wish we had such quality markets in England. The hotel reception staff and the valet staff were very helpful and their welcome was very warm, which is unusual for large hotels. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Inn at the Market as a great place to stay.

I and my wife own a Four Diamond property and typically stay only at four or five diamond properties as a matter of comfort. We found the rooms and ambience of the Sorrento to be excellent. What really makes this hotel special, however, is the staff. There is a difference between a high level of service that is simply offered by the book vs warm, sincere high service tendered with a genuine desire to help. The Sorrento excels in the latter. I hope to stay here often in my future travels to Seattle.

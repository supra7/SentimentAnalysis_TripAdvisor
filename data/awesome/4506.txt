This is my first ever review,but i felt i had to write one. I have just returned from a one week stay at this resort. Our bedroom was beautiful ,we did'nt go preferred and i don't think we missed out . All the bedrooms are the same ,only difference is the view and how close to the beach you are. We ate at most of the restaurants ,food was 1st class ,my husband enjoyed the sea food and steak ,while i'm a vegetarian and was slightly concerned about what would be available for me , I shouldn'nt have worried i never struggled to find something on every menu apart from the french place which we did'nt try. Pools are beautiful ,we never had a problem getting a sunbed , but people are out in the sun quite early here ,most are out by 10am. Staff around the pool are constantly asking if there is anything they can get for you , you don't even have to leave your sunbed as they even bring around platters of nibbles! We did'nt make it to many of evening shows ,but what we did see was great fun.We had some photo's taken by the resident photographer ,the quality was superb and the sitting free, we only paid for the photo's we wanted , i would highly recomend this. all in all a fabulous holiday ,i would be back in a shot in fact i'm already looking at the dreams resorts ,which are the family version of secrets.

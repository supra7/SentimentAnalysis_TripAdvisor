I became apprehensive as I read reviews about this hotel before we arrived last week. I found an excellent hotel, really comfy beds, rooms with views - we were on 23rd floor north Tower and a team of staff who were so keen to make sure you had a good stay. Liked the touch of the call 30 mins after check in to check we were happy with everything. The concierge team were excellent plus - sorted out 2 nights restuarants for us first night Icon was not a good experience but the hotel was not to know the restuarant had parted company with 2 chefs that night. Its menu was promising, but the food was cool and had to be sent back twice. However, 2nd night - what a recommendation Palisade complete with a comp limo to collect us- one of the best meals ever. The concierge also rescued us when Gray Line seriously dropped the ball on Friday morning by forgetting to contact us to tell us our tour we purchased for the on line two months ago had been cancelled. Excellent and professional handling of the situation by Douglas. Our rooms were very clean, well serviced each day and did not look tired to me. Every member of staff was extremely pleasant and given the first class location of this hotel beside the monorail, near several free buses and an excellent shopping centre, I would stay there again if we ever go back to Seattle

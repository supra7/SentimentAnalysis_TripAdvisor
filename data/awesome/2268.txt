We only stayed 1 night before going on a cruise and thought the hotel was great. The welcome at reception was friendly, the concierge helpful, the rooms clean and comfortable as was the bed, everything just perfect. We even thought the location was ideal, as long as you like walking and are reasonably fit the hill is no problem, only took us 15 minutes to walk down to the monorail to go to the space needle. Vitos Italian just a couple of minutes down from the hotel doesn't look much from the outside but is nice inside and serves really good food. We definitely want to come back to see more of Seattle and the Sorrento is where we'll stay.

Had such a great stay here! The staff and hotel are just perfect. The location is amazingly close to everything and Red Fin is so delicious. I was so pleased with the room and hotel decor from the Aveda bath products ( my fav) to the art work on the walls, in the halls and the quirky individualized door pictures.... Coolest. hote. ever. Will be back in the near future and would recommend to anyone and everyone!

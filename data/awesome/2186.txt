I just stayed at the Edgewater Hotel and I had a memorable stay. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, it has a feel of a lodge with fireplaces everywhere (from the main entrance, to the lobby, inside th restaurant, inside the lounge and best of all in the room). The hotel offers a scenic view of Elliott Bay on one side and the Space Needle on the other. The staff were very accommodating. I did eat breakfast at the Six Seven restaurant and it was delicious as well as inexpensive (the dinner menu is a lot more expensive). The hotel is not located in Downtown Seattle, it's a little removed from all the action however the hotel offers a shuttle bus that runs every hour on the hour. The shuttle bus will take you anywhere you want to go within the tourist area. I was dropped off at the Space Needle, when I was done there I called the bus picked me up within 5 minutes and dropped me off at Pioneer Square. If you prefer to stay in, I found it very relaxing to grab a book and hang out by the fireplace in the lobby, just relaxing and enjoyting the view of Elliott Bay. The hotel also has a lounge with an extensive assortment of beverages. Overall this was a wonderful place to stay, it has a very unique atmosphere.

My wife and I had a wonderful time with our daughter and son-in-law. The staff were all very, very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious and nicely decorated with an outdoor patio and steps leading down to a swim-out pool. The Preferred Club had 3 computers, free Wi-Fi, a bar and special hors d'oeuvres/food most of the day. Check-in and Check-out were easy. The concierge answered many questions and checked on us daily. We loved the tequila tasting party by the pool. The Mexican and French restaurants were the best - I'd say four star! The spa was one of the nicest I've ever seen with wonderful candles and aromas. Unfortunately it rained our last several days; otherwise, the trip was near perfect! The only negative....we should have used the Fitness Center....but it was too small and too crowded when we checked it out.

The Sorrento shines again. The staff was wonderful (some even remembered us by name, and we've only stayed once before), and our stay perfect...almost;) We were a little disappointed that their car service was out of commission, as it treated us so well last time. Fortunately, our spots (Capitol Hill and downtown) aren't that far for a healthy foot traveler. Aside from the hotel restaurant which is nice, there aren't a lot of food options around there and the car would've been nice to go to dinner (they did hook us up with sedan to the airport though, at a steal). The room itself was smaller than our last (every room is different!), but just as cozy. The beds are heavenly (much to my chagrin, actually, as my wife insisted on sleeping in). The building has some of the "quirks" that come with older buildings (climate control is a challenge), but is elegant and clean. Did I mention free high speed wi-fi? All in all, the Sorrento is perfect for energetic folks who don't mind a little distance and find enough charm in the hotel's character to forgive its quirks. Despite the car thing, we give it 5 stars mostly for A: the awesome staff (hands down best of anywhere we've stayed) and B: to cancel out a previous unfair rating made by someone who blind-booked their vacation, then criticized harshly when the hotel didn't suit their needs. For the sophisticated traveler who does a little research, the Sorrento may become as special for you as it has for us.

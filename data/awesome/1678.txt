I stayed here for a few nights on business and was fully expecting a non-descript city hotel: beige walls, stained carpeting, etc. Instead, the lobby is expansive with a long marble check-in counter and a comfy seating area that has several Microsoft Surface tables. Check in was smooth and my room in the Union Street tower was beautiful. I think I may have been in a newly renovated room, because everything was immaculate. Flat screen TV, spotless carpeting, warm colors on the walls and bed linens, big work desk, and a bathroom that had updated hardware. Very plush and comfortable. Room comes stocked with a new coffee maker and Starbucks coffee, Bliss toiletries, and daily newspaper delivery. Room service that was ordered at 7:30 pm arrived less than 30 minutes after I hung up the phone (and was pretty decent!). The gym was just renovated and has a decent selection of cardio equipment and weight machines. The pool was still closed but days away from opening. Concierge service was friendly and efficient, providing me with restaurant recommendations and a vase for the flowers I had bought at Pike Market. The hotel is perfectly situated. I can't think of anything negative to raise. I would definitely return to this hotel, even on a personal trip!

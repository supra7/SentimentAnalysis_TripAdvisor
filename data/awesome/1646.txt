We fully enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Sheraton. The valet, bellboys and reception staff were all very efficient, helpful and smiling. Great location to both downtown and Capitol Hill. Nice that you had the choice of both a "to-go"-counter and restaurant on site, giving you more choices eg. when choosing where and how much time you will spend to have breakfast.

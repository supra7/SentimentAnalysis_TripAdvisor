This is the third time was have stayed at this hotel while in Seattle. The hotel staff is always friendly and accomodating. The rooms are always very, very clean. The exercise equipment is amazing (Precor). It is true that it's a bit of a walk from the parking garage (which IS expensive) to the lobby, but the person who said it took 20 minutes to get there must have gotten lost or something. For the life of me I cannot imagine it taking 20 minutes! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and will come here again and again and again when in Seattle. I DO wish there were in indoor pool. That would have made the stay perfect!

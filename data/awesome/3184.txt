My grown granddaughter and I had just finished a 7 day Alaskan Cruise. Not pleased wit h a different hotel at the beginning of our journey, I sacrificed our prepaid, non-refundable reservations and opted for the DoubleTree Seattle Airport. The accomadations were excellent, the service exemplary, the cookies upon sign-in fantastic, the grounds superb, the hottub and pool - flawless, room and all accoutrements flawless.The rest, quietness and friendliness of staff helped us relax and enjoy our short stay. All that and a senior discount - what more could anyone want.

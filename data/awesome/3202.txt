Stayed here in August for one night, huge hotel but really freindly and homely feel to it. Extremely welcoming reception staff and very efficient too, fantastic hotel with great facilities, lovely pool, dining room, lounge area bedroom was massive and very well equipped etc etc etc. The bar tender was brilliant, very freindly but not OTT was genuinely interested in where we were from and going, if i had my own bar i would have hired him. Food was to die for, (steak was HMMMM ) breakfast also unbelievable, would love to go back but doubt the chance will ever return .

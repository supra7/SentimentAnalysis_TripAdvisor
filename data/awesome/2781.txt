Hotel Vintage Park is located in downtown Seattle, but is within walking distance to most of the area's tourist attractions. The hotel is within minutes of Pike Street which is relatively flat compared to the other streets. The staff was delightful to work with; the room was beautiful with our view of the Seattle Public Library. It had all the conveniences of the larger hotels yet had a quiet elegance.

We stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park for 5 days in August on a vacation trip, and found it to be one of the best hotels in all of our travels. The staff is first rate, and our king premier room was lovely. The afternoon wine reception became one of the highlights of our day, both from enjoying a variety of wines, and from visiting with others staying at the hotel and exchanging informaton. We especially enjoyed the two concierges, Ally and Louis, who not only added to the wine reception but were very helpful especially with restaurant recommendations. We tried the hotel restaurant for breakfast and weekend brunch, and it was very good. All of the extras provided with the hotel added up to an outstanding value, even more so if you are a Kimpton In Touch member. I will definitely recommend this hotel and we will stay here upon future return trips to Seattle.

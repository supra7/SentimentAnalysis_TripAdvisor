It was an amazing stay. Although we are from the Seattle metro area we pricelined and got a fantastic deal to stay in a waterfront (which literally is right ON the water). We could open our window and throw crackers up in the air and watch the seagulls catch them on a "fly by". It was as if they were suspended in the air...I realize being a NW Washington girl that Seagulls have been referred to as "Rats of the sea" but it was so fun to watch with the ferries approaching in the distance from the San Juan Islands...gorgeous views. We had a clawfoot tub and fireplace topped off with a big stuffed bear ottoman. It was the most amazing weekend of playing "tourist" in our own city. I highly recommend staying here plus you can say you stayed in the same hotel that the Beatles once stayed in...however they fished from their room rather than feeding the seagulls...hahaa.

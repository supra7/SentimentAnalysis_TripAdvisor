I can't say enough good things about the Mayflower. When I called to make reservations, the reservations rep was sooooo helpful and informative. And I was not disappointed when we arrived. Every person that I dealt with from the Bellman to the Concierge to the Front Desk Personnel were truly service oriented and friendly as well. I was so impressed. This hotel, obviously, trains their staff very well. And the hotel is also located in a great place -- next to several restaurants like the Dahlia Lounge, Lola's & Serious Pie and lots of shopping like Macy's, boutiques, etc. Wonderful experience! Will stay here on my next visit for sure!!

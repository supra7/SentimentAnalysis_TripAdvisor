We were five in a family suite. The rooms are nice, clean, maybe a bit heavy on the flowery decoration side, but that is just me. Breakfast was excellent, the restaurant has won some prices but we didn't try the evening menue. Service was great and the location is in the middle of downtown Seattle. Even the vale parking was quick and at $20/Day cheaper than driving the car yourself into the underground parking next door.

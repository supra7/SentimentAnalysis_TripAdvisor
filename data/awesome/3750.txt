Stayed at Secrets Maroma from Oct 12-20, 2011, and it was absolutely amazing. The accomodations, food, service, beach, etc, were undoubtedly 5 star. There are so many staff there working to make everything beautiful and ensure your stay is flawless. The location is very remote which was really nice. Even though it rained almost the entire time me and my wife were there, since we're Canadian the 30+ rainy weather was still a nice change! Would recommend (and have already) to anyone that is talking about going to an all inclusive. Thanks for the unforgettable honeymoon!

My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at the Edgewater. Our room was a water view and it was terrific. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was clean and spacious. We walked to just about everywhere we wanted to go, because the hotel is located close to the water, the shops, the Aquarium, the Space Needle, and Pike Place Market. The breakfasts in the restaurant were delicious. Overall, we would stay here again, without question.

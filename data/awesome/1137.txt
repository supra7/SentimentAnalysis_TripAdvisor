Loved this hotel. Upon check in the Front Desk agent was so helpful and polite. Gave us a room with a gorgeous view and made sure we had assistance with our luggage to our room. Truly cannot say enough good things about this Hotel, management is doing a fantastic job. Will definitely be staying here for our next visit to Seattle!!

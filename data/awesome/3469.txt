I am from Montreal and was looking for one day get away! Our experience at the hotel was great. The front desk staff was very welcoming and very polite. We didn`t even leave the building from check in to check out. Evening in the 12th floor jacuzzi, great night sleep and then breakfast in bed. A great get away to relax!

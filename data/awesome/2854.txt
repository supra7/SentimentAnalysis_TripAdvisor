Start to finish they got everything right! Not to mention our dog is spoiled forever! It started with letting them know it was a birthday getaway...they surprised us with an upgrade to a "Fabulous" room and then a yummy cake was sent to our room with a card signed by several members of their staff! Our dog, Boots, was not left out and he received some dog biscuits shaped like a "w"! Thank you to W for making our dreams come true and we will be back!

We stayed one night here before our Alaskan cruise. I had gotten a great rate through hotels.com which included the breakfast buffet(which was $17 a person). The room was large and very nice. We stumbled upon a Princess cruiseline rep the next morning in the hotel who checked us in and took our bags, so all we had to do was get a shuttle to the ship! It made it very easy!

Fantastic Hotel. We booked this hotel on Hotwire for a really good price, so we didnt know what to expect - We were really surprised with the quality of the hotel. The lobby is beautiful and grand, and the bedrooms are big, spacious, well decorated and very clean. The starbucks coffee in the room adds a nice touch. We ate in the hotel restaurant both nights we were staying and had great food which was well priced. The restaurant staff are excellent, very friendly and helpful and the bar is a great place to relax with a cocktail. The location couldnt be better, we were a couple of minutes walk to Pike Place Market and we were able to get a short monerial to the space needle for a couple of dollars. I would recommend this hotel, and would stay again.

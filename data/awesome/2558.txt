My wife and I stayed at the Westin for 4 days starting June 18,2005. We enjoy walking when we visit. The Westin was close to shopping, Pike's Market and the Piers. The conceige recommended both Elliot's and the Crab Pot for crab and seafood dinners. Both were great. The Mariners are about 1 1/2 miles one way from the hotel and the Space Needle about another 1 1/2 miles the other way. The room was comfortable with a great view. We stayed on the 33rd floor south tower. My only complaint is that we requested extra pillows when we made the reservation. The front desk acknowledged our request and said the pillows were on the way up. They never arrived. We called the next day and it took only 10 minutes for the pillows to arrive. That said I would stay at the Westin again and would definitely recommend it to my friends.

We stayed at the Warwick on a Friday night and didn't notice any noise problems. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to the port, Pike Place Market, shopping malls etc. The staff were extremely helpful and efficient, the room was big and the beds were very comfortable. We had a great view of the Space Needle. I would definitely stay there again.

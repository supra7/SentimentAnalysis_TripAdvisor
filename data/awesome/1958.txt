Attentive, friendly staff upgraded us to a suite upon arrival. Hotel is very stylish, very comfortable, and priced reasonably considering it's quality and location in Seattle. Easy walk to the Space Needle & Seattle Center, or down to the Sound and ferry terminals. I could not have asked for a more pleasant hotel in Seattle- I would definately recommend to others and look forward to returning.

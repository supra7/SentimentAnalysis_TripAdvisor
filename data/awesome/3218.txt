We got a great priceline deal for a trip to visit family. Flights were late into the city and left early, so we wanted to stay near the airport. It's really close; the free shuttle ride is less than 5 minutes. Very comfortable, clean and the staff is nice. Avoid parking there; it's a hefty charge. If you're renting a car, it's just as easy to take the shuttle back to the airport car rental site.

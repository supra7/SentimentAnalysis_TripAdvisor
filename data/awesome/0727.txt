This place is in a great location, literally over the road from Pike Market and about a 5 minute walk to the centre of the city. We originally werent sure whether to stay in the city, but given the Inn turned out to be so close to the city and that the Pike Markets are so colorful, it was a great choice. We didnt feel unsafe at any stage and in fact the mafority of the stranger types appeared to mainly reside in the city itself. There are plenty of places to eat very close by, from quick snacks to nice restaurants, so again location was excellent. We had breakfast at a small French patiserie about 2 minutes away that served great coffee and fantastic pasteries at a reasonable price. We were also impressed with the hotel. Although it doesnt look much from the outside, its been decorated modern but refined and the room was great. We tend to try and get a room with a view and in this case stayed in a Parlour Suite. While expensive, the room didnt let us down with both the view and quality. We were very happy and comfortable. Didnt try the hotels restaurants, but they always seemed to show up on the "best in Seattle" lists. So overall we couldnt have been happier at the Inn at the Market and would recommend it to anyone.

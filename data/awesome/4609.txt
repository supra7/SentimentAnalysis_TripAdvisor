We had an amazing Honeymoon!! The staff is Genuinely friendly & cater to your every need. The Resort is meticulously clean & they keep it up on a daily basis. The restaurants have DELICIOUS food & desserts. The only downfall was we found the bed to be a bit hard, mattresses not comfortable & the pillows not of quality. We are in our 30's and woke up w/ a headache and neck pains every morning. I requested orthopedic pillows but they were same as the ones on bed, blowdryer will swallow your hair. If you have long hair or like me long & curly bring your own. Other than those 2 things, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT & we were happy we chose SMB to celebrate our Honeymoon. If you want peace & quiet stay away from Main Pool & enjoy your swim out, Highly recommend it!! Alot of young couples get drunk & start getting loud & stupid & honestly it's annoying.

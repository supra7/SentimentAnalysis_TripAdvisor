The Maroma was the nicest all-inclusive vacation spot that we've stayed at to date. . The rooms and beds were very comfortable. There was a waiter delivering appetizers around the pool in the afternoon, a very attentive wait staff, a beautiful beach and wonderful food. Drinks were great too! We met several couples that we still are in contact with, and we traveled there March of 2011. I highly recommend this hotel. We would go back this year, but it's out of our price range as last year we ending up staying there using the "Golden Apple Surprise Super Saver" through Apple Vacations.

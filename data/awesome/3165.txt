Right across from airport. Older building with an odd design, but the rooms are updated, clean and comfortable. Good wifi signal, fast enough for video. Decent fitness center w/full dumbbell set to 50 lbs. Several treadmills and ellipticals If you don't like to walk with bags, get a room close to the lobby. I was in wing 4 and it was a bit of a walk and two different elevators to get to my room, but I the chocolate chip cookie gave me the energy I needed.

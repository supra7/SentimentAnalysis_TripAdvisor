This family run hotel has a very friendly welcoming atmosphere thanks to wonderful staff who go about their work in a cheerful and highly efficient manner. We had room 720 which is a corner room with views up and down 4th Avenue. There is a mezzanine corridor connection to the Westgate shopping mall which is connected to the public transport tunnels incuding a railway to Sea-Tac airport for only $2.50. Across the road from the hotel is the famous Macy's and one block away is the Nordstrom department store. In the hotel Oliver's Cocktail Lounge and Andaluca restaurant enthusiastic expertise was evident. The cocktails and meals we enjoyed are probably among the best to be had in the city. The hotel slogan claims it to be "Quite Simply One Of A Kind". My wife and I can testify that this is true.

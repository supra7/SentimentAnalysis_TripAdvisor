My husband and I made our 13th trip to Mexico in the past 5 years in April and stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach. It was definately the best all inclusive we have been to. The food options are great - you just need to know that you may have an hour wait to one of the specialty restaurants - but they give you a beeper - you get a drink and walk around or wait in the lobby bar - just like at any restaurant. It wasn't a problem. The rooms were beautiful and the swim outs were fun. The BEACH is the best. Silky soft sand - crystal water (slightly seaweedy the morning after a large storm but nothing anyone could do about that). The staff are all so sweet. Sergio in the World Cafe is our favorite!!!!! But really all of the staff were wonderful. The wait staff at the beach was very friendly and quick - and yes, you do have to give them a couple dollars - really, is it that bad. So, we will be back here. The pictures don't do it justice. Really really great place.

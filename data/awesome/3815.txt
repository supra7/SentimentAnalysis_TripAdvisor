We visited Secrets Maroma Beach last fall and absolutely loved it. The trip from the airport was easy, check-in was a breeze, the rooms were beautiful, the beach was beautiful and the entertainment was fun. The food was good and there was a nice selection of restaurants. The Japanese Hibachi is definitely fun but you need to make reservations as soon as you get there in order to get a decent time. We really enjoyed the nightly entertainment and the staff did a great job. We also loved the grill by the pool where they served lunch every day. There was always something different and it was all delicious! We really liked the service on the beach, too. The turn-down service at night was nice and the rooms were luxurious compared to other resorts we've been to in the same price range. It was an easy trip to and from the hotel which is a plus. We've been to Jamaica a couple of times and that was not the case there. We've now visited 3 different all-inclusives and Secrets Maroma Beach is my favorite....I would definitely go back!

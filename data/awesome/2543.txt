I've stayed at this hotel on three occaisons, as I come to the area quite often. Overall, very clean, great service, and very well equipped. I choose the Seattle Westin everytime I am in the area. Great pool area and workout facility, very spacious rooms, and great view make this hotel a definite recommendation in my book.

I am a country woman unused to the big city. I was at The Edgewater for 3 nights, during the move of my daughter from Africa to Seattle. It was a stressful time for both of us. The wonderful room, the fine dining and especially the friendly efficient staff made it more like a vacation for me than the ordeal it could have been. Our room was clean and very comfortable. Quality linens and soaps and lotions. All the Staff were professioal, friendly and helpful. The view is unparralled. The Food the Best I have ever had. I would highly recommend The Edgewater Hotel to You!

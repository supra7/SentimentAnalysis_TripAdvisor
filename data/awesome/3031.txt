Cool, hip and trendy...to use three overused words. This is a great place to stay if you want to get out of the cookie-cutter hotel rut that you might be in. True, my room was small. And the shower? I'm 5'8" and 160...and the shower was small for me! (Great towels, though). The bed and pillows were great, as was the art and the staff. The fitness room was not too bad. The vibe of The Hotel Max just screams, "We're not at the Holiday Inn anymore." If you're in Seattle to watch TV all day, then this hotel is not for you.

Arrived in the middle of the night after hours of delay at airports. Staff was very welcoming, refunded us the $ we had to pay for a cab from airport since shuttle was not available at those hours. Was also given a discounted rate since we would be departing in a few hours. The rooms were very nice, wonderful beds, nice bathrooms. Service and food choices in the hotel restaurant were excellent. Didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked fantastic. Shuttle driver back to airport in the morning was friendly, helpful and efficient. We were recharged and ready to continue our trip after a horrible start!

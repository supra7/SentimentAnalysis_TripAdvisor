Domus Ester was everything we needed and looked for. Perfect location (middle of everything, on a quiet backstreet), good rooms, friendly staff. Not a single thing to complain. If you're looking for five-star pampering, then it is of course not for you. But if you just want to experience Roma and relax in its streets with reasonable prices, this is made for you.

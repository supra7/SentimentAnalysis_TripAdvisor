We spent our 10-day honeymoon at Secrets Maroma Beach in mid-October and can not say enough about the resort. The beach is one of the most beautiful we have ever seen, the grounds of the resort are absolutely gorgeous (exactly as seen in the professional photos on this site!). The suite was magnificient and very comfortable. The food was great and last but not least, the entire staff was SUPERB!!! Every employee we encountered during our 10-day stay was very professional, polite and pleasant... and VERY HELPFUL! We had an amazing and relaxing honeymoon - exactly what we were looking for!!! You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a romantic getaway in a tropical setting! We highly recommend this resort!!

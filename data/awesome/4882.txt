We had a fabulous 7 night stay at Secrets Maroma. We have been to many 5 star, all inclusive, adults only resorts in this area over the last 10 years and this one has exceeded all our expectations. We loved all our amazing dinners with Portofino's being our favourite. All staff members aim to please. Urbano, Anna and Lidia went above and beyond our expectations all week. Our suite was spacious and spotless. The beach is the best beach we've ever visited. We've never returned to the same resort, but we feel we would not find one that would even come close to this.

This was our first trip out of the country and we one of the luckiest not to say the happiest, to have stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach Resot and Spa. The food and drinks were needless to say WONDERFUL. Service and Staff were unbelieveable. We were there celebrating our Wedding Anniversary,and had the Anniversary package. We were treated like Royality from our pleasant checkin with Barbara to our concierge, Sebastain who went above and beyond his duties to make us feel at home. All the activities, pool and most of all the beach was the most beautiful beach ever. I have nothing but great things to say. Wish I was there now. The first words spoke to use upon arrival was "Hola, wlecome home" from that moment on I truly felt at home. Thanks for the great memories.

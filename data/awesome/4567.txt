We visited Secrets back in July for our honeymoon. It was perfect. If you are looking to relax and be indulged, Secrets is THE place to go. The beach is stunning- lots going on too.The pools are amazing- we prefered the one closest to the beach as it tended to be quieter. The food and restaurants were fantastic- although after 14 days we were well and truly stodged!! we eat far too much- we piled 10lb on each!! Room service was also great- there was far too much to eat!!! The drinks were just as fantastic anything youn wnated- and more-oops!! The staff at Secrets made it so special, they were always smiling and you felt well and truly looked after. Entertainment was also good- altho the shows did repeat each week, so after 2 weeks we had seen things twice.... Our room a jnr suite was beautiful, we were glad we didnt upgrade as the swim out suites never seemed to be used much and we think attracted mosquitos. We were careful and used repellent and only got 1 or 2 tiny bites. The spa was also lovely, we had a couples massage- hihgly recomended.We also had the dinner on the beach- taken just before sunset, the food wasnt as good as the restaurants but the experiance was so romantic. We took a trip to Chitchen Itza, booked at the desk in reception. Fabtastic experience and great to see beyond the resort. However, driving to every all inclusive in mexico to pick up other tourists- not so great!!! it was a long day!!!! The guests at Secrets were mainly honeymooners, or couples,all really friendly and wanting to relax, we made soem great friends.. However,during our 2 week stay there were a few days when the resort seemed to be invaded by noisey, loud groups, intent on getting drunk and being obnoxious,the atmosphere totally changed. Overall, a great place, would go back tin an instant- although probably not for 2 weeks!!

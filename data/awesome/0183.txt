My wife and I had an opportunity to visit Seattle for a few days on a corporate leisure trip. During our trip everyone at Hotel Monaco made every effort to make us feel warm, welcome, and satisfied. The hotel is centrally located in the CBD and we found everything within a few minutes walk. I'm not sure how they pulled it off, but they also arranged for perfect weather during our visit - many thanks. We look forward to seeing you again.

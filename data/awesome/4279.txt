Hi - this is our third year in a row going to Secrets Maroma Beach. I uploaded a video review for anyone that is interested in a romantic get-away to a fabulous resort. I can't say enough about the staff, service, food, premium alcohol and magnificant beach. This resort is like heaven on earth! http://www.tripadvisor.com/ProfileGallery-i30742246.html

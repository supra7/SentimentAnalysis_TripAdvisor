The W Hotel in Seattle is centrally located, downtown - within walking distance to most sights and numerous wonderful restaurants. The entire hotel is quite modern and simple in its decor - but not uncomfortably so. The staff is extremely helpful, room and maid service was efficient, and the views over the city are captivating. We are Starwood members, but I never got the impression, service for any others would be any different. We found the room to be very comfortable for our three day visit, with plenty of room for not only the two of us but all of our luggage and camera gear. The bathrooms here are very large and the bed was divinely comfortable and conducive to deep sleep. We'd stay here anytime we came through Seattle, for business or pleasure.

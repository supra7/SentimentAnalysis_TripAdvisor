True, this is not the most central location in Berlin. But with a bus stop literally in front of the hotel (which takes you o Potsdamer Platz in 8 minutes) and the U-Bahn a 5 minute walk away, this is a great hotel option in Berlin. The area feels very safe, and I even felt comfortale walking the streets alone late at night being a woman travelling alone. The rooms are very, very clean, maybe even one of the cleanest hotel rooms I have ever stayed at. I had the most basic room available, which was just great. Big bathroom, comfy bed and well designed with loads of closets; The room was very well designed. My room was situated at the front of the hotel. If you are a light sleeper, definately book a room at the back side, the sounds of the busy road at the front side might be too much for you. Would definately stay here again!

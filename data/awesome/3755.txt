We have stayed at Secrets Capril 3 times (even survivng hurricane Wilma) and never thought we would better it...... we were wrong ...Although we still love Capri, Maroma is definately better. The beach is amazing, the service is too. The food is like eating in a top London restaurant every night. There is always a sunbed, nowhere is ever crowded. I do like the hotel layout at Capri more....prefering the 'hotel' layout to the low rise buildings of Maroma. Just has the most amazing 10 day break. Didn't use the Spa as it was very expensive and to be honest we were totally spoilt so didnt feel the need. We will be returning!

I have stayed at Hotel Monaco at least five or six visits over the past month. The staff is consistently friendly and efficient. I believe they care about their guests and will do what it takes to make your stay as comfortable as possible. This extends from the front desk to the bell men and housecleaning. The staff in Sazerac restaurant is also fantastic.

I was there with my daughter on a birthday shopping trip and we upgraded our hotel with the Clipper to The Vintage Park for 3 nights and enjoyed the deluxe, non-smoking suite on the 10th floor. They even sent up a complimentary bottle of their Best sparkling cider when they found out it was my Daughters 17th Birthday! The staff were 2nd to none and it was really nice to mingle with other travelers and sample local wines with their complimentary wine pouring every night. Coffee service in the morning was also available as was their much needed unbrellas! They are practically next door to the 5th avenue Theatre where we saw a Broadway musical for under $50! My daughters price $20 and mine(Adult)$27 Unbelievable! We will only stay at the hotel Vintage Park when we're in Seattle!

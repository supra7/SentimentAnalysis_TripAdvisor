Nice hotel in the heart of seattle. We spent 2 nights here during the Christmas holiday season. Spacious clean rooms with great views of the city. Very convenient location for shopping. Their lounge (for Sheraton club members) is lovely and the breakfast and snacks are very good. We liked the Gingerbread Village exhibit in the lobby which was so christmasy and welcoming!

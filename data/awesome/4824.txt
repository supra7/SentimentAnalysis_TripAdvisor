My husband and I got married at a Dreams Resort in the Dominican Republic, so when a friend of ours was getting married in Mexico, we knew just what hotel name to look for -- Secrets or Dreams. Since we weren't traveling with anyone under 21, we decided on Secrets. We stayed in a Junior Oceanview Suite in the Preferred Club. The stay was only 5 days and 4 nights, but it felt like it could have been longer because of the comfort and relaxation that we experienced. Though we usually sight see when we're in a new place, this trip was solely for attending the wedding and relaxing. We both visited the spa twice while there and the service was AMAZING!!! All of the resort pictures on the Secrets website are true to life from the beach to the rooms to the restaurants and pool. The staff are all VERY helpful and they do a great job of making you feel 'at home' . Staff will come to you while you are laying on the beach and serve you drinks and snacks if look like you're hungry or thirsty. They always serve with a smile. The all-inclusive nature of the place is makes the visit less stressful, especially since you don't have to wear an armband. The variety of the food was good, but the best dining experience comes with Dinner on the Beach or dining at Himitsu (Japanese-style) in my opinion. My husband and I will ALWAYS consider Dreams/Secrets hotels over any others if we are in the Caribbean.

I normally do not write reviews but felt compelled to write a little about Secrets. I had been planning my wedding/honeymoon for over a year when I came across this resort. I am so glad we chose this place, it was more then we could have ever imagined. The food, beach, pool, room, staff were all amazing! We were in heaven! Pretty much I can say is that all of the positive reviews on here are 100% accurate and all the negative reviews are from people who will never be satisfied in life. However, the thing that stood out the most was the staff here; they truly go out of your way to make you happysomething you do not experience often in the states. We will definitely be going back!!

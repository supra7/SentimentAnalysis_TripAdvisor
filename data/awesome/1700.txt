Stayed at this hotel with my gf for the Easter long weekend. The central location downtown was why we decided on it. Booking was easy with the hotel's website and was a really good price with their stay friday promo ($129) which is great considering it is a four star hotel. After we got the confirmation number, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a room in the Union Street Tower (UST) which is the newer (2007) slightly shorter (26 floors) building, as opposed the Pike Street Tower (built in 1982, renovated 2004). The front desk said she would put a note on our reservation which was confirmed when we checked in. Amazing lobby! The room was perfect. At the end corner of the floor so with windows on two adjacent walls (only could hear the ice machine a little). Only on the 7th floor, and facing the highway exit, but not noisy from street at all. Super clean room, immaculate bathroom. Big king bed and flat screen plasma (note: go to TV guest services to get local weather in Celsius). To top it all off, we totally lucked out with an all sunny weekend (in Seattle no less!!) Only one downside was parking. In heart of downtown have to pay, but we took another reviewer's tip and did not use the hotel's $35 a day (out by 6pm but with in-out privilages) which has to be declared upon check-in (add added to your bill). Instead tried the convention centre which is one block north of the hotel. First nite parked at 6:30pm and got the car out by 6:00p the next day = $30. Second nite parked 9:30pm (after the convention centre closes) and got the car out 1:30pm=$22. No in-out privilages but okay since we were mainly walking downtown. Good luck!

I was flying into Seattle in the afternoon and then taking the Amtrak train the next morning so I had a choice to either stay near the airport or go downtown. I got the Hilton for $65 through Priceline. It is an excellent hotel and I would certainly recommend it. Free and quick shuttle from the airport and check in was very efficient. I had room 1185 on the ground floor overlooking the inside courtyard. Quiet and peaceful and never heard any airport or other noise. The hotel arranged for a taxi to take me to the train station the next morning. I was with friends for the evening so cannot comment on the dining, bar or other facilities. andrew

The Secrets Maroma Resort is wonderful and my wife and I loved it and hope to be back next year. The staff was great and the food was very good. We stayed in a Preferred Swim Out suite. The room was very attractive but infested with mosquitoes. A more comfortable sitting area from which you could view the TV would have been better. If we wanted to view the TV without being in bed we had to bring the desk chair up next to the bed. We loved the Paraiso golf course and hope you can continue the relationship with that course. The entertainment was good but it would be good if there was a casino on the property. Overall we think it was the best all-inclusive resort we have stayed at.

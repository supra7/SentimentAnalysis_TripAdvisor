We stayed at the Sea-Tac Doubletree for one night between our Canadian vacation and our flight home. This mega hotel served its purpose perfectly. We got a super deal on it ($45) through Priceline so I didn't expect to have the Penthouse suite. We had a room on the 1st floor in the 6th wing. We had a view of the parking lot but it was very, very quiet. Bring your walking shoes and map as this hotel is really spread out. Check in was quick. The desk clerk gave great directions to our room and handed us chocolate chip cookies as we finished. This hotel must be used by flight crews quite a bit as they had their own dedicated line for checking in. When we walked through the lobby, there seemed to be quite a line up except at that check in station. The room itself was nice - what I would expect from a Doubletree hotel - although it seemed a little dated. The bathroom in particular could use some updating as it had an ancient toilet and only a shower. We took a dip in the pool and the hot tub which were in a large courtyard between several wings. Since parking was $16 per night, we decided to return our rental car a day early. We were able to catch the shuttle to the hotel after about 20 minutes but we didn't realize we could have walked there in about 10. The shuttle was smooth for ride back to the airport the next morning. What really impressed me were the employees. Every single employee we encountered said hello. This seems like an amazing feat in such a huge hotel. Congratulations!

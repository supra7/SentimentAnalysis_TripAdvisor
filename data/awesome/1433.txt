I stayed here for 7 nights in July, 2005 and loved the hotel. The location is perfect...the new library is right behind the hotel, 10 minute walks to the downtown shopping core or to the water. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops within a 5 minute walk, too. My room was a good size with a nice bed. The washrooms were also a good size and clean. Service was good (a little too good maybe, hotel workers were knocking on the door to check on things 3-5 times daily). I ordered room service a couple of times and the service and food were both great. There is a pool and workout facility in the hotel which is pretty good, too. All in all, could not have asked for a better hotel. Keep in mind my company was picking up the tab, so I did not shop for prices. Would definitely stay here again.

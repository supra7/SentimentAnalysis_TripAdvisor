My husband & I really didn't have much of a desire to ever travel to Mexico until we saw this resort. We went to attend a wedding of a friend but decided to make a vacation out of it & boy are we glad that we did. From the moment we got there until the moment we left, we felt safe, taken care of & well fed!! This resort is certainly the utmost of luxury & we have already been talking about going back next year for a vacation. We aren't frequent travelers but this is certainly someplace we will return to & recommend to others. You can't go wrong staying at Secrets Maroma Beach!

My wife and I went to Secrets Marmora Beach for a four-night winter getaway with some friends. It is located about 20-25 minutes away from Cancun Int Airport. After turning off the main highway and proceeding down a one lane road for about a mile, you arrive at the resort. The exterior is simple and understated, and the lobby, unlike many tropical resorts, is enclosed and air-conditioned. You are greeted warmly by the staff and invited in. The staff is universally friendly and helpful and the overall atmosphere of the grounds is quiet and zen-like. The rooms are very nicely appointed. We had what was called a junior suite. One thing that appeared odd to us in a couples-themed adults-only resort was that the room had two full-size beds instead of one king or queen size bed. Other than that, it was very nice. The resort hs two pools; an unheated infinity pool overlooking the blue Carribean Sea, and a heated one with a swim-up bar. The beach is great, with very walkable super-fine white sand. You almost feel guilty about complaining about anything here, but in the interest of fairness here are the negatives: they need more chaise lounges at the beach and pool - we sometimes found it difficult to find open ones; we thought the food at times could have been a little bit better in some of the resturants -although we certainly had some good meals - don't miss the Oceana for the seafood! Overall this is a fantastic place and we all had a great time!

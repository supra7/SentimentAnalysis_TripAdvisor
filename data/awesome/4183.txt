Dear Sir, My wife and I have been visiting the reviera maya for the past ten years ( 3 times per year). We have stayed at your resort on 3 occasions and I must say " it get better with each visit". We have found hotels that have great food, great service or wonderful accommodations, but your resort has seemed to capture all of the above. The staff you have assemblied is by far the best we have experienced. Special kudos to you. We would like to give special mention to Sergio at the french restaurant, Cesar at the Italian, Enrique at the World Cafe, Jesus in the entertainment group but we would like to especially mention Paulo , Kevin and Jaime ( pool concierges) as extraordinary examples of the fine employees under your direction. We could probably mention an additional dozen or two employees but I'm quite sure your time is precious. Thanks to both you and your staff for a wonder vacation. Hope to see you again in December......Joe and Fran Burgos

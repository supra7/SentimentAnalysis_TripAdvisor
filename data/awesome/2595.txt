We spent 3 nights at the University Inn while touring local colleges, and loved it. The hotel was stylish but comfortable, and the staff was so friendly and helpful. It was also a good value for the $$. We appreciated that the computer and printer were available when we ran into flight & tour issues. We liked being able to walk to University Ave., the campus, and shops & restaurants, and were just a short drive from Seattle's sightseeing highlights. (I particularly loved the Ballard Farmer's Market, just a 10-15 minute drive west.) If we're back in Seattle we'll definitely return to the University Inn.

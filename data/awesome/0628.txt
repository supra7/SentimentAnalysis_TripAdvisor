Location to to the Market is fantastic. Staff and locals were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The view is awesome from the deck and our room was definitely big enough for the 2 of us. The snacks and drinks offered in the room were a bit pricey, but you can walk a few blocks and purchase your own. This was our first visit to Seattle and if you're looking to shop and dine or drink in the Market, this is the perfect location. Rooms might be a bit pricey, but it's worth it for the location, especially a short stay. Let me say again, the staff is amazing. We've never experienced such excellant customer service.

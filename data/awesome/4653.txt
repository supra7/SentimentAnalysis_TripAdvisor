We went to Secrets for our honeymoon and loved it! We had a junior swim out suite and enjoyed having a semi-private pool at our backdoor. Room service was prompt and the food was consistently good. The restaurants offered a wide varied of well prepared options. The gorgeous Maroma beach was steps away from our room and we enjoyed swimming in the crytstal blue water as well as lounging under thatched umbrellas. We wish we had stayed a bit longer.

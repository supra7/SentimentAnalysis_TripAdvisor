We stayed for five nights at the Sorrento to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday/our 19th anniversary, and we couldn't have been happier. When we checked in our room had been upgraded to a beautiful suite at no extra charge. Chocolates were waiting for us inside the room, and a complimentary bottle of wine was delivered wishing us a happy anniversary several hours after we settled in. The concierge staff was wonderful. We had not rented a car so we could get a better flavor of the city by walking and taking buses, and all of the concierge guys were more than helpful assisting us in our travels and getting us to where we needed to be. They also were generous and helpful with their restaurant tips, as well as tips on what sorts of activities we might enjoy. We felt like we were treated like royalty. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and its terrific staff!

My new husband and I went June 21-28th for our honeymoon. After extensive research I picked this hotel from all the reviews. The hotel is really nice. The service was above and beyond amazing considering gratuity is included, the staff literally waits on you hand and foot to make sure you are happy and get you anything you ask for and want. If you go to the pool ask for Alejandro.. he was our man the whole trip. He is the best pool waiter you could ask for and we tipped him everyday because honestly he deserved it. Tipping a few dollars here and there really goes along way with the staff although they would still treat you amazing, this just makes them so happy and they really go above and beyond to treat you like royalty. DEFINITELY take mosquito repellant and bug spray. We got bitten all over that was the only downfall ! The mosquitos are tiny so you cant see them and they bite you all over.. whether your in your room or in the lobby bar you will get bit ! The spa was AMAZING !! Its a must !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make sure to take sunscreen and anything you need because its super expensive to buy in the gift shop. 90 Percent of the hotel guests were honeymooners like we were so that was cool. The secret box for room service was the best invention ever ! I would absolutely recommend this hotel !

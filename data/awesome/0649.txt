I think our bags were nearly in our room before we could get out of the cab. The service was very good, despite the slightly eerie feeling when they welcomed us with our names off the luggage tags. We stayed in a city side room, which was quite comfortable. For those who are light sleepers or not used to city noise, I would highly recommend booking a room on one of the other sides of the building. We were fine with our 3 hour jet lag. The hotel is steps from Pike Place market and surrounded by good places to eat (try the crumpet shop for breakfast). Don't miss the spiced tea in the lobby, it is excellent after a walk in the rain.

My wife and I stayed here during a trip to Seattle. I had read reviews saying that the staff were pretentious but I experienced none of this and they were professional and courteous throughout. The rooms were impeccable, the location was excellent. The beds were so incredibly comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.

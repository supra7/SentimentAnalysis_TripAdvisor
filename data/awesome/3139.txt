We got a great rate on this fine hotel which made it even nicer. And, we were upgraded to a 2 bed bedroom, which we found very roomy, bathroom included. It is a short walk to the Pike Place Market, waterfront shops, and Belltown. Downtown shopping begins right out the front door, and a number of good restaurants are in the block or within easy walking distance as well. The Airport to Westlake light rail makes getting there a breeze. No car needed, as buses go everywhere. The only small negative is the need for the hotel to fix the other elevator to help peak time hotel movement.

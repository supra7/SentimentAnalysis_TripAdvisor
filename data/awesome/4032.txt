The beach and water were fabulous. The property was beautiful and it was a short walk to beach, restaurants, lounge, and bars. The food was excellent in all the restaurants and the buffets were full of fantastic food. The best part was the service and the staff of secrets. Everyone is so nice and caring. Two weeks before I stayed at Secrets Cap Cana and it doesn't come close to the set up of Secrets Maroma. SM totally has it all together right down to the great service on the beach, rafts in the pool and plenty of chairs on the beach. I've been to almost all the Islands and now Secrets Maroma is on my top 5.

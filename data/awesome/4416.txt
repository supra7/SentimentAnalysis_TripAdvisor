We had a fantastic time at the Secrets Maroma. If you travel to Mexico frequently and have appropriate expectations, then don't believe any overly negative reviews. The beach was beautiful and the service is the best I've experienced in Mexico thus far. If you go, please say Buenos Dias to mi amiga Elayne at the crepe station in the World Cafe. Her genuine, beautiful smile is the perfect start to a sun-filled day.

We went for our 10th wedding anniversary at the end of Sept. it was not crowded and the weather was awesome, not too hot. Staff is very friendly and polite. We had a swim out room which was awesome. Our room was beautiful the incense in the room my husband loved. The pool area was great and we did not have any trouble getting lounge chairs together. The beach was beautiful, and the activities they did daily was fun. Pool volleyball with the staff was entertaining. The entertainment staff were hilarious. We did a couple trips off the resort, one to Playa de Carmen to shop and one to Explore for the day. Explore was awesome, the ziplining, food and all terain vehicles were fun. Highly recommend. My husband owns a travel agency and we travel a lot. We loved this resort.

Hubby and I stayed here for two nights over the Black Friday weekend... we pretty much just slept at the hotel... we spent much of our time shopping or eating out.. Our room was in a high-level floor and we had an nice view of the city... bathroom was nice and clean.. bed was comfortable... The hotel is very nice! I can't really comment on any other services as we didnt really eat there or interacted much with staff other than check/in check/out

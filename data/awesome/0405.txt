This hotel is a wonderful gem. I really don't want to write a good review as I want to keep this place to myself. The rooms are a wonderful size, the bathroom is great and the bed absolutely perfect. This was the best nights sleep that my partner and I have had in years. We really did not want to check out. The location to Pike place market is ideal, literally step out of your hotel and there it is.

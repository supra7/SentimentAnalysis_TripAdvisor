I don't have tons to say about this hotel, as we were there for only 12 hours or so... but we loved everything we saw. the hotel is very beautiful and chic. decor is top notch. and the staff are exceedingly helpful and friendly. the room we stayed in was a large corner suite with a view of the city and partial view of the water. the bed was one of the nicest i've ever slept in, complete with a pillow menu. really nice spa quality shampoo, conditioner, lotion and face wash in the bathrooms. the only "issues" we encountered was our room being a bit delayed for check in. we were sent to the hotel bar with a $25 gift certificate to kill the time. very nice gesture, however the bar is VERY expensive, so that only bought two drinks. the next day when we checked out, they comp'd our valet parking as well for our inconvenience. that was great since valet was $32 a day (yikes) we would for sure stay here again, but it's not for people watching their pennies. it's a splurge, but worth it for a nice night away.

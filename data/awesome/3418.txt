We decided to stay a night in Seattle on our way back from Alaska. This hotel has the abolutely best location, directly across from the entrance to SeaTac International. Very modern with spacious, first class rooms. Upscale lounge with friendly service. Transportation to our departure airline was right on time. And the price was very reasonable - promotional price of $99.

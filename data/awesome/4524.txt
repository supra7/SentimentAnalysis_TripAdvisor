Having reviewed the resorts web site we knew a bit about the facilities. We along with 42 other of the bride and grooms friends and family attended a nephews wedding. We decided to use it as leisure time too. We stayed for a week. We were more than satified with our entire experience. A wonderful staff took care of us and made us feel like family without intruding. We did as much or little as we liked. The entertainment was top notch. The restaurants were outstanding. The drinks were abundant, again only as you wanted it. The staff worked to make the wedding, which was the first they had on the beach at night, just right.

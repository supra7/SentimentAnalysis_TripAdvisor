This is a great hotel! The location was perfect. We walked everywhere. This was our first trip to Seattle so we did all the "touristy" things, and the hotel is situated right in the middle of everything. The hotel feels very small and quaint. The customer service is fabulous. They greet each and every customer as you come and go from your room, and they are so friendly and knowledgeable. The room was nice. Nothing spectacular, but very pleasant. It was spacious with a huge walk in closet. The only complaint about the room is the bathroom. It is VERY small and there is absolutely no counter space whatsoever. It makes it difficult for a woman to get ready. The restaurant attached to Hotel Andra is called LOLA. The food is incredible. Expensive, but worth it. We ate at most of Tom Douglas' restaurants and were never disappointed. Stay at the Hotel Andra. The rate was great (Expedia) and we had no problems at all. I forgot to mention that there is a gym, but it is very small. It is free to use.

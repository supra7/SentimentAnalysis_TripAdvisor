This was my first time in Montreal, and I'll definitely be back - hopefully when it is warmer and after I've brushed up on my French (even though EVERYONE speaks English). We stayed at the Le Crystal for four nights. Below are the high points: - Convenient, safe neighborhood - Two blocks from Metro entrance and Bell Center - Twenty-minute walk to Old Montreal - Five-minute walk to get access to Underground City - Ten-minute walk to Musee de Beaux Arts - Gorgeous lobby and accommodations - Very friendly staff (booked tickets to Cirque du Soleil) - Very clean, new workout room with the typical hotel gym equipment - Molton Brown bath products - Excellent housekeeping (provided bottled water everyday) - Free wifi in the rooms which was very reliable and fast - Fresh fruit and newspapers available for guests in the lobby and on every floor - Very useful kitchen (espresso machine, electric tea kettle, microwave, and dishes/utensils) We didn't use the pool or the hot tub, but it seemed like plenty of other guests were loving it. :) I definitely would stay again!

We stayed in Lindemann's hotel for 4 nights and we enjoyed it a lot. The hotel is great value, modern, very clean. Rooms are large and so are the bathrooms. Location is ok: the neighborhood is a working-class area and does not offer much for tourists but the hotel is only 10 mn from the Postdammer Platz by bus. Buses are running every 10 mn. The metro is only 8 mn walk from the hotel. The staff are friendly and always there to help. The breakfast buffet has a great selection and is good value (12.50 eur). in summary: great hotel at an affordable price. !

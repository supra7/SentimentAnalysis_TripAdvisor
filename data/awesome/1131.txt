Very comfortable room with many amenities. We were there for the Mariners and Sounders games. Short walk to link station to ride to Stadium: $3.50 round trip. When we got back late and didn't want to order a full room service meal, it was only a short walk to a late night grocer for snacks. Right next to Westlake mall and great shopping. King suite was quiet and comfortable with plenty of room. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. $20 per night Valet parking. Pull in front of Olive Way entrance. Takes about 10-15 minutes for car retrieval. Only picky thing...I'm tall so I have to tip the shower head up in some older hotels. The towel rack is in the shower and I wasn't paying attention enough to realize I was getting the other towels wet from the shower spray so I suggest moving the towels out if you are tall.

Best place to stay in Seattle, close to Pike's Market (2 feet away), cruise ships, SAFECO FIELD (baseball) & QUEST FIELD (football). Took the Clipper from Victoria BC land right in the heart of downtown. Took cab to hotel, don't rent a car crazy roads in Seattle! Hotel beautiful, room looked over Puget Sound. Watch the ships, water planes, ferries lit at night transporting people across bay. Wonderful bed in room, lovely toiltetries, great room service, very nice restaurant and can eat outside. Lots of restaurants around every corner. Ten minute walk to Nordstroms, JJill, Coldwater Creek, Jcrew etc etc. 20 min walk to Sheraton hotel where you pick up bus to Everett Washington to take a tour bus to the Boeing Plant and see huge jets being constructed and their own runway for testing. Walk to aquarium, restaurants on pier over looking harbour, and world famour Pike' s Market Place, food, crafts, flowers, antiques, everything you could think of. Closes at 6 p.m. A different crowd downtown at night but lots of police in full view on bikes and horses, never saw any problems. Hotel is a boutique hotel and a lovely change from the big 5 star chain hotels. Would go back in a minute.

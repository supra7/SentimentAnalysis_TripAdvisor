My recent stay at the Vintage Park hotel was more than I expected. The hotel is similar to many of the boutique hotels found in NYC. Charming and quirky. The rooms ... although a tiny bit small ... were well appointed and the beds were very comfortable with ample pillows. The staff was quick to serve and used your name making it a personal experience. Although I did not participate in the happy hour I saw other customers and saw them enjoying the local wines being served. The valet and front door staff were quick to open doors and hail a cab if needed. The restaurant looked great ... I didn't have a chance to sample and was disappointed I could not try since the restaurant looked inviting and the menu was diverse. I'd definitely recommend and will stay here again.

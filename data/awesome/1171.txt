Stayed here for 8 nights and everything was great. Although the room was a little small, it was cosy and the bed was very comfortable. Service was good and the front-desk staff were always friendly and helpful. Complimentary wireless internet worked without any problems although the speed was a little slow at times. Hotel location is fantastic. The hotel is just 10 minutes walk to Pike's Market and the Waterfront. Next door is the Westlake Centre where you can take the monorail to the Space Needle. For shopping, Macy's is on left and Nordstrom is on the right. Lots of eating places and restaurants nearby including a really good one (Andaluca) which is in the hotel. Will definitely stay here again when I am in Seattle.

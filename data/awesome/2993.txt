Just returned from a quick trip down the coast to Seattle, we stayed right downtown at Hotel Max as an alternate to our usual Pan Pacific, and were very pleased with a great stay there. The rooms are very well decorated with art by local Seattle artists, a fantastic idea! The beds and rooms were very comfortable and sleep quality was terrific. The building is a renovated historic building, they kept a lot of the great original (I believe) features of the building in both exterior and interior. That being said the floor plans didn't leave for much space in the bathroom, but neither of us minded, it had a nice soaker tub though. :) The desk and bell staff were great hosts, and it was really impressive that the GM emails you post stay to check up. Would definately return and recommend this hotel to others looking for something trendy in the downtown core.

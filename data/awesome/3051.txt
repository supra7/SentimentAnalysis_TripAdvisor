I was in Seattle for a couple of days to see the city. The Max is located perfectly in the downtown area, near shopping and the sites. the staff is very friendly, the building is cool and clean and the room was perfect for a solo traveler. Would be very tight for two people. The bathroom was small but nicely done and the bed was very comfortable. The internet and parking were free for the deal I chose and the price was ridiculously low. A great great deal.

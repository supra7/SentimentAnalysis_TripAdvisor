Well, first of all, The Max is a pretty cool place right in the center of Seattle. The lobby is awesome and ultra modern, and there's someone to open the door for you and calls to lobby to get you checked in right as you get to the front desk, just need photo id and a credit card. Once I got to my room, it was nice and cool. My room is small, however I traveled by myself, so that wasn't a problem. I'd recommend you getting a King of the Art room if you're traveling with more than one person. If the pillows on the bed aren't to your liking, you can order a pillow from the pillow menu, and the spiritual menu probably has a book from your chosen religion. I slept like a baby, and never heard either of my neighbors in the hotel. One thing I might recommend to the management is to have hot chocolate in the room, as they have coffee and tea. I love the place and will stay there again as soon as I'm in Seattle once again.

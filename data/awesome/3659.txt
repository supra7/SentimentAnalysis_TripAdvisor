My husband and I own a vacation house in the area and our guests were leaving the night morning so we just needed a place to sleep for the night and then be on our way. We picked Destiny Palms because of the low rate...I have to admit I was skepical. We were totally surprised and excited by what we got. The room was clean, comfy bed, LCD wall tv, etc. I have stayed in hotel for $125 and gotten less. I wouldnt stay there if I was with a couple of kids and the stay was going to be longer than 2-3...the rooms arent that large..but for 2 people it was more than fine. The only downside was the client looked a little strange. It's hard to explain and I dont mean to judge but they looked almost homeless or shady. A few people smoking in the outside stairwells but other than that I would say it was a great experience. I thought the pool area and clean and enjoyed the pool after we had dinner. Definitely give it a try Doreen Boston MA

I have to say that I was very impressed with this place. I went here for my honeymoon and upon arrival was greeted with many "hola's" from all of the staff. This was our first all inclusive, but after talking to several other couples that had done all inclusive's before, they said that Secrets Maroma easily blows them out of the water. The entertainment staff was good, nothing too special, but what can you really expect? The shows were fun and a nice way to spend an evening. All of the restaurants were excellent. You def have to get reservations for the Hibachi tables at Himitsu. It is basically just like a japanese steakhouse. Great food and entertainment. I highly recommend a swim-out suite if you can afford it. We booked ours in the winter and got it for the same price as a regular room and WOW, was it amazing. Nothing like going back to your room at any point and getting in the water that is connected to your room. It was amazing. We did the couple's massage on the beach and that was AWESOME. There is so much food available at any time at this place, if you go hungry, it is your own fault. The buffet by the pool was very good (especially after several cocktails). I really don't have anything bad to say about this place. I read many reviews like this before making my decision on where to go, and we were not disappointed. Not having any kids there was very nice. It is all honeymooners and couples on their anniversary. We went to the night club 1 night and that was actually pretty fun. Overall I had a great time at this resort and would recommend it to anyone.

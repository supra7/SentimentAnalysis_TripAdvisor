Stayed at this hotel for the Washington Coalition for Open Government 2012 conference up the block on night of March 9-10. Arranged for my stay a few months before so I could get best available rate. Was able to check in at 10 am and take my bag up, declined to accept a $100 hold on my debit card though simply because I wanted in-room WiFi. Found the suite great with a nice desk strong enough to take my 30lb bag + big enough to let me clutter, a nice sofa, a refrigerator, complimentary coffee, a closet and a very comfortable bed. Not to mention a great view and an even better job done by housekeeping. Also very nice to have the business center to check on e-mail & Facebook on the fourth floor. I was the only person using the already-paid for internet though at 4:30 PM and then 10:30 PM for two half-hour sojourns on a Friday night, though. Felt very safe inside the hotel, what with the elevators across from the front desk. Do appreciate that the hotel is three blocks downhill along Seneca Street and then on 3rd Avenue is a staircase to the light rail. Only a bit longer walk to the waterfront & the ferries. I did take a few pictures of the suite. Hopefully shows the good work by housekeeping. Finally, I'd recommend the hotel for anybody NOT on a tight budget... very comfortable AND QUIET place. Couldn't hear anybody else nor the elevator from my suite during my stay.

This is my first 5 dot TripAdvisor review. I didn't think I would ever give that to any hotel. This place is amazing! Perfect location, incredible rooms, and the finest men and women in customer service I've ever experienced. We check in, and immediately people know you by name and greet you. Every day I was greeted, and everything I needed was retrieved immediately. I got to my room. The toilet was running slightly, so I called down and it was fixed, including replacement parts, within a matter of minutes. I needed a rollaway for an extra guest.. it was provided at turndown later that evening and was turned down and made like a regular bed. I needed an extension cord, as we had two laptops and a assortment of other devices to plug in. It was at my room within 2 or 3 minutes. The bed was a firmer variant of the memory foam beds, and was amazing. They only offer queen size beds in this hotel, but since I was single this time around, that wasn't an issue. I never slept better in a hotel. The bathroom was amazing. It was half the size of the room, at least, and had plenty of space for 2 people and their toiletries. It had several lighting options as well. You could change it from late night to boardroom with an assortment of switches. In addition, I felt the supplied soaps and shampoos were excellent and felt no need to augment them. Every hallway, restroom, and staff member was immaculate in apperance and maintenance. I was not missing anything and I DID NOT want to leave.

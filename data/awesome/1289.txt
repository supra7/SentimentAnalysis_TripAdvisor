Considering the exorbitant hotel prices in Seattle, the Moore is really good value for money. The front desk is really helpful in providing you with tips on where to go and how to get around. I had a huge room on the 7th floor where I could see the bay. It was such a joy to wake up in the morning to that view. The location is good too. I could get around conveniently without much hassle, though the bus stop is at the next block. Nevertheless, it's a stone's throw away from Pikes and 5th Avenue. And if you are brave enough, you could actually walk to Pioneer square down 1st Avenue, or to the Space Needle in the opposite direction and that's nearer. Even though it's next to a theatre, The Moore Theatre, I'm not sure if there are actually performances. I checked it out, and the box office seemed perpetually closed. One caution though. If you are walking back late, the route along Stewart Way gets a little dodgy. The bar next door also tends to have people lingering outside after dark. So be on guard.

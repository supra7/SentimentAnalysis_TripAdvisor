The hotel delivers everything you'd expect from a newly renovated Sheraton. The rooms were clean and quiet (we were in a corner room in the Union Street Tower and requested the same when we stayed post cruise). From memory the rooms were 1751 and 1551. Free wireless internet in the rooms (although I don't recall seeing this advertised within the room) and plenty of space in the lobby to sit and connect wirelessly. The staff were excellent, and appeared to have things well under control during some busy periods. The valet parking charge was a little on the high side - however they were quick and polite. We ate at the Daily Grill (within the hotel) - It has a little more character than the usual hotel fare, food quality and value was good. Also, the location was a winner - Plenty to see and do around the hotel, many food and shopping choices.

After a long day of flight delays and missed connections walking into the Andra was such a relief. Every staff member we encountered during our three day stay was friendly and helpful, and the room was extremely clean and spacious. On top of great rooms and service, the Andra's location seemed ideal, and happy hour at Lola was excellent. The only thing that would have improved our stay was complementary wifi, but we will be staying at the Andra again.

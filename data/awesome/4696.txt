My husband and I went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon, it was one of our most amazing vacations. The service was great, the food was delicious. We were served appitizers daily around the pool, from sushi, to popcycles. We were spoiled! We booked a swim out room further back in the resort & when we got there we upgraded to an ocean front swim out room. My only complaint with ocean front is that there are trees actually blocking the view of the ocean, you could see it, but not the best view. However that room was great for access to the pool, as soon as you walked out of our room you were at the pool in a couple steps! It was very hot and humid in June, but absolutely beautful weather the entire week, no rain at all. For an all-inclusive this is TOP NOTCH! :)

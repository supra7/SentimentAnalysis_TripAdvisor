This place is exactly what I wanted and needed. Stayed in building 26 with Carlos as our concierge. Everything we wanted we had. The resort is beautiful, and the beach is stunning. I read a lot of reviews before coming to this place, so I will try not to repeat what others have said. I saw that it was mention there was no point in upgrading to the preferred club, and I disagree. Every day they have really delicious appetizers out for you in the preferred club lounge, they also have a better selection of wine in the lounge then at other places. We went there for happy hour 4 out of the 7 nights we were there. We never really had lunch and we usually didn't eat dinner until 9 or 10pm, so eating at the preferred club at 5 was perfect for us. The room was amazing! The view from our room was worth every penny of the upgrade to the preferred club. Bottom line is we will be coming back for our 1 year anniversary and will specifically request to stay in the same building/room O yea we spent some time at the spa, and I know some others have mentioned the prices were to high, again I disagree. We book 3 separate treatments and everything was amazing, plus you can go in early and play around in all the cool pools they have there. Do yourself a favor and book something there. Thanks Secrets!!

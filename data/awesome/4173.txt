My wife and I went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon. It was absolutely amazing!! Here's a breakout of our stay: Resort: It is located on Maroma Beach which is hands down the nicest beach we've ever been to. The pool is right by the beach with a swim up bar and pool side service. The resort had been open for about six months when we got there. For being open such a short time, they ran an amazing smooth operation. There were a few things to improve upon on, but overall it was great. Room: We had a junior swim out suite which was nice. However, I would not pay extra for the swimout suite and would instead opt for an oceanview suite. The room was immaculate. The linens were nice, the bed was soft, tile shower and a spa tub. Service: My only complaint was our butler. He was pretty much non-existent. He said he would take care of reservations and never did. Their 24/7 room service was a huge bonus...especially when arriving in on a late night flight. Dining: They had great food. The Hibachi place requires a reservation, but everywhere else does not. The Seaside Grill was great for lunch. I am very critical of every resort I stay at, but this one blew me away. I've been to Ft. Lauderdale, Punta Cana, Puerta Vallarta and Grand Cayman. All at 4-5 star resorts and Secrets Maroma Beach easily beats them all!!!

This downtown oasis is a hidden gem. I have travelled to Seattle for weekend getaways for many years and stayed in most 4-5* hotels in the downtown, Bellevue and Kirkland area but the Mayflower Park has the most wonderful consistent service and within walking distance of anything in downtown Seattle. From the time you park your car at the front door until breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant, the outstanding staff make every effort for a wonderful stay. Thank you for always making our stay memorable and so enjoyable.

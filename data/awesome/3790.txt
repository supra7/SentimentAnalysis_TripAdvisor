We have previously stayed at Excellence Riviera Cancun and El Dorado Royale and loved both of them, however we felt the service, food and rooms were truly top of the line at Secrets! We were thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this resort! We chose this resort this time due to the unlimited green fees. Golf is a big deal to us. The course, Playa Paraiso, is just a short taxi ride away and surpasses any other course we've played in this region of Mexico. We heard there's one other in the area which is fabulous but the PP is what was included with this resort. Carts are mandatory at $49 pp and there is a surcharge of $40 if you desire to play in the a.m., but still for $89 this course is a great value! The entertainment was great also, especially the "Rock and Roll" show! Be sure not to miss it. Our concierge, Roberto - bldg. 25 was awesome! He always had a friendly smile and was willing to do whatever we asked of him. I had heard that there were going to be mosquitos so we came prepared with repellant. We found not one! The only one thing I had to complain about was that the water temperature in the room wasn't hot enough for us. Maintenance came up twice and tried to adjust it, but it never did get hot. It was pretty warm, but we prefer really hot showers, even in the tropics. The water temperature in the showers at the spa was SUPER hot, so we know that they could up the temperature in the rooms if they chose to. That being said, we'll still most definitely return for our next vacation. Our favorite restaurant was the French one - awesome to say the least! Don't miss this one either.

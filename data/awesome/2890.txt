Stayed at the W from Aug 2 - 5th, 2009. Could not find anything to fault with this trendy hotel in a great location. Easy to walk everywher. Very quiet, had a 'wonderful" room on the 19th floor. No waiting for elevators, newspaper daily, very comfortable room with roomy sofa under window. DVD player, ipod dock, great bed, small fridge containing minibar. All staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Concierge right by the elevator always ready to answer questions or help plan sightseeing etc. We did not dine at the hotel, lots of available options nearby from fine dining to casual breakfast places. Very trendy front desk and lobby / living room area. Elevators had great music, hallways are dimly lit, a good idea seems to keep noise down in the hallways. All in all a very memorable trip, can't wait to stay at the "W" again !

We have the seasonal passes to Disney and everytime we come down we stay at Destiny Palms. We have stayed here 5 times in less than a year. The staff is great, very friendly and welcoming! Chuck even remembers my kids when we come down. You can definitely feel that the whole staff wants you to have a wonderful time at this hotel. The free breakfast is also nice, the rooms were clean. I really only have positive things to say about the staff and this hotel.

We went to Seattle to see Teatro Zinzanni before my husband deployed and got a great rate here. The staff was super friendly and kind, a relaxing wine hour was enjoyed, and we even got a free upgrade to a larger size room/bed. The front staff were helpful and so pleasant and they even supplied umbrella's (hello-Seattle!) when we went for a walk and realized ours were in the car. The room was spotless and had great tasty snacks! I recommend joining Kimpton in Touch before you go so you can get some extra amenities like free wireless. Will definately stay in Kimptons' again!

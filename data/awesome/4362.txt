Don't change a thing. The staff was curtious and professional at all times. They handled our large group with ease. The accomidations were the better than any resort I have ever stayed at. The resort has it all, great pool, wonderful ocean, exceptional rooms, and the entire staff was top notch. Would highly recommend this resort to anyone.

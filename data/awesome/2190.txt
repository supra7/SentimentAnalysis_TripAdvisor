We stayed at the Edgewater to celebrate my wife's birthday and to see a musical. The hotel is a four star hotel with very good service. Our room was an ocean view and all rooms have a fireplace. Our room had a claw foot tub, large glass (no door) shower and lots of granite. The bed was a pillow top and very comfortable. We enjoyed the modern, rustic look with the pine and river rock. If you are looking for a 4-star without character, then this is not for you. If you are looking for a Northwest (very nice) cabin feel, you have found home. The hotel is 100% non-smoking and clean.They provide a shuttle every hour on the hour to local spots.The only draw backs are as follows: Parking is $28 (valet) per night, the drinks are $10 each and they stop serving breakfast at 10 on Sunday to prepare for brunch. In recap, the view is fantastic, the service was great and the room was perfect. We would go again and we're glad that our Priceline bid landed us at the Edgewater.

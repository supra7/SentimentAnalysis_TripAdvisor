Stayed here for the airport convenience but the free shuttle to the $3 rail line into Seattle was an added bonus. Really easy to get into downtown and great hotel price. Amazingly, I don't remember hearing planes or traffic and the hotel rooms and pool area were clean and great. Good food at the restaurant though a bit pricey. Front desk staff friendly & helpful!

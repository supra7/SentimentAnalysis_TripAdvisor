This is an AMAZING hotel!!! When checking in our room was not available but instead of making us wait they gave us a free upgrade to a suite. While our view was of the room (which was fine with us) the living room/bedroom was perfect. My husband had a room to watch TV in at 4am (since he decided he had to get up early everyday in Seattle). The food at the hotel was good. Breakfast was perfect. We would stay here again for sure!!!!

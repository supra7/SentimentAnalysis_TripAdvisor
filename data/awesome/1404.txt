Before I made a reservation I read all the reviews and I was a little skeptical. However, we were staying with Marriott Rewards points and the Marriott downtown didn't have any rooms. We decided to bite the bullet and stay at the Renaissance. As rewards members we were upgraded to a room in the 23rd floor with marvelous water and mountains views. The room itself was very nice and clean with lots of space. The fitness room was a little crowded but not bad for a hotel. We didn't use the pool because we forgot our bathing suits but it looks like a very nice pool to relax at the end of the day. Every one was very nice and polite during our stay. When we asked, the valet parking attendant suggested that we park our car on the street to avoid the hotel parking fee since parking on the street is free on the weekends. There was never an issue with extra towels and toiletries. Some people have complained about the location. We didn't experience any noise and the walk was a pleasant walk. The walk is uphill but we found it invigorating, great way to exercise. For those that have problems walking, there is taxi service outside the hotel. The concierge service is excellent with great knowledge of the city. While we were able to catch a signal from another building, one thing they should change is the access to high speed internet; $12.95 per day is a lot of money for a service that should be free. The hotel room rates are a little high but I would stay here again even if we don't have enough points for a free night.

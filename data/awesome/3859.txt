We were at Secrets Resort for our 20th anniversary. We had booked an ocean view junior suite in the preferred club but were offered an upgrade to ocean front for a discounted price. It was a beautiful room with a great view. We ate at the World Cafe, Oceana, Seaside grill, the japanese and of course the barefoot grill by the pool. All of the food was great. The concierge was very helpful and everyone was very nice. We had to change our original travel date and Jennifer at tripguy was very helpful with this. She made everything very easy. I recommend using her for your travel needs. Her email is jennifer@tripguy.com.

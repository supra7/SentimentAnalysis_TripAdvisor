I've stayed at Hotel Max twice in the past month. Once for leisure. Once for business. The first time my husband and I had a room on the 6th floor at a good rate ($159) and found it an all around good value. The hotel and restaurant staff are great - friendly, efficient and helpful We liked the neat, clean room with pleasant, modern furnishings (we are very picky). Bathroom is tiny, but functional. Rooms are on the small side, but so clean and simply furnished, with a very comfy bed, they are relaxing. We were not bothered much by noise on the 6th floor. The public spaces are nicely furnished with original art, comfortable, modern furniture and hallways with cool, photographic images on each door. I liked it so much I decided to stay there again on my next biz trip. This 2nd visit was not quite as pleasant as the 1st only because I was in a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the alley. Since it was a biz trip, and didn't spend much time in the room, I didn't ask to change rooms. However, being so close to alley level meant that I was awakened at 5:30AM by trucks. Having gone to bed at 1AM this was inconvenient. Nevertheless I would DEFINITELY recommend Hotel Max and I would stay there again. If you like sushi and other Japanese-style food, the hotel restaurant Red Fin is great for Happy Hour. It also serves very tasty breakfasts at decent prices.

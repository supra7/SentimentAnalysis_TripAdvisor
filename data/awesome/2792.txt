We got a great rate on the Vintage Park through a travel website and booked it based on other reviews here. The first room we were given faced a brick wall with an air conditioning unit directly below us, but we called the front desk and were moved to a larger room on a higher floor. It didn't really have a view, but that was fine with us. It let in plenty of light and was very comfortable. If you want a view go eat at Pike's Market or visit the Space Needle, both within easy walking distance of the hotel. The bed was also comfortable and everything was in good working order. We didn't dine at the restaurant, but we did visit the wine tasting. Both nights we were there the wines were not the best examples of what the Northwest has to offer (Hint: look for Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley or Cabernet from Eastern Washington) and one night the wine seward had actually chilled the red wines instead of the white, but still, it's a free glass of wine before you go out for dinner.

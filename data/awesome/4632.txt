We've been to Aventura Spa Palace, Execllence Riviera, Dreams Riviera and Secrets Maroma is by far the best All Inclusive resort we've been to. The resort is clean, the food is great, the rooms are spacious (we were in the preferred section) and as you will always find in Mexico, the service and the people are just wonderful. By far this has the best beach too. We can't wait to go back and this time with some family or friends!!!

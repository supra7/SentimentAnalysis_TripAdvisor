This hotel is the best value - great price, full breakfast, fitness, pool, spa, internet, coffee, free parking. On top of that, I was really impressed how friendly and helpful the staff were - added that little bit more on what was already a good value stay. Some of the double rooms are a little tight, but it was exceptionally clean from top to bottom, including the pool and the breakfast area, etc. Great location for seattle center and take monorail ($2) to downtown.

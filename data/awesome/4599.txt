To begin, this is the first review I've ever written about a vacation. We are seasoned travelers but we both agreed that Secrets Maroma Beach Resort & Spa is the best trip we've ever experienced whether solo or together. The service is "Top Notch" and it comes standard with being a guest. The staff are very competent and trained on delivering stellar service and will go out of their way to ensure your stay would be an unforgettable one. As soon as you arrive, you are greeted with a warm, "Welcome Home" by the curb side staff. Then, a nice cold aroma therapy cloth is delivered on a tray to cool you off from the heat. We were offered 3 glasses of champagne in a 20 minute time span for waiting for our room assignment. By the way, we recommend the swim-up jacuzzi suite. It's very romantic and awe inspiring. The facilitiy is just impeccable in appearance and lay out, very picturesque! All of the 8 restaurants were superb with their menus and believe me, we sampled them all for ourselves. If you are a big eater, we recommend you order two main courses for your meal as they serving sizes are conservative to give you the gourmet look as seen on TV. Order as much as you like, it's ALL inclusive. The drinks were tasty and not watered down. You will have your own concierge assigned to you as well and 24 hour room service. This place is Grreeeat for honeymooners, wedding anniversaries and general purpose vacation. The age group is diverse we noticed and it's a nice blend of people. The pools are gorgeous and the beach is one of the cleanest white sand beaches out there! No trash EVER or debris. This is a thumbs up review and we WILL go back again. Oh, there are activities to do as well off the resort which are coordinated and well structured.

Stopped in for one night on the way home from a wedding in Victoria, Canada, and the Westin lived up to it's standards. Loved the "Westin bed" and the "Westin bath"! We stayed in the South tower, 18th floor, and had a nice view of the city. The hotel is in easy walking distance to many sites and attractions. The monorail is also nearby. Booked through HotWire and got a great deal of $117, inc tax. Tips: We walked a few blocks down 5th Ave to Tula's for Sunday night jazz and dinner. Cover was $5, and the food and music excellent! And the next morning breakfast at the 5 Spot in Queen Anne neighborhood (you need a car). This month the theme was "Puerto Rico" -- it changes every 3 months. Great food and service -- fun for kids and adults. And our quick visit at Pike's Market on the way to the airport was fun. What's not to love about fresh flowers and food. You gotta try the "OMG Peaches!"

One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in-The staff is exceedingly friendly, the rooms are excellent and the location is superb-within walking distance to all of the top sights in Seattle!! i.e.around the corner from Pikes Market. We loved every minute of our visit to Seattle, much of our enjoyment due to the pleasure of this extremely well-managed hotel!!

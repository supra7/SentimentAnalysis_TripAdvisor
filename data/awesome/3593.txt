We just got back a week and a half ago and stayed there for 5 nights. The king size bed we had was absolutely amazing. The rest of the group we were with said their beds were the same! Comfy, comfy, comfy. The room was also very attractive and clean. I would recommend this site to any of my friends and family traveling to go to Disney. This hotel was on a main strip with so much shopping, resturants, and a main way to get to the Disney parks. Staff was also great! So friendly and helpful. And the rates are very affordable!! Thanks Destiny Palms Hotel for making our trip a great one!

At the end of a week long trip that included Seattle and Victoria, we stayed one night at the Edgewater on the recommendation of a friend who was raised in Seattle. Our ground floor waterfront room had a balcony right over the water. We sat out on the deck chairs and enjoyed the view and the ferry that went by like clockwork. It was like being on a boat. Beautiful lobby with floor to ceiling windows and comfortable chairs for a relaxing view. We utilized the in-room fireplace (the switch is located in the bathroom under the vanity). The room was pricy but unique. The hotel is right next to the pier that the ferry to Victoria uses, so it was very conveniently located for that leg of our trip.

My partner and I stayed here for two nights in mid-August and had the greatest time ever!!! Aside from the hotel's main selling point - its location - this hotel has so many things to offer. As Preferred Guests, we were booked into the new Union Tower, on the 24th floor, in a room with one King and a city room. The space was clean, quiet, beautifully decorated and well ventilated. The pool and recreation centre in the Pike Tower were also clean and easy to access. The restaurants downstairs served average food at a relatively reasonable price, but given your proximity to other venues, it would be advisable to eat elsewhere. Try the Tap House (with 160 different beers on tap and good food to boot) or the Cheesecake Factory, both of which are only a block away. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!

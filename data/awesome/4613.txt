We have been to 10 different resorts trying to find the "one". well we did, I won't go into detail about the food, service,rooms,beach all excellent. For us it was the people that worked there. You do feel like you have come home. We did not find one person that wasn't trying to make our stay a plessure. We will be back in April 2011.

My sister and I took our kids to the hotel for march break. This hotel is absolutely incredible. We had the superior room. Great city view. The beds are so comfortable the kids slept in to 11am every day. The pool was fantastic and clean. Life guard on duty. Gym had the highest end treadmills I've ever seen. The cleaning ladies just left us extra towels without asking. The pool also has towels. Hot tub is outside with space heaters so youre not cold going in and out. Same block as the bell centre and one block from St. Catherines street. The staff were really incredible. So polite and informative. We asked for restaurants to go to and they new the best ones, I asked for hockey tickets and they got them for me in my price bracket. Such a fantastic time. I will always stay at le crystal when I go to Montreal.

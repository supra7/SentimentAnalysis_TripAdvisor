Great hotel. Nice group of staff. Stay in the suite on the top and overlook the city from the huge balcony. Overall, it was a nice stay. The staff were wonderful, very kind and professional. The hotel is pretty big and can be a little challenging for new customers to find their way around the hotel to their room. Believe it or not, I kind of ended up getting lost and had to regroup at the front desk. The bell boy, with a smile, immediately said he'll lead me to my room - I was amazed of the great customer service! I was surprised of his great service. I thought, maybe, it was because it was just simply in his Asain blood - as I know of Asains to be very hard working and respectful. I noticed and received a very strong impression that the the entire staff were very kind and always said hello to passing customers. They have Starbucks inside the hotel on the first floor, so it worked out perfect for me!!! Again, overall, it was a great experience. Ask the concierieg about the Korean BBQ Restaurant in town - very delicious! He'll call a nice Lincoln Towncar for the same price for a cab. It'll cost you about $40 one-way, but it's worth it all. The mall is located only minutes away from the hotel, I think it's only 3-miles away...Had a great time...I'll be back!

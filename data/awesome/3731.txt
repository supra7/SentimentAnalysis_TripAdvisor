Visited Secrets Maroma in March of 2011. We did not choose this hotel as we booked an adults only, all-inclusive, 6G Square Deal through Apple. We were very surprised when the agent told us we were assigned to Maroma. We enjoyed every minute of the trip. The best restaurants were the seafood (Oceana?) and the French (Portofino?). We were less impressed by the steak restaurant (ordered Kobe beef and it was the worst steak I have ever had). The breakfast buffet was well above average, especially when we found the mimosa table (although we had plenty served to us by the staff as well). We ate at the poolside grill for lunch every day and never got tired of it. The wait staff was amazing. The bartenders rotate but we always enjoyed to people working the swim-up bar. Pablo at the French restaurant was very accomodating and kept our glasses full, plus an welcome but unrequested Frangelico for dessert. They could have a couple more servers for drinks on the beach, but a couple of bucks went a long way to getting faster / more regular service on the sand. The front desk was responsive to any requests we made. We were surprised one day to find a note that our safe had been locked and we had to call security because the safe was found open by housekeeping. Nothing was missing, they were following their protocols and I certainly appreciate that they were being careful. They were very professional. We went to the front desk to request security based on the note and they were waiting for us when we got to the room. We are anxious for a return to Secrets or a similar chain (Dreams or Now) to see how it compares. I do not know that the price difference for Maroma is worth the extra cost, but we certainly enjoyed the trip!

Very friendly, fast check in. The room was exactly as we had asked for in the online reservation system. All staff was friendly, and very welcoming. I only had two issues, but it didn't take away from the wonderful time we had there. You have to have valet parking regardless of the fact that you may not be leaving the room or grounds. The valet parking is an extra 34$ on top of the nightly rate. They used to have where you could park right in front on your own, but they changed that. We had a beautiful, king, water view room one of the windows had bird droppings all over it. It was a great stay!!! We plan on coming back at least 4 times a year. It was wonderful Thank you Edgewater for going above and beyond on customer service!!! ps Room service food was amazing!!

I have nothing negative to say about our holiday at SMB, it was wonderful despite the terrible weather we had, which can't be helped. In summary, The SPA is worth every penny (use your vouchers). The food was fantastic if you avoid the beach burgers (if your from UK you will be impressed by the food, Americans have much higher standards than us). The staff were brilliant, use your concierge they are extremely helpful. The cocktails are to die for and the house wine (white, rose and red) were all a good enough standard, with the mini bar as an excellent plus. Best of all was the beach, beautiful, with wildlife everywhere if you look. You will enjoy :) its expensive and a long way to go for us Scots, so doubt I will be back :(

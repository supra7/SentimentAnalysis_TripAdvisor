Everything was fantastic, from the time the courtesy van driver picked us up at the airport until we returned to the airport. We had a flight mixup and found ourselves at the airport at 7 pm, with no room and 28 hours until our red eye flight the next evening. We were able to get reservations immediately using the Marriott central phone reservation system. The van arrived within 15 minutes and we were at the hotel 10 minutes after that. We were greeted with extreme courtesy at the hotel. The front desk clerk was especially cheerful and helpful. She provided us with a Marriott Platinum room upgrade before I even requested it. Once we got settled in the large, comfortable room, we went to the Club Lounge and were, again, pleasantly greeted. The manager asked if we'd had dinner (it was about 7:30) and when we replied we had not, she prepared us a wonderful dinner from the evening's buffet, even tho it had closed at 7 pm. She was very attentive throughout the time we spent in the Club Room. The indoor pool and hot tub were wonderful. Perfect temperature and wonderful scenery. The workout facility was top rate. The next day we had breakfast in the Club Room. Again, great food and service. We had a late lunch in the lobby bar. Superb food and service. I have travelled to thirty countries, and this is one of the best hotels I have ever visited. Superb!

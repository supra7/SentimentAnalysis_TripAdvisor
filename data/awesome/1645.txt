We had previously booked at another hotel in Seattle & were incredibly disappointed, which is how we found ourselves at the Sheraton. The staff was wonderful and after our tiring day we were extremely grateful. Mostly used as a business hotel, this was is very nice, marble floors, leather lounging chairs & everyone dressed as if they're on their way to the meeting of the century. Rooms were exceptionally clean and spacious. Excellent location & easily walkable to Pike's. The one gripe I have about the hotel is that for paying so much money, it would be very nice to have free internet in the rooms. That cost $10.95. It was free in the lobby but a pain having to walk to the lobby each time instead of the comfort of my room. Overall nice hotel, great location.

Service second to non. Very friendly, helpful staff throughout. Room stunning with glorious sea view (paid for as extra). Food excellent quality in all restaurants. Sea gorgeous and staff serving drinks to sunbeds all day. Pool lovely and nice extra's like chefs offering taster foods. Abundant top shelf drinks and great cocktails. Ambiance of resort relaxing and romantic but also plenty to do if your so inclined. High standards of everything without being pretencious. Exceptionally clean. Many guests we met had returned to Secrets having done Dreams, Excellence etc as very hard to beat. Golf good at nearby Iberostar. We will definetely be returning next winter as so impressed with the place. Simply beautiful resort. Top marks to Secrets who have got everything right at Maroma Beach. Highly recommended.

My wife and I recently stayed for 5 nights for our honeymoon in late August 2011 and couldn't have been happier. We stayed in a swimout preferred club room and would highly recommend it. Even if you don't use the swimout pool very often, it's a nice option to have. We've stayed at some other "all-inclusive" resorts through the years and the rooms here were by far the best. I think the service was the best part of the experience however. All of the workers here are very nice and always courteous. They will go out of their way to make sure you have what you need. Bartender/food service by the pool and beach was something that we had never experienced at other all-inclusives and truly allowed you to relax. The conceirge was a nice added bonus of the swimout room. The food was also fantastic - we had the Hibachi, Italian twice (Portofino), and the steak (Seaside Cafe I think it was called). I don't know if I could pick a favorite they were all VERY good. The Kobe steak at Seaside was probably my favorite meal though. The breakfast buffet in the morning was also fantastic and had anything you could think of. We only saw one of the shows, but there were offerings almost every night. The drink selection was also great - they offer top shelf liquor at almost every bar which was another thing we had never experienced at other resorts. I honestly don't see how anyone could give a bad review of this resort, it's honestly the best we've been to and we will definintely be returing soon. Book with confidence!

I booked a room at the the Warwick in Seattle for my husband and grandson for August 16th and 17th 2009. They drove from Alaska to Seattle because my husband loves the drive and my grandson had always wanted to make the "Alcan" drive. I had requested Ivey to put them in a room with a view of the Space Needle if at all possible. She was still there when they checked in and she gave them a room with a beautiful view of the Space Needle (thank you Ivey). They were thrilled with their accommodations. The room was very nice, clean and quiet. They added an extra night to the original reservation because it was such a nice place to stay at a very reasonable rate. The hotel is within walking distance to many attractions. No need to use the truck the entire time they were there. My grandson took advantage of the onsite amenities (pool and workout room). They ate at the onsite restaurant yesterday morning and said the food was very good. Thank you to the Warwick manager for calling and checking to see that they were enjoying their stay and to make sure they were comfortable and being well taken care of by the staff.

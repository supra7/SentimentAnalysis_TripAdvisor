WOW! We had the most wonderful time March 07 -14, 2010 at Secrets Maroma Beach; this was our second time and it was as amazing and wonderful as our first trip in January 2009. We are beach people and expect to be able to go for long walks when the mood strikes. THIS BEACH IS SPECTACULAR. We walked for 45 minutes on each side of the hotel (north and south) and could have continued further if desired. The sand was very soft and never hot. The ocean was the prettiest turquoise you imagine. It was windy while we were there and so had waves to play in. We never had a problem finding loungers at the beach. It was decadent to have 'servers' at the beach - and we certainly took advantage of the opportunity to quench our thirst (often!) . I couldn't believe my eyes when the chefs came offering all sorts of culinary treats - in their uniforms - midday. Lovely. The pools were beautiful looking but we did not go to Secrets for the pool (or swim up bar). The rooms were extremely spacious and very, very clean (also high on my list of must haves). Staff was amazing; food spectacular. We had a wonderful, wonderful week; it is so hard being back home and back to reality. We will back - and I can't wait.

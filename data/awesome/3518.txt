We stayed here for 3 nights in August - before our kids (10 and 12) returned to school. The hotel is located across the street from the Bell Centre. It is about a 15 minute to old town. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and other action within a one-two minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is very clean, has plenty of nice cars in the small parking area, and is located in a new, and fashionable, buiding. Our room was excellent and included a fireplace, sitting area, separate bed room, small kitchen areas, and 2 bathrooms. We started to refer to the room as our 'apartment' in Montreal. The pool is well managed and includes a beautiful outdoor hot tub. If I found a good price on a room on 'Le Crystal' I would run back. Great stay!

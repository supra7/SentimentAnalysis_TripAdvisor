Absolutely well located, a few blocks from downtown Seattle, a few blocks from the Public Market, this Hotel has excellent service, great and spacious rooms, clean and comfortable. Wi-fi was also working in my room. Not to mention the Moore Coffee, a small and beaultiful coffee shop just for you. If you are going to Seattle, this is your hotel.

Had the best sleep ever at this hotel. I was facing the street but did not hear any street noise. Hotel was pretty quiet, I did not hear noise from any other rooms. Make sure you sample the "pillow menu"...this hotel has the best pillows! Had breakfast in the restaurant which was good and the service was smooth. Elevators are small.

We booked this Hotel on a "reverse fly and park" deal. We parked our car then flew to NC for Christmas. When we returned we stayed at the hotel one night before returning home. This Hotel is very accommodating and staff was extremely helpful. The rooms are very nice, roomy and comfortable. They have sleep number beds - but the jury is still out on exactly how comfortable they really are as compared to higher-end mattresses. I read one review where the person was up all night listening to the sound of the sleep number bed's motor. Although we heard our neighbor's bed "once" I am convinced that it would not have kept us awake or woke us up. Linens are super nice, bath towels new and large. Location is outstanding - right across from the Airport and their shuttle service is convenient. I think they have fridges on request. They have a restaurant and bar but we got in late and left early so we did not utilize either one. If your flying out of Seattle and need a convenient place to park and a nice hotel to say in - this is the place for you.

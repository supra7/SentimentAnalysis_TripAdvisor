Hotel Vintage Park is centrally located in downtown Seattle, it was very easy to get to the shopping areas/Pike Place Market and a few good restaurants. We did not have a car and it was very convenient to get around. The staff at the reception were all friendly and helpful. It really only took a couple of minutes to check in and out. We were offered a coffee-maker, which was delivered within 10 minutes of our arrival with coffee/sugar etc. all on a tray. The room was spacious with bathrobes/socks/umbrella/in-room safe inside the wardrobe, and actually had plenty of hangers as well. The bathroom had good lighting, also with all the amenities that we needed. Our king size bed was comfortable with good pillows/sheets. We liked the decor, the couch and bed were not clattered with cushions (lots of modern hotels have heaps of cushions these days, and we usually have to move them around to create more room). Our room was on the top floor, so we had a leafy outlook of the city. The wine tasting evening was a nice social occasion to meet fellow travellers, especially for the single travellers. We really enjoyed it. We joined the Kimpton Intouch, so we got free internet throughout our stay, and it was great to be able to keep in touch with friends and family. This hotel is just so unique, one has to stay there to experience the difference ! We will definitely stay there again when we are back in Seattle next.

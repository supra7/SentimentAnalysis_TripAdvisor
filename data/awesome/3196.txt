Wonderful large rooms with very comfortable beds, nice, clean bathrooms, all in a resort like setting near the city, shopping, restaurants, and sight-seeing. The hotel has great workout facilities, good restaurants both on-site and nearby, as well as wonderful room service. And it has great access to freeways that can easily get you to the best Seattle has to offer. This is a great place to stay. I have stayed there 3 times in the past 4 years, the first time through Priceline. But even at styandard rates it is a good deal. I will only stay here when in the Seattle area.

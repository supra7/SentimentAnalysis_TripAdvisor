The staff was courteous and professional. Our room was top notch, and the housekeepers were in and our often, but we never saw them. The bed was to die for - so comfortable wrapped up in a spa robe freshly showered after a long day at the beach/pool. Highly recommend - it was our honeymoon - and a 10 out of 10.

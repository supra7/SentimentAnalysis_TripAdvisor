Stayed here on New Years Eve, and chose this over the Hotel 1000 at the last minute. Mainly, I wanted larger rooms, and that's what I got. I got the King Suite and it was very roomy and spacious for the price. The room was very well appointed, very modern, but not cold like the W. I compare this hotel to the W because I often stay at W's when I travel because I like the service and quality of their rooms. Andra is a very well appointed and designed hotel. I like the stylistic touches you'll see throughout the property. In a lot of ways, it was much better than any W I've been too, especially for the price. The service was really great. I saw lots of hustle with the bell captains, and desk staff. NYE is a very busy night, and there was no lack of attention anywhere. The best part of the hotel is that it's in the middle of Tom Douglas' restaurant Disneyland. Lola's is in the hotel, Dahlia Lounge is across the street, and Serious Pie is a block up. My dinner at Lola's and Dahlia lounge was extraordinary, and the quality of the meal and attention to detail to food rivals restaurants that cost ten times more in L.A. and NY. Lola's is also the "kitchen" for the hotel. GET BREAKFAST IN BED IN THE MORNING. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. GET THE BREAKFAST WITH THE HOME MADE SAUSAGES AND CRAVE THEM...FOREVER! ...also, there's a Martini at the Dahlia Lounge made with a local gin from DRY FLY in which, if the craving doesn't subside, I will have to fly up to Seattle just to savor it's taste again. I'm thinking if you just stay here at the hotel, hit all the Tom Douglas' restaurants, you're in for a very chic and satisfying getaway.

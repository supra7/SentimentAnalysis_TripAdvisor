Stayed one week for business, got a discount through our travel service; high price (over $200 night,) but well worth the experience. The room in the newer tower was clean, spacious, great light from big windows, comfy bed. Lobby is spacious, chairs for lounging, free wi-fi, complimentary computer use. Staff friendly, check-in smooth; fee for parking, but really easy & nice guys. Pool and hot tub in other tower, but you gotta go anyway. On the top floor (35th?), incredible view, all around Seattle, feels like you're floating in the sky while in the pool. Totally fun and memorable. Restaurant attached to hotel is okay. Service was spotty. Spendy prices. But very convenient. Hubby says: TV too small for a King room. 11 son says: Really cool electronic table top in lobby, but there is only one and not everybody shares. (This is a touch screen coffee table with chess and a few other games, novel idea.) It snowed in Feb 2011, and the Sheraton in right across the street from the Convention Center, so access to work was simple and short, no driving. Mini fridge in room, no microwave. Quiet, safe, nice.

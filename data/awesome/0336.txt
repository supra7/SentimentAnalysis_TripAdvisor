Comfortable room, very good restaurant, good location for Pike St. Market and Piers for ferries. Also on Grayline Airporter bus route. However, due to street repairs, hotel is not being served during Spring/Summer 2009 and you have to get off/get on bus at Westin Hotel, 3 blocks away -- which is fine if is not raining!

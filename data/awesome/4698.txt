We had a fantastic time at Secrets Maroma Beach. It was a first class property decorated to the nines. Each themed restaurant made us feel as though we were dining in the country of origin. The food was amazing and abundant (although I wouldn't eat the beef again - a bit chewy). The beach is the most beautiful beach I've ever been to with sand like silk. We always found a chair at the pool where we could relax or be entertained. The entertainment was NOT overwhelming, but yet available if we were restless. The staff was extremely hospitable with "it's my pleasure" response to every request. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and upgraded to the Preferred Club & would do it again. We were steps from the private bar which always offered appetizers, cocktails, espresso/coffee, free internet access, books & current magazines. I highly recommend taking advantage of this option. My husband like to hang out there while I showered and got dressed at night.

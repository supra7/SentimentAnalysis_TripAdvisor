My husband and I chose this resort for our 20th Anniversary - it was wonderful! It was recommended by a friend, and then after reading the reviews online, it almost sounded too good. There is NOTHING that I didn't like about this resort. The pool, swim up bar, beach, restaurants, shows, etc - everything was perfect. Would definitely go back - unfortunately, this year we told the kids that we would take them, and since this is adults only, we have to find a different place to go :( BUT, I did appreciate the fact that there were no kids running around the resort. Perfect resort if you're looking for luxury for adults only.

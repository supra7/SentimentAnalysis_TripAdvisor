My girlfriend and I stayed here in July the night before the bite of Seattle. I called this place last minute and got the last available standard room. We were very impressed upon entering the unassuming entrance to the hotel. A stairway up to the front desk lead us to a beautiful lobby with giant ceiling. Very modern feeling inside. We ended up paying about $100 for one night. The room had a single full sized bed (sufficient for my gf and I), a table and a sink with toiletries supplied, also two white robes. The bathrooms were down the hall as well as the showers which are shared between patrons. Very clean and private. The location is great. It sits above the cyclops bar which has some great food. I recommend the fish tacos! Lots of great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. Overall a great experience here. Friendly staff and free waffles in the morning!!

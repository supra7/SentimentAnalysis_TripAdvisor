Although at first sight the area might appear deserted and the hotel abandoned, it is actually far from truth. The hotel is very clean and modernized inside. The staff were fluent in English and were very helpful. I'm not sure if our room was standard or upgraded fro honeymooners, but everything was sparkling clean and the bathroom spacious. The fridge however wasn't working and one of the staff members tried to make it work but something just wasn't right. Also the shower-head wasn't switching modes but couldn't care less about that. To my surprise, the area seemed to be fairly safe, as we constantly made trips back and forth at night with no incident. But it CAN appear intimidating owing to its very quiet neighborhood. The walk to Bologna subway station is at least 10min (unless you make a run for it) and the buses take longer to get to the center, so I recommend the subway. The full breakfast was great, something we really missed in some of our consequent hotels. Overall, if you don't mind the walk to the subway, this hotel is an amazing find! PS: do your research on what's closed on Mondays in Rome and what season is the "vacation" season for the locals - it would save you a few surprises when you face the closed doors of a certain attraction or restaurant

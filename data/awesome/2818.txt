My husband stayed Dec 4-15(11 nights), I stayed 4. We both do a lot of business travel and I have to say this was our favorite hotel. The wine tasting was lovely every evening, great location, very confortable beds/pillows, very clean, homey atmosphere, helpful staff/cleaners. A very nice touch with the hot apple cider/coffee tea. It made our first trip to Seattle that much more enjoyable. Thanks

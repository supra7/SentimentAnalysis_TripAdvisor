Location is the key when I travel with limited time and lots of "to-do" on the list. Pike Market was definitely one of the top destination during this trip and Sheraton wasconviniently located just a few blocks away from Pike Market. Not only close to Pike Market, but also many attractions/destinations in Seattle. I was impressed with service/amemities/price/cleanliness that Sheraton Seattle offered. I willl definitelt say there again if I ever travel to Seattle again!!

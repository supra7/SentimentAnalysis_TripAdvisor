We live within a 45 - 60 minute drive - or a ferry or train ride - of the Mayflower Park Hotel and stay over in Seattle at least once a year just for fun. We love the hotel, including its associated restaurant, Andaluca. Service is great - hotel staff make you feel welcome from the minute you arrive. It is our favorite hotel in Seattle.

Without being asked, the staff at Secrets Maroma Beach told us how happy they are to work there, because the Management are so good to them. The staff were warm and couldn't do enough for us! Three that stood out were Roberto, the Conceirge for Buildings 12 and 14: Anna, the server at the beach; and I am sorry to say I don't know the name of the lovely lady who makes the omellettes. The beautiful surroundings, the rooms, the beaches are second to none. The food in the restaurants is terrific. This is a wonderful resort to spend with those close to you. We didn't spend time in the disco, but others who did reported it was an active spot.

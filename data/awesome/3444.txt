I recently stayed at Lindemann's for six nights, and was very, very, pleased with the hotel. I had a basic room, which was larger than I was expecting (I loved the slate bathroom with heated towel rack!). The staff was mutli-lingual and very friendly. The breakfast buffet (at 11 Euros) had a good selection of European breakfast items. You can certainly eat for cheaper at a local cafe or bakery, but I thought the buffet was worth the cost. The hotel does not have a gym or pool, nor is there a coffee maker or iron in the room. A U-Bahn station is only a few minutes walk away. I would definitely stay here again! I selected this hotel based on the Travelocity reviews, and I was not disappointed!

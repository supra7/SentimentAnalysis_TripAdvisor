We had the preferred club status with a swim out pool room. It was fabulous! The rooms were clean & so was the rest of the resort. Very natural setting and the beach was very nice...not crowded with spring breakers. The pools were great! One infinity pool and the other with a swim up bar. Spa services rocked! Food was decent. One neat thing is they would bring you little appetizers of sushi, etc. while you were sitting around the pool during the afternoon. My favorites: the preferred club lounge and amenities, the swim out pool room & the beach. Least favorite: all inclusive didn't include bottles of wine or champagne, you have to order individual glasses to avoid additional charges.

We went to Secrets Maroma for our honeymoon. It was the perfect resort for honeymooners. You can relax by the pool or beach all day, as you are waited on non-stop. They also have activities all day to participate in or shows at night to watch. The staff is beyond accommodating. The food was delicious no matter where you went. The resort was very clean as well. I would definitely go back to this resort or recommend it to others.

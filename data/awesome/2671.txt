I've stayed here three times now for business and am always impressed. The hotel is a short walk to Pike Place market, shopping, and other tourist attractions. The staff is incredibly friendly, takes initiative, and helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful and unique. My rooms have always been exceptionally clean and quiet. A high quality for the value. I especially love the wine hour each evening. If you have a rental car, the valet service is great and has a quick turn around (unlike other city valet services).

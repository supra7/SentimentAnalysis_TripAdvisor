I love Kimpton hotels. Being a free InTouch member and having the New York Times delivered to me, a free raid the minibar card, free upgrade and wine in the hotel lobby between 5 and 6pm - it can't be beat. The staff is friendly and helpful. Frette sheets on the comfortable beds. Half price parking for hybrid cars and pet friendly. I'm bringing my cat next time!

My husband and I chose Secrets Maroma for our honeymoon. From the moment we walked through the door the service was outstanding. I was constantly in awe how nice the staff was. From maids to concierge, all had a smile and "what can we do for you" attitude. I cannot tell you how beautiful the place is. If you're looking for a modern upscale resort, this is your place. The food was also outstanding. You will not go hungry at any point during your stay! A restraunt was open almost every hour, or the poolside grill if you didn't want to leave the pool. The free 24 hour room service was also a great perk! I'm not sure we could ever top this resort, in fact, I don't want to try! We are hoping to book a return trip soon!

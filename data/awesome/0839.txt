Stayed here with my wife for two days. I think we were on the 25th floor so the noise wasn't noticed. The club level continental breakfast was decent and they also have an assortment of munchies from 5 to 7. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Easy walk to the shops uptown and a hilly walk to Pike's Place Market and the waterfront. Yes parking is kind of expensive, but not many other options and it is in line with what the other hotels charge. Room was decent sized with a fridge. Would stay here again.

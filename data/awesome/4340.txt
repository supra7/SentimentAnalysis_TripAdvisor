Well where to begin...this place is just amazing! Just got back from a 5 night stay in a junior partial ocean view room...we were in building 25 which was a great location midway between the beach and the lobby/restaurants...the room itself was very roomy and comfortable, very modern with everything you could need.....beach and pool area was beautiful, the service is the best I have ever experienced! Go visit Luis for lunch at the Seaside Grill and Freddy for breakfast at the World Cafe...the entire staff is very accommodating they will do anything for you! The food at all the restaurants was very very good...make sure to have a crepe for breakfast and the lobster at the French restaurant! We never had a problem finding good chairs at the pool or beach...we only went to one of the nighttime shows and it was ok...definitely visit Coco Bongo's while you are in the area...we reserved at the tours desk in the main lobby and got a good deal...the only thing I would make a complaint about would be the housekeeping service...most days we would get back from the beach around 3-4pm and our room would still not be cleaned yet! A quick call and they would be right there to clean it however....all in all a fabulous time, will definitely be returning in the future!

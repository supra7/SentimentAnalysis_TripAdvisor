I really enjoyed staying here. It has a very unique indoor pool. The rooms are very nice, modern and well-equipped. The in-room wifi is a complete ripoff and is unacceptable when paying these kinds of rates. Of course then most people went to the business center and one of the computers was broken so you always had to wait. Or you could sit in the lobby with your computer for free wifi. Annoying. Also the parking situation where you have to use your key to get out is annoying. But I could understand that they are near the airport and people probably try to take advantage. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel that is very clean and the sleep quality was very good. The staff should get some more education on Seattle though. If you want to go in there there was a lot of cluelessness.

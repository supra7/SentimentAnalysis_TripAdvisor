The location is right downtown. One could walk there from the new Seattle light rail system provided you walked out the right door of the terminal! The rooms are right on the street and they do tend to be a tad noisy but not as bad as they could be. I had a corner room which are good sized but the bathrooms are downright tiny. The bellmen were ever so much fun.

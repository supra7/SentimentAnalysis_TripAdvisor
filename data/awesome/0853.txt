We stayed there for a Friday-Tuesday couple weekend. I booked the tickets through Hotwire.com. So since I'd never used Hotwire before, I assumed I would be staying in the worst room in the place. This was an incorrect assumtion. I call the hotel a couple of days before we left and ask if they could put a note on my reservation that we were there to celibrate my wife's 40th birthday. So when we arrived, the girl who checked us in saw that note and took care of us. She put us on the 26th floor with a view of the Space Tower and a partial view of the water front. It was an executive king-bed room. The room was very nice and was 1st class. **I was a little concerned at first, since the room was right next to an elevator. This turned out not to be an issue at all. We never heard the elevator or any guests using it. I didn't even have to ware my ear plugs the entire stay. Location: The hotel was in a good location. We were 2.5 block from the light rail, which we took from the airport & back. The light rail was great!!! $2.50 each way and we never waited for a train!!! It was clean and felt very safe. I will use it again. 5 blocks from water front. So walking wasn't so bad. We also made our way on foot to Space Tower via monorail, Pike's Place, Safeco Field for a baseball game (we took the light rail there.) **Disclaimer: Seattle is very very hilly. So be prepared to walk up hill all the time. Big big hills. Breakfest: We ate breakfest at the hotel's buffet in the morning 2x. It's a litlle crowded, but if you get there from 6am-7ish, you'll have the place to yourselve.

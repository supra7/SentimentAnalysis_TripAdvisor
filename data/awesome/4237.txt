AMAZING resort! I picked this spot for my honeymoon based mainly on the reviews from fellow Tripadvisors. The Service was unbelievable...you will never get tired of hearing "my pleasure" from the staff. I booked a swim-out suite, which was unbelievable for a honeymoon, but to be honest, next time around I'll probably save the $ on the room to be able to stay longer than 8 days! Our suite was always immaculately clean, and our mini-fridge was always stocked with corona, cokes, and H2O's. There is a view from the bed to the jacuzzi tub--how beautiful is that?! Room service is included--another score! I had a jewel fall off my bikini top, so my husband asked our concierge (Patricia), if there was any glue on site. A few minutes later the resort had sent down a staff member who insisted on fixing it for me. The spa certificates are kind of a rip off, since you have to spend so much...so do the daily deal for the spa. Once you visit the spa, they give you a free day pass to enjoy the steam shower, sauna, and hydrotherapy pools. Also, the massage on the beach is very affordable and absolutely worth it. I was so relaxed during our couples massages that I actually fell asleep :) I've read a lot of reviews from "foodies" saying that the food isn't up to par. Let's be real: you are in paradise, and have unlimited food and alcohol...no reason to complain! I thought the food was really good, however, the hibachi restaurant (the only one that requires reservations) was just okay. I'm a fitness junkie, and will admit that I gained 10 lbs on this trip!!! The catamaran and kayaking are fun outings for the day. Also, check out the snorkeling in the underwater national park (schedule w/the company behind the Holiday Inn). Totally inexpensive but such an experience. We decided to be "resort hermits", and enjoy everything the resort had to offer. Events by the pool will keep you busy. It was so fun to play bingo, and the staff makes sure everyone is having a great time.

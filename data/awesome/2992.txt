Our experience from the start of the reservation until our checkout was TOP NOTCH! The cleanliness of the Hotel Max and the extremely courteous, ( but not to overly accomodating or anxious), staff made this one of the most relaxed and easy going overnight city stays we have had in a very long time! We did not eat at The Fin Restaurant, but we are looking forward to it in the future! The location of the Hotel was within 2 blocks of great Seattle Shopping and we felt relatively safe going to and from the Pacific Place Shopping Plaza. On the other hand, it was NOT so nice and safe heading up 2 blocks towards the bus station. But this is not a reflection on the Hotel Max establishment. Safety, coffee, shopping, great food, and an amazing Hotel and staff made this an experience we can't wait to repeat!

We stayed at Destiny palms hotel in February while visiting Orlando. Our stay was great, actually a lot better than expected. I would have to say it was a four star hotel with a one or two star price. Bed and room VERY comfortable and were clean. The bathroom was kinda small but still extremely happy with everything. The location was still close to everything but not too crowded. Walmart and several restaurants very close. Breakfast was provided but I woke up late and missed it so not sure of the quality. We will be staying here again for sure! Staff was very polite and personable.

I was very satisfied with this hotel for a number of reasons. The location was perfect, easy to find and very close to the major freeway. I was very surprised that it being so close to the Airport that once inside my room I did not hear the sound of planes all night. The room was very spacious and clean. The amenities were great. The lobby of this hotel is very warm and friendly. They have there things you would find in your home living room. The parking was absolutely free!!! The breakfast buffet was suitable the service was excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Enjoy

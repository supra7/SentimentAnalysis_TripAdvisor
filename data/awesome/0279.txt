We spent the first two days of our honeymoon in the honeymoon suite at the Hotel Monaco and couldn't have had a better time. The room was beautiful. We had a fabulous jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. We lived it up, lounging around in our leopard-print robes. The hotel was immaculate. Between 5 and 6 pm both nights, we indulged in the complimentary wine and beer. It's close to everything, and we walked a lot. Best of all, it was only $190 per night (midweek). We absolutely recommend Hotel Monaco Seattle, and would stay there again in a heartbeat.

Spent one night at the Max with my partner and was thrilled to be at this property. Coming from Portland where Hotel Lucia & Deluxe rule the streets it was nice to see the same concept in a hotel. The hotel has an extensive collection of beautiful art and bold colors. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to Ma & Pa or anybody easily offended. The valet service was fast and efficient with little wait. Always a smile and friendly "hello" when we walked passed the front desk, even the housekeepers in the hallways were rad. We were in a corner room (717) which had a nice view of the city below. Room was on the smaller side but who the hell just sits in the room all day while adventuring around Seattle. Nice bed, bold original art on the wall, bathroom small yet usable with Aveda shower products. Overall I would definitely rate this one of my favorite hotels in Seattle. The only thing I would have to say was a "negative" was the lobby music was turned up crazy loud. Kind of felt like we walked in to dance club USA but really wasn't an issue. Thanks!

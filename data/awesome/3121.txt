Spent Dec 24 to 27 in a Jacuzzi King corner room. Very spacious room, fantastic two person jacuzzi soaker tub. Free no hassle in room wifi, welcoming staff, no issues whatsoever. Booked thru Expedia and all purchase details were honored at check-in. Cannot beat the location, right smack in the middle of downtown shopping, movies theatres in same block as hotel, Starbucks across the street and six very short blocks to Pike Place Market. Have stayed at a variety of Seattle hotels in the past but will look no further than the Roosevelt next time.

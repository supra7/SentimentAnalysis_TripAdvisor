This is a very pretty hotel with lovely, friendly staff in the heart of downtown. Lots of choices in restaurants and bars in the area as well as shopping and tourist stuff. 5th floor terrace was a nice touch, but bring your own cocktails to enjoy the sunset--the hotel has no food or beverage service of its own. Room service comes from nearby restaurants. The entrance is low key, and down a road that looks almost like it isn't a through street, so its easy to miss. Valet will take your car and luggage though, once you find it. Walk to Dahlia Lounge for dinner for some great northwest cuisine.

This is really a dream trip! Going back again next September! A GREAT time to travel, because there are no crowds! We had a swim out room and enjoyed it very much! My only tip is bring MOSQUITO SPRAY, Maybe a Citronella Candle to burn in your room, and after bite stick! The insect is so tiny, BUT they can really BITE! Secrets Maroma is everything you could ever want for a Couples Vacation! Also, bring along $100 in singles, for tips that are really appreciated!

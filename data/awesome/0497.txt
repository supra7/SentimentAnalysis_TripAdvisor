We have stayed at the Inn many times....there are not many places we walk in and they greet us by name, we know that the room will be perfect and we can just simply relax. The Inn is the one exception......the staff is amazing, the room has breath-taking views, the location is unbeatable, the linens are impeccable. There is quite simply nothing I would ever change. We go back several times a year because they take such excellent care of us!!!!

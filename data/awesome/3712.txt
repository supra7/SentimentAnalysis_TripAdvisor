Every good thing you read about Secrets Maroma is true. We just got back from a wedding there and wow, was it amazing from start to finish. It's a pricy resort, but for that cost, you don't have to think about a thing while there. The restaurants are truly top notch and the drinks are delicious. (Make sure you call your liquor or they do give you the well variety). Overall, if you are considering any of these resorts, go for it. The standard, quality of service, and location was just amazing.

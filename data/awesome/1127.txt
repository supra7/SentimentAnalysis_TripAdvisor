This is a very stylish hotel with a classy feel to it. The building, furnishings and appearance all ooze class and style, as do the staff. The hotel is superbly located right in the shopping heart of seattle, with 2 shopping centres within 1-2 blocks, the monorail to the Sky Needle next door, and Pikes market place about a 5 minute walk away. The room with 2 queens was very comfortable, with very high standard furnishings and confortable beds. Our room also had 2 bathrooms - we didn't need it but would be handy for a family of 4. The room service and restaurant food is of a very good standard and value, and there was a nice bar downstairs to have a quiet beer after a days sightseeing, while my teenage son used the free in room wifi to catch up with friends. Overall, I would not stay anywhere else when visiting Seattle.

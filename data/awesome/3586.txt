Outstanding in everyway. I have stayed at many places in downtown Montreal and this one for me, is perfect. Every room is spacious and comfortable with all new modern ammenities and very clean. The service is outstanding and friendly. Their indoor pool just opened this weekend and is beautiful. Great location as well. Highly recommend it for anyone staying in the area.

Great couples retreat. Ok, I have been meaning to review my stay here for sometime (life, toddler got in the way). We actually stayed here June 2010 but Trip Advisor will not let me go back that far. This was by far a wonderful couples retreat, we stayed in a concierge level ocean view room near the beach We were close to the beach/pool/ pool restaurants but about a 5 min walk to the main building. The staff was amazing at the resort, they were always around and friendly. The food in the restaurants was very good and no reservations needed with the exception of the Benni Hanna style one. The grounds and rooms were clean and well maintained. The pools were very nice and they had servers going around throughout the day passing out hors d'oeuvres during the day (grilled shrimp on a skewer was one of them). The pools had a bar, a restaurant open during the day for sit down meals (both restaurants were open during the evening) and a buffet grill which was very good.The beach was white sand, clear water, and very clean. On the beach the service was not as good as by the pool but sitting on the beach outweighed the not so good service. There was a grill setup on the beach during the lunch hour and the food was good too. We also had a couple treatments at the spa which was very nice too. Overall this was a very good resort experience and we would go back for another childless vacation. This hotel is very good for couples, not so much for groups of friends (unless they are couples) or people traveling solo.

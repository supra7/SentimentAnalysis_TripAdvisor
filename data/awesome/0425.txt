My husband and I, and our 10 month old daughter, stayed at the Inn at the Market for 5 nights at the beginning of October, 2011. We loved everything about it! The staff was very accommodating; the location was perfect (literally steps away from Pike Place Market, and walking distance to many area attractions/restaurants); and the rooftop deck had amazing views! We stayed in a city view townhouse, and it was a great set-up... our baby could sleep/nap upstairs while we utilized the downstairs living area. Each evening we took drinks and snacks up to the deck to enjoy the view. We highly recommend the Inn, and we will be back!

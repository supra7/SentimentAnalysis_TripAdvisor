Stayed one night at the Moore Hotel because of the value and location of the hotel. I am not a super picky traveller and only really require rather basic amenities while traveling. Upon entering the Moore, one can tell it is a rather old hotel and building. The scariest thing about the hotel is its elevator, which if you have a fear of elevators, it will be brought even further to light when going up this elevator. It's creaky, small and just old but scary because of it. The room itself was nicer than I expected. It was a typical budget hotel room, with comfy beds, a nice view and a tv set. The bathroom could use a renovation and had some mildew around the shower's edges. Additionally, the shower stalls drain was extremely slow, causing some water to overflow from the shower stall and onto the bathroom floor. (Hence, probably the reason there was mildew around the shower base.) A nice touch was that the towels were all folded into shapes to create a very lovely presentation. Even the toilet paper roll was folded into a seashell shape. Overall, the stay was nice and even though we had a room that face 2nd Street, there wasn't much traffic noise at all. Additionally, there was a show at the Moore Theatre the night we stayed. However, that show seemed to end by 11 PM and even when it was occuring, there wasn't much discernable noise coming from it to our room. All that said, I was able to soundly sleep at the Moore. The hotel has great character and charm and once you get past the scary elevator, you realize just how many people have walked and stayed in these rooms. If you require newer surroundings with updates, I wouldn't necessarily think this is the place for you. However, I find its history and charm to be insurmountable and for the right person, this is the perfect place to stay. I wouldn't be surprised if those halls are haunted!

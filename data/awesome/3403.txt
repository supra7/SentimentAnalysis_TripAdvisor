I stayed at the Radisson by SeaTac for one night at the end of September. I would definitely stay here again should the need arise. It is easy walking distance (5 minutes from luggage level) from the airport, although they have a shuttle if you need one. You wait longer for the shuttle than it takes you to walk (I know - I tried it)! The staff is extremely nice and helpful. After checking in to my room and finding it a little warm, I turned on the AC. Didn't seem to work, so I informed the front desk and they moved me right away to another room. The rooms are huge - really! Nice king-sized Sleep Number bed (which I was leery of, but found it to be very comfortable), huge area for working if you so desired, and clean bathroom. I was surprised at how quiet the hotel was - I don't remember hearing a plane all night long. They have free wi-fi and I had no problems with the service. My friend and I had dinner in their bar area, and the food was surprisingly good. I had a salad and french onion soup and they were both delicious. The glass of wine was quite expensive, however. I started with the house wine ($9) and it tasted like vinegar, so I switched to a name I knew - $12 a glass. Well, we are a captive audience. Breakfast in the dining room was not free, but not unreasonable. They offered a buffet or you could order off the menu.

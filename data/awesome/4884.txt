Escape to a beautiful beach where the staff and service are equally spectacular! The rooms were nicely done offering a relaxing parlor area and balcony with ocean views. The bathrooms were very spacious and I loved the way it was designed. The pools were very inviting and even though hotel was sold out when we were there, it was not overly crowded. The staff was great - very friendly and fun! I was very impressed with the quality of food in the restaurants - our fravorite was the Seaside Grill and Oceana offering great steaks and fresh fish! A great place to relax or if you are the adventurous type, activities and entertainment were always available every day and night. Resort is very close to Playa del Carmen offering many great shops, restaurants and night clubs - no need to make the trip to Cancun unless desired. The spa was exceptional - one must experience! The service was incredible everywhere at the resort! A very special retreat and Secrets Escape - we will definitley return!

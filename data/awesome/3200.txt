We ended up at this hotel as our flight home was cancelled. We stayed near the airport at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Cedarbrook Lodge as it was rated no 1 on Trip Advisor. This hotel is on a par in terms of service and room quality. Considering over a hundred people turned up at the same time due to the cancelled flight the check in was very quick. The staff went around the lines of people handing out the essentials of shaving foam, razors, toothpaste, toothbrushes and home made cookies as we didn't have our luggage which was checked into the cancelled flight. Room was enormous, with balcony and was spotlessly clean. Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced and breakfast was good. Shuttle service was very quick with plenty of buses on hand. The only issue we had was the size of the hotel with various wings that were difficult to navigate. A few more signs halfway down corridors would have helped. We got lost as did lots of people we met along the way! Don't let this put you off though.

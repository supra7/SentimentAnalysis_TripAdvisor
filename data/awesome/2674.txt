Not your typical American Glass and Concrete Hotel with ultra modern decor. Has lots of character. Get a corner Premier King Room. Very spacious with a large comfortable bed and large sitting area with couch that can convert into a bed. Tastefully decorated. Great WiFi. Great service. Bathrooms are small, but adequate. Small lobby, but who cares? Perfect location for all Seattle downtown activities. While some reviewers complain about no coffeemaker in the room, most rates include continental breakfast. Continental breakfast includes coffee, juice, pastry or toast and fruit. Rather have this than a coffeemaker in the room. There is coffee in the lobby - so why not hop down and bring a cup to your room?

We booked a premium waterfront room but when we checked in we were given a complimentary upgrade to the Beatles Suite! What a great surprise! I think we would have been very happy with the other room, but this was fantastic. The views of the water and mountains were superb --would be true in any of the premium water front rooms. Hard to leave the room which was more like a small apartment and so comfy! The staff was always very friendly and just seemed happy! Food was delicious although portions seemed a bit small for the price. However, meal prices in the whole area are higher than we would have expected. Room service was fine and delivered a little early for the time we chose for breakfast. Area is very nice and close to the attractions along the waterfront. Aquarium was fun and enjoyed watching the boats and sunset from our room. We would definitely recommend this hotel...glad we chose it over the others in the area.

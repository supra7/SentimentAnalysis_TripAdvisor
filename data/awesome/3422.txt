I went to Istanbul for the 2nd time with 2 other friends of mine for 6 days, and again, we stayed at Gunen Hotel - Laleli. It was just as wonderful as the 1st time. The management and the staff were very welcoming and showed great hospitality, they were very helpfull and just our right hand whenever we needed any assistant. They showed great appreciation for seeing us again. They simply were like a family to us. Our room was on the 5th floor, wide and clean, warm and quite, the rates were perfect due to the discount we received for staying with them again, the breakfast buffet... so yummy, the swimming pool on the roof top is highly maintained, the location was perfect for sight-seeing and for shopping. I will stay at Gunen Hotel everytime I'm in the city, and I would recomend it to everyone agaian and again. M. Mehrabani 1 Nov - 6 Nov, 2011

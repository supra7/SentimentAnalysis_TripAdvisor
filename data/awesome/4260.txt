The service was outstanding. I have never been on a vacation in which I was actually feeling like I was very important. The Secrets staff was very friendly and helpful. I talked with several staff members during my stay and they would make sure you were happy and had everything you needed. When I go back to Cancun I will be staying here. Thank you Secrets Maroma!!!!!!

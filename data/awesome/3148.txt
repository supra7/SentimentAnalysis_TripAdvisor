I recently spent two nights at the Roosevelt when I attended a conference at the nearby Convention Center. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the accommodations and service. To begin with, although my reservation was for multiple nights, my flight to Seattle was cancelled resulting in an abbreviated stay. I contacted the hotel and my cancellation was approved with no charge for the night I missed. My room was a mini-suite with king-sized bed and a separate sitting area. Well-decorated, clean and quite welcoming, the room, hallways and lobby relfect the ambience of a well-appointed boutique hotel. The attendants in the lobby and at the reception desk were extremely friendly and informative in terms of sites to visit, directions and resturants. The location of the Roosevelt can't be beat- in the center of the downtown area and literaly steps from the Convention Center and within walking distance to all the tourist sites in downtown Seattle. Another plus- the Gray Line Downtown Transporter bus stops across the street from the Roosevelt. Only $17 roundtrip if you book online, the Downtown Transporter is a comfortable, economical and efficient way to get to the downtown area from Seatac Airport. Add to the fact that the rates at the Roosevelt are so reasonable, the hotel is a hidden jewel that I heartly recommend to the business traveler and tourist alike.

My mother, 13 year old daughter and I spent 5 days at the Vintage Park. The room is small and the carpet IS garish, but some how it all combines to give a cozy and comfortable elegance. The staff were gracious to us, from booking, to accepting a package for me before my arrival, to ordering food in and charging it to the room for my daughter after the hotel restaurant had closed (though this was definitely outside thier normal operating procedures!) when she chose to stay in the room instead of coming to dinner with her grandmother and I. I've just booked another trip to Seattle, and I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!

Our expectations for SMB were through the roof for our honeymoon vacation after reading all of the reviews, and in almost every aspect, SMB delivered! An incredible beach, awesome pools, and a beautiful room left us wanting to return for future getaways. One thing I especially liked was the somewhat remote feeling of the resort. While there are a few properties to the north, SMB guests are basically the only people on the beach for nearly a mile. This meant we didn't see many beach peddlers/etc. and really contributed to a relaxing stay. The only thing we didn't care for was the somewhat late (nearly 4-5 PM) maid service. We would return from the beach/pool and want to relax before dinner only to find out that our room still hadn't been done for the day. Other than that, our stay was perfect and I would highly recommend SMB to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway!

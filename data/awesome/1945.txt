Just spent a night at the Hotel Andra as a surprize night in Seattle for a romantic getaway with my wife. Before my review I want to mention that all the public busses are free in downtown Seattle all the time just hop on, no charge!! We are kinda fussy travelers. We would not hesitate to recomend this hotel. Rooms are beautiful, roomy sort of a mini suite. Everything seems brand new. Robes are to die for. The bathroom maybe small but....they are clean and nothing to even mention as a negative,and there is sort of a dressing area outside the bathroom by the walk in closet. The immediate area has several nice resturants, also a pizza place (Serious Pie) and a bakery accross the street. The Mayflower Park hotel, ( one block away) has a very good bar (Olivers) with great free snacks at happy hour. There is also much shopping a few blocks away. You will not be dissapointed.

Loved this hotel! The location is excellent; within walking distance to common attractions and shopping. The decor and atmosphere were warm and inviting - a fire in the fireplace when you first walk in; complimentary hot chocolate with real whipped cream; vintage furniture and style. Snacks in room were distinct and unique. Got a great deal on Hotwire and would definitely go back.

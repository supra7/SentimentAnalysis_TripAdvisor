We attended a wedding at the Edgewater Hotel in June. It was amazing! Seattle had so much to offer and the Edgewater was so unexpected and exciting. The wedding as great, but I was blowen away by the interior design on the common areas. Such a fun city and great Hotel! Do spring for the Water Front room, they are leap and bounds above the City Side.

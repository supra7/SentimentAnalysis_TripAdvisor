We stayed at the Double Tree prior to going on 2 week hiking vacation. I have nothing but praise for this hotel. The hotel was modern, clean and the room was of an extremely high standard and was situated in ideal location. The free shuttle bus was extremely useful when travelling to the airport to catch the metro link to down town seattle. Overall a very pleasant 2 days stay at this hotel

We recently stayed at Hotel Max on the end of an Alaskan cruise. I prebooked/payed for the hotel after doing lots of research online. I wanted a hotel that was convientaly located and not terribly expensive, while also having some character. Max was all of those things. We went to drop off our bags early in the morning right when we got off the cruise. We didn't expect to be allowed to check in since check in time was 3:00. However my 10 month old was sick so I asked if we could at least check in early. Not were we allowed to check in early, but we were checked in by 10 am. Fantastic! We also had the whole next day in Seattle since our flight didn't leave until 11:50 that night. They were so great they even let us stay until our flight, and charged us half the room rate. We were totally thankful, as anyone knows with kids, those long days can be rough. It was really great of the staff to work with our schedule. On top of that our room was super cute and the art everywhere was great and our son loved looking at it all. There are also some really great little extras in the rooms that make your stay that much better. I would totally recommend Hotel Max to young couples, and anyone with an open mind.

Great place! Room, food, drinks, main pools, beach, fitness, etc - all thumbs up! Swimming pool at the door step - fantastic! Service is extremely Just make sure to ask staff for moskito spray :-) Attended only one show, it was OK. We are not much into resort shows. Unfortunately, there was too much wind during our stay, so we couldn't do water sports - kayaking, sailing - that we really enjoy. My only suggestion to the staff results from their very personalized service. Even in a buffet, they have to record your room number and name, you cannot just go in a take a table. Sometimes it resulted in lines. I would also replace their cylindrical pillows with rectangular ones but this might be too personal.

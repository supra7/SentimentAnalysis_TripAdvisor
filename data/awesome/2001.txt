I am just home in Australia after a special week at The Edgewater Hotel. I bless my travel agent for finding this beautiful place for me. I loved the north-west, lodge-style decor, the visual texture of the wooden furniture and the Native-American print carpets. After a day out in the cold, coming back to my water-side room, the gas fire, the claw bath and the warm robe was very special. I was treated to friendly, obliging service - the box to sneak my oatmeal left overs to my room after breakfast; being spoiled by my room "housekeeper" who came to say goodbye; the birthday candle on the room-service ice-cream to go with the Angel Food cake I bought specially; the advice about peanut butter from the youing lass in the gift shop; modern gym with fresh towels and water cooler; free bus to the main sights ... If you want to see a movie, treat yourself to the art deco wonder of The Big Picture movie house just 3 blocks up the hill on Wall Street and Ist, downstairs in the El Gaucho building.

I was in town for a convention and after reading good reviews for this hotel decided to book my stay there rather than one of the host hotels. I was glad I did! Being built in 1929 the hotel had charm that I didn't find in the more modern hotels (and thankfully no construction was going on either) The room was more than adequate, yes the bathroom is small, but so is the one in my 800 square foot house, so it was no problem for me. I did opt for one of the larger deluxe bedrooms (#705) with a king bed that featured an extra seating area and TV so it that was an added plus (the others who booked with me had the smaller rooms but still said their rooms were adequate). The room was clean, hotel staff pleasant and helpful, internet access was good , room service was prompt. The hotel is located close to everything. Just a 5 minute walk to the convention center and right across the street from the Pacific Place Mall. Six blocks from Pike's Place Market, an easy walk as well. Its also close (within 2-3 blocks) to the monorail for a quick trip to the Space Needle. The hotel is adjacent to Von's restaurant which featured a buffet breakfast each morning for $11.99. The Grayline Airporter offers transportion to and from the airport, with their drop off/pick up point being just across the street at the Hyatt, $17.00 round trip. Overall I would stay here again!

I loved staying here. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel structure itself is historical. Everything was pleasant, but what put this hotel over the top was its staff. The hotel staff are the friendliest hotel employees I have ever encountered in all my travels. They went beyond friendly without being fake. They took time to assist my friend and I with airline check in, taxis, shuttles, shopping, places to eat and drink and took time to greet us whenever we returned to the hotel with genuine smiles. Nothing can beat this friendly laid back atmostphere. I doubt I will stay anywhere else the next time Im in Seattle.

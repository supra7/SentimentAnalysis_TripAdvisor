Our first time back at the Sorrento in 30 years and were treated like royalty. Everything was seamless from booking to departure. Beautiful suite with "Shaken not Stirred' package, the only suprise was that the quality of service and $ value surpassed our expectations by a large margin! Excellent and accomodating staff at front desk, dining room, room sevice, concierge, and valets. Treated like we were the only guests, they should offer courses on SERVICE and ATTITUDE to a number of other 5 star hotel chains! We will be back!

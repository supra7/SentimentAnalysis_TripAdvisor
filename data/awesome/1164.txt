My boyfriend and I live in Vancouver, BC and drove down to Seattle this past weekend, staying one night at Mayflower Park Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It was a fantastic experience. Aside from the great location in Downtown Seattle and our clean room, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Every single person went above and beyond, anticipating and attending to our every need. I would definitely recommend this hotel over and over again. We have already raved to our friends about their service. We really felt your exceptional service made all the difference on our little weekend getaway.

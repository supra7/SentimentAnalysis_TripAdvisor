We LOVED it. The resort was clean and well attended. Staff was always within 20 feet to help us move a pool lounge chair, bring a drink or towel. We were always greeted politely by every staff member we encountered, every time. The pool was clean with some fun (but corny) activities. Our bed was quite comfortable, maid service tended not to occur til later in the day though. Our shower not not as hot as it could have been (but warm enough) and we were not able to communicate that to get it repaired, but the jacuzzi was great. We had a standard room. Note you only get to use 1 pool unless you have a ground level room! Watersports staff patiently gave me windsurfing and Hobie-Cat lessons! All said, our trip was perfect and the hotel was wonderful! The club showed recent films or had a show each night. We dined at the pool side restaurants (2 side-by-side), breakfast buffet, Asian. We did go into Playa-Del-Carmen a few times - day and night. Cab ride is $20 each way for up to 4 people. PDC is quite safe and fun. Also took the ferry to Cozumel for snorkeling. Snorkeling and renting a moped gets cheaper and you can negotiate one you get over there. I would time my arrival as close to 3pm as possible as we arrived at 12 noon and could not check in until 3, saw many couples on subsequent days, waiting. You could use everything until your room was ready - but we were tired from the early flight! -Michelle

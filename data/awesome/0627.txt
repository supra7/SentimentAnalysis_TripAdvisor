At the end of a week long cruise to Alaska, our family decided to stay an extra day in Seattle before heading home. What a mistake. We should have stayed longer. Our travel agent put us up at the Inn at the Market. What a charming Inn it is, with a friendly, enthusiastic staff, with spacious rooms that are quiet, well decorated and relaxing. A roof top deck overlooks the Market and all the traffic on the water, pleasant during the day and beautiful at night. We walked to the Market, restaurants, the aquarium, all so convenient to our wants and needs. We didn't stay long enough. I wish we had missed our plane home.

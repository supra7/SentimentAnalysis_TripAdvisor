We had a fabulous time at the Inn at the Market! The staff was MORE than willing to help, and they were all so outwardly positive. What a difference from a mega hotel!!! The proximity to everything was also great...we walked all over town, never needing a car. The room itself had a beautiful view of the whole sound...even were able to see the snow-capped Olympics! The rooms were meticulous...the morning coffee in the lobby wonderful, the cookies checking in...these are little things, but they mean a lot to a guest! Definately want to return! Make sure you have good walking shoes!!! And be prepared to be treated "special"!

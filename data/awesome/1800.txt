My wife and I have stayed at the Andra twice now, both times during that joyful week between Christmas and New Year's Eve. The location is perfect, an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, downtown shopping and restaurants, and public transportation (bus tunnel and the monorail). We always appreciate the friendly staff, lobby fireplace, Lola's, and the very comfortable and stylish rooms. We hope to keep up the tradition next year.

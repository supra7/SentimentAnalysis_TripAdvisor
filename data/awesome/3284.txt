great times at Colony bay I've been to the Dominican Republic six times before and this year I've stayed at the Colony bay resort... and had a great time!The hotel is not so big as others I've been to but that's just what I like. The staff was very friendly and very helpful, always smiling... the room was nice and kept clean twice a day. We had a fantastic view over the sea and the mountains!Excellent view at the buffet over the sea and coastline. The food was good, different things to chose from. The beach was nice, sometimes good waves, sometimes calm. I've enjoyed the long walks along the beach. You have enough space because the hotel is not build in directly between other hotels.The animation was also great, although at the time I was there there were not so many people around, they did their best to create good vibes and made an entertaining show every night.Fun!

We had a 10 hour layover in Seattle, so I thought I should priceline a hotel so we could get some sleep. We ended getting the Hilton. I wasn't looking forward to going to another Hilton after my Hilton Long Beach experience. But it was a great hotel. It started off with there free shuttle that runs 3 times an hour. With very friendly staff from the shuttle driver to the front desk. The room was very clean and updated, with a very comfy bed and pillows.

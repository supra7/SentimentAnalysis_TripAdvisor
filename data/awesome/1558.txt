I took my family for a weekend to Seattle and chose this hotel because of the location. I was not disappointed. Great rooms, great location, great amenities. I can get a bit busy but nothing we can't handle. The parking is a bit of a hassle since you have to either pay big bucks to the valet or park it yourself in a parking lot that is a block away, not great during the rain or snow. Close to the Pika Market and other shopping areas. I would go back to this hotel.

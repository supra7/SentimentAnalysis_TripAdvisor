From the moment we stepped from the car, I knew we had made a wonderful choice. The valet was polite and assisted with our bags. Our reservation and check-in was flawless and the room was fabulous! Hotel is located in the center of everything ... Nordstrom's Flagship, Macys, Pike's Public Market, Wonderful Dining all around the area, easy transportation, easy accessibility to the major transportation corridors, and an overall wonderful stay!

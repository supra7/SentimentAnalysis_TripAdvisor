After reading all the positive reviews of Inn at the Market, I'm having a difficult time adding to the accolades. We were there for six nights and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Our room was beautiful (fantastic bed linens) with a breathtaking view of the water. We were in room 804, and the picture on the website of the water view room is entirely accurate. There was even a complementary bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived. The service at the hotel is also wonderful. I had to buy flowers at the market (couldn't resist), and the hotel provided a vase. Also the hair dryer was not working properly, but within a couple of hours of letting the desk know, a new dryer was installed. As everyone has said, the location is perfect--many lovely restaurants, wine bars, shops, as well as the Market are at your fingertips. When we returned home, we watched "Sleepless in Seattle," which we hadn't seen for many years. We were delighted to see views of the market, the Athenian where Tom Hanks ate with his friend, and--to make it even better--we saw the Inn at the Market! It made us wish we were still there.

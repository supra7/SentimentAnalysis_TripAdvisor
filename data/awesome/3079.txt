Could the rooms be bigger? Yes. Could their be a small restuarant on site? Yes. Was the staff most receptive? Absolutely. I travel a lot and tend to rate my hotels by the staff first, and this staff was overwhelmingly accomodating. They are there to help as much as possible. Would be nice to have internet included, but their business center was excellent and most accomodating. kb, ohio

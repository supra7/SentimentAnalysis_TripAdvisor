We had the most wonderful time staying at this hotel. the staff is very professional, the accommodations are terrific. We had a water-side suite for my family of 5 and could not have been more thrilled with everything the hotel had to offer us. The view was breathtaking and it was such a great way to experience Seattle, which is a wonderful port town. The location was perfect for us - walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Bell Town restraunts and bars and on a free bus line to Pioneer square. We did not rent a car and never felt we needed one as the public transportation was very accessible. The hotel dining was wonderful as was the hotel bar, which had live music and fabulous views. My extended family was staying in other hotels in town, but all agreed we had the best spot. We will be returning to Seattle and will stay here again!

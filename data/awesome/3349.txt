We stayed here one night on our way back from Alaska in order to avoid a redeye flight. Having been in Seattle previously, we elected simply to stay a hotel at the airport. The Hilton was top quality all the way. The convenience of simply walking out of the airport, over the sky bridge, and into the hotel was simply marvelous. Check-in was swift and professional. We only had our carry-on luggage due to a misunderstanding with Continental (they had retained our checked bags in the belief that we weren't leaving the airport between our flights) and we were cheerfully provided with everything we needed. Our Garden View-King room was comfortable and clean; we appreciated the tranquil interior garden which belied the busy airport just outside. The bathrooms were particularly nice, with top quality amenities. There is a Spencer's right in the hotel, which is a real plus. We weren't up for a lot of food, though, and ordered in the bar instead. Food was great, but our cocktail waitress was even better. Witty and efficient, she turned what was just going to be a throwaway meal into a memorable experience. Our waitress at breakfast was equally good -- we were running a little short on time and she expedited our order with ease. We had an excellent room rate due to prepaying. I'm sometimes reluctant to prepay on a location I've never seen, but the Hilton Seattle Airport exceeded our expectations and was a unexpectedly pleasant end to a very long vacation.

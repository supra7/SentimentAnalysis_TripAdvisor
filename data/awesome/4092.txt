The staff is excellent and the restaurants are amazing. Its like eating at a 5 star restaurant everyday. The room service is also a 10. 10.10. At night time they come to your room and clean it and let the drapes down and the bedroom drapes down too, so when you come back you're ready to relax!! The pools at this place are nice too , they also serve you food and drinks right where you are so you dont even have to get up. The beach at secrets of Maroma is also the must relaxing part of the resort with clear blue waters and a cool breeze that will make you never want to go back home. It was actually sad to leave the place and I was so we stayed another two days, they loved us soo much they let us stay for free!!! Nothing to complain about, just good memories and good times!!

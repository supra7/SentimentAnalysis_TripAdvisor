what canwe say we stayed at Destiny Palms Hotel for a week in June and returned for two weeks in July because we liked it so much. All our needs were catered for and staff very pleasant and helpful. Chuck the manager went beyond the call of duty to look after us nothing was too much trouble. In our opinion the rooms are the best deal on 192. We do intend to return for the third time this year and look forward to our next stay. Well done to all for making our vacation pleasant. Dave 53 and Michelle 49 from London England..

Hotel Max is a cool place with great, friendly service. Its location in downtown Seattle is about eight blocks walk from Pike Place Market and a little over a mile from the Space Needle - easy walks. Desk personnel and auto valets were very helpful, warm and knowledgeable. The chamber maid was quiet, courteous and meticulous. At $139 a night, ($10 more on weekends) the room rate was quite decent. I do wish they had some kind of non-slip device in the tub/shower. Apart from the parking charge and numerous state and local taxes, I was delighted with everything else. The hotel also includes Red Fin, a top-rated sushi restaurant, with ordinary and late happy hours. Hotel Max is well-known for the original artwork in rooms and for large black and white photographs on external room doors. The front desk is bright red. The TVs have flat screens, the sinks are stainless steel bowls with single handle controls. Everything was clean and worked well. The rooms and bathrooms are small but this was not a problem. Also, this is about the quietest hotel I have ever enjoyed. And the clock radio-CD player was neat. I loved the "pillow menu" with such options as "body," "reading," and "U-shape," along with the more conventional soft, firm, medium firm, etc. I also liked the "spiritual menu," with a list of religious reading matter they would provide. And the door hanger for the maid simply said "Yep" or "Nope." This was great fun and a delightful place to stay.

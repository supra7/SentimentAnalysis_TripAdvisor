We just returned from our anniversary trip to Seattle and a two night stay at the Hotel Andra. We hadn't been to Seattle in many years and looked into the best places to stay that were within walking distance of Pike Place and the waterfront, as well as good restaurants. Hotel Andra is located in the newly revitalized area of Belltown on 4th Ave- a walk straight down Virginia on the corner takes you to Pike Place and the waterfront. Tom Douglas' restaurant Dahlia Lounge is directly across the street and the wonderful italian restaurant Assiago is right next door. We loved our room on the 5th floor, the decor in the hotel is modern and fresh. The beds were fabulous- the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on in awhile! The bath products are great- they're from Face Stockholm, and the spa robes were wonderful. The staff could not have been more helpful- they were extremely pleasant and accomodating with requests. I would recommend asking to stay on a higher floor if possible- the views are better. My husband enjoyed the workout room- each treadmill had it's own flatscreen but it was on the smaller side. Since the hotel is in an older building the rooms are not huge either but I would definitely stay at Hotel Andra again- we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

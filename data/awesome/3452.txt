We spent 3 nights here for the Xmas markets and we couldn't fault the place. The rooms were stylish, clean and the beds very comfortable. We were on the front of the hotel on the 4th floor and we weren't affected by traffic noise as mentioned in a previous review. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and the price was brilliant value. We didn't have breakfast but we did make use of the bar after a long day sightseeing.... The immediate vicinity isn't brilliant for bars and restaurants, but this isn't an issue because Berlin has one of the best transport systems going and there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel. Buses from here will take you directly to the Brandenburg Gate in ten minutes and we never waited longer than a few minutes for a bus to arrive. It also has an underground stop 5 minutes away which in 45 minutes including a short bus journey the other end gets you to Shoenfield airport for a few euros.

My husband and I spent the first two nights of our honeymoon before our cruise at this hotel. From the minute we were picked up at the airport to the moment we left the staff was incredible. Always super friendly and helpful. When we checked in they saw we were on our honeymoon and upgraded us to a waterview room at no charge. They also left us a handwritten note and piece of delicious cake in our room. The rooms and bathrooms are both large. The beds are Tempurpedic beds so we got the best nights sleep.This hotel is in a perfect location you are steps from Pikes Market. You are also within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. We were deciding between a couple of hotels and we were both so glad that we decided on the Inn at the Market!

We stayed here the night before our 6 am flight. It was a much more relaxing experience than we'd had at the nearby Doubletree the night we arrived, and it cost quite a bit less. At check in we were told the shuttle ran on demand 24/7. We were given several suggestions for dinner with information on how they might fit into our drive to return our rental car. We arranged for a 3 am wake up call and went to our room. The room was regular Hampton Inn but had a refrigerator and a wardrobe/desk rather than a closet. The bathroom was fine and there were plenty of towels. The directions to return the car were excellent and dinner was good, too. We called for a pick up and in less than 10 minutes our shuttle arrived and within a couple of minutes we were back at the hotel. There was little airport noise and we slept well. The wake up call was right on time and the shuttle and driver were waiting for us when we got downstairs. We will return here on our next visit whether we need to park a car or not. Parking is free.

My husband and I stayed here for a late 1 yr anniversary. It was by far the best hotel we've ever been to. The staff were very friendly and go out of their way to furnish your requests. We stayed in the Mediterranean Suite. They rooms was absolutely beautiful and very spacious. We had massages while there as well. The girls were very professional and easy to talk to. They didn't make us feel uncomfortable at all. It's within walking distance to Pike's Market, so you get to see the city as well on your way there. We got the Harry Potter pkg. At check-in we received our round trip tickets for the monorail and tickets to the Harry Potter exhibition and the Pacific Science Center. There were no hidden costs or fees. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

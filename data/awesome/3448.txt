What a pleasant experience this was,having booked the other Lindemann (the Fjord one) there was a problem and we were relocated to this one......by taxi with a free bottle of fizz. and it got better from there,with the rooms being fab,the location around 1000m from Potzdamer Platz right on a bus route and with a stop outside the hotel.in fact they even had bus tickets for sale at no premium. just down the road we found a fantastic Greek restaurant "The Ypsilon" and a fine little bistro doing Italian also within the scope of the hotel locale. The hotel staff were all wonderful and helpful.simply a perfect three night stay. Highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a visit soon. Berlin itself was a surprise....safe,clean,friendly,not what most large cities are like.And the culture is all around,a mixture of stunning Art Deco with the newer stuff being tastefully incorporated into the whole. More museums than you can do in month.You can even get your passport stamped at Potzdamer Platz by a guy in traditional DDR soldier's get-up. TOP DRAWER..

We stayed at the W Seattle this past weekend. The front desk staff was great and very welcoming. Our room was Wonderful and could not have asked for more. Clean, sleek, sexy....just like you would expect from W! I loved the huge bath towel. We had drinks before leaving for dinner on Saturday night. Great service, great appetizers and great martinis! We called a couple times during our stay for extra bath amenities and they were so promt in bring "whatever" up to our room. Great Job W.....I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Location is perfect too. Can walk to everything! We had brunch at the hotel on Sunday morning. Awesome.....we had an omlet which was very good and blueberry pancakes. The highlight was the dish I ordered. It had dungeness crab, potatoes and poached eggs. I could have eaten it all day it was so good. (per my request they even over cooked my eggs just like I enjoy them!) Stay at the W Seattle and make your time in Seattle extra special!

I use a mobility scooter which requires special transportation from the airport and to places in the city for dinner. The Concierge, Louise Avery, was the most helpful person I've ever found in a hotel. And a delightful person. I'll look forward to my next trip to Seattle when I'll sleep in the wonderful beds at the Westin and have Louise take care of my reservations for Halibut at Ivar's Salmon House at Lake Union. Also great. Incidentally, I found Ivar's in the concourse at the airport, so I pigged out on Halibut again. Louise made my trip a delight.

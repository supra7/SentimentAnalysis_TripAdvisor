My wife and I had a wonderful week. The staff was more than accomodating, the Entertainment team was fun, genuine and just good people. Karla, Saul and Giovanni went out of their way every day to make us feel like we were part of the family. Our Concierge (Carlos, building 25) treated us like family. We could not have asked for a better location, better resort, we will return.

Spent two nights with my wife over the 4th. We had a bay view room that was more than we could have hoped for. Great view of the fireworks. This is a world unto itself after walking all day in Seattle. A great place to come back to. Pikes Place market is at your door step so the location is perfect. Try to stay as high ( as in floor height) as you can as the market opens early and there can be some noise. The beds are the posturepedic foam and are everything that they claim. We slept really well. I think if we ever go back to Seattle, this was our second time, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Room service was right on time and all food we had in the room, and in the restaurants, was quite good.One other thing about the view, you have Mt. Renier to your left, facing the bay, and the snow capped Cascades in frount and to the right , it's postcard great.

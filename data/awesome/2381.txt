OK, it was a little weird that our king bed appeared to be a Murphy, but after we finished scratching our heads about that, we turned around and noticed that Puget Sound, Queen Anne Hill and the Space Needle were staring at us through our wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows (and then, oddly, we forgot all about the funky bed frame). The windows and the amazing mattress had only the luxurious bathroom to compete with for our attention while at the Seattle Westin. This place was so impressive - beautiful lobby, super attentive front desk staff, concierge and bellmen, an extra large room with huge windows, nice sofa and chairs, large closet, etc. We were really blown away. Terrific location, right in the middle of everything that is downtown Seattle. It was truly painful to leave that room...

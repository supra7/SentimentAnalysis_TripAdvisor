If you want a resort in the Riviera Maya that has it all - this is it! Great service from every employee, one of the best beaches in the world, all the rooms are suites (the view just changes) and wonderful food in restaurants that do not require a reservation. This was a return visit for my husband and I and we loved it more this time.

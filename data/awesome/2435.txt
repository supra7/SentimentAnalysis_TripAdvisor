We stayed 2 nights in Seattle in the Westin due to our reservation over priceline. For the price we payed we could not ask for a better deal. If you have to pay regular prices you definitely will have accordingly to what you paid for higher requirements but if you get a bargain far below 100$ this is an excellent hotel.

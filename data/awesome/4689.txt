This was my third time to SMB with spouse and friends. This is by far an excellent All Inclusive. The property is finally growing in after it first opened late summer 08. The menus at the restaurants are more extensive and the quality is great. The food passed around at the pool is a nice touch if you decide to skip lunch (or not skip lunch!). The bartenders and staff at Manatees swim-up bar and swing bar are top notch. My biggest complaint is that the check-in process could have been better. Our room was not ready, when the room became available it was not the room I paid for! Alfredo at check-in could have been a bit nicer as I was not getting an ocean front room but a partial ocean view on a lower floor. (BIG DIFFERENCE) The beach is just as terrific as I remember. The soft white sand and turquoise waters are some of the nicest in the world. The resort is maintained throughout the day-gardeners tending to the lawns, cleaning staff always around. You will not see any garbage anywhere, ever. Management if you're reading, the AC in the lobby and club needs to be addressed. I usually don't make a big deal of this, but it was uncomfortable after spending the day in the sun. If you happen to hang out in the lobby bar after dinner and can put up with the heat, be sure to order drinks from Neydi. She is one of the most genuine and gracious staff members at SMB. She even remembered my husband and I from our prior visit! I look forward to coming back to SMB (hopefully next year!) and would love to see some of the great staff again-Neydi (Rendezvous Lobby Bar), Lazaro (World Cafe), Eduardo (Desires Night Club), Rusel (swing bar), Balbina (pool area ).

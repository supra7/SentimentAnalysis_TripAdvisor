What a fun hotel! The room was small but funky and very cozy. I requested and had delivered a pet fish, named Pooler. It was a beautiful bowl and fun to have. The daily paper delivered to my door was the NYTimes, a plus being a New Yorker. The honor bar was well stocked and the room service was a little pricey but prompt. On the last night I finally got a chance to partake in the complimentary wine hour which included a fortune telling. Overall this is the most fun I've had in a hotel in a while. I will definitely try to book Kimpton hotels in the future.

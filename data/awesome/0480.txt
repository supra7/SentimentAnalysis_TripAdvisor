If you stay at this hotel you will not be disapointed! The hotel was clean and centrally located. I have stayed at a lot of hotels and by far this is one of thebetter ones. The staff and even the bellman went out of their way to help you. The rooms were clean and spacious. They also have on the 5th floor a quaint terrace and it had tables and chairs out there for your usage. My husband and I had a bottle of wine and cheese up on the terrace and we enjoyed the scenic view. You will not be disappointed.

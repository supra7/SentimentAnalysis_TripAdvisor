I would recommend Secrets Maroma to anybody and everybody. My wife and I have been to quite a few places in our young lives, and we both agree that Secrets Maroma was far better than the rest. The service was always there for you for everything you needed, and the resort was amazing. We had the Preferred Club Swimout Suite, and we found it hard to leave the room because everything was so great. It was so beautiful around the resort and the food was very good as well. The beach could not even be described in words how beautiful it was and there was always something to do here. I would say the only negative would be the extremely bumpy dirt road that led to the resort, but once you got passed this point and saw the resort, you were good to go. I loved everything about this place and it was the perfect place for my wife and me to spend our honeymoon.

My organization had a meeting at Hotel Andra in the spring. We had an event at another hotel recently, and it didnt remotely compare to our experience with Hotel Andra. The staff was so much more professional in every way, prompt with information, helpful with questions and planning, and not to mention the difference in food, the food was absolutely amazing. We aim to go there again for another event and look forward to it very much. I would recommend this hotel for any personal or business stay.

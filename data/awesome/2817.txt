We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle for New Year's Eve and for an additional 3 days. This boutique hotel is a beauty. Totally charming, great ambiance and loads of personality with a touch of that great eccentricity that makes everything more interesting. Beautiful funky fireplace that is SO cozy... Also, the staff were wonderful--from the valets/bell hops to the front desk and the concierce. Francesca, our concierge, was a delight. She found us a wonderful, local vegetarian/vegan restuarant on New Year's Eve--Cafe Flora--that absolutely blew us away. I swear that it was the best meal I've ever eaten in a restaurant. And you can rest easy: REALLY comfy bed. Our room was Small (to be expected in old, gracious, boutique hotels)--but a fantastic location, central to everything in this delightful city. This is not your daddy's ho-jo! We cannot wait to come back!

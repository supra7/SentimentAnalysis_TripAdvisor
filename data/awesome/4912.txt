We loved Secrets Maroma! Our room was beautiful and the beach & service was second to none. Carlos, our concierge was great. After a couple days of our stay, we received a letter inviting us to spend the last two nights of our trip at their sister resort, Secrets Silversands. In return, we would receive a complimentary 5 night stay back at Secrets Maroma with our same preferred club, ocean view accommodations to be used within a year. As much as we didn't want to leave Maroma, we couldn't turn down the opportunity to be able to return again at no cost. Plus, we were curious if Silverlands could compare. In our opinion, there was no comparison. The rooms were not as nice, the beach was unswimmable and the service didn't seem as genuine. I caught one of the waiters roll his eyes after he walked away from a table in one of the restaurants. We felt the entertainment crew was too in-your-face. We also noticed the little things, like the glasses our drinks were served in were plain plastic with no garnish...even at lounge bars. At Secrets Maroma, even the plastic glasses they served by the pool were very cool and we always had some fancy fruit garnish on every glass. In summary, we can't wait to return to Secrets Maroma. It truly is paradise and it will be hard for other resorts to top it.

We stayed at Inn at the Market for 4 days and our visit was wonderful. The room was attractive and comfortable. The bed was really comfy. Most of all we were impressed with the staff. They welcomed us and responded to all of our requests quickly and pleasantly. Location was excellent and the roof top deck is fantastic. The view is awesome and it's a comfy place to relax! We will always stay at Inn at the Market when visiting Seattle.

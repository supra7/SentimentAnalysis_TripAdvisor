Nice hotel in a good location, just a few stops from the heart of the city. Reception staff is very firendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and the room was good, value for money is excellent in my opinion. Wi-fi internet is available in the room on request and with supplement (a bit too expensive, especially in 2010...) and it binds to one single device, so it can't be used on multiple computers or phones.

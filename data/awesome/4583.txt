Secrets Maroma was amazing. I cannot say enough about the service. All of the staff is very eager to please you and there is always a smile on their faces. The rooms are kept very clean (housekeeping comes twice a day) and are very modern and comfortable. The pools are very clean and nicely maintained. They have lounge chairs everywhere and they are very comfortable. Even the service at the pool area is wonderful. The beach is beautiful, the sand is very soft and clean and the water is a beautiful blue color. Angel fish will swim right around you. The beach waiters/waitresses are wonderful too. Definitely recommend taking a walk long down the beach. The food at all of the restaurants was very good, not top notch, but very good. We liked Portofino the best. Also, the 24 hour included roomservice was very nice. Drinks are plentiful and ours never seemed watered-down at all. The entertainment staff are funny and do a good job with the shows and beach activities, etc......Please tip the staff, they do a great job and work very hard, always with a big smile on their face. We brought $150 in one dollar bills and did not even use them all and were sure to always tip. If I didn't have any money on me or ran out of singles the service was exactly the same whether we tipped or not, so not tipping does NOT affect your service at all. Also, the spa was beautiful- great massage. Overall I'd say it was one of the best trips ever. We felt as though the price reflected the service and had no complaints. I would go back without a doubt!

We have stayed in a number of hotels in Seattle but this was one of the best experiences. It is a delightful little boutique hotel - we were comped to a fabulous water view king room - incredible views and a really pretty room. Wonderful location right above Pike Street Market and within easy walking distance of all the great shopping in downtown Seattle.

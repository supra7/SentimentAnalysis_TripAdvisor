We ended back-to-back cruise vacations with an overnight stay at Inn at the Market. Although we had access to the Inn's sedan service (there are certain caveats that exist around that service attribute), we chose the quick cab from the cruise ship terminal to the Inn. My partner was having mobility problems and we advised the hotel in advance that we might be an early check-in. When we did check-in, the front desk rearranged our full waterview suite to a room that was close to being refreshed. We were able to get to our suite 608 with ease. The view was breathtaking with a grand view of the bustling marketplace and waterfront, the room well appointed and Gilcrest and Soame bathroom amenities were most welcome. It's always a good sign when there is little need to leave the comfort of a suite the first evening. At dusk we mingled with several other guests on the terrace, which lent itself to a nice little wind down to our vacation. The bed was extremely comfortable and made for a great night's rest. At checkout in the morning, one of the desk clerks who met us temporarily the previous day recalled both our names. We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, but it must absolutely be the waterfront view. It currently is our favorite accomodation experience.

We stay at the Mayflower at least 6 times a year. We always have a great time. The staff is friendly and efficient. We're at the point where they remember us, which makes each visit even more fun. The rooms are comfortable and clean and we often get a complimentary upgrade to a 2 room / 2 bath suite. They even filled the ice bucket for us as part of the turn down service which I certainly didn't expect, but was happy to get. The on site restaurant Andaluca has been great each time we've eaten there. We've also had their room service breakfast which was generous and delicious. We often get the breakfast package which includes valet parking. Oliver's has great drinks and it's now our "tradition" to stop there after we check in for a snack and a cocktail. Sloooowly working my way through the martini menu! The location is perfect for our needs. We're within walking distance of the light rail system and the monorail. And of course, there's plenty of shopping, coffee shops and restaurants all nearby. It does book up fast, so plan ahead.

Must say that the staff goes way out of the way to make this place great. Rapheal Cordova is a great ambassador for this resort and does a great job. Paulo is also incredible and doesn't miss a thing and always makes you smile. The food at this place is excellent and the food by the pool is phenomenal and you never will have to leave the pool for lunch it is sooo good.

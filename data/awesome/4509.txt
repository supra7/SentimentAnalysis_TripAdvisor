This resort is awesome. From the time you get there until you leave. This place has everything top notch such as the rooms, beach, food, service and entertainment. The staff is awesome as well. People such as Kevin, Paulo, Allan from the pool, Carla from the spa, to Carlos, our room concierge, the entertainment staff such as CC, Uri,Tomas, Moises, all these people were amazingly wonderful people. Hope to see you all again next year. We miss you. Regards Tim and Joan LaValley

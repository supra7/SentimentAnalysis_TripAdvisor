My wife and I stayed here July 14-17 and truly loved everything about this resort. The staff was great. We arrived about an hour early and our room was ready. We stayed in room 2510. The room was clean and very welcoming. We had a swim out, which was nice to hang out at when we wanted some quiet time during the evening and a bit more privacy. Our concierge was helpful when we needed things, although we did not need much. The workout room had enough equipment to get a good workout, so that's a plus. The main pool with the swim up bar was a little too busy for us so we spent most of our time at the wading pool, which was about 10 inches deep and had loungers in the water. This pool was perfect for us to relax and soak up the sun. We didn't even bother going to the beach, which is rare for us. And if we wanted a drink, the staff was always around to take your drink order. The food was great. I read some other reviews about the food not being too good. Everything we ate was wonderful. And there was never a shortage of bottled water. The Spa was great also. My wife was sunburned so she bought a water lily wrap that accelerated the healing process and took alot of the redness away. I bought a reflexology massage (my first) which was great. We watched a fire show one evening which was fun and exciting. And we spent one night at the dance club for about an hour or so. We enjoyed it all. Our goal was to enjoy a long weekend of sunshine and relaxation. And we did just that. I can't write enough about how great this place is.

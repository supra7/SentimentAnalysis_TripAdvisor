My husband stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach for one week 9/5/to9/15. The resort exceeded our expectations. The resorts is beautiful and the staff incredible. The staff appear to enjoy their job and it shows, they cannot do enough for you. Paulo,at the pool was great he greeted us each day and every request was met with a smile. He is an asset to the resort. Eric the general manager was very visible and throughout the week I saw him interacting with the guests. He approached us and asked about our stay. The restaurants were all good the Italian and Mexican were our favorite. Make your reservation as soon as you arrive if you want a seat at the Hibachi table. The meal and show were great.

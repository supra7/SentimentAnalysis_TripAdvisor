This hotel was very nice and accomodating. The front desk and concierge staff were amazing and very insightful. The hotel is very close to everything, easy walking to most essentials. Great coffee shop in the hotel. Room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a lot of counterspace which is helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone.

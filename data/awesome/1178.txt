From the care of my luggage, the ease of checking in, to the guidance from the concierge staff, the Mayflower Park Hotel provided me with excellent service. My adult daughter was my travel partner and our deluxe room had two bathrooms and a wonderful view from the window. The amenities (robe, newspaper, coffee maker, safe, large screen TV, etc.) were great and a shopping mall was available through a connecting pass way. The concierge staff provided great information and assisted with dining reservations. The location was central to all the sights we wanted to see such as Pike Place Market, the Underground, the Seattle Central Library and many other shops and scenic tours. I would definitely stay at the Mayflower again.

Upon arrival, greeted with cool towels and drinks. Room wasn't ready, however staff showed us around the property and we ate lunch. After lunch room was ready and staff showed us to our room. Overall the trip was EXCELLENT!! The property is beautiful and staff are very responsive and attend to your requests and demand. We were their for our 10 yr anniversary. They decorated our room for our special night. I can't say one bad comment about the hotel, the staff or the property. Highly recommend and will definitely go again or at least to another Secrets property.

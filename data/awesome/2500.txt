This was my second stay at the Westin Seattle and it was definitely a great choice. I got a really cheap deal via Hotwire and I was pleasantly surprised that I was put in a great room on the 32nd floor, along with 2 of my friends who also paid a similar price after we requested to be put on the same floor. You can't beat the location. It's accessible to everything in the downtown are and very close to a Longs Drugs and the monorail. Bed is the best part of the room - they don't call it 'heavenly for nothing! Bathroom is on the smaller side but very functional and light. Room is spacious and the sofabed is a great touch if you have people staying the night. the only complaint I have - and it's a small one - is that the internet function accessed through the TV is pretty awful - especially for 9 dollars a day. You cannot access facebook and other sites and it's very hard to view and navigate. My laptop screen broke the day before i arrived so I was hoping to use this facility - but I ended up going to an internet cafe instead (there are internet terminals available in the lobby for a whopping 6 dollars for 15mins) I'll definitely stay again next year

We stayed here mainly because of the price and location. My daughter and I went to visit UW. The hotel is within walking distance and I was able to leave my car without paying additional parking. It is directly across from University Village and the shopping and dining were really fun. The rooms were clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

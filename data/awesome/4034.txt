i guess i should start out by saying that before we go anywhere we always check in with trip advisor first to see what everyone else has to say about the hotel. let me tell you that who ever had a negative thing to say about secrets maroma is just one of those people that are hard to please. everything went right. we went to renew our vows and it was perfect. the list of people that made our stay fantastic are felipe, salvador, sophie, andres from preferred club.... and roberto was our conceriege for our building#25 and he was so accomodating that we couldnt ask for more. kevin and jaime are the pool side concerige and let me tell you that there is nothing they will not do for you. the lobby bar gets quite busy around dinner time but we never had any problems because miriam was our watress. the dinners are incredible but we had 1 special dinner that was out of this world, PORTOFINO. The most romantic dinner we ever had.. yes you pay extra to sit in the booths in the back ( you must buy atleast a $60 bottle of wine ) but let me tell you the service , spectacular the wine, delish and the best part... when you sit in the booths there is a curtain that seperates you from the entire restaurant. romantic. if you havent made up your mind yet, dont wait, book now.

Great experience. Did not experience any negatives. All staff were great. Have traveled a great deal. One must remember when staying in historic accomadations that rooms may not be as large. This facility is very well managed. Will stay here again on return. I am not easy to please and looked for the negative because of the many negative reviews I read. I know everyones experience is different.

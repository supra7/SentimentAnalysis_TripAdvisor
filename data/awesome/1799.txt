Had a great stay at Hotel Andra! Staff was very friendly and polite, accommodations were comfortable and stylish. We especially enjoyed the warm and inviting lobby - whether it was sitting by the fire or in the comfortable "Jetsons" chairs! Loved how the hotel is within walking distance to almost everything! (including the fabulous Dahlia Lounge) Will definitely stay again!

This hotel is Absolutely Amazing! I came here for my honeymoon June 21 - July 1, 2010 with my husband and we had the best time. We played pool volleyball everyday and met great people that we still talk to. The staff are so helpful and will do anything to please you. The food and entertainment staff are wonderful too. We are already planning a trip back for our 1 year anniversary with the couples we met!

This was our first visit to Seattle, so I had lots of questions when I made the reservation. The hotel staff was friendly, patient, and very informative - made it easy to decide to stay there. When we arrived, we weren't disappointed. The reception and checkout was smooth. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The robes are a great touch. Enjoyed the wine. The staff at the restaurant was outstanding - good was great, too.

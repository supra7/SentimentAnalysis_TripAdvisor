This is an older hotel and the rooms appear smaller than other Embassy Suites where we have stayed (Bellevue, Nashville, etc). It is convenient to the airport and shuttle service is provided. The free breakfast buffet is the best you will find. The hotel staff-- all of them-- made our visit a very pleasant one. They listened, gave recommendations, and provided services that were beyond the call of duty. We would definitely stay here again.

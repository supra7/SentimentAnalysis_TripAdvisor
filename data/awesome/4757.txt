My wife and I went for 5 days and it was amazing. Everyone at the resort was extremely helpful, always courteous, and very friendly. We had a preferred club suite, and we liked being able to use the preferred lounge for various things, so we'd do that again. We didn't have the swim out pool suite...which after looking at how the swim pools are somewhat private...we'd probably try that next time. The food options were good, and we didn't experience any wait the whole time we were there. The chicken fajitas at El Patio were the best thing we ate all week, so I'd definitely recommend them. Overall a great experience, and we definitely plan to go back someday.

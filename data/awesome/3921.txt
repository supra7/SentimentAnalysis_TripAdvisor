Everything was perfect. The resort is beautiful. The beach and the scenery are breath taking. Everyone says "hola!" and is smiling and so nice. We took the prefered club and did not regret it, if only for the magic minibar(and the coronitas!) that refills itself. It is also well located, so if you want to have some adventure it's most likely close to the resort. The food is great. Except maybe for the italian restaurant, they try a bit too hard but the pasta is very good. The grill restaurants are amazing, and the house wine is not bad. We had a dinner on the beach with the honeymoon package and it was so romantic. The staff works really hard to fulfill all your desires, and again they are so nice. We loved our room, the bed is comfy and the bathroom very fonctionnal and nice. When we arrived, they said "welcome home", and we felt like the room was our little home all week long. It was my first trip, and i have to say that i would definitely go back.

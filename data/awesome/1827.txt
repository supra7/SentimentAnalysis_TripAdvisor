Stayed for just one night but would go back and stay longer. Usually stay at the Hotel 1000, and this was a nice change. Stylish room with great, big windows, modern decor thoughtfully well-done, and the staff were SO service-oriented. Valet, front desk, restaurant, etc. All good! Location was SUPER. I felt like a local. Fireplace in lobby and breakfast on-site in restaurant was killer. Locals eating there looked like they enjoyed the food often. Highly recommend.

Lovely hotel! The staff was very attentive, rembered our names. The in-town car service is great! Rooms are clean with modern conveniences yet the old charm has been preserved. The Fireside room is fabulous and cozy; great for relaxing with a drink and snack after a long day of exploring the city shops and Pike Place Market.

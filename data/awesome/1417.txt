This hotel received a nice update with the recent renovation. Lots of vibrant colors in the rooms, lobby, and restaurant/lounge. Unfortunately didnt get to take advantage of the top floor lounge because we ran out of time. The biggest wow was the exceptionaly friendly room service attendant who brought us wine as well as cheerful smiles for my wifes birthday. She obviously enjoys taking care of her guests.

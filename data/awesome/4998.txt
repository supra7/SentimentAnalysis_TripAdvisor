Staff is very friendly. Food is VERY GOOD! Entertainment is above and beyond! I plan on telling my family and friends to stay there. The Beach is the best I've seen. So many extras to offer. Its hard to get my husband to go any where on vacation and he loved the place. He's already talking about next years vacation. Thank You so much for making our anniversary a special memory ! A special thanks to Luca who made sure my husband was well supplied in M&M's and always making sure everthing was ok. See you next year!

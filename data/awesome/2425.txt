Well Obama stays here so what can you say but it is pretty nice indeed! They have a huge pool and a big spa pool which all looks lovely too! The only negative was that there bar fridge is chockas so so are not allowed to use the fridge at all which was a bit of a hassle for us as we like to keep our DanActives in the fridge - Probiotics! And they threaten to fine you if you use the fridge! A bit strange but all in all it was a very comfortable stay. The only issue we had with Seattle was there is so many homeless people here it is a bit of a problem, we were even hassled in the lobby of the hotel once whilst sitting there, and many times when we walked out the front! But this goes on all over the city unfortunately it is a real problem in many places where we travelled very sad indeed!

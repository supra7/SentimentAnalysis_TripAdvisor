I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place prior to visiting Disney. Almost nothing is a bargain when you visit Disney World, so when you find a hotel that is you have a tendency to jump on it and I'm glad I did. Normally we stay at Disney resorts when visiting but I decided to go for a cheaper option this time. I'm so glad I did because now I've found where I'll be staying whenever I come down which is usually a few times a year. We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in being very tired, sick, & cranky and just hoping we would get to be checked in early. We had reserved two rooms and were hoping to have them connected. From the time we got to the front desk I felt like we were in a 5 star hotel for our well we were treated, almost like we were family members of management. We worked a lot with Chuck who I believe was the Resort Manager, he was amazing. They went out of their way to quickly get us into both our rooms and gave us connecting rooms which is what we were going for. Both our rooms were nice and clean, beds were super comfortable and our room was big enough for us. Bathroom was of average size but we found everything we encountered to be clean. The breakfast was good and always kept well stocked even when it was busy. The hotel was withing walking distance of a McDonald's & 7-11 and also a short drive to Disney. While the road in front of the hotel is busy, overall it's located in a very quiet area and we were able to enjoy a quiet's night sleep the entire time. I really can't say enough good things about this hotel and for the staff we encountered here. For the price we paid and the service we received it was 2nd to none and I'll be picking this hotel over the Disney Resorts in the future. Don't 2nd guess a decision to stay here, you won't regret it!

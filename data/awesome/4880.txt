Just wanted to say that this place was 100 times better than i expected. Starting with the 5 star staff, meals and rooms. Me and my wife went for some friends of ours wedding. They made the ceremony so beautiful and the cocktails on the beach after was a wonderful touch. If you are doing a destination wedding i highly reccommend secrets maroma beach. My only complaint was that the air conditioning was broke the whole time we were there. However, they did offer to put us up in another secrets property. Great time and will be back soon i hope.

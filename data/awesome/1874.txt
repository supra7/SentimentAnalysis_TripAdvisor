Traveling with my Wife, 11month son and my Mom. Mom had the small room but at an excellent value. My Wife, Son and I had a larger room at the front of the hotel on the 5th floor. The hotel accommodated my Son with a crib at no extra cost. Recently remodeled with nice finishes and classy touches. My wife is in love with the bathroom, so much so that she has pictures of it. The room was very spacious even with the crib. It was a very quiet room with a small fridge and large flat screen television (with inputs to watch your day's videos). Location is perfect, a short walk to Pike Market, bus/train station, corner market, shopping, everything, etc and was why we first chose it in the first place. Across the street is a scrumptious bakery which we could smell from our windows. Downstairs is the hotel's really cool restaurant and bar. Reception and the staff had friendly dispositions and helpful walking directions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

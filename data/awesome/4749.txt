The staff was very friendly and the service was great. The rooms where nice and the hotel was always clean. The beach was amazing!!!! We spent 8 day's and enjoyed the variety in restaurants and night life. The food was good, with that, most of the meals were similar. We also did a good amount of scuba diving and the water was beautiful . There dive master Jorge was awsome, be sure to ask for him! Last the pool overlooking the ocean was perfect. Be sure to get your chairs early, they good ones fill up fast.

This hotel was very convenient to multiple areas in the city, and a reasonable walk to the waterfront and the market. The service was very welcoming, when asked if we wanted a key for the mini bar on check inn, I told them I did not need it. The lady then told me there was a nice store right down the street - this ended up being very convenient for us. They were very helpful in providing suggestions and directions around town. The rooms were modern, very clean, and unique - something that makes a hotel like the Andra just add to the overall vacation experience. Valet parking was expensive at $39.00, but there was not a lot of place to park, and the valet staff was outsanding as well. Tip - there is a Top Pot Donuts - a great little Seattle donut store down the street that is worth trying.

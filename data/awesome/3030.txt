My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Max for just Saturday night. The staff were very friendly, and knowledgeable. The decor is really nice. The rooms are hip, but small. We paid $120 for the night, which given the location and quality of hotel, was incredible. Parking was expensive, but that is to be expected. Reasonably priced room service which is a find. Overall, very happy with it, and would stay there again without a doubt. Great place.

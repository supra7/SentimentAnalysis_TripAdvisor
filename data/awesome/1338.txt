Was ambivalent to stay after reading some reviews but we found it a great hotel at a great price in a great location. Don't expect a homogenous chain experience here. Refreshingly unique. We easily got a street facing room, had no noise problems and found no problem with the bathroom! The wine reception was delightful! The staff was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely stay here again! You can't beat the rate.

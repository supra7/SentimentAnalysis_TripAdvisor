Best vacation ever!! Went there for our 15th anniversary and so happy we chose this. Staff was amazing!! Tips are included per brochure so was worried service might only be adequate, but it was the best ever!! We did tip here and there for our favorite servers. Activity staff got everyone involved in games and activities. Only thing.... says snorkeling is included - it was not...extra $ but we had enough to do without that. Took a Catamaran ride and kayaks. Spa was wonderful and worth the $$$ Can't wait to book our next trip there!!!

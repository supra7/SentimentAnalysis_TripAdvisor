This was our first time in Seattle and this hotel was a great place to stay. It was within walking distance to everything. We didn't need to rent a car which was perfect when staying in a city. All of the shopping areas and famous landmarks were easy to get to and the subway station/link station was also close by. The best part of this hotel was the pillow menu - you can choose pillows that are soft, medium, firm, extra firm, body pillow, neck roll or a reading pillow. We will most definitely stay here again. All of the room doors have their own art. Nice twist. Nothing like any other hotel I've been to.

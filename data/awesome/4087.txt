Having stayed at Dreams La Romana in NOvember 09 where we got engaged we had high hopes for SMB for our honeymoon and we were not disappointed! It was fantastic. I was very sick on my first full day there and we are uncertain if it was something I had eaten from the Barefoot Grill or if it was just the stress and comedown from our wedding and the long flight etc, but when we let our concierge know they were really concerned and asked me how i was everytime we saw her. The only other downside is the rooms, they say you have a suite but they are nt suites really , just large hotel rooms. At Dreams LA Romana we upgraded to preferred club once we got there and we had a massive living room and dining room and then a large bedroom and large walk in bathroom all seperate to each other. SMB was quite the opposite - very nice all the same but just not what I call a suite. Also we ordered a bottle of champagne on room service when we first arrived and had to pay 200 Pesos whereas at Dreams there was no charge for bottles of champagne. The food is very nice at SMB especially at lunchtime when all the chefs come out carrying trays of food and bring it over to you and the drinks are really good too. I ve heard people say the drinks are watered down but i dont beliveve this to be true. If we could ever afford to go here again we will definately go and i would highly reccomend it if your looking for luxury, peace, fantatsic beach, great food and drink then SMB is where to go.

Four girlfriends met for a five-day stay to relax, recharge, enjoy the ocean and catch-up. The resort turned out to be the perfect place. It satisfied the princess in us -- especially the restaurants and gorgeous spa -- and also provided keen service in a relaxed and unpretentious way. While most of the vacationers there were couples, we never felt out of place amid the honeymoons and romance. Room service is free, the all-inclusive part easy. If you need to recharge, we highly recommend this resort. Do see Victor in the spa. He's a massage genius.

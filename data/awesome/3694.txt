My partner and I stayed early January for two weeks. Staff are excellent, fantastic choice of restaurants and house wine (several choices too that are included with your meals) is nicely palatable. Drinks are on tap along with entertainment. Beach is beautiful and great for running. The gym has a good variety of machines and free weights to allow you to train. The spa will sort you out after. We lazed on the beach for the two weeks with attentive staff asking you if you wanted drinks or food frequently. A previous comment said that as a gay couple that felt uncomfortable, we didn't along with the 5 or 6 other couples. First time we have done an all inclusive and thought we'd be bored after too weeks..... would go back tomorrow if I could.

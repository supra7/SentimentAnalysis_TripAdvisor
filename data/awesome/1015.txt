We stayed at the Mayflower for our 25th wedding anniversary. We originally booked because of all the reviews and the hotels location. We will return because of the staff. The front desk greeted us with a Happy Anniversary! and they upgraded our room to a beautiful corner room king suite. After letting us check in early we dropped our bags and went out to shop. Everything was very close by. Upon returning to the room we found a box of chukar cherries (delicious) and a card that all of the staff had signed. We were very touched by the gesture. It is an older hotel but everything needed to be comfortable is updated. I love the books and info in the room giving the history of the hotel as well they are very proud of it and it shows.

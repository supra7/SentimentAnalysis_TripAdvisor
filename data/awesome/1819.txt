We, our wedding party and family stayed at Hotel Andra the weekend of our wedding. It was FABULOUS! Hotel Andra's staff worked very hard to make sure everything was perfect. Our friends and family kept commenting on the level of detail in the hotel as well as how accommodating the hotel staff were. The rooms, lobby, bar and Lola restaurant were all beautiful and the perfect place to celebrate for a wedding. We were especially impressed when we returned back after our reception and there was champagne and pretty music playing on the radio for us! I could not have found a more perfect place on the most important day of my life. They truly helped to make it perfect. I highly reccommend!

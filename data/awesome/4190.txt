This resort was wonderful!!!!!!! Gormet restuarants, plenty of room on the beach or poolside. My husband and I were very impressed at how "over the top" the resort was. The staff was very friendly but not overly in your face.the beach was absolutely beautiful no rocks, very clean. The color of the ocean is indescribeable. We did a zipline/rapel/snorkling excursion that was even an amazing experience. If i was forced to come up with a negative it would be that the bed turn down was inconsistant. But seriously not a big deal at all. We had an amazing time. I would definitely recommend a couples massage at the spa well worth it!!!!!

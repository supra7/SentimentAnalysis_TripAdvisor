Staff is extraordinarily polite and welcoming; any member of staff that you will come across will always greet you any moment of the day. The resort is very spacious and with only 412 rooms it always feels private and relaxing. Gardens are immaculate and extensive. Having WiFi for free throughout the resort is a win and the offered daily activities (kayak, scuba, tour around the kitchens, tequila tastings, bike tours ..) allows you not only to enjoy your holiday even more but also meet people by sharing the same experiences. The gym is a bit basic and could be upgraded to match the rest of the resort facilities.

It was an amazing getaway for our honeymoon and it was well worth it.From the room to the food,we didnt have any complaints.Loved the lunch by the beach,you were able to lounge and enjoy the beach or the pool and not go too far to get a bite to eat.The service was exceptional,from the room service,to our concierge who went out of his way to make sure our stay was a pleasant one,we have no complaints at all.Cant want to go back again for our anniversary!!!

We stayed in the North Tower of the Westin on the 46th floor, just one level below Penthouse. The view up top was spectacular! Our room had large windows, enough for us to enjoy the view of Space Needle, the city and the water. Our room was nice and big, very comfy. With Starbucks coffee in-room and their to-go paper cups, made going out with a coffee in hand just like home. I'd have to say very thoughtful of them! Their heavenly beds were comfy, but nothing special. There is free Wifi in the lobby, and if you don't have your own laptop. They have a room with free computers to use, but it may be a wait now and then. The location was awesome though. 10 minute walk to Pike Place, 5 minutes to the central square where Sephora, Macy, Nordstrom, A&F is. We arrived on a Sunday and there was free street parking. What more can i say, we got the room through Priceline for a great deal.... Overrall extremly happy!

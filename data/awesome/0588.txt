This was our 3rd stay in this hotel and we now think of it as "our place to stay" in Seattle. We are from Seattle and now live in Portland. We love to wake up looking out over Elliot Bay with the Pike Place Market right outside of the lobby. For convenience it can't be better with downtown Seattle shopping just two to three blocks away, buses and light rail, the symphony hall, art museum and lots of food and drink literally right outside your door. There is also a hotel towncar available at certain times or cabs right in front of the hotel so we take the train to Seattle and leave the car at home. The staff is really friendly and professional. The smaller size of the hotel makes our stay much more personal and calm than the feel of one of the larger hotels. Staying at Inn at the Market just makes relaxing much easier when we're vacationing in Seattle. We highly recommend it to get a good feel for the "real Seattle".

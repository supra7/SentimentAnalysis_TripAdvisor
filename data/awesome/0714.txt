My husband and I just spent the weekend here, and could not have had a better stay. The location is easily the best in Seattle, the hotel is beatiful AND comfortable/welcoming, the staff - meaning *every* person we came into contact with from the parking valet and front desk to room service - was helpful, professional, and genuinely friendly. Our impression was that customer service really matters here - and as the customer, we appreciated it! The furnishings are simple and classy - no fussy or pretentious here - and the beds are to die for! Room service was very quick, and the fresh croissaints, juice blends and Chai lattes were delicous. The word "complimentary" comes up often here - even including the wireless in the rooms and the business center with *multiple* work stations. We truly enjoyed our stay here and can't wait to come back!

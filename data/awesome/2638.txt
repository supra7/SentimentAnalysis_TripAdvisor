Stayed two nights with my family, through an own-bid booking on Priceline. The hotel was a nice surprise, with several little perks that made our stay: unexpected free upgrade to a larger room, complementary wine tasting each afternoon, and free WiFi with a Kimpton affinity card (free and well worth having to avoid the #&$^!% angst of 4-star pay-wifi). Plus when we arrived, each of my young girls got to pick a free book/toy/stuffy from the lobby Treasure Chest, which sold them on the hotel instantly. The room was nice and fit the standard. The only negative was the $34 overnight parking, but that's in line with the other downtown hotels. Easy walk to d/t shopping, Pike Place, etc., and easy access to Hwy 5.

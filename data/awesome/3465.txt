This hotel was great! It's beautiful from the outside and the room and bathroom were both large. The bathroom had a glass standing shower and a jacuzzi tub next to it with designer toiletries. The kitchenette came equipped with everything (except a wine opener!) including a nespresso machine- which we used every morning. The hotel is right behind rue catherine and nearby many clubs/bars and shopping areas. It's also 2 blocks away from a BIXI station. We went for our honeymoon and received a small welcome note and small gift in our room which was very lovely. Would definitely recommend this hotel. There was also a lovely outside area in the back of the hotel with furniture. For us- it was worth every penny!

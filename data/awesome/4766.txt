My husband and I went the Secrets Maroma Beach for our anniversary celebration. We were very pleased with the staff and cleanliness. Staff are very polite and want to make your stay memorable. The beach was incredible with pure white, soft sand. We loved the beach service you recieve with drinks and food too. The food was great, and the drinks were good too. My only suggestion would be to have more wines available in the all inclusive price. The selection they had was minimal. We plan to go again, but next time we will go earlier in June before the hurricane season starts. Our snorkling excursions were cancelled twice due to winds.

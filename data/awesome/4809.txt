Took my wife there for our anniversary - what a place! The beaches are beautiful, the water amazing. Great walks along the shore. The service was OUTSTANDING. Always someone there taking care of you. The restaurants were top notch. Dress code was generally button up shirt/polo and dockers. Very fine dining and great food. This was the first place we have gone to that we couldn't find anything that was not up to our expectation. We had our own concierge right outside out door which made coordinating anything very fast and easy. If you go, do the swim out patio suites - YOU'LL LOVE EM!!!

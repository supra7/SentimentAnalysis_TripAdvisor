I don't know what it takes to make this hotel #1 but that's where it should be. This is the nicest hotel overall I have ever stayed in. The hotel is about 1 year old located between St. Catherine's and Renee Levesque across from the Bell Center, great location. The staff was amazing, accomodating, and friendly. My suite had a huge bathroom, stand-up shower, and jet tub, a kitchen area, a little living room area with a swedish foam couch, a microfibre and faux fur throw, a separate bedroom with a swedish foam topped mattress (so comfy), a nice desk, bathrobes, slippers, 2 flatscreen tv's...I could go on. I could live here. The gym was nice and new (slight mildew smell). Hopefully they can keep the price reasonable, up the quality and cleaniness and updates as needed.

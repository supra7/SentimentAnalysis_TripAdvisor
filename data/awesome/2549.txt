Fantastic hotel, especially for a conference. I enjoyed my stay, and the high thread count bed linens. The staff was busy, but very pleasant and helpful. The lobby bar was eager to serve up the double Gin and Tonics. Centrally located to store No. 1 of a major department chain, it a great stay to add to your wardrobe. Downtown can be walked easily from this location.

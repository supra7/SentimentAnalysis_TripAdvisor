I spent four nights here in late September 2011. The hotel is located on a dock, over the water. The bar and restaurant look out over the bay - a beautiful view and a nice way to end the day. My room was "boutique smallish" but all you need, clean and comfortable. The Space Needle was a 12 minute walk; Pike Market was a 20 minute walk, Poineer Square was a 30 minute walk. For the later two walks, you spend most of your time on the docks, which are colorful and full of restaruants. I highly recommend this hotel.

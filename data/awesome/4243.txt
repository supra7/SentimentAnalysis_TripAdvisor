I went with my husband and 3 other couples to celebrate my 40th birthday. The resort was beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. I asked the building concierge for hair conditioner as the room was only supplied with conditioning shampoo and it was in my room within 10 minutes. Anything you needed or wanted someone was eager to help. The food was very good, some of it great. We loved the tilapia ceviche for lunch at the restaurant by the pool and had it several times. Be sure to try the tamales with red sauce and the Chilaquiles (I preferred the green sauce on these) for breakfast at the World Cafe. The beach was well maintained and we loved to hang out on the swings at the bar but even when we were laying on the lounge chairs, we never had to wait long for someone to bring us a drink. We had a swim out room and while the pool at the room was clean and beautiful, we just didn't use it much. I would ask for a room on the 4th floor for a view of the ocean next time.

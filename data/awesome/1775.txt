June 2nd 2008 stayed here before leaving town from a week plus vacation in the area and a cruise. The location and price were a good value. Had a lovely large room on the 5th floor. Check in and out was flawless. Booked online and prepaid. Close to Westin for the airport shuttle and this worked out wonderfully. wish we had known how close this was to the Space Needle--within walking distance. It is close enough to all the sights. It is also directly across the street from the Jazz Alley for shows. Perfect location and price value for Seattle. Definitly on the short list for future stays in town.

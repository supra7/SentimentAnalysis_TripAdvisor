My husband and I stayed at Hotel Max for two nights (May 2-4) during our 4 night vacation to Seattle. Upon our arrival, which was earlier than the check-in time, we were told they would upgrade us to a king corner room (no extra charge) since our room wasn't ready yet. Wow! That was great! I read several reviews that the rooms were extremely small, so we knew what to expect. But our room was pretty spacious (see pics). The service was wonderful too. The front desk was very helpful with suggestions and gave us a detailed map to help us get around. The Red Fin restaurant (attached to the hotel) has delicious food and an extremely affordable happy hour (afternoon and late night). The only negative thing we could say about the place is the small elevators, but it wasn't that big of a deal.... Overall, we were extremely happy with our stay!

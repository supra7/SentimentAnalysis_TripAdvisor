I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while in Seattle on business. Others have mentioned it, but the location really is exceptional. It's such a treat to be only steps away from any number of great foods, restaurants, coffee, wine, etc. in the market, but still within easy walking distance to the conference center and downtown shopping. The hotel has a great rooftop deck, with glorious views across the harbour. The staff I encountered were without exception friendly and helpful. My room was just fine - a standard hotel room with everything I needed. The bathroom was huge, and the bed very comfortable. It's also nice that the windows open. Overall, my impression is that the interior of the hotel is perfectly pleasant, but pretty standard - it's the location, the lovely staff and the rooftop patio that make a stay here so enjoyable.

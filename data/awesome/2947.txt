We booked on Price line and ended up with the Hotel Max and couldn't have been happier. We stayed for 2 nights in beginning on June. The staff was more than happy to offer suggestions for places to eat & things to do. The room was great! It was very clean, the beds are super comfy & there was plenty of room for the crib they delivered for our infant son. Unlike some of the hotels we've stayed in, there was plenty of room to have separation between our bed & the baby's crib. THe room was very clean. The only downside was the very small bathroom. We loved the decor & the pictures on the doors that were different for every room. The location was perfect for us. We rode the light link from the airport and it was a very short walk to the hotel from the station. It was also very close to the Seattle monorail that takes you to the touristy things near the space needle & a very short walk to Pike's Place and shopping. We had great weather when we were there, so the short walk was perfect. The Red Fin restaurant next to the lobby was wonderful with a great happy hour. We stopped in for a beer & some appetizers before we went out for the evening each night. The food was great & the happy hour specials were very affordable. The staff there was great about seating us where a high chair would not be a problem. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to a friend and would love to stay here again if we come back to Seattle.

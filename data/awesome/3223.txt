Scheduled a day in Seattle before our cruise with our flight arriving at 9:27 in the morning. The Doubletree airport shuttle picked us up and took us to the hotel. We weren't sure how our luggage would work out since check in time was 3 pm. The bell man took our luggage and our traveling companions and stored it until we finished sight seeing which was about 9 pm that night. We caught the MT194 which took us to Pioneer Square for $1.75 and same back to the hotel (an added convenience which is right in front of the hotel). The concierre arranged a van to take us to the Cruise Terminal cheaper than all of our exhaustive research turned up. We didn't want to pay the $5 for Wi-Fi for one night but they informed us that could pick it up for free in the lobby area which worked out nice. We checked emails while waiting for the rest of our party.

The first "best" about this resort is that the staff is trained impecabbly - we always felt that they were just happy to help you or take care of you. Every "thank you" was replied with "my pleasure." We never felt anyone had their hand out for a tip - service was always excellent. Beach was the most beautiful we've ever seen in Mexico and, though, there were vendors, they were respectful of a "no." Water was clean and beach area kept well. Entertainment staff was exceptional in providing things to do and drinks were a plenty. Secrets Box is a nice touch - we had breakfast in our rooms most days and, if we didn't feel like answering the door, the breakfast fit in the Secrets Box. The Porto Fino restaurant was outstanding - we ate there 3 times! We tried all the restaurants (except the Mexican) and each had its own style and good food, but Porto Fino's had Italian the way grandma made it! Only down side - we had a swim-out room - the tiles leading to the pool are dangerous when wet, so when getting out of the pool - watch out! Would return in a second and have recommended it to everyone who will listen. D&D from Connecticut

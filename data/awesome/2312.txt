This is by no means a new and modern hotel but it is so clean, the service is great and it's so darn charming and romantic. We'd definitely stay there again. Our first night we had a queen size bed which wasn't going to work for us (our mistake for not requesting a king on check-in). The second day we requested a king room - no problem - they cheerfully changed our room for us. The $32 per day parking is steep. We decided that in light of that and the cost of a rental car, parking fees wherever we went - we just wouldn't bother renting a car again. Cheaper to do cabs. Wonderful hotel - we recommend it - the staff is great!

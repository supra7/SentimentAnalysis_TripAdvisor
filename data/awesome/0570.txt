This is the most wonderful hotel in Seattle! Get a water view room, you will never want to leave! Watch the Washington State Ferry come and go and look down on all the activity milling through the Pike's Place Market below. A bit of Europe at your door steps!....Location, location, location. Not to mention the staff was warm and friendly.

I stayed here with my niece as she was on an overnight,9 hour layover. I wasn't sure what to pick because I have heard nightmare stories about some of the hotels near SeaTac airport. Everything from the reservation process to the fresh baked cookies at check-in to room service and shuttle service was handled spectacularly. The room was decorated well, the bed and the linens were top notch, and the room and bathroom were spotless. They clearly are customer driven and make sure that every need is met. I only stayed for the night but would have been happy to spend a week there. They are a little higher in price than the others in the area, but it is worth spending an extra 25 or 30 bucks to sleep in a place that is comfortable with people there waiting to handle all your needs.

My wife and I took our daughter, son-in-law and their two kids for a weekend stay in Montreal and decided to try Le Crystal. We live near Montreal and have stayed at most of the major hotels in downtown Montreal and in Old Montreal. We had never, however, stayed at Le Crystal which is relatively new to the Montreal hotel scene. We decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. The entire staff was very courteous. We had two adjoining rooms and because we arrived early one of the rooms was not yet ready. They allowed us access to our one room and quickly finished cleaning the second, then promptly notified us when it was ready. The location is right across from the Bell Centre so if you are going to a Canadiens game or any other event there, it is a very convenient location. Lively Crescent street is just one block over. It is an all suite hotel and we had two deluxe suites. Some of the comments indicate that the classic suites are small so that it why we opted for the larger suite. It was a nice size with a kitchenette area and a separate sitting area. The bed was a luxurious king with a bearskin throw on top of it. Nice touch. The bathroom was huge. It is a good hotel for families because of the large pool which is about three feet deep. Good for both laps and for kids to play. A lifeguard was on duty all the time. Great views of Montreal from the pool floor plus an outdoor hot tub which we scurried to on a cold January day. We didn't try the restaurant but did have a drink at the bar and it seems very attractive. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

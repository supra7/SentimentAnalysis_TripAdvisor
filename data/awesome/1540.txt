We stayed here for 3 days in July. Got the room on Priceline so it was a good deal but were treated like we payed top dollar. The staff was some of the best we have had.. THey made great restaraunt suggestions and shuttled us to where we needed to go to avoid us navigating the strange one way streets in this area. It is a pet friendly hotel which we loved. We didn't have our dog with us but plenty other people did. Sometimes you can tell there are pets (smell) but not this place. Super clean. Very modern decor. We used the free internet in the lobby and it was nice. Overall an excellent choice.

Booked on Priceline, got an "upgrade" to the tower with my Hilton Honours membership. Desk agent provided cookies and directions to the closest parking spot to the elevators for our room. The car stayed there for a few nights while we were away and picking it up was really easy with the fast pay machine. The shuttle was fast and the drivers nice. Everything was great here and 1000times better than the Hilton down the road that we stayed at the other day.

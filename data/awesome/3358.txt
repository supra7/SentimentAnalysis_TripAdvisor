We booked that to be close to the airport, and oh boy if is close you can even walk to it......... but not because is a short stay hotel they forget about service. This is not the case, since you arrive they help you all the time, they welcome you with fresh water with some fruit, the rooms are very clean and large, they have a great Gym, a laundry room (fast and clean), a nice pool, great garden areas, and the best of all, smiling people all the time!!!! You can walk from the airport or take a shuttle from the hotel in all the arrivals of the airport. They were so nice they even kept a bag for us when we went for a week on a cruise ship, no extra charge!!! I felt better than at home!!!

I have been traveling all throughout Europe staying in moderately priced hotels, and this is by far my favorite. Whitewashed rooms, large and luxurious beds, everything done tastefully and as simply as possible. Great locations. Tiny bathrooms, but much nicer than anywhere else I've stayed. It's not a room service/concierge kind of place, it's really just a comfortable place to stay. But it was everything I needed. Highly recommend.

Just come back from 5 day stay at Seven Sands and we were very happy there during our stay. We had two large and spacious apartments for our group of 5 people, each with a kitchen which had a cooker, microwave, fridgefreezer, kettle, toaster, iron and ironing board, and some basic crockery and pans. Each apartment had a bathroom and also an extra loo. There was a spacious lounge area with a dining table for 4, and a flatscreen tv, about 30 or 32 inches. There was a smaller flat screen tv in the bedroom. The apartments were furnished in dark mahogany, and the walls were decorated with Arabian themed watercolor prints. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms were made up daily, with plenty of extra towels when requested. There was a restaurant on site which we didn't use as we were out all the time. Around the corner was small grocery shop so we were able to buy milk and groceries to make breakfast. This suits us fine as we prefer to do our own thing when we're on holiday. The hotel was clean, comfortable and quiet, and very conveniently located near the metro station, and Emirates mall. The hotel had a gym which we didn't use, (no time) and a swimming pool on the roof, which my daughters swam in at dusk, just before it closed at 9pm. We really enjoyed our time at this hotel. If I had anything to criticise it would only be that it is quite old and could do with a bit of a revamp - the decor and furniture is a bit worn. However, I've only mentioned this as it would bother some people. It didn't bother us one bit. We had a very relaxing comfortable stay and next time we come to Dubai we will stay here for sure.

A friend recommended this hotel when we were looking for a place to stay for a wedding. We got a wonderful rate on the room, and then they upgraded us to a larger room for free. The staff was great; they actually ran out and found contact lens solution for me one evening. A particularly cool touch was the daily free wine hour in the lobby- and because we had other friends staying there for the same wedding, it gave us a great place to meet and chat. All around, it was just an excellent experience.

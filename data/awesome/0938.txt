What a cute hotel! We arrived at Seattle from a cruise and had not made arragements for a hotel for the day. We were tired some looked at the web to find a hotel and saw they had an offer, a last minute saving. We took a cab and arrived at this cute place, very old structure but very nice. Andrew the employee at the entrance opened the door for us and took our bags. We explained that we only needed a room for the day, because we were leaving that night very late and wanted to leave the bags and go sightseeing. Rachel, the front desk employee told us that the check in was at 3:00 pm, but found a room that was ready this early in the morning and allowed us to check in (it was around 9:30 am). The room was very clean and well maintained. This was a very old building, but everything looked clean and neat. The room had a kitchenette with amenities. We felt so comfortable that we did not wanted to go out. There were many restaurants and stores in the area. We really recommed this hotel to anyone and would like to go back and stay longer. All the employees were very nice and professional.

I loved it!!! I was on vacations with my friends and it was perfect.. everything the food is amazing but my fav restaurant was seaside.. also one thing i liked was when the chefs came out at the pool and started to repart food, i thin that's original, besides I never saw that in any other hotel. Definetely I'll stay there again!

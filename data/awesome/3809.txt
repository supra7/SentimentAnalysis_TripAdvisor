We travel quite a bit and I have to say Secrets Maroma has been our favorite by far. We rarely stay at the same hotel twice, but we found ourselves at Secrets Maroma for a third time in 3 years. The employees are the best. They are so nice and always have a smile. For an all-inclusive the food can't be beat. And we are big foodies. You will not go hungry or thirsty. We opted for the swim out room this time and really enjoyed it. We didn't use it as much as we thought, but it was still nice and private. The beach is breathtaking. We found ourselves spending more time at the beach than in years past.

We stayed at this hotel for two nights with tour group and one night on our own after cruise. The hotel is in a great location and we found staff very efficient and helpful. although the room was quire basic it was very clean and comfortable. The restaurant was very good and we enjoyed breakfast and dinner there. Overall an excellent hotel.

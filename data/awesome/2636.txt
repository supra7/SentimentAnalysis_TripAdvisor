This hotel was way better than I thought it was going to be, for such a modest and reasonable price. The accommodations were stellar. There was even a mini fridge and a microwave in the room. The service people were friendly. The floor was really clean and nice. As were the walls. The bed was big and clean. Everything was clean! (and not to mention in good condition) There was an elevator too! The continental breakfast was good also. There was also WiFi, which was nice. I thought it was an awesome hotel, and there was nothing wrong with my stay.

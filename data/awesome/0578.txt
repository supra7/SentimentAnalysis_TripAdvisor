A wonderful place to enjoy a holiday week-end away to shop with family and experience the wonderful sights of downtown Seattle. Located at the Pike Place Market with lots going on. Convenient to all the shopping areas by foot. No parking worries, the hotel will keep your car (for your paid valet charge) after check out until 6 pm at no extra fee and will store your bags as well. Wonderful clean rooms with cozy beds. The heating units are independently operated in each room and are a bit noisy. Fans directed at the beds, which if you're not used to, could keep you up at night. Would be great to have a 'dimmer' switch on the very bright bathroom lights.

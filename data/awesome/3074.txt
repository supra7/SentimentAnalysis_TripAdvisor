What a great experience I had at the Hotel Max! The moment you walk in the hotel you are greeted by happy folks and it just continues everywhere you go. I loved the pillow menu! It is a great way to try out all of those different pillows you have been wondering about. The art work is so much fun and we went to every floor just to see the art on the doors. There is a different theme for each floor. The view from our room was great and just made you feel like you are a part of a beautiful city!! I know sometimes famous people stay there but I didn't see any during that visit. I just can't wait to go again!

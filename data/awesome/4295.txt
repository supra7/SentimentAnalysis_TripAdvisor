Simply put the resort is fantastic. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were very spacious, and the beds were out of this world. The food throughout the resort was readily available and delicious. Drinks were of the premium nature and never disappointed (Look for Joel at the Beach Bar and ask for his special margarita). Only downside was the oceanview from our room. Although we could see the ocean, it was quite far away!! Oh well, everything else was out of this worls. Will definitely stay at another Secrets in the near future.

This was my first sightseeing trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Park was the perfect place for me. Its a historic place within easy walking distance to anything and everything I wanted to do in 3.5 days. The light rail from the airport is so easy to use and the 3rd Avenue exit is just around the corner and down the block from the hotel. I was able to check-in early, always a plus. My room was fine but I was directly across from the ice machine and I could hear it repeatedly during the evening. I also faced the Westlake Center and on that side there is a lot of very noisy equipment that runs all the time. Im used to dead quiet at night so I thought this was going to be a real problem but I slept reasonably well every night. Must have been all that walking, fresh air and using the hotels small but adequate fitness center. I recommend Olivers, great service the night I was there even though it was busy, and room service, also good service, and an excellent, hot, burger. Andalucas though was not my best dining experience. The food was tasty but barely warm for both the breakfast and dinner I had there. No idea why that would have happened  twice. The coffee was hot though and very good. Another big plus was that the Chocolate Indulgence tour through Savor Seattle starts right at the hotels upper lobby. I didnt know that when I booked the hotel but it worked out very well and Id recommend the tour. All in all, Id go back to the Mayflower Park in a second. I like a good walking city (the front desk folks are really good with directions) and from here it was easy to get to Pikes Place Market, the aquarium, Miners Landing, the Seattle Art Museum and the Regal Theatres (also theres an AMC about the same distance). Plenty of excellent food and drink a stones throw from all of these places. If you choose the Mayflower Park I think youll enjoy it. I certainly did.

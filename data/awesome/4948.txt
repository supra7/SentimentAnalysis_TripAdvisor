Secrets Maroma takes service to a new level. Not only is the resort and the beach spectacularly beautiful but the personal service is fantastic. Every need is taken care of with a smile and a pleasant greeting. We recommend the food in the Mexican restaurant and also Oceana the seafood grill. All in all a terrific all inclusive resort worth every penny!! We will seek out other Secrets properties as they become available.

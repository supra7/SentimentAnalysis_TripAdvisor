We splurged by staying here and it was well worth the money! we had a room on one of top floors- the W really pays attention to the little details like stocking your hotel room with Bliss products. Staff was really friendly- a very trendy hotel. earth & ocean was a great dinner but quite pricey. all in all, a really cool place to stay in Seattle...you can walk everywhere, fantastic location! highly recommend!

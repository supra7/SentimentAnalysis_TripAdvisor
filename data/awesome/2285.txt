Hotel is a beautiful old girl! Updated in all the right ways. Room was beautiful, fabulously clean, luxurious AND the most comfortable bed I've slept on in years(better than home!) Staff is friendly, courteous, and efficient. Food was excellent. Bartender got a special tip from my husband. Although restaurant does not open til 8am -we were happily served coffee, juice and toast before our early departure. Appreciate being away from the "main drag". Best value and experience ofmour full week of hotel stays. We will absolutely be back.

We stayed at the Edgewater after our cruise to Alaska. After disembarking the ship, we walked to the hotel for a three night stay. We had a waterfront room which a waterview. The room was a good size-I wish it would have been cooler to be able to use the fireplace. The bathroom was very nice too. The staff is so accomodating and everyone made our stay wonderful-we really did hate to leave. We would definitely stay there again!!

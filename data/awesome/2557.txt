We hadn't planned to stay originally at the Westin, but we got a great last minute prepaid price of $120 per night for three nights--and it was a much better choice than the more expensive Warwick down the street. The location can't be better--a sushi bar nearby, a retro movie house known for its superior sound system, and major shopping--all within 2 blocks. We checked in as soon as we got there, and they had a room available for us at 11:00 a.m.--four hours before our check-in time. The front desk staff and valet were incredibly helpful and courteous--the concierge not so much (when I had forgotten my toothbrush and asked for one, they told me I could purchse one for about three bucks in the gift shop--whatever!). This hotel has a workout center that can't be beat--all the latest equipment and hardly anyone is ever there, plus your own disposable headphones (the treadmills and ellipticals have tvs attached). Try the in-hotel 5th Avenue Cafe for breakfast; they have all you can eat fruit salad for a very cheap price. The only bad stain was the lobby bar staff--we had to wait about half an hour for service (because the waitress was flirting with some ruddy businessmen), so we left only a dollar as a tip and ate all of the munchies we could find. Ridiculous. However, it's that way at the Sheraton in our town, so it's not all that surprising (must be a chain thing). We will definitely be staying there again--if the lady from the Caribbean doesn't want her free 4-night stay, we'll take it!!

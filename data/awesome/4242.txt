It's been awhile that I've travelled on a vacation, usually all my travel has been for work. So I'm very pleased that I chose this resort as my vacation that I so needed. The service, food, room, beach, pool, restaurants were all amazing. I spent most of my time on the beach which was pristine. The staff that worked on the beach were very friendly and really worked hard walking up and down on the sand making sure everyone had drinks. They kept the drinks coming and also kept the beach clean of glasses and plates. It's too bad more people didn't tip them as I watched some groups work that staff hard making them walk up and down in the sand and heat. Sometimes a little tip goes a long way and shows appreciation to the staff. I think the meal I looked forward to the most was the breakfast buffet in the morning. There was so much choice and the food was great, actually every meal I had was great but the breakfast in the morning was my favorite. I had no issues what so ever with the hotel but only a minor annoyance at some of the guests there that sometimes forgot that others were there to enjoy their vacation as well. We watched as a big group spread themselves across the beach blocking everyone else behind them easy access to the water. This same group every morning spread towels across all the chairs as well. I understand they watch for this up on the pool deck, maybe they should also extend it to the beach as well.

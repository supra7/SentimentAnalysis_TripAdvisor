first trip to Seattle and friends recommended this Hotel. With Mapquest we had no problem finding it. Checking in was great..Constance at the front desk was very helpful and we had a million questions! The rooms are large and very clean..the bed soo comfy! Out our window across the street is a Gentleman's Club called "Little Darlings" My husband had fun watching all the showgirls go in! There is a bar (we had a beer) and a restaurant (we didn't eat at) on the 2nd floor and a small work out room! We were recommended to go to(Brooklyn"s) about 5 blocks away! No one fault but we were disapointed with the food and the price. Check out the next morning was made lovely by the older black man on the desk(didn't get his name) Very nice!

From the moment we arrived, we were treated fantastically. The entire complex, from the public areas, to the restaurants, the rooms, the pools, and the beach, were extremely elegant. My wife and I could really only think of two complaints over our entire 7 night stay. One - table drink service sometimes took quite a while; sometimes up to 20 minutes to get your drink (not Erika though; she was AWESOME!). Two - We felt there should be drink service on the beach later into the evening. If you want a drink to take to the beach after 11PM I think, you have to walk all the way back to the lobby area...kind of a bummer. But to be honest, those two complaints are extremely minor. The service was amazing! We were met with smiles and helpfulness everywhere we went, and at ANY time of the day! The appointments were elegant, the food was good, and the entertainment was very entertaining! And, the Spa...wow! Bottom line, we WILL be going back, and that time cannot come soon enough for us! Oh...and try the ice cream! Nm nm nm! :)

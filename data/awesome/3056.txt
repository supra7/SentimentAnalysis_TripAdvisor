What can I say.... My Partner and I had been looking for an upscale artsy hotel to stay in while visiting Seattle. The Max Delivered!! From the moment we entered the building we could feel the welome. Even though it was artsy, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a corner king room. Penty of room and what great views. The amenities offered for sale wer perfect. The pillow and spiritual menu's were a nice touch. The bed was extremely comfortable and shower and Aveda products a nice touch!! The hotel itself is perfectly placed for those wanting to explore Seattle. Pikes Public Market is nearby and the free bus service during the day makes it easy to get around!! My partner and I will definately stay at the MAX the next time we are in Seattle. We enjoyed it and recomend it to fun loving arsty folk who aren't prudish. If seing semi naked nudes and intamancy kits in your room for sale would offend you then this is not the hotel for you. For any one else this is a definate must stay in our book!!!

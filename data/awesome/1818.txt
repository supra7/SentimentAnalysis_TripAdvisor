When planning my recent business trip to Seattle there were very few hotel rooms left in the city. I had never stayed at Hotel Andra before, but TA reviews were positive, so I booked it. It's been a great experience. It is about 3 blocks from the light rail, so I could avoid taking a cab or renting a car from the airport to downtown. It's about 5 blocks to the Pike Place Market and waterfront. The room is very clean, and the staff very helpful. I was a little worried about the location of my room when I first arrived. It's immediately across the hall from the elevator, but it has turned out to be a non-issue. It's been really quiet. I will definitely try to stay here again when back in Seattle.

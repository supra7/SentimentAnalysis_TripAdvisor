I booked this on Priceline for a $100 bid. When I found out where the bid was accepted I was nervous to say the least. Seeing the Edgewater from afar many years ago I thought it looked like a real dive. I called ahead to at least request a water view room which came at the price of $75 extra. We went with out of town guests and so I thought I'd try to salvage the situation by at least being on the water. When we arrived I was shocked. It is a beautiful hotel now. It was remodeled about 2 years ago and it is fantastic. The rooms are wonderful, the view spectacular, the service was terrific and the smell in the halls - per other reviewers comments - not an issue at all. We ate breakfast in the dining room. It was my hubby's bday. The waitress was wonderful and even brought out a little bday cream puff with happy birthday spelled out on the plate in chocolate syrup. Our friends, from Miami, said that would NEVER happen where they live. They were awed by the friendliness of everyone. We walked everywhere, the location is very convenient to all downtown sites. I would highly recommend this location, especially on the waterfront side of the hotel.

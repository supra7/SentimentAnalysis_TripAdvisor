The hotel was a posiive surprise. The hotel room was big - had a separate bedroom, terrace, kitchenette and a big bathroom with both a bath tub and shower. With the refrigerator (mini bar) and the Nespresso machine, it was easy and comfortable to have your own breakfast in the hotel room. The outdoor jacuzzi and the swimming pool were a big plus. It was only a pity that the sun didn't reach the sun deck and the jacuzzi until late afternoon. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Good location close to shops and metro.

I have booked mayflower hotel for july 7th and just can't wait to go after reading all the great reviews. Called the hotel directly to book and that was a very positive experience. We go to seattle each year for a cruise and am so happy to have found this hotel instead of the usual cookie cutters we have been staying in. Will let you know how it was upon our return home.

Beautiful room, view, great staff. Had dinner Friday evening in the restaraunt which was fantastic, and then there was live music which was tasteful and helped make our evening even better. Check out is at noon, not 11am like many other places which is nice. Had lunch also when we checked out which was very good too. Will stay here again as soon as we get the chance. Great place for a romantic getaway.

This resort is incredible! Plain and simple, for the price you will not find a better resort...no question about it. For anyone to give this resort any sort of negative review there has to be one of two things happen 1) they have unrealistic expecations of what their money should get them 2) they are having a bad day/week/month/life and NOTHING would make them happy. Based on my experience here is some advice that I noted: 1) If you are considering the preferred club I would say that it is defiitely worth it. Having a place to go to when you just want a snack, nice drink, jump on the internet etc its great. Plus the private check in is a nice perk. 2) Go for a swim-up room if possible...they are the best 3) If you have a choice, don't take a room right across from the conceirge (each building has its own conceirge) because the halls really echo and it can be loud at times 4) When the bus or van brings you into the resort from the Highway DON'T BE ALARMED BY THE TERRIBLE BUMPY ROAD on the way .... haha .....it looks like you are entering Jurassic Park and we got a little nervous thinking what did we get ourselves into but don't be worried 5) A lot of people complained about sales pitches for time-share etc and we only had it come up once. If you really don't want it, just don't give any sort of buying signals at all and that's where it ends 6) The food there is incredible! Filet Mignon at the French Restaurant is excellent 7) Bring bug repellant 8) Head into Playa Del Carmen for $20 cab ride and check out 5th Ave for some good shopping 9) Make sure you bring your Wedding Certificate if you are going for Honeymoon or Anniversary for some added perks This resort was FULL of American's and very few Canadians there I think that is it.....this resort is guaranteed to impress anyone and you cannot go wrong booking here

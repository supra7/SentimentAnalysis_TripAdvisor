I recently stayed in this hotel while visiting my son. The rooms were perfectly clean! Room service was knowledgeable about the menu and food preparation. I was there when Seattle got dumped with snow and they gave me a discounted price since I couldn't get out of Seattle that day. The staff was great! Friendly and informative! I'd recommend this hotel!

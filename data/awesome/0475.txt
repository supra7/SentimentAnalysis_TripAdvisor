Although not inexpensive, the Inn is an exceptional hotel. Staff, location, and the room itself were simply excellent. Could not ask for a better location in downtown Seattle. Immediate access to virtually everything. Beautiful room; extremely comfortable. The 5th floor terrace was simply fantastic. We spent many hours there with a glass of wine or two over a 3 day stay. I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend it to anyone.

This is an update from DAS080808. I made an error on rating Secrets - Maroma Beach. Everything was a 5 - simply wonderful in every aspect. I have received a few e-mails about my initial review and wanted to write another review correcting my error. The hotel even called me last night to ask how they could have made our stay better. If that isn't service, I don't know what is. This hotel was even prettier when we got there then the pictures on their website. As you know most of the time, that is the opposite. We thoroughly enjoyed everything and we will go back and take our friends the next time. Sorry for the error again!!!!

We had a fabulous 3 night stay here. The staff was very helpful in every way every day. They knew where to go in Seattle and how to get there. They know that people staying there are staying there on a bugget and want to save money. When we checked in we they were very helpful and easy to get along with . Our room was clean and neat. We used the pool and the hot tub. The hot tub jets were not working. The next night I just tried them and they worked. The breakfast was good. The make your own waffles were a neat thing to have along with the sausages. There was pleanty of cereal and toast, fruits and pastries. Then all day long they had pastries out front along with coffee,lemonade and cold water. This a great location and they told us how to get the free bus and where to get the monorail. When we got back from our cruise they stored our luggage for the day till we had to go to the airport. For the money we had a fabulous time and a great stay. Loved thier staff and would use this hotel again.

My husband and I visited this resort for a weeklong vacation to mark our 10th anniversary. We were VERY impressed with the service rendered at the resort..in a week, we did not have one bad service experience. The beach was outstanding. The pools were plentiful, and the resort was extremely clean. The food was good...not excellent...but that did not take anything away from our experience. We highly recommend this resort.

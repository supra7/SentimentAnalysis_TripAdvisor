I've stayed at many Starwood hotels and this one is truly one of the best. I found no flaw whatsoever. Everything was better than expected. The valet was especially prompt. Bar and room service were some of the best I've experienced. Room was large and spotless; perhaps the best bed I've ever slept in. Not sure why W Hotels can be so inconsistent, but this place has it's act together.

We stayed at the Moore Hotel for 2 nights this month. We stayed in one of the queen bed rooms on one of the upper stories with a private bathroom. We were extremely impressed with the quality of our room, the price of the room, and the attention to detail in the decor. The hotel maid staff is clearly a cut above the rest: when we arrived they had folded all of our towels into the shape of different animals. They even creased the paper in the toilet paper rolls. The room was very clean and tidy. The view from our window was also excellent. We had a great view of the Puget sound and other historic downtown Seattle buildings. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. A couple other things: 1) There are men and women's restrooms on the first floor which is very convenient if you need to use the restroom while checking in or after checking out 2) They have a luggage closet where you can store your stuff if you want to continue roaming the city after you have checked out. 3) The furniture in the lounge are is very comfortable But, the absolute best thing about this hotel is..... The Location!! We were enthralled to find out that almost all of the restaurants we wanted to eat at and a lot of the things we wanted to see and do in Seattle were within a few blocks of the hotel! Perfect location for anyone visiting the city. We were very happy with this hotel.

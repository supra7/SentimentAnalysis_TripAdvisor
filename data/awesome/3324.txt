We stayed at this hotel the day before our cruise and a day after our cruise was over. The hotel does offer a shuttle to and from the airport but it's not the fastest. If you are in a hurry I suggest grabbing a taxi. Overall the hotel was super nice and super clean. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms were very large and they have extremely comfortable beds. The restaurant in the hotel has good food as well. Do note if you want to use their wireless in your room be ready to pay a usage fee. Are you kidding me, a usage fee?

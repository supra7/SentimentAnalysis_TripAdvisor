Wonderful beautiful, large and clean rooms made our stay fabulous. In room amenities are 5 star quality. The hotel is 3 blocks from the bus and metro so we were able to get to all the attractions easily and inexpensively. BE SURE TO ASK FOR SENIOR AND CHILD RATES ON THE BUS AND METRO. I Suggest the city attraction pass as it saves money and you can see the best the city has to offer. PIKES MARKET IS 1/2 A BLOCK AWAY. WE WERE A FAMILY OF 6 AND WE ALL LOVED THE HOTEL. For breakfast visit BRACCO around the corner from the hotel.

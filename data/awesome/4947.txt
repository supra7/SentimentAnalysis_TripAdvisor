From the moment we arrived to the resort everything about our experience there exceeded our expectations. I have been in the travel industry for over 25 years and will have no problem whatsoever in recommending this resort. It is a tremendous all-inclusive property and there couldn't be a more beautiful beach than Maroma Beach. And, the service is over the top!

The rooms were gorgeous, the food was always fantastic (and there were so many restaurants, we didn't even try them all during our 5 night stay!) and the service was amazing. Everyone spoke English and was exceptionally kind- be sure to bring extra cash to tip, because the staff definitely deserves it. And the beach was VERY well taken care of- It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever been- we're definitely going back! Oh, and the complimentary photo session was lots of fun <3

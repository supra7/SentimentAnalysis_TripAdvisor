Our family of four stayed at Le Crystal this past July and loved it. We had a minor hiccup during check-in in that our room was not ready on time, and had to wait for an extra hour. During this time, we were allowed to use the pool and facilities and due to the incovenience, we got an upgraded suite and free breakfast the next day, which was not very well received and appreciated. The hotel iteslf is gorgeous and the suite was fantastic. It had all the ammenitites we needed/expected and more. The pool is clean and inviting. The balcony area is a little small and it can be tough to get a lounge chair, but the jacuzzi is quite large. This is actually on the twleth floor, which is the top of the hotel, but there are private appartment for about another ten floors above you, so you are not actually on the roof. All in all, it was an extremly pleasant stay and a great start to our holiday.

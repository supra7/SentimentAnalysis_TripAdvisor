Secrets was a great place for our honeymoon. I would recommend this resort to anyone, everything was great, the service, the food, the beach, and the room. The nightly entertainment was awesome and the we couldn't find a reason to leave the resort for anything. More chairs around the pool would have been nice as they filled up fast and people would keep their stuff on the chair all day but other than that great trip. We can't wait to go back!!!!!

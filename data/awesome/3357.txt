I was a little leary of booking through hotwire.com , only because you don't know the Hotel Name beforehand. I booked through hotwire.com and to my surprise was booked at the hilton seattle airport & conference center. i had been looking on their website and wasn't particularly enthused with paying $200.00 a night. I payed 99.86 with all taxes on hotwire.com. The hotel is a very great location if you are flying out of SEATAC. The shuttle comes 3 times an hour which is great. The drivers were very courteous and attentative. Upon arrival check in was very quick , and with great customer service. The lady at the desk was very helpful. The room was great! It had a little patio our into the courtyard which had the pool. The room was very big. VERY clean , I am a housekeeper and I am so picky , but it was great! Overall a great experience. I didn't eat or drink as I brought my own food into the room. Room service was pretty much the same price as any other hotel. LOW noise for an airport/convention hotel. I didn't hear a peep all night. I would definately stay here again!

We started to stay at The Inn in the mid-1980's. Since then, every trip to the North West includes a stay at The Inn, whether it is business or pleasure. Unlike any other hotel I ever stayed at, there is such a great feeling of peace here. The employees cannot do enough for you, and they know when to let you be. On my last visit, I had a courtyard view. The courtyard was under reconstruction, but was still very bearable -- even the construction workers were respectful. The roof patio is wonderful. Nothing beats a glass of wine while watching the sunset, Ranier and the Space Needle. At night, the lights on the bay are fantastic. I am a Starbuck's junkie. Can't beat getting up, walking the block to the original Starbuck's, then enjoying my latte while enjoying the views from my room. Even our son puts The Inn as, number one -- although it does not have a swimming pool!! My only regret is that we cannot get to Seattle often enough.

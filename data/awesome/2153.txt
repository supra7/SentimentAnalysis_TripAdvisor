Right on the water - Beatles stayed there in the 60's. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable, clean but a bit small (which was no problem) - the bed was fantastic with feather pillows an option - bathroom was beautiful - bath/shower products outstanding - plush bathrobes. Small balcony with view of harbor - woke up on Friday to see a cruise ship docked next door! On the other side of hotel just a short walk was the Victoria Clipper dock where we took the ferry to Victoria on Saturday. Location was perfect for us. Restaurant was delicious with a good selection of local fare - elegant dining in a casual setting overlooking the water. Breakfast and dinner were outstanding. Alcoholic drinks were generous with a wide range of liquors available. Wait staff well trained, friendly and knowledgeable. Lounge was comfortable on Tuesday when we first got there, but as the week progressed it got busier and nosier. Seattle was very pedestrian friendly and we found we had no need for a car (parking was $33/night) - we turned in our rental after the 1st day. What a vacation - no driving. Took the ferry to Victoria, BC and then a bus/ferry to Vancouver, BC which left us 3 short blocks from out hotel there. There was a free bus that stopped right in front of the Edgewater and ran along the water front to the older part of downtown. Most of the city's public transportation (from Pike's Market down to the Football & Baseball stadiums) was FREE during the day.

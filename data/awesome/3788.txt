This resort was amazing! All of the restaurants offered gourmet food prepared to perfection. The rooms had a wide variety of anemities and we loved the comfortable seating area on our balcony where we had coffee each morning. The service of all the staff from concierge to housekeeping was outstanding. The premium alcohol and the room service were my two favourite features. Excellent beach as well. Really it had it all!

My wife and I have been to Riveria Maya in the past and researched places to stay since we like seeing new things. Secrets Maroma Beach was a great choice. The beach was beautiful, not rocky and the water was very clear if you walk down the beach a bit. The food and service was by far the best we have had at any all inclusive. We were most impressed with the Hibachi restaurant which was veyr similar to a Benihana. They offer top shelf liquor including Grey Goose (wow). The staff was very friendly (at all levels) and helpful. We stayed in building 26 which was close to the beach but it was on the 2nd floor so we could not see the ocean well. Overall, it was a great experience. I highly recommend this property.

When we arrived at this wonderful hotel, we were greeted with those magic words "we have upgraded you"! This was to room 414 and it was one of the best rooms I've ever stayed in. The whole hotel oozes class at a reasonable price and all the staff were friendly and efficient. I will always return here when in Seattle and suggest you do the same!

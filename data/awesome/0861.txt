We just returned from a 3 night stay here, and thought the hotel was great. Perfect location, everything was within a 10-15 minute walk, and there were loads of restaurants/shops etc right outside the front door. We were upgraded to a suit with an amazing view out the bedroom and living room windows (room 2656). The rooms were a great size, bed was super comfy, good bathroom. We didn't order any room service or try out the restaurant/bar. Staff were all really friendly and helpful. I'd definitely stay at this hotel again

We stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach from Feb 5th to Feb 12th 2011 .1st. I have to say my husband and I have been married almost 34 years and this was my very first time even flying and my husbands first time flying outside of Canada! We usually travel by motorcycle for our holidays so this was a true adventure and well deserved holiday for both of us..I have wanted to go to Mexico for years and years and finally after a year of many tragedies we decided to bite the bullet and get it off my "bucket list" so to speak and go ..So I started gathering travel brochures and looking resorts up on the internet I came across alot of promising resorts but kept going back to the Maroma Beach area " and fell in love with Secrets Maroma before I knew it no others could compare in my mind...I have to say the staff are one of the things that make this resort and I never had one member of the staff that did not work so very hard in making sure my holiday was anything but exceptional..I did aqua fit in the pool and I have to say Ci Ci really made my day "every day" what a hoot that girl is...a gem! Every meal was so amazing and that is one thing my husband was concerned about (I have Crohn's and it is always a worry whether food will bother me ) but yippee not one problem ! The beach was so wonderful and we had fun with the angel fish coming all around us. The Super Bowl Party on the beach was a riot and being from Canada we still had a blast ...the intertainment team at the resort thought of everything for the game...so much fun had by all . We enjoyed all the shows ..the Rock Show was very good and the Fire and Ice show was really really good I really think the only thing I can say negative about this trip/resort is the "Time share" thing that others have wrote about....I felt like we had to deal with it at the airport and once I am at the resort I should not be approached on the "pretence" of having a $200 dollar credit..when I knew full well it was for a timeshare speel ...Maybe try to put a flyer for the timeshare in everyone's secret box that way if they want to hear the speel they can if not you wont be turning people off with this approach....just my opinion for such a high end top notch resort everyone we spoke to was "turned off by it" ....I even hated mentioning it as I dont want people to "not experience" this resort..I miss it already and hope the new friends we met from Wisconcin and my husband and I can go again.next year god willing..Thanks you so very very much for a holiday I will "never" forget.

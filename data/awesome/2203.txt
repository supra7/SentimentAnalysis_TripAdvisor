Our visit was excellent and we will return. Although the room accommodations was a tight fit for three people, it was very clean and our housekeeper was attentive to details. We found the front desk, restaurant staff, and bell desk to be friendly and informative. The water view from our guestroom was worth paying for. The food in the restaurant was pricey but the impeccable service made it all worth it! The bell staff graciously accommodated our request for the complimentary shuttle service to Pikes Market. We spent a total of 6 nights at the Edgewater and we have nothing to complain about. We also found the Edgewater to be within walking distance to downtown and a number of good restaurants. We also enjoyed the ambiance of their lobby. Thank you to the staff of the Edgewater for a wonderful visit. We will return someday!

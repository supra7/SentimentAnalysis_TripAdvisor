The location of Inn at the Market is absolutely perfect! This is the most central you can feel in Seattle. Short walk to shopping and dining destinations, or anything downtown. My partial water view room was large and had a great water view (better than "partial") looking over and past the 5th floor roof deck. This was a free, unrequested upgrade from a City Side room, by the way. The hotel offers great dining options onsite. Room service menu is outstanding. The sheets and pillows are high quality. Lobby is quite small, so it wouldn't be a good choice if you are trying to hold business chats or other get togethers in the lobby area of your hotel. Overall, if you want a very Seattle feeling hotel with great ambiance and staff, this is the best choice.

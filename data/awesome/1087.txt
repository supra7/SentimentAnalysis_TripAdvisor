We stayed here one night after we returned to Seattle from our cruise. The price was very reasonable and it was nice being downtown and close to everything. Check out isn't until noon, so there's plenty of time to do additional exploring before check out. Room was very clean and very quiet. Staff was good and very helpful. We'd stay here again.

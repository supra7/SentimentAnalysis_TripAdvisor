Since I would be arriving late into SeaTac from the East coast, I decided to stay one night at the airport Marriott before heading into Seattle the next morning to meet friends. I expected just a bit of convienence but instead found a wonderful welcome to Seattle in an unexpectedly luxurious setting. The hotel itself was lovely, evoking a sense of Northwest charm. The lobby was comfortable and inviting, with a bar that overlooked the garden style pool/atrium. I enjoyed a delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail with a generous glass of wine. It was a wonderful way to relax after a very long day of travel, especially knowing that my room was just steps away. The location was as convienient as can be - minutes from the airport with shuttles running at frequent intervals. (I know this for a fact since I used the shuttle several times, having forgotten something at the hotel and using the shuttle to pick it up before I flew out of town). The staff - the front desk, the shuttle drivers. the bartender, the waiters at breakfast, the store clerk - all of them were wonderful - friendly, professional and helpful. (One desk clerk seemed to be having a bit of a bad day when I returned to pick up my forgotten item, but I, too, was feeling a bit rushed and inpatient - still, it was nothing that detracted from the overall experience). Perhaps tellingly, there seemed to be quite a few flight crews staying at the hotel. In my experience, I haven't found too many airport hotels that would be worth the visit besides the convienence - the SeaTac Marriott is an exception. It's a nice hotel, airport or not! It made flying seem like fun again.

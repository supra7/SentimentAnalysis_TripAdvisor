First of all, they let me check in at 10am to dress for an event. Then there was a small problem with the room so they upgraded me an executive corner suite with a view of the harbor, Space needle and Lake Union.. My wife would open all the drapes and admire the views day and night (a Grays Anatomy fan). Hotel food was outstanding and about 20% more than eating at a hole in the wall. A concierge found me wandering and offered to show me the hotels offerings. The most memorable of which is the 28th floor pool and hot tub with a floor to cieling 2 wall view of the city. Be sure to take your swim trunks. I could go on but my final opinion is that it was the best value, treatment, and service I have ever received. When you leave the hotel, the hills are killers. I am retired and I used the free bus to visit all the sites.

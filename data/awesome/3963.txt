Stayed here for eight days for our honeymoon in the honeymoon suite. We have been to a number of all inclusive resorts in Mexico and this one has the best food, rooms, and staff we have found. The drinks are made with name brand quality liquor and if you are in preferred club you can get premium liquors as well. The nightly shows are entertaining but not as well done as I've seen at some other resorts. We'll definitely be back!

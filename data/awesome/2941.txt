This has become our go-to hotel in Seattle and I wish there was a similar place everywhere we travel. The staff, notably Topher for us, go out of there way to accommodate you, find you the best rate or package, advise you on whats going on in town, and will upgrade you when they can. From the doorman to front of house, both in the Hotel, and in the attached Red Fin sushi resto, everyone is exceptionally pleasant and helpful. We've sent many friends to the Hotel Max and they all are repeat guests!. We love the art, the location, the luxurious and colorful boutique rooms, the photo hallways, and the whole Max experience. See you for Valentines Day!!

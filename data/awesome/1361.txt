We were unsure if we should book here because it only had 3 stars on here, but I am so glad that we did. The room was clean, the staff was attentive, friendly and professional. The location was great, quiet and close to many things we were there to see and do. The room was quite small, but we knew to expect that from other reviews, and found it to be very comfortable for our needs. If you're looking for a large spacious suite, look elsewhere, if you're looking for clean, safe and comfortable, it's a great deal for the price!

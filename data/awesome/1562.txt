We recently took our first trip up to Seattle and stayed at the Sheraton. The hotel is located in a great location so you can walk to most things. (if walking isn't your thing, cabs are very easy to get) The hotel itself must have been remodeled recently as it seemed to have that new carpet smell throughout the hallways and rooms. The rooms were a pretty good size for being a hotel in a city. Pretty spacious, clean and bright. The bed was amazing!! We would definitely visit Seattle again and when we do, we will stay here again.

Lovely hotel and very friendly & helpful staff. Comfortable, clean and quiet room. Excellent dinner in the restaurant. Location can't be beat - lots in walking distance and close to Monorail to get to Space Needle, Science Center & Music Experience. Short walk to Pike Place Market. All sorts of shopping and restaurants in walking distance. Outdated information in hotel guest guide - check with the friendly consierge; incorrect TV listings so use their Channel 2 for correct information. Overall experience was excellent and we will definitely stay here again.

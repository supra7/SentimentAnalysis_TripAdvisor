This is by far the best hotel I have ever been and probably will return soon. First of all this is a luxury all inclusive hotel. 7 restaurants as far as I remember and my wife felt in love with all of them. People around is nice and courteous all the time and they make you feel like a king literally. There are many Europeans in this place so being a Latin appears to be something good as they treat you very well.

This is a great hotel, and don't be shy about getting a "partial sea view" or even a street view. The rooms are large, tastefully decorated and the location cannot be beat. The staff will do anything to help and really go out of their way to make sure you're happy with them. This is one of the best hotels on the W Coast. My only suggestion, and it's a small one, don't make me pay the $15 for the gym 2 blks away. It's a great gym, but I wish they'd pick up the tab.

As you can tell from the other reviews, the resort was perfect. The food was amazing, the service was incredible and the resort was gorgeous. I can't stress how great it is to go on vacation and not have to worry about a thing. They absolutely think of everything. You never feel as though you're a hassle....the place is amazing! Top shelf liquor, any kind of drink you can imagine, and so many different choices to eat! You don't have to tip (you don't get better service if you do), but they work harder than any American I've ever seen, so give them a couple dollars. Even if you tip $2-5 at every meal and $1-2 for every drink, you won't even break a $100!

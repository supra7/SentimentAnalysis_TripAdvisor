I can't say enough wonderful things about this amazing resort! From the pristine beach, to the great pools, to the out-of-this-world food, drinks, room. view....incredible doesn't even begin to describe it. But the best part is the SERVICE! Everyone is beyond nice and wonderful! Everyone smiles and says "Hola!" to you. The staff is so fantastic, anything you ask for is immediately done or taken care of and every sentence is finished with "It's my pleasure!" and they actually mean it! Each building is fairly small and has it's own personal concierge so you feel like you have such personal attention everyday. Our concierge was so fantastic we wanted to bring her home with us. We joked there was literally nothing she couldn't do and we used to place bets on how fast she would call us back (she was actually faster then we were!) Oh - and we got married there and the wedding was 50 times better then I could have ever dreamed. My advice to any bride wanting a destination wedding...go there...don't ever stress or worry...just grab a dress and go! Trust me, you won't have any regrets!

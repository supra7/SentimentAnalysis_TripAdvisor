Having read numerous reviews here, I was prepared well, so thanks TripAdvisor members! Upon check-in, asked for room away from highway, upper floor, and upgrade to Priority Club. There was no King bed available on the side away from highway but we were on the 30th floor facing southish, so I-5 is visible but noise isn't an issue. In fact it's neat to watch the highway traffic! Valet parking pretty stout, nearly $40/night. Room is comfortable, staff reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally nice (Deante? is from Georgia, for all you Southerners traveling here, and will TAKE CARE of you!! JessieRose at front desk was so friendly!). Very friendly and helpful staff all around, truly. So far this hotel deserves the good reviews I've seen, but being prepared made a big difference, I'm sure.

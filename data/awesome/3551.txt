Traveled to Montreal for my honeymoon. I booked the Hotel Le Crystal based on the many positive reviews I read and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is in a nice location downtown, within an easy walk of plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping, including the Underground City. We had one of the smaller suites, but it was still plenty big enough for honeymooning. The decor was modern and clean. The bedroom was separated from a living room by a glass wall. Both rooms had flat screen tv's and the living room had a nice view of the city. The bathroom had a huge shower with a rainshower head and a regular shower head. The maid service was excellent. When we initially had trouble with the air conditioner they immediately sent a service man to fix the problem. When we asked for additional towels they were delivered quickly. The front desk people were friendly and helpful, and made restaurant reservations at my request. All in all, the hotel was great.

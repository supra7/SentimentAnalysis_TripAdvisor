I had a 12 hour layover at SEA and decided to try the HH Seattle Airport & Conference Centre. It is one of if not the closest hotel to the airport. The shuutle buss runs every 20 minutes and picks up at Curb 1 and Curb 3 outside of the arrivals area. The hotel appears to be an older propoerty yet inside it is immaculate. A very classy lobby area with a Spencer's Seafood & Chops restaurant off the lobby. I was very tired and decided on room service. The food was very good and very prompt service. The hotel also states that the room service attendant receives all of the 19% gratuity which I think it great! I did not have time to enjoy much of the hotel as I just wanted to sleep. The bed was a King bed that was extremely comfortable! A nice big screen TV and upgraded washroom amenities were also available. Rates are very reasonable at this location and I would highly recommend this property!

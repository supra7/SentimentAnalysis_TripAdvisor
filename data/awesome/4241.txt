We were at this great resort from April 28th thru May 5Th. This is one of our favorite resorts that we have been to in the last 20 years. At check in we were approached by the time share or vacation group, Listened to for 5 minutes and told them we were not interested in it and was never bothered again. The rooms, grounds and the rest of the rooms were great and had no problem with any of them. We were in Room 1524 and our Concierge was Sandra. We asked for some Modelo Beer to replace our Corona and it was done within 20 minutes. All the good things that have been said about this place is true and I do not know where the negitives come , we definitely had none. One thing that has not been mentioned was that you never had to worry about Beach towels there was always plenty , even late in the day. The Beach was to DIE FOR. The nitely shows were fun we liked the Elvis and Majic Shows the best. Daniel the Bartender at Barracuda Bar was great also Tony on the enterainment group. We will return.

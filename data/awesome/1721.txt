Um, did I mention that I love Seattle? Had a conference at the Convention center right around the back of the hotel, so it was super convenient. Had a view of the city and could see the Sound from my window. Great location and close to everything. We rented a car so we could get around if we needed to, but didn't use it too much. Husband came along with, and we had a great time. Walked down to the piers. Had a GREAT wine tasting dinner at Elliott's (highly recommended) and the obligatory bowl of clam chowder at Ivar's. My husband would bathe in that stuff if we could afford to get it shipped here in 100 gallon vats. (Gross, I know, but true.) Loved the Pike Place Market -- paid out the wazoo to ship home fresh salmon and halibut, but dang, was it good in my belly. Had a coffee at the original Starbucks, went to the Space Needle b/c you have to do it once (even though it's a rip off). Our favorite thing was taking our car on the ferry over to Bainbridge (sp?) Island and Fort Ward Park. Peaceful and we took lots of great pictures on our walk. I love ferry boats...(for all you GA fans out there, I wish SGH was a real place b/c I'd have thrown myself in front of a car just to need surgery in that place...kidding, obviously.) So....yes, I love Seattle, and the Sheraton is a nice hotel with a great location.

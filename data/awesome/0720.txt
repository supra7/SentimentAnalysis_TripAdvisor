Inn at the Market is the perfect place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. The location is the best in the city - at the Pike Place Market, which is so much fun! You can also walk to upscale shopping, the waterfront and aquarium, dozens of great restaurants, museums (including the must-see new Olympic Sculpture Park), and so much more. The staff was gracious and friendly. My room had an incredible view of the Market and the water. Be sure to visit the outdoor deck on the fifth floor - even if the weather doesn't cooperate, the views will impress. I slept very well in the comfy bed. I loved the daybed by the window, too - wish I had one at home!

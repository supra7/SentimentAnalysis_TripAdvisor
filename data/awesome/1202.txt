This is a well managed historic hotel in a good downtown location, convenient to mass transportation, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, a Great location to use as a base to explore Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights at the beginning of a 10 day trip to the Puget Sound area and returned for the last two nights. Our first room was a very nice large deluxe room on an upper floor with a king bed and sitting area with sofa, two chairs and coffee table. We slept with the window open a couple of inches and were not bothered by street sounds. Rooms in Seattle were scarce at the end of our trip, so we emailed the hotel after getting the first reservation and were able to get a smaller room, about the size of a standard Marriott room, with two queen beds and two bathrooms on a lower floor at the same price. Both were very nice rooms, great for sleeping with good maid service, but being an historic building, the bathrooms were smaller than bathrooms found in newer properties. The front desk staff provided good recommendations for dining and were extremely pleasant. On the evening of our arrival we had a light meal and drinks in Olivers, the hotel lounge. The food and service was good. Preferring a light breakfast, we used coffee shops and cafes out of the hotel. We opted to pick up our rental car at a downtown location at the end of our 1st two nights, preferring to explore large cities on foot and eliminated both the valet parking and airport rental car concession fees. Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus service ($18pp roundtrip) from SeaTac to the nearby Weston Hotel worked well and we walked the two blocks to the Mayflower Park. Being at the end of the Monorail to Seattle Center was a plus and we also took advantage of the free daytime downtown public bus, using the nearby underground bus tunnel. There are many things to see and do in Seattle. This hotel worked well for us and we would definitely use it again.

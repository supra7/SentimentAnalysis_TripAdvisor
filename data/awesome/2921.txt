I stayed here 2 nights for my business trip. Aside from spacious room and unique ambiance, the service made me feel like I'm treated very special. You never get confused which number to press when you need to order food or set morning call. You just press "Whenever, Whatever" button and they will help you all the way out whatever the problem is. I really loved their Bliss bath cosmetics kits as well. The only thing I didn't like was they kind of charge you what you usually expect as free in many other hotels. For example, I drank mineral water at my bed side (I think it's generally complementary in other hotels) and I only learned it cost $10 for the bottle when I saw my bill at check out. Also they charged me $5 for the Internet cable. (They do not have wireless in the room) Overall, the experience was great, and I think I might stay again here if I visit Seattle again.

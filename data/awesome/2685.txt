On a recent trip to Seattle we stayed for several nights at the Hotel Vintage Park. Everything was exemplary. I seek out Kimpton Hotels for my travels after having stayed frequently at Hotel Monaco in Washington, D.C., during my years of work with the National Academy of Sciences. While I do not want to down play the marvelous treatment and superb accommodations that I have always experienced at The Monaco, this stay at Hotel Vintage Park was way over the top. The accommodations were as always what one expects at a Kimpton hotel and the food at Tulio was outstanding. But what made the stay so especially memorable and rewarding was the servicetruly the best I have received in many years at any hotel. The concierge, Louis, led the list of a truly remarkable staff with his ever attentive, yet in no way overwhelming service. It seems he was always on duty, greeting guests with a smile and offering what proved time and again to be very helpful and always accurate assistance. His friendly, informative, and professional demeanor as host of wine tasting turned happy hour into an exceptional social event. Even as we were checking out and packing our car for a weekend trip to wine country, Louis came to our rescue. We had purchased a large Dungeness crab at the market to enjoy later for a picnic. When Louis saw how poorly it was packaged, he asked if I minded if he helped. He took the crab and repackaged it in ice, sealed in a travel box, and returned with a big smile, refusing to take a tip. This is not your typical concierge duty, and Louis is by no means the typical concierge. He is thoroughly professional and the best advertisement that any hotel could hope for. All the staff was greatservice is the name of the game for boutique hotels of this qualityVintage Park has it all.

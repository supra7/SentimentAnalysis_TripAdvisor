First let me say that I'm a tough customer when it comes to hotels. I always have high expectations and can be difficult to please but I never have a problem when I stay here. Whenever I have an early flight at Seatac, this is my hotel of choice. The staff is very courteous, professional, and always willing to help. Recently they helped avoid a crisis when I brought the wrong Gameboy charger for my son by allowing me to take one from a big box of forgotten chargers -- for FREE! The rooms are quiet, spacious, and always incredibly clean. The pool is better than some 4 or 5 star hotels found in downtown Seattle. The food is also very good. It's only a few blocks from light rail so it makes it easy. I love this hotel and think it should be a model for other hotels to learn from.

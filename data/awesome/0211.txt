Located in the heart of Seattle the Hotel Monaco is always a favorite of our traveling crew. From it's location to the staff to being a pet friendly hotel the Hotel Monaco is always a treat. Your never alone in the hotel as you'll have one their trademark Goldfish w/name in your room when you arrive. Just a great environment and pleasant place to stay.

I stayed here in a townhouse city side suite with my wife and 2 kids (2 and 8) on our summer trip. The location is just steps from the market which is great for walking to grab breakfast and dinner and is also close to catch the monorail to some of the activities in the city. The patio for the guests was great. The only improvement we'd like to see is a larger bathroom as it was extremely small and cramped. Other than that the two level suite was great.

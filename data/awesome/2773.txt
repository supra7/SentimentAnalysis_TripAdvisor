This hotel has a free wine tasting late each afternoon, which after a long day of walking all over Seattle was an excellent relaxation moment before the dinner hours. Hotel location is very good. The room we were upgraded to after the first night was excellent. First night was across from the elevator, which we had previously requested not to be. Would definitely stay there again,

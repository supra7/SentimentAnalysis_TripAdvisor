My 18 year old son and I were extremely pleased with our accommodations at the Crystal Hotel in Montreal. I read many reviews before and after booking our reservations through Expedia. I cannot say anything negative about the hotel rooms. The front desk staff (Edith, Sophie, and Milien (sp)) were extremely helping and accommodating any time I had special requests. They would go out of their way to help you out; more so than any other hotel I have stayed at in the last five years. The furnishings and decorations were very nice and chic. Our first room (which we turned down) did not have a separate bedroom so I called the front desk and within 3 minutes Sophie was there to lead us to a more spacious room. The bathroom was very large and I love the shower head so much that I want to install one in my master suite. The tangerines in the morning were a nice touch as we headed off to walk the streets of Montreal. My son enjoyed two nights using the pool, sauna, and whirlpool. The computers were always available and in working condition. Even the cleaning lady was very hospitable and made sure we had fresh supplies of bathroom products such as shampoo, etc. every day. I highly recommend the grayline bus tour to Qubec City which lasts all day; it is very informative and you will learn a lot of interesting historical facts. I guess the only area where i would suggest improvement was La Coupole. We ate one dinner there and i found it rather overpriced for the portion sizes. I had a $35 filet mignon dinner which while tender had no real flavor. There was a small piece of bok choy and a few potato fingerlings and three stems of asparagus  no salad and no baked potato like you would probably get at a Texas restaurant for less money. The service was good but I was slightly hungry an hour later! We shall return to this hotel if we ever get back up to Montreal.

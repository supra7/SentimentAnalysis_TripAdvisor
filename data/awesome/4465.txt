Excellent in all aspects. My wife and I experienced an excellent stay at Secrets Maroma. This was from our perspective mainly achieved through a perfect management and a superb attitude of all Maroma personnel. Congratulations!! Only recommendation for improvement : As besides a significant US colony, quiet a lot of Belgian and Dutch tourists are enjoying a stay in this beautiful hotel, pse add BVN to your satellite TV channels and envisage Belgian/Dutch computer news prints. Thank you very much, and looking forward to another Secrets hotel at possibly the Dominican Republic.

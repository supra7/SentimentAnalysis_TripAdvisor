We recently stayed here for our first anniversary. The only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. We are both extremely busy with work and thought a 3 night getaway would be a nice little trip, but of course, we wish we would have stayed longer. The resort is beautiful and the staff is wonderful. We had a swimout suite and would highly recommend that. Alberto, our concierge, was amazing. He found out it was our anniversary and when we came back to the room there was a sash on our door, as well as a bottle of champagne waiting on us. These small touches make your trip so much more memorable. The only negative I found was that I felt like everyone we came across in Mexico was trying to sell us something. At the airport, the taxi service, the timeshare at the resort, etc. We were here for such a short time that allI we wanted to do was relax. We just avoided it at all costs, and in the end, it wasn't that bad. Back to the positives, everything really exceeded our expectations. The beach was gorgeous, the bars and pools were great. The food was good. Customer service-excellent. They go above and beyond in every detail and it really shows. We had a couples massage and it was the best spa treatment I've ever had. I get massages on a weekly basis, so that's a tall order for me to give such a high mark. If we would have been there longer, I would have booked more treatments for sure! I could ramble on for awhile, but I think it is best summed up in the fact that my husband and I want to return. We like to travel and we try not to visit the same place twice. Even if we go somewhere more than once, we will still stay at a different hotel/resort. We thrive on new experiences. The fact that we both said we are coming back to Secrets Maroma should say it all.

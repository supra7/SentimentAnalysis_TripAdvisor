We got to Kissimmee a day earlier than planned and needed to find somewhere for one night. After checking the rates at five different locations, we got the best price at Destiny Palms. We thought that it might be lower class, but since we only needed one night decided to give it a try. We were delightfully surprised. The room's accommodations were superior to other hotels in the area (Upscale dark wood furniture) and included refrigerator and toaster oven. Lots of high pressure hot water and a marvelous shower head (Put it on massage). The complimentary breakfast included hard boiled eggs as well as all other usual items. The staff was very helpful and directed us to a really nice close Italian restaurant, Bruno's. We have never taken the time to write a review before, but think the Destiny Palms deserve to be brought to the attention anyone needing a hotel in the Disneyland area.

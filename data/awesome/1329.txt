We stayed here for 3 nights in April. This is an amazing find and in one of the best locations in Amsterdam. It is very close to the Nine Streets, which provides some of the most charming eating, shopping and walking in Amsterdam. We stayed in the White room, which provided a large and very comfortable bed. The bathroom is a little unique, but it works. The room has large windows facing the canal. The room is also equipped with a Mac for your use. There is no breakfast included but because of the location, you would want to go out and have breakfast in one of the cafe's that offer a great Dutch pancake! You may want to make sure that you bring your own soap and shampoo.

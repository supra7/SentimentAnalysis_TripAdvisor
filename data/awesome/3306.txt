After a couple of stressful flights from Alaska, the stress simply melted away from the time the airport shuttle bus picked me up to the time they said goodbye and wished me well. This Marriott is the benchmark by which ALL hotels should be measured. I am a Customer Service training specialist and even I was blown away by their utterly genuine and sincere excellent customer service. When I was told by check-in that it was a pleasure to welcome me to the hotel I actually felt very special. I could not fault them in the slightest. EVERY staff member I came across was charming, polite and superbly attentive. The beds were heavenly, so soft. Such a change from the usual cost-saving lumps of concrete often tolerated these days. My room overlooked the atrium which was absolutely delightful. A kind of indoors/outdoors area with pool well screened by foliage plus several clusters of spacious conservatory style furniture which just begged me to take advantage of. How relaxing it was to sit in comfort reading a book and unwinding. Even though the lobby area was lively with early evening guests enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail, the sense of intrusion normally felt in such hotels was noticeably absent in that the design of each area ensured privacy and intimacy. Superb customer service continued into the restaurant. Again I was blown away by their attentiveness, finely tuned to ensure it is not overdone. Not only would I highly recommend this hotel, I would even go so far as to orchestrate my schedule to necessitate another stay in the very near future. The staff should be congratulated on their service. They obviously work very hard yet are like the proverbial swan - calm and serene on the surface, whilst working harder than ever behind the scenes. A superb example of exemplary customer service. Thank you.

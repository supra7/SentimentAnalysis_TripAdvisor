My wife and I have stayed at the Aventura Spa Palace on two occasions, and let me tell you, Secrets Maroma Beach blows it away!! The size of the resort was perfect! You could easily get anywhere quickly. The rooms were very spacious and accomodating. I can't say enough for the food!! We ate ate nearly every restaraunt and never had a complaint. We were never hungry (or thirsty!). The staff at the hotel was incredible. Each building has it's own Consierge to help with any needs you may have. My Mother-In-Law actually had to get in touch with us the day we arrived, and they came and found us on the property! They really pay attention to guest satisfaction. The resort has their own "Entertainment Team" that organizes events, such as volleyball, bike riding, etc. They were awesome!! The first time you do anything with them, they remember your name whenever they see you around the resort! It was by far the best vacation we have had in a long time, and will surely be our "Go-To" resort when we return to the Mayan Riviera! You can't go wrong with Secrets Maroma!

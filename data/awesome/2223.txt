I recently stated at the Sorrento Hotel in downtown Seattle and found it to be a wonderful European style hotel. The front desk and bell staff were superb. They helped me with my transportation needs to a dinner meeting and extended my checkout time so that I could leave my belongings in the room until after the funeral Mass I was attending at the Cathedral. The restaurant served a wonderful breakfast and the server was friendly and met all my expectations. I can highly recommend this hotel to any traveler looking for a great European style hotel that is neat, clean and has excellent service.

My husband and I are in our late 50"s - travel extensively - use all inclusive frequently. Fabulous beach - cant compare with anywhere else in Mexico. Service - fantastic - if you need a lounger just ask Kevin - he will find you one or two and place it where you want Food - breakfast buffet - great - lunch - waiters coming around with several options or there is the bbq grill or sit down - dinner - alacarte - not Wolfgang Puck but not too shabby! Dress - women usually dressed up - men - not so much Entertainment - well done Pools - heated swim up - other pool - refreshing - swim outs - you had to ask that they turn up the heat and they were fine Spa - over priced - over rated Service - excellent Great place to relax - lots of honeymooners - anniversary - not the place to go if you are single and lloking to find someone - very little rowdiness Would go back again.

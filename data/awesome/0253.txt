We booked our room on Seattle SuperSaver's site, since our normal Seattle Hotel was booked solid. What a treat---and we may have a new favorite hotel in Seattle. Staff: Fabulous, friendly and Helpful! Room: Spacious, light, roomy, clean and very comfortable. Goldfish: The true delight of my daughter. The 5 pm reception in the Lobby: Warm, inviting--usually I hate those receptions where strangers all get together---but this was nice---light--not pretentious. Location: Perfect for exploring Seattle. We loved it and will definetly return!

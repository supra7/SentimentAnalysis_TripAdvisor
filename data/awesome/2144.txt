The location of this hotel was perfect for a spending the day enjoying the bayfront. After calling to check on rates and availablity I was even more impressed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were great from the first telephone, to helping us get where we needed to be and thru the check out process. The rooms were nice and cozy with the fireplaces yet very modern in furnishings. Would highly recommend staying here.

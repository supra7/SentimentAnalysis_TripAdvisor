Just returned from a week at Secrets Maroma and we miss it.Have stayed at all the Secrets properties in Riviera Maya and this is the palace.The staff at this hotel could not do enough for you.My wife and I were spoiled from the moment we arrived untill we were leaving.Loved it.Best beach on the coast,great food,even room service.Any problems are taken care of in a matter of minutes with a smile.This was our 8th trip to mexico and we finnaly found our home away from home.

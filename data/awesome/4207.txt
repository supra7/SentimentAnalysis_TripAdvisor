My wife and I went to Secrets Maroma for our 10-year anniversary. The goal was to relax and be lazy for 5-days. Overall the resort was outstanding. From the pool, ocean, restaurants and service we had an outstanding time. The pool and beach waiters/waitresses were great. We met a lot of really nice people and truly enjoyed everyday. Another great part of this experience was the mini bar and room service. If you don't like what is in the min bar call room service and request what you want and they will bring it. My only negative comment was one night a resort adjacent to ours was burning something so we woke up thinking our hotel was on fire.

Honestly, I do not know why anyone would rate this resort as a bad experience. They obviously are people who are never happy with anything. If you are looking for a place to honeymoon or get away, look no further! We went in July 2010 and loved every minute of it. They treat you like royalty. Food was GREAT, I really don't know why people complain about it. Staff and entertainment are amazing. We enjoyed meeting new people and hanging out by the pool bar with our favorite bartender, Javier!! The beach is wonderful with crystal-clear waters. We loved standing out in the water and watching fish swim by. Total relaxation with unlimited drinks and food. We are looking forward to going back for our 2nd anniversary. We miss you Secrets Maroma!

We stayed at The Roosevelt after an Alaskan cruise and were very pleased with the hotel. It has got to be one of the best locations in Seattle. 1/2 block from convention center, 6 blocks to Pike Place Market, shopping and restaurants all around. The hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. Rooms were clean and very large. I would stay here again without question.

My husband an I had a wonderful and great trip in this very nice hotel. We met some very nice couples, and we had some great fun together in our swimout room. Food is excellent and the beach is beautiful. No problem to find a calm place. I did topless and nobody cares about it. At the end I was not the only one! Evening programm ist great too, not to forget it's an adult only resort! Enjoy your stay, no kids and therefore let have fun alone or with others! We will come back in December with another couple again, hope to motivate other women or couples to get nude at the end.....was the best funny trip!!!!!

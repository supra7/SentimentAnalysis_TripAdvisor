We come to Seattle once each year, and every time, we stay at the Warwick Hotel. The service is always great, the rooms are clean (and recently updated) and the location is great - there is a great little grocery store right across the street, and shopping is just a few minute walk down the street. There is a pool/hot tub AND a fitness room, which is a combination that isn't seen too often within hotels. There is also a great restaurant - we got chance to have a great breakfast there with great service and delicious food. I would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a fair price, with great service and a good location close to shopping and restaurants.

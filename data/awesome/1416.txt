I stayed here in the Fall for a conference. The hotel was chosen for its "green" practices, which are commendable and worth a mention. Like most places, they still have a ways to go in that direction, but they have many practices that go beyond just low flow toilets and not changing the sheets and towells every day unless asked. Aside from that, they were one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in Seattle. I'm a government employee, and when we travel we almost always get the least desirable rooms as we pay the gov't rate. Mine was in the back of the building, close to both the elevator and the ice machine, overlooking the freeway and the city street, yet it was very quiet and very comfortable. The rooms are all set up suite style, and I must say the bed was as comfy as any I've slept in. Could I have found a way to get it in my suitcase, I might have been guilty of hotel theft. In addition, the hotel has a nice restaurant with a great view, and the food was very good and reasonably priced, with very nice wait staff. Staff at this hotel were outstanding, too, from the wait staff at the restaurant to the check-in staff to the doormen. Helpful, friendly, considerate, efficient, responsive. You can always tell a hotel that is good to work for; people seemed happy to be at their jobs and to really make an effort. Our conference facilities, too, were excellent. Even the food served at the conference was a cut above. I wasn't involved in setting it up, so I can't speak to how easy they were to work with, but if the flawless service and really delicious food (and I know we got the least expensive options, because that's a requirement) were any indications, if ever I need to set one of these things up in Seattle, they will be my first choice.

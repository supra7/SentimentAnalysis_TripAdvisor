Best Airport Hotel in Seattle by far - amazing how things vary from one Marriott to the next, but this one is streets ahead of the rest in making Platinum Elite members feel special and welcome. Checked in at 10pm - Key card already in folder and process too 30 seconds. Welcome note delivered on check in. phone call to room 5 mins after arrival to check that all in order. Great hotel very comfortable. Well done SEATAC MARRIOTT

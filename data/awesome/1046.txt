We had 3 in our party for a girls getaway. We arrived on Wednesday for a real treat. This hotel is truly amazing. The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. The rooms are spotless and the bellman Sen was so friendly and helpful. The room itself had 2 beds and 2 restrooms so we were able to get ready alot faster than with just one. This was a pleasant surprise. It is an easy walk to lots of shops and Pike Place market which is alot of fun. I cannot say enough about the service we received while we were there. They even had a free wine tasting on Wednesday evening and that was alot of fun. I would highly recommend the Mayflower Park to everyone

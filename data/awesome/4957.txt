My fiance and I went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our week long honeymoon. We had beautiful weather the whole time we were there and had a swim out preferred club room. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and if you walk to the right you won't find any other hotels. The service at the hotel was outstanding. The drinks were awesome as well as most of the food. We enjoyed the japanese and italian restaurants. Breakfast was amazing, hand made crepe and omelette stations were fantastic as well as all the bloody mary's, mimosas, and fruit you could eat. Don't forget to grab coffee at the coco cafe. We took a cab into Playa del Carmen for $20 and also did the jungle tour and went to xcaret. If I had that to do over I would go back to xehal instead. We were in an isolated area in the jungle and had an absolutely amazing vacation/honeymoon. We also had a great time at the spa with our couples massage.

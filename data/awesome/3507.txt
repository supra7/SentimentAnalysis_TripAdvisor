I am from Miami. I spent hours researching Montreal hotels before settling on the Crystal because it had a fireplace. It had that and so much more. The hotel itself was spectacular, the room ridiculously amazing, from the kitchen where I could cook small meals and make espresso, the giant soaking tub, the floor to ceiling windows, the fireplace, balcony, to small details like the turndown service with the next day's tempurature printed and the great toiletries. I could walk everywhere to great boutiques, pubs and restaurants, caught a hockey game across the street (and all of the players were staying at our hotel which made the elevator rides fun), had a guided tour pick me right up from the hotel, and was 2 blocks from the main train station. The rooftop jacuzzi was to die for, and i enjoyed a day at the spa which was great. Tip - join the Crystal Club (free) as I got free breakfast in my room every day (and on time) plus 15% off at the spa. The breakfast was so huge I saved parts of it to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch or snacks and sent my friend home with tons of croissants and danish each day. Everyone is so nice, from the front desk to valet to the lifeguard to the breakfast delivery guy and because it is a small hotel, they quickly and efficiently attend to every need. I have stayed at places like the Ritz Carlton, Beverly Hilton, and the Waldorf Astoria, and have never been so impressed, comfortable, or not wanting to leave a hotel like the Le Crystal.

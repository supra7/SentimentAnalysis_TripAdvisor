I stayed here for one night before flying out of SEA early the next morning. This hotel is absolutely huge! As an Hhonors gold member I was given a corner room on the Hhonors floor with a nice wraparound balcony and also a $10 cert for the restaurant/bar. Unfortunately i only spent about 10 hours in the hotel so didn't really get to enjoy the room much. It did have a nice size flat screen TV and a very comfy bed, also a couch/seating area to watch TV from. The airport shuttle is very convenient, they have a large school bus type shuttle to handle all the passengers they move to and from SEA. I think it leaves every 15 minutes all day long (24 hours). Internet is a small fee to use in your room, but you can come down to the lobby and use it for free so that is what I did. Also they have a small gift shop in case you need to pick up any last minute souveniers, necessities, or postcards. I used my $10 cert in the hotel bar for dinner and sampled a couple NW micro brews and had a very tasty sandwich. The meal was a bit on the pricey side, but the cert made it all work out for me. I paid around $155 using a AAA rate which got me under the gov't per diem allowance for this business trip, however if I was traveling for vacation I would probably hunt for something cheaper.

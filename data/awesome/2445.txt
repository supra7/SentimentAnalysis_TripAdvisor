We had a great experience - the staff was friendly and helpful, the location quite good. When we arrived we were a bit shocked by the $36 parking, so we just asked the attendant whether he could recommend any less expensive options, and he gave us printed instructions on how to get to the alternate parking, which is $22 and attached to the mezzanine level by a skybridge. Then, when we checked in (we'd purchased our room on Priceline for only $105 for a weeknight, so the value was great), there was no lineup. It was after our dinner out and 11:30pm so that probably accounted for the lack of lineup. The service was friendly and when I asked if they had any rooms with a king bed, she said that sadly those were all spoken for, but they did have a "parlor rooom" on the 45th floor with views over the city and harbour. Amazing views. Great stay, Comfortable bed, and the room we were given was twice the size of a regular room. So nice that she thought of it; by 11:30pm it isn't likely that anyone else is going to buy it, so she made us happy! I would be very pleased if Priceline or Hotwire selected the Westin for me again, and if I were a business traveler I would be very happy with it.

My wife and I stayed here for our 1 year anniversary in early October. We stayed at Sandals in Antigua for our honeymoon, and even w/ the Butler service we had at Sandals, we preferred our stay at Secrets Maroma! The food was excellent every meal, everyone we encountered were SUPER friendly...couldn't ask for more. Well the one "complaint" we had about our stay was that when we stayed at Sandals we had one of the private "homes" with a little more room and a private pool. Here at Secrets it was just one hotel room attached to the swim out pool. I say "complaint" in that this was the only thing that wasn't as nice as the Sandals. However, since this wasn't our honeymoon we were out and about doing more during the day so it was a very minimal "complaint". One thing I think gets overlooked is comfort outside of your hotel room. We LOVED the fact that the lobby was enclosed and air conditioned as well as all the restaurants we visited. It was a nice break from the warmer days. I'm also not sure about overall size of the resort here at Secrets vs Sandals, but we loved that everything was just a short walk away and there were always plenty of bathrooms, bars, and snack spots very close all day. I could go on and on, but would be happy to answer any specific questions. If we go back to this area, Secrets will DEFINITELY be on our list of places to stay at.

Stayed in a king suite on Halloween. Wonderful room and view but the bathroom was TINY. Not a great use of space. Was double charged for items from mini bar, which we noticed after we already had been given our reciept upon checkout....seemed a little odd to me. Parking was a little steep...$35 a night.

My wife and I just returned from a most enjoyable Seattle extended weekend. Acting on a recommendation from a friend, we booked our stay at the Inn at the Market (IATM). The name couldn't be more appropriate as it is literally steps to Pike Place Market. IATM now became home base for the next four days of sight seeing, economy stimulating, and drinking coffee. The staff was professional and courteous throughout or stay. We found the Inn to be comfortable and enjoyed the view from the deck on that rare Seattle warm spring day. Exemplary service was offered, unsolicited.I had an ankle injury and while my wife was getting ice, a Bell staff offered to pick-up some homeopathic medication. It was delivered to our room shortly thereafter. This is WOW Service! We were also offered and driven to nearby restaurants. For visiting the city of Seattle, this is an ideal location. Walking distance to virtually all points of interest. Public transport is nearby too. The walking is highly recommended, as the excellent eateries are abundant.

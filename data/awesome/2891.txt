The hotel is 2 blocks from Benaroya Hall. The rooms are spacious, modern, and welcoming. The lobby is well designed and easy to use for meetings, either in the lounge or restaurant. The service and staff are far above average in both the positive disposition with which they serve their customer, and the seemingly effortless perfection of the entire experience at any time of day or night.

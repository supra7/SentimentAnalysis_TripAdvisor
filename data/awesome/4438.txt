We were greeted with a glass of champagne and a hot towel. The room was something else...spacious, well decorated and very relaxing. The room came equiped with all the usual stuff but some things I particulatly liked were the jacuzzi bath, ipod dock and giant shower. The hotel has pretty much everything you could need pools, beach, spa etc. The beach is beautiful and kept very clean plus the waitors are very attentive and always notice when your drink is low so don't worry about having to march all the way to the bar from the beach. The beach can be quite windy which helps if the weather is super hot but if you prefer the heat I'd stay around the pool. There was always enough loungers so this is not one of those resorts where you have to get up at 6am to put your towel out. As for food the breakfast buffet will blow your mind. I guess americans are use to these huge breakfasts but as european I was not prepared for the selection and the amount of food...be warned you will put on a stone. For lunch you can go to one of the restaurants or try one of the grills either by the pool or the beach. In general the restaurants are very good in particular the japanese. With 7 you will never be stuck for somewhere to go plus you don't have to reserve a table. Throughout the day and night there is lots of stuff on. In the morning you can avail of yoga, aqua aerobics, body sculpting and in the afternoon they do things like tequila tasting, wine tasting, sushi making etc. Honestly this is the best holiday I have ever had. This is not your usual 'all-inclusive' resort where they serve up tonnes of poor quality food and watered down drinks. In addition the staff are really nice and are always willing to chat. I would return

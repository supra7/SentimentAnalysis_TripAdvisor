Just returned on Monday from 10 days of bliss at Secrets Maroma Beach. What a fantastic place it is...Yes it is a pricier resort, but in many ways it is worth the extra dime. If you want to step it up a notch, this is the place. The grounds are amazing as the landscaping and natural beauty within the complex is the best I have seen. We upgraded our room to and Ocean Front Swim Out Suite. The room was massive and very well furnished. The upgrade was $180 per night, but very worthwhile for a 10 day stay. Essentially we had a private suite right on the beach with our own private pool every day. As the other bottom floor rooms were mostly unoccupied, we felt as if we had this beachfront area all to ourselves. It was great! The food at the restaurants was fine, as good as other 5 star all-inclusives we've stayed at. The beach is indeed one of the nicest we've seen. Great for walking for 3km in either direction as well. Honorable mention goes to the staff at this resort. We were waited on and doted on at every turn. Anything we asked for was made available (within reason of course). The staff are the friendliest and most service oriented I have ever seen. We've been travelling to All-Inclusives in the Mayan Riviera and Cancun for over 10 years, and this resort was our best experience to date.

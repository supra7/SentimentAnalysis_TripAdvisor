We wanted to visit Seattle to see the Picasso Exhibition which is currently on show at the Seattle Art Museum. While checking different hotels on line, we found that the "inn at the Market" had a great offer which included tickets to the show plus complimentary valet parking until 5pm the following day. Since we drove down from Vancouver, BC for this visit, this arrangement was perfect for us. When we had made our reservations, we had requested a room with 2 beds. When we walked into our room, no: 419, we found that we had a corner room, possibly the best room in the hotel with large floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Public Market sign at Pike's Place and fabulous views of the sea and all the ferry traffic. The room was very quiet, very spacious and exquisitely furnished with the most tasteful art and decor. On top of all that, there are two excellent restaurants in the hotel, the Campagne and Bacca plus you are in the heart of the marketplace.

We stayed at the Warwick for three nights about two years ago and loved it. We had traveled by Amtrak from Sacramento and then took the Clipper to Victoria for a couple of days. It was a magical vacation...all public transportation and walking to our destinations. Our room had one whole wall of windows that faced the Space Needle. (There was a sliding door that opened onto the balcony...weird) The room was small, but so cozy. The staff was wonderful. They have 24 hour shuttle service and we enjoyed talking with the drivers. We had dinner one night and it was great, the waitress had a strong French accent (something we don't hear often in CA) Beautiful food presentation, We easily walked to the Market. The Mall was great, with Monorail stop so convenient. Street entertainers were wonderful,and we were delighted to find real stores open on Sunday. We bought bento (box) lunches at the sandwich shop near the hotel and took them on the train, It was the best vacation ever..so glad that my daughter told us to stay at the Warwick. later I remembered that I had stayed at a Warwick hotel in Denver and enjoyed that too.

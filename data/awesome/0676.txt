If you're ever in Seattle, you can't go past Inn At The Market. Ideally located next to the historic and vibrant Pike Place Market and within easy walking distance to the centre of the city, it's a beautiful boutique hotel. I stayed there with my brother for four nights and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more efficient. I had a large package delivered to the hotel, which they kindly held for me, and they provided me with a free razor after I realised I'd forgotten mine. Our room was spotless and comfortable. Great value for money all-round.

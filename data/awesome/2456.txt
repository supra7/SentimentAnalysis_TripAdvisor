We stayed one night before an Alaskan cruise ten days ago and one night following the cruise, which was last night. We booked on Priceline and were cautiously optimistic after reading mixed reviews here that it would at least be satisfactory. As it turned out, the hotel was one of the highlights of the Seattle part of the visit. We found the lobby was well appointed with complimentary wireless internet (in the lobby only), a business center with complimentary printing of boarding passes and complimentary Starbucks coffee in the lobby from 4am to 6am for all of us east coast folks who are still operating on EST. Check in and out was easy and quick. We had a room on the 12th floor of the North Tower the first night and the 34th floor of the North Tower the second night with a view towards Westlake Center. The room was spotless with large soft towels, a VERY comfortable bed and pillows and a 42" flat screen TV. The shower heads were a little low and I'm not tall, but the water was hot and plentiful with decent pressure. The room was absolutely silent, probably the quietest hotel room I have stayed in. It was an easy walk to Pike Place Market (although there are a few hills which might be difficult if you have mobility problems) with lots of restaurants, shops and such close by. The light rail to and from Seatac stops at Westlake Center and the nearest entrance to that station is one block away or about 300 yards. You can also ride the monorail from there to the Space Needle area. Don't miss Top Pot Doughnuts, which is just two blocks north! It looked like parking and room service were typically expensive for a downtown hotel, but we didn't use either so it wasn't an issue for us. There is also a drug store right across the street and lots of shopping the next block over (Macys, Nordstroms, and a mall).

Just came back from the Secrets Maroma Resort. The resort was better than was described to me. We were very happy with the place. The check-in was quick and easy and things just got better from there. The staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful. We couldn't have asked for better. The food was fantastic, we have eaten at many places around the world and were more than happy with the food on site here. Not sure about other reviews that complained about the food? Was very happy with the number of choices and the times that food was available. The rooms were very nice and clean, my only complaint was that the cleaning people always seemed to come in the late afternoon just as we were coming back to our room. Just a minor thing though. Was also very happy that there were no children, teenagers or spring breakers at the resort. Was very relaxed and quiet, great for relaxation!!!!! You can book trips/tours on site at the hotel at a couple of different places both of them said they were cheaper at the other but we had already books excursions and didn't bother to compare, so you may want to check into that before you plan an excursion...do not do it at the airport!!! The staff here was great and was able to answer and help with all of our questions. I will definately go back here and have recommended it to my friends. The wireless internet service and not too great in the rooms, faded in and out a lot. We had travel arrangement from the airport but were wrangled into the timeshare thing when we got off the plane by a guy who said he represented the company were had arrangements with, watch out for these people they will say anything to reel you in just before you leave the airport exit.

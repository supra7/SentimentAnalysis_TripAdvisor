We went to Secrets Maroma to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Having never been to a 5 star resort or an all-inclusive resort we were really not sure what to expect. In my wildest dreams I could not have imagined a more beautiful and friendly resort, We stayed in building 23 and our swim out suite was amazing. The concierge in our building Roger Arroyo was so helpful with every last detail. The food at the resort was so delicious. The entertainment staff was so much fun and the shows were a lot of fun. One of the highlights of our trip was the Spa at Secrets. The Moon and Stars massage is so absolutely amazing and definitely worth the money. The fiesta for Mexican Independence Day was truly a night we will remember for a long time. WHAT A PARTY!!!!!!! With the resort being in such a spectacular location it is clear why this place ranks as one of the most romantic spots in the world. However what truly makes this resort the shining star that it is are the PEOPLE @ Secrets Maroma. From the welcome home greeting when you arrive to the HOLA and smile from everyone you see this special place makes you feel so comfortable and relaxed words can not describe the amazing feeling you get there. Having to say goodbye was tough but knowing WE WILL BE BACK made it a little less painful.

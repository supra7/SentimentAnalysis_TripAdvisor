After my bad experience at the Edgewater in Seattle I was still a bit shock and was hopping to have a better welcome to this hotel I arrive around 6 30 PM after a whole day meeting and ready to Leave to San Francisco early morning as soon as I get in I was treated as royalty, The Check in a breeze and the wonderful ladys at the Front desk could not make me more welcome, They ask me how was my trip so far and I explain briefly how I was hurt by the rude service I received at the Edgewater the night before She told me let me I was on the 9 Floor but she offer me the 11 floor there was a cocktail reception in the lobby to all guest. I was so Exhausted I just decide to get to the Room and get ready for Dinner When I open the Door She add upgrade me to the best suite ever, huge living room fire place, fantastic view on Seattle Convention Center working studio, Crazy Bathroom with Jacuzzi... Great bed with Baldaquin other fire place flat TV and all I just get back down to Thank-her for the fantastic upgrade. I try to get to the Downtown core to buy her a great box of Chocolate but Seattle is not very alive on a monday night in the Downtown core I did not find any restaurant thickeling my fancy so I get back to the Hotel where I get to the Italian theme restaurant The service was so outstanding the foods more then acceptable, beet salad on Goat cheese, lambs and chocolate dessert, I send two of the chocolate dessert to the front desk as a Thank-You note There is no Coffee make in the room but a coffee & tea station is instal in the lobby in the morning I order a city car to get to the Airport and this was so easy Thank-You to all at the Vintage hotel to make my stay so wonderful

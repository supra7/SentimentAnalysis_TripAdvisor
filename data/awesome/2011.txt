Highly recommend this Hotel/Lodge. It is important to pay extra for the waterfront view. There is the feeling of being on a cruise ship without the motion sickness. Room service was great. The fireplace in the room was really nice. We were visiting in the winter and loved looking at the snowcapped mountains surrounding the water, the sea life playing outside our windows and the lights and sounds of ships and ferries made for a delightful get a way. We suggest visiting City Church if time permits.

one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in. the room was very comfortable and spacious. i had a corner room so i had a beautiful view of seattle through large windows. i got a terrific deal through Hotwire.com so i paid about 30% less than the list price for my room. the room was extremely clean. i have serious allergies to dust, so i always notice if the pillows or blanket have that thin layer of dust on them--this was pristine. the front desk staff were helpful and polite--exactly as they should be but so often you get lousy service that i'm impressed when i get good service. the one misstep was when a woman at the front desk told me there was usually a cab waiting outside the hotel. it took me 20 minutes to hail a cab in the pouring rain, and there wasn't one out in front of the hotel during the 2 days of my stay. better to call and reserve a cab ahead of time when it's raining! overall i was very happy with the crowne plaza and i hope i get to stay there again! the proximity to all things downtown was enormously important.

We stayed in the Lindemanns in August this summer and enjoyed the most amazing service and quality we had in a hotel for some time! The staff are amazingly friendly, attentive, but not in your face. Also the rooms are super, contemporary and clean, amazing walk in showers. We had a standard room for start but as we had booked the business special package we asked for an upgrade after the first night and were put into a slightly larger room with an even more spacious bathroom with walk in shower. Great service, thanks. Also, the hotel is conveniently located for both visits to the old West part of Berlin as well as easy connections to the new Mitte and Kreuzberg. The hotel is not in a super trendy area but close walking distance to Schoeneberg as well as a short bus ride to Potsdamer Platz. Overall, I would definitely stay there again, the price is good, affordable for this type of quality hotel, so I m definitely coming back. Also, the breakfast was amazing, good range of different types of food, and again, the lovely hotel staff were at help throughout and couldnt be any better!

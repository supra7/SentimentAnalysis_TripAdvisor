The Sorrento Hotel offered us superb hospitality by providing forgotten items with a smile. They allowed our group to enjoy group discussions near their fireplace, in their restaurant and bar late into the night. The Penthouse was a rockin' time and their patio rooftop view was absolutely worth seeing. What an experience! We'll definitely make our way back to The Sorrento Hotel next time we're in Seattle.

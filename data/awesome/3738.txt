If you're thinking about here for your honeymoon or any kind of holiday at all, go for it. It is a spectacular property. The resort is less than 30 mins from Cancun airport, but once inside you may as well be on an enchanted Caribbean island. Wonderful pool with four poster beds surrounding it. A few footsteps to the white sandy beach with crystal clear water sea. The huge beds in the very spacious rooms are very, very comfortable and there's 24hr room service, with a decent menu. It's all-inclusive, so you can partake in any of the 7 different restaurants (all excellent) as much as you like - the food is top class. The staff are really well-drilled and fall over themselves to make your stay as pleasurable as possible. Their attention to detail and going the extra mile truly is impressive. There are even coatimundi and iguanas hanging around the site. This place is certainly worth it's number one status. Go there, you won't want to leave.

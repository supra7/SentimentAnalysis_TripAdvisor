My family and I stayed in the Sorrento Hotel for a long weekend while visiting Seattle. We booked through an online booking site and were initially worried about the reception we would receive but all of our concerns quickly disappeared. The staff at the hotel were outstanding in every way. They consistently excelled in their service and their attention to any needs we may have had. The complimentary car is a fabulous amenity and was greatly utilized and appreciated during our stay. We stayed in one of the suites and found the room to be perfect for our needs as we had 3 adults and a toddler. Our suite had 2 queen beds and a living room area with a pull out couch and a second standard couch. The living room had a large flat screen tv and the bedroom area had a smaller flat screen tv. The hotel is very nice in and of itself but the staff is really what makes this place shine. I cant recommend it enough and would definitely stay there again.

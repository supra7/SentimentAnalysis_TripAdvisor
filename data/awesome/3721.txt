My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon in September 2011. The activities staff was amazing (especially Miguel!), the shows were actually very entertaining, and the service was great. Our room was very large and well-appointed, and the housekeeping staff did a great job keeping us stocked and clean. The food was very good for an all-inclusive, and the drinks were great. Take lots of dollar bills to tip...its not mandatory, but you'll be remembered for your generosity and rewarded with even better service. There is a variety of wildlife that you may encounter (iguanas, anoles, snakes, coatis, stray dogs) but we never felt threatened by any of it and we never had a problem in our room with any. One warning: BRING LOTS OF BUG SPRAY...the mosquitoes can be vicious outside at night. The staff has bug repellent wipes that they can give you, but we found it easier just to spray down before leaving the room. We hope to go back someday in the not-so-distant future!

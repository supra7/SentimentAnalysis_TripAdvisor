We were a little bummed at first that they overbooked our ocean view room but they upgraded us for free to a swim-out. Most ocean view rooms were blocked by the greenery anyway so we didn't mind too much. There was nothing that we didn't like about the stay. We stayed for 7 nights and loved every minute of it. The drinks came fast and often, and the food was outstanding. The ribs at the Barefoot Grill were out of this world. The staff really go out of their way to make you feel at home and have the best vacation experience ever. Many activities to do onsite as well. Hope to be able to return again soon.

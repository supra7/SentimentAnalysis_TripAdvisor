This is a great airport hotel. Very friendly staff, lovely lobby, nice pool/spa area, clean and well stocked exercise rooms. It was a great location for us as we college shopped in both downtown Seattle and Tacoma. Only downside was the parking fee. Our room looked out onto a nicely landscaped garden area (yes, there are those rooms with a street view). Travelers without a car can get to downtown Seattle by light rail (a station is right by the hotel) and there are restaurants within walking distance. If you have a car, there is great shopping and eating within a 10 minute drive. It also has a business center so we could print out boarding passes.

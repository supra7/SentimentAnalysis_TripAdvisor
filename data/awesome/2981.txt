-Tiny rooms that are well thought out. -Excellent and unusual amenities -Aveda products and plush towels -Feather pillows, down duvets, funky woollen blankets -Each room is individual - no ugly floral print bed spreads or boring mass produced pictures. -Love that an art catalogue is included with the amenities -Pillow menu and Spirituality menu (choose your religious reading materials) are quirky but appreciated

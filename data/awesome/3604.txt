wowee zowee, yes i have made several subsequent stays to destiny palms, and every thing that impressed me on my first visit still applies. Its the best value in the Disney area bar none. Chuck, the manager, is eager to please and has a wealth of knowledge to get the best of Orlando and its attractions, its like having your own private concierge. The entire staff, ammenities, cleanliness, safety, and value will keep me coming back.

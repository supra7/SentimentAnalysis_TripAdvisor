This resort met and exceeded all of our expectations! It was me and my husbands honeymoon, and first time in Mexico. I researched for the right resort for months before our wedding and I came across the Secrets properties. I used people's reviews here on TripAdvisor to help guide me to the right resort. This resort has so many great reviews, and they are ALL true! Everything was spectacular, from the rooms, to the beach, food, service, kindness of employees, drinks, landscaping, ambiance, etc. Everything was amazing and we will be returning to Secrets properties again. :) I HIGHLY recommend this property to anyone who wants a relaxing and beautiful time in Mexico. We couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon. Thank you Secrets!

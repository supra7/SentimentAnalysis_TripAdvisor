Stayed for 5 nights in this hotel having booked it for our city break to Seattle after having read the good reviews on Tripadvisor. The reviews hardly did the hotel justice which was just about perfect in every way. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean, the view from the hotel deck over the Puget Sound was just breathtaking and the staff could not have been of more help. However the best bit about the hotel was its location "in the Market". It was ideally placed for Pike Place Market, shopping, various other attractions and a whole host of excellent restaurants. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again if we ever return to Seattle

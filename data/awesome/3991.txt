Yes the beach is amazing The room had problems with the AC but the staff goes out of there way to accoodate so they changed our room inmedietley. Food is A for me, i know usually all iinclusives have horrible food but this resort is the exception, and not only that the waiters go out of there way to accomodate your taste, at the french restaurant they even prepared a pastry I was craving. PLEASE give the staff a tip. They belong to a union, ab the tips that are "included" on our bill does not make its way to the hard working people,because the union leaders get the money . understan the waiters and bartenders make only 160 dlls a month. And it is so sad to see people are not even willing to tip 1euro or 1 dollar, i know in europe it is not the custom to tip, but our mexican workers are being over worked for a miserable salary. That is embarassing you would think the resort could pay the staff at least double of what they pay....SO SHAMEFUL. Please tip.

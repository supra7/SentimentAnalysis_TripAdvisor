The hotel was not cheap but it was well worth the money. The room was spectacular (huge bathroom with rain shower, separate bedroom) and full of things that make a stay top quality: Nespresso machine, ipod docking station, two TVs, a microwave, larger than normal fridge, etc. The location to restaurants and entertainment was fantastic and the walk to the old part of the city very pleasant. The staff was very helpful and friendly.

We honeymooned in Maroma in February this year.... This Hotel is absolutely Amazing, We arrived after travelling 12 hours from Dublin to an amazing welcome, with refreshments from the Staff.. As it was 10pm when we arrived it was great to have been met with such great Attention.... Staff were attentive and couldnt do enough for you,food was excellent with a great variety to suit everyone... We stayed in a Swim Out Room which was Brilliant, with a great feeling of Privacy. The Entertainment staff keep you going all day and brilliant Shows at night. It was such a great start to our Honeymoon, we loved every minute of it and will definitely go back for our Anniversary!!!!!

I found University Inn by chance. I was driving cross country and ended in Seattle for a cup of coffee because at that time, both me and my girlfriend had no idea what Seattle had to offer. With no expectations of the area, we were greeted by sunny weather and beautiful scenery as we drove into Seattle through I-90. We wondered through the downtown area and had no idea where to stay for the night. After driving by Queen Anne, and Fremont area, we ended up in the U-Dub district. (University of Washington) and at the door steps of University Inn. The front desk was super helpful and friendly, it was a great welcome as we've been driving for many hours before. We got our keys very quickly and had parking on site too. So it was very convenient for everything. The rooms were very comfortable and clean, decor was nice and well done. The neighborhood around the area was great because of the U of W students. Lots of different restaurants to try and not expensive at all. I had since lived in Seattle and had visitors to the area and I always recommend University Inn to everyone. Won't be disappointed.

Stayed at the Edgewater 11/29-11/30//11 and was really impressed. I had a water facing room and really enjoyed the views while sitting by a cozy fire. What a wonderful way to enjoy Seattle in November! I also had a chance to enjoy their "67" restaurant. The food was wonderful and the presentation was outstanding. The combination of truly excellent food and stunning setting was really on another level -- even for Seattle. I travel all over for business and I must say I haven't been this pleasantly surprised in years with a property. Nicely done.

Room was very clean, quiet and bed was comfortable. Bedding was very nice and the bathroom had plenty of towels. The shower worked with great water pressure and consistent hot water with an easy to operate temp. adjustment. Big TV screen, comfy chair, good AC control and a window that opened. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I am very impressed with this 3 star hotel having stayed at the other 3 1/2 star hotels in the area. This hotel is much nicer than the others. One other thing that is very important to me-the reading light was bright enough to read quite a rarity.

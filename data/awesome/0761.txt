My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The location is great - so close to all the shopping areas and literally next door to Pike's Market. Lots of great restaurants in the area and the staff is very helpful at recommending them. Our room overlooked the street below but wasn't noisy at all. There is plenty of space in the rooms for luggage and the bathroom is big and bright. Excellent mattress as well. We can't wait to go back.

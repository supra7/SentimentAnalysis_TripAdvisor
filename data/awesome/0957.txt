Came up from Oregon to attend an event at Key Arena and everything here was just top notch. Friendly staff, comfortable cozy rooms and an amazing location. I came up with two of my best friends and we all stayed in the Marqueen Double Queen room. The two queen's were so comfortable and I didn't hear any complaints about the twin pullout. Loved my time here and was sad to go! Definitely goto Peso's across the street for some great food!

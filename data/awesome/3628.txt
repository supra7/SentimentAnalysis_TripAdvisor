Rooms were small but had one of the comfiest bed I've ever slept on. Excellent location, next to macdonalds, walgreens and short drive to super target and restaurants. Less than 10 mins away from the entrance of walt disney world and only 15 mins drive to downtown disney. All the staff were friendly and helpful. One downside is that breakfast is always busy, may need to extend breakfast hours. Apart from that excellent stay.

Berlin is certainly the place to be. And when you're there, this is a great option. Excellent location, close to the subway and with very easy access to everywhere! Lots of good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Everything is new, rooms have good sizes and are beautifully designed. Staff is also very kind and helpful.

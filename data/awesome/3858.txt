We stayed there for eight nights and it was truly an unbelievable experience. The food was wonderful and service was over the top. Ask for Kevin, the pool concierge...He was outstanding and loves him job. Alberto our room concierge never failed to reach out to us. Victor the bellman never forgot our name and went out of his way to greet us whenever he saw us. The resort did a great job with the wedding we attended on the beach. The only negative is stay away from the sales pitch for their Vacation Club unless you want to lose 4+ hours of your vacation when it is pitched as a 90 minute presentation with no pressure. It was a horrible experience with tremendous pressure. The sales lady we had even took the People Magazine out of the Preferred Club and put it in her purse while telling us all the amenities the Preferred level offers. The rooms to tour were not ready and we had to wait an additional 30 minutes. The promotional brochures were poorly copied on a copy machine. They would not let us have time to think about it for a couple of days. If you are interested, stick it out and you will get a great deal as they kept coming down on the original price and adding more things to the deal. We talked to a couple that bought it for only about 10% of what it was originally pitched to them. I think if we did stay longer we would have gotten a lot more off but four hours was enough of losing sun time. We'll definently go back but not take the sales presentation.

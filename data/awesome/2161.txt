Liked the most: Location, Price-line price, Bathrooms, Bed Liked the least: $40 a night valet parking, Somewhat noisy room with heat/fireplace control that was somewhat confusing for some family members to operate. Nice staff. Paid additional $15 a night to upgrade room to two double beds on city side but that...along with the $40 a night parking was all was factored in before I bid on rooms using price-line...so we were satisfied with our stay. Victoria Clipper pier yards away made it convenient for a day trip to Victoria, British Columbia. I would stay there again.

This is a place which is closer to paradise than any other place I have been in my life. Not only the location, at the hearth of the Maya World and in one of the most beautifull beaches on earth. But also the human factor: the most service conscious team I have ever experienced, always available, allways concerned for your wellbeing, allways ready to serve, very professional and smiling. The service package with all included is wonderful, you just have to ask and your desires are immediately fulfilled. I came here with my wife to celebrate 33 years of happy marriage, and afterwards I can say we could hardly imagine other place where we had enjoyed that much. Thank You very much!

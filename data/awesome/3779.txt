I never go on warm weather vacations, haven't been to an all-inclusive resort in 15 years, but I absolutely loved our trip to Secrets Maroma. The rooms were great, the food was great, the pools and beach were great, nothing to complain about at all. I really enjoyed the entertainment and the staff were unbelievably nice and helpful. I will definitely return to this resort and recommend it to my friends.

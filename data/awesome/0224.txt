We got a very good deal on staying here through a site like Priceline and were really happy with the place. Such great service from the start and right throughout our 2 night 3 day stay there. The staff even wrote down bus directions for us to get to Alderwood Mall etc. The room and bathroom was clean and comfortable and really felt like luxury. Location was perfect. Just a short walk to everything Seattle has to offer... the only qualm we had with the place is room service. Our breakfast was late and pretty much cold when it arrived. They did, however, call to let us know if would be late and that there had been a problem in the kitchen.

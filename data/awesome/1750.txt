The exterior of the hotel does not look too attractive, but true to other reviews, the rooms are very nice. Nice comfortable rooms, comfortable beds, and very helpful staff. Staff were friendly. When I called the front desk to ask for information, they offered good and friendly advice. And price is very good. The hotel is located on the other side of the road of Westin, so I do feel assured it is a safe area.

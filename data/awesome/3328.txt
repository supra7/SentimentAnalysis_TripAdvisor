Wow! what a suprise. We stayed at the this property for one night (July 3) with my wife and two children (4 and 18 months). Check in was faster than I have ever experienced and had a newly renovated room on the 7th floor overlooking the airport (the parking garage actually). Room was larger than I expected (two double beds) and had plenty of room for the porta crib. The bellmen were very helpful with bags and even set the crib up for us. My Son and I went swimming and a had a great time. The beds were super comfortable and we slept well (very quiet). The hotel was not busy (very slow) but I don't think that would change if it was busy. Check out was very efficient. The shuttle comes every 15 minutes, and is less than five minutes from the airport. We will definatly stay here again if we have an early AM flight. Great job on this property Marriott. I'm a big fan.

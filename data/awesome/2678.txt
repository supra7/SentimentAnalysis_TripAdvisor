Great hotel that is a bit away from the noise of downtown seattle. We stayed in a queen, queen deluxe room which was perfect for our family of 3. There was a sofa bed in the room so we all had a bed. The bathroom was rather small, but okay for us. Clean, comfortable , quiet room overlooking some trees . The weather was wonderful and our windows opened which was very nice to have. Beds were extra comfortable. They had coffee in the morning and a wine tasting in the evening which was really nice. The staff directed us to a really good steak house nearby. We walked down to the harbor area and enjoyed every minute. It is a pet friendly hotel (so many are) and they put us on the upper floor as it was a "no pet" room. Room was WONDERFUL and everyone helpful and friendly. We had breakfast in their restaurant food and the atmosphere was very, very nice.Remember most all hotels charge to park downtown. Seattle is a great city and we will be back to stay at this hotel.

My husband and I visited Secrets Maroma Beach last week for our 10th anniversary. What an unbelievable time we had. The resort was impeccable. The staff was amazing. Anytime you requested something they would reply with, "It would be my pleasure." I really believe that. They were so happy to help you with anything. We received some special treatment being there for anniversary, discounts at the spa, champagne breakfast, etc. Our personal concierge, Carlos, was wonderful, as were the ladies at Talisman Jewelry. The food was high-class and delicious. The beach and pool are were both beautiful. I think we will make this our annual anniversary tradition! We can't wait to go back!

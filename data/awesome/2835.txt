This is a high end property with a minimalist design. The front desk and other staff were all efficient, professional and very helpful without any attitude. The elevator required your room key to go to your floor and since I was with my daughter I appreciated this security feature. The room was very basic without allot of storage space. They had an outlet strip and multiple outlets, I Pod. docking station and a plasma TV. I could not hear any city noise but we were on the fifth floor. The toilet was very short and the sink was small almost like a child's bathroom. The shower was great with a larger shower head but the hardware was difficult to use and seemed cheap.The toiletries had a nice clean scent. The beds were comfortable with feather beds and the linens were wonderful. This whole property was very clean and had a calming vibe to it.The front of the hotel was quite ugly but the valet parking was at the side and that entrance looked better.The location was fabulous and close to everything downtown.

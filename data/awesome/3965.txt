My wife and I went on our honeymoon at this place in early April of 2011. It was a great experience. The concierge and the staff were working to serve you and make sure that you were all taken care of. One day the concierge went out of his way to go buy my wife and I some darker beers that we had talked about with him that weren't served at the resort. It made us feel special and we really appreciated that. We stayed in the ocean front suite on the 3rd floor. Greeted by champagne, fruit, chocolates, and rose petals, it was a very warm welcome to our stay. We ordered room service every morning for breakfast and ate on the balcony staring at the ocean! It was magnificent! We then would go down to the beach and grab a couple of lounge chairs and soak up the sun. The staff working the beach was really friendly and responsive. The beach was a beautiful, white sand beach that didn't have a ton of foot traffic so you could really relax and unwind. Ate night the restaurants were all good, nothing too special, but tasty none-the-less. The entertainment at night was awesome, but we wish we went to more of the shows they offered during our stay. Overall, this place was amazing and we are both wanting to go back soon. We constantly are going back to it in our heads because it was so blissful!

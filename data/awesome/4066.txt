My wife & I were part of a Company trip & the resort was absolutely AWESOME!! We had a wonderful time. The Secrets employees went out of their way to make sure all of us had the best experience possible!! And we did!! The only negative was most of the Restaurants required the men to have long pants to be able to make a reservation which, of course, I didn't bring any. So we were unable to eat in some of the Restaurants that we wanted to. I wish we were told before we got there that they had a dress code. However, the other Restaurants were top quality, so I can't complain too much!!

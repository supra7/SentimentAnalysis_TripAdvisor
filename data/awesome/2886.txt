Once again the W has outdone itself. From the blush products in the bathroom to the amazing bartender! We stayed in a corner suite facing the water. I like the corner rooms best because the windows wrap all around. The room and bathroom are very spacious. The bed was so comfortable! I didn't want to leave. Service throughout the hotel was purely excellent most notably the bartender who turned me on to my new favorite vodka. He also gave us excellent advise on nightlife spots to hit later that evening. The only complaint was the parking. It's a little tricky getting in the garage and the valet took awhile to get our car back. But really a perfect hotel to stay at while in Seattle.

I stayed in room #119 at Travelodge in Seattle Washington near the University of Washington. The room was clean. I inspected it for cleanliness before I brought my luggage into the room. I even pulled back the sheets and inspected the mattress edges. It was perfectly clean and there were no odors. I have stayed at another popular hotel near the University several times and because their prices went up and I am on a budet, I tried this one. This room had a refrigerator and a microwave which I had to supply my own at the other more expensive hotel. The lower cost was reflected in the more trimmed down breakfast bar, which I did not care about. No one bothered me at all. I did not opt to have my room cleaned during my stay but each morning the cleaning staff was on hand and happy to give me fresh towels or anything I needed for my room. It felt safe. I never had the feeling of being afraid during my visit there. If you stay in the winter I would advise bringing an extra blanket for the bed or use the heater in the room. It was a little loud, but it also served as a good "white noise" machine. Every hotel I have ever stayed in has hallway noise of doors opening and closing so this would drown that all out. Overall I felt that it was a good value for the money.

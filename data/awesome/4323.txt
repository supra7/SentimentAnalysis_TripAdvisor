First time staying here in Mexico. We stayed in a Secrets in Punta Cana, and Mexico was way better. We had a great time. Our room was beautiful and very clean, the view outside was incredible. The staff was very friendly and helpful in every way. The food was delicious. The entertainment staff was awesome too, we had alot of fun with them. There was so much to do. We went on two excursions and the transportation was excellent. The Spa was beautiful and very relaxing. The only disappointment was while taking a walk on the beach, there was tons of garbage all over, but that has nothing to do with the Resort. Just a couple of suggestions Staying on the fourth floor is a must if you want a incredible view and no noise. make sure you reserve a night in the Asian restaurant cause it books up fast and its the best restaurant. FYI if you bring a lap top computer they charge you $15.00 a day.

This hotel was a pleasant surprise for a "night before travel" stay. The front desk was helpful, even though they were busy. The room was clean, spacious, and the beds were extremely comfortable. The continental breakfast was the best that I have ever had in a hotel. There was a kind person continually cleaning and refilling the available items. They had the fixing for a sausage and egg biscuit, as well as standard items like English muffins, bagels, yogurt and cereal. The coffee was surprisingly good (not even Starbucks!). The price for all of this was less than you would pay for a Marriott or Embassy, but honestly, those hotels have nothing on this Hampton. If all Hamptons were like this, Hilton would have a great alternative to their more expensive hotels.

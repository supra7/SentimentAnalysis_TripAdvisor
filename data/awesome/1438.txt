This is a great location downtown for the price. We stayed here pre-cruise. Alamo rental car in the hotel made return very convenient. Easy walk to Pikes Market. Rooms were clean & beds comfortable. We did have one problem about 10 pm a drunk man in only his underwear holding a belt tried to enter our room! Hotel Security came & took care of him. Felt very safe in this hotel traveling with sister's & 2 yr old. Bellman very helpful with transportation to pier 91.

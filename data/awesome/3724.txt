Over the years we have frequented The Royal Hideaway (twice) in Playcar and then Secrets Capri (four times). This was our first stay at Secrets Maroma Beach and it was a slight cut above RH and Capri. The resort is nicely laid out and just the right size to be comfortably spacious yet easy to get around to restaurants, pool, beach, various activities, etc. The entire staff is friendly and engaging. Particularly the Activities and Entertainment staff. The food, while not top shelf gourmet is very very good. There were always spots at both the pool and at the beach. No running out at the crack of dawn to place items on lounges to claim your territory unless there is a particular spot on the beach or pool you just have to have. We are quite active so we enjoyed going on the mini bike tours, playing beach volleyball, taking the free mini-tennis lessons, etc. And we also enjoyed the downtime around the pool and at the beach. No loud blaring music playing at the pool. We found the crowd to be roughly late 30s - early 50s although there were some newlyweds and some seniors well represented. Many U.S. couples from the cold states but also couples from European countries. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will be returning next year.

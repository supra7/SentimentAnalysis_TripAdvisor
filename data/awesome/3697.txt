We just returned home from a four night stay at the Secrets Maroma Beach resort and cannot possibly say enough wonderful things!!! My husband and I felt as giddy as children in a candy store the whole time we were there! We were continually impressed by everything the resort had to offer. The rooms were elaborate, the food was decadent, the drinks were divine, the beach and pool were soooo relaxing, and above all the staff was incredible! Our favorites were Alejandro on the beach and Freddy in the World Cafe. We hope we will have the opportunity to go back in the future and would absolutely recommend the resort to anyone looking for a romantic luxury getaway!

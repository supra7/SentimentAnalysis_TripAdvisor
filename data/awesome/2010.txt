Although I usually stay in a hotel within walking distance of the shopping area around Norsdtrom, this was a pleasant change. My only complaint was they charge for WiFi. This in very annoying in a 4 star hotel. Also, there's no self parking so whenever someone came to visit me they paid $6 plus tip. I usually don't hang out in hotel lobbys, but I found this one very inviting with a great view of the Sound. Maybe because I booked through Hotels.com and got a great deal, I had a view of the parking lot. The fireplace was nice and the hotel gift shop is a lot of fun - another unusual element. I'd stay here again if I could get an ocean view.

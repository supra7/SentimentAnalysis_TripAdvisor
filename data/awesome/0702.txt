On this, out first trip to Seattle, I can genuinely say that we found an hotel which we would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone. In fact, my wife and I, who have traveled extensively, would rate the Inn at the Market as being amongst the top ten hotels that we have ever stayed in. The service was pleasant but not obtrusive, our room contained everything we could have desired, the bed was wonderful and any information needed was at hand and easily understood. I also liked the the vista of the harbour and surrounds, when relaxing on the hotel's open terraced area on the fifth floor. A free computer facility was open to us as well, so emails could be checked and the Internet visited. Being only yards away from Seattle's famous Pike Street Market was a bonus and the variety of restaurants in a general cosmopolitan area was an added attraction. We only spent a couple of nights at Seattle, at the end of a three week USA visit, but we could see that Seattle has a lot to offer. If we only had more time.

Fantastic rooms, fantastic service, and a place I'd love to go back to. We have been to many all-inclusives in search of the best hotel, with the best beach/pools. This is the closest to perfection I've seen. We have stayed at Secrets Excellence (when they owned it), 3 Sandals resorts (Sandals Halcyon, Sandals Antigua, and Sandals Dunns River)and 2 Couples resorts (Couples Swept Away, and Couples Negril). The only negatives here are that there was some seaweed when we were there on the beach - not sure if that had to do with the fact it rained a lot the week before we got there or not, and the bartenders were not the best drink makers, in terms of making them strong enough, but overall, that pales in comparison to all the positives of the resort..... really nice restaurants, 24-hour room service, shows at night, beautiful grounds, awesome rooms, friendly workers, etc...... a great choice for an all-inclusive.....

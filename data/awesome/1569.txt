After flying all night from Hawaii, we arrived at Sheraton Seattle just before 8:00 am on a Friday...to convention attendants checking out en masse. I was greeted with a smile at the front desk by Kelsey, who told me she would try to get us checked in early once she found out if any rooms on the club level floor were ready. She asked for my cell number an promised to call. I was hoping to get in by noon. Twenty minutes later she called and said our room was ready!!! She directed us to the 34th floor and informed us breakfast was still going on in the club lounge. We ended up with yummy snacks and a lovely, quiet room. The room was spacious and immaculate. The bed so comfy after a long night of flying. Yes, as another reviewer noted, the sheets are a bit noisy, but not enough to keep us awake! My husband used the gym every morning, and we enjoyed use of the club lounge for breakfast and evening hors devours. The pool looked inviting, but we never found the time for a swim. The Club Lounge was crowded at times, but the food was constatntly replenished, the attendants wonderful. I enjoyed amazing berries with my granola each morning. There are no decent raspberries in Hawaii! Pike Place market and lots of great restaurants are a strainght shot towards the water. This hotel is 3 blocks from the light rail station at Westlake Cnt. Highly recommend using it to/from SeaTac. We spent 4 nights at Sheraton over a busy Memorial day weekend, and everything was perfect. Our wonderful long weekend started with Kelsey's cheery attentiveness. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. FYI: Elliott's at 3pm for oyster happy hour, and Matt's in the Market for incredible small plates...go early (5pm) for happy hour

It had been 2 years since I stayed at the W Seattle. It was my first W and still my favorite. I was concerned that the "Hipper than Thou" would grate on me. It didn't then and it doesn't now. The location is great for seeing Seattle or fo downtown business. If my business needs did not necessitate a car, I would have jumped the light rail from SeaTac and then had the Acura service take me around. I had to have a rental car and parking is an arm and a leg, but there is free street parking after 6 PM and all day Sunday. The bar is active with a nice mix of people and ages. They have a great happy hour early and then again late with a nice bar bites menu and drink specials. As a solo business traveler I ordered from the Restaurant Menu at the bar. The duck breast was outstanding and well priced. The rooms are still great. Not huge, but very well designed and appointed. The bed is absolutely a dream. The bathroom very nicely done in Ivory tile and polished Chrome fittings. Finally the Bliss products are out of this world. A couple of nit pics. Room Service is fast and efficient, but EXTREMELY expensive. A Cheese swandwich is $17+22%+4.00 delivery. I was very happy to find that my memories had not grown fonder with age, but htat it really was that nice a hotel.

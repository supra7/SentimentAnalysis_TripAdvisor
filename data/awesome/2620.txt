We booked this hotel because of the Trip Advisor rating, and the rave reviews from other travelers and were not disappointed. The experience was wonderful from start to finish. The front desk staff were efficient, knowlegable, friendly and helpful. The property was immaculate, including the rooms, and the eating area. There is a complimentary breakfast, complete with actual waffle irons, a large selection of beverages, and a diverse offering of foods. There is also a complimentary 'snack' served mid-afternoon, comprised of meats and cheeses, crackers, veggies and dip, rolls, and more bevvies. There is a complimentary internet station set up for the patrons use, complete with printer and hand sanitizer. Free, surveilled parking, close proximity and complimentary shuttle to many tourist attractions, and excellent room set-up, with fridge and microwave, nintendo, and sink-and-mirror combo outside the main bathroom, complete the package. Top it off with moderate pricing and you cannot beat this property for value. We were stunned at how reasonable the bill was on departure. I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE, particulary if you want to be out of the hub of downtown, but within a reasonable cab ride to the major attractions. It is about a 15 dollar fare if you are outside of the shuttle hours, and literally a 10 minute drive. If anything, this property is UNDER-priced. We've never been more impressed.

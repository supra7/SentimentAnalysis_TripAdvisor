This is my FAVORITE W Hotel in the States! The rooms are awesome- great views of the city! Top 10 things I love about this W property: 1.) Great location walking distance to most of where you want to go in DT Seattle 2.) The rooms are modern and well done 3.) Beds are incredibly comfortable (of course) 4.) Bathrooms have plenty of room, big tub, great shower water pressure and Bliss products 5.) The staff including housekeeping, front desk and the concierge were all great 6.) Gym was solid for a hotel gym 7.) The W bar is right downstairs - great atmosphere for hanging out 8.) Acuras shuttle you around 9.) Great service from all staff members 10.) Clean, clean, clean hotel I won't stay anywhere else in Seattle.

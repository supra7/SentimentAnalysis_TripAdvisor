We had 3 wonderful nights at this hotel. The room was very comfortable. Had breakfast in the restaurant twice with very good food and service. Visited the lounge a couple times and the server ( 'Susan' I believe was her name) was very friendly and helpful. Sean Stampley, Concierge, provided us with much information and helped make the most of our 4 days in Seattle. He informed us of various tours and all of the public transit options available. The hotel is in a great location for people using the transit system. All the staff at this hotel were very friendly and happy to help any way they could. We were very impressed. We stayed at 7 hotels during our holiday and the Mayflower was by far the best!

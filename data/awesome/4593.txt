I had never stayed at an all inclusive resort due to hearing bad reports of food and tips. However, my husband and I disregarded those reports and booked our honeymoon at Secrets in Maroma beach. WE LOVED IT! The restaurants were great, the staff was great and resort and beach were beautiful! We want to go back!

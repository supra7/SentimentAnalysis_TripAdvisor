We had a swimout suite which was great. The hotel was fabulous, rooms were very high-end with the best stone & finishes. Very clean, service was great. My only complaint would be the alcohol...it seemed watered down even though premium brands. We found ourselves constantly asking for double shots in drinks, etc., just to get that nice vacation "buzz". other than this small complaint...what a blast!!

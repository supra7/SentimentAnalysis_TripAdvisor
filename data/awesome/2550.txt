I pricelined this hotel and what a bargain. I really lucked out. I am always leary of what will happen with priceline but we were using seattle as our base and then spending other nights in Ranier and then up to Vancouver. We only spent one night here and arrrived late. We left early in the morning to catch the clipper to victoria We had a great nights sleep on the super comfortable bed, a commanding view of the space needle, the TV was fantastic. Staff very helpful & super friendly. Everything sparkling clean, room service meal prompt warm & tasty. I pricelined another hotel in Seattle for the night when we came back from Victoria and I was dissapointed. Next time I will just make reservations directly with the Westin. My one night's stay there left me wanting to enjoy the facilities and the great location more.

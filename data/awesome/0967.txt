Absolutely the best place to travel with a family. Each room has a kitchenette and the store is a block away. Within walking distance of the Seattle Center, so everything is easy to get to. The staff is very helpful and courteous. The rooms are HUGE and very comfortable. I would stay here every time--no problem!

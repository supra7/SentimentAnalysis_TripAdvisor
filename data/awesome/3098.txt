I really loved staying at Hotel Max during a recent conference. I was there for four nights, and I thought the hotel was clean, interesting, and in a good location downtown. The rooms are small, as others have noted, and the building is old, but "modern" hotels are usually like this and I wasn't surprised. I thought my room (on the seventh floor, one super comfortable queen bed) was perfectly sized for one person. The staff was very friendly and the attached restaurant (the Red Fin) had several great vegetarian options for me. The only drawback? $13/day for in-room internet access, but that seemed to be the case at most of the downtown Seattle hotels. Oh well! If I could get a good deal another time, I would definitely stay here again, especially for a romantic weekend.

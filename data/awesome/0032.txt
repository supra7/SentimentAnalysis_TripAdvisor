I was very happy with our stay at Hotel Monaco. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and the restaurant was awesome. The restaurant has an open kitchen and we enjoyed sitting at the bar talking with the chef. The food was the best we had the entire trip. There were only two downsides: the view from our room, right into another building...and the parking. We own a large pickup truck which was too tall for most standard (6'8) parking garages. Neither the front desk or the doorman could direct us to a lot that would accomodate our truck. It took us an hour to find parking 8 blocks away. However, after that hour, we had a wonderful time and enjoyed the hotel and the city. I can't wait to return!

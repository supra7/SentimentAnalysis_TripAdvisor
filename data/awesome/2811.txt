This is a great hotel overall, and at the rate I got on the internet ($159), quite a bargain. Great service, convenient location, good restaurant on site, and helpful staff. My room was a good size, with a huge bathroom and very comfortable bed. The free wireless internet throughout the hotel was a nice perk. I was able to walk almost everywhere I went, though it's also convenient to buses, which are free in the downtown business area. I'd recommend this place without hesitation.

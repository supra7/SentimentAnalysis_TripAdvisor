We've booked here 2 years in a row now and absolutely love this hotel. The location can't be beat, the decor is fabulous and the service is always positive. The only minus with this place is that (and what) they charge for wifi. It's a service that costs them relatively little - so it's ridiculous that it's not a free service like it is so many other places. We go across the street to Starbucks for free wifi (which brings our overall experience at Hotel Max down a notch). Other than that though, we love love love this place. The Red Fin next door also has some lovely sushi and is a great place to start the evening.

From the very beginning we felt right at home,all of the employees were extremely nice and courtious,even the maintence workers.i would highly recommened this resort and i have to already others.This is an amazing resort,we can't imagine going to a different resort now as Maroma has set the bar very high.We are already thinking about going back next year and we've only been home for a month.

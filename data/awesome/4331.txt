We stayed the 1st week of March. Been to Secrets Capri so knew what to expect. The property, grounds, beach are the best. The water looks like a postcard. Part way into our trip a large company group came in.The 1st day we couldn't get a chair at the beach or pool.No big deal we just layed in the sand for awhile.The pool, well you really couldn't see the water in the pool.It was a sea of people. We went to get ready for dinner and received hotel mail. They said they were over booked for the weekend and wanted to know if we would like to go to Secrets Capri or Zoetry.We talked to our conceirge and he assured us everything would be taken care of. Secrets Maroma were true to their word. We had a very nice stay at Zoetry for 2 nights then came back to Maroma.When we came back we were given preferred club, ocean view room,champagne chilling, private dinner on the beach,$100.00 to spend anywhere in the resort and A certificate for a future stay of 5 nights free.Can't wait to return to this beautiful resort.It was certainly worth moving for 2 nights,and a big plus- when we returned to Maroma all the company groups were gone, leaving Serects Maroma to it's norm.

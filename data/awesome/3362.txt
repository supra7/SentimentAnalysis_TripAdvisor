We were booked on a cruise from 8/6 to 8/13 and wanted to get a room for Friday night the 5th. The Hilton shuttle picked us up from the airport. The hotel staff, Clay, booked us a shuttle to get us to the cruise ship. We were also told that we could return on the13th for the day as our flight didn't leave until 7 PM. The bell desk helped us to use the Seattle express and suggested a restaurant (Crab Pot - Wonderful). They stored our luggage while we went out and also shuttled us to the airport. I've always loved the Hiltons but this was way above and beyond service.

There are "buts" about our stay in Lindemann's Berlin - it was all we wished for. The room was clean and airy, decorated in a slick manner, bathroom was huge. We had a feeling as if no one else was living in the hotel - it was so quiet and we havent actually seen anyone. Housekeeping impeccable, very friendly and professional staff who spoke fluent English. Not in the center, but there is a bus stop right next to the Hotel with buses running every 3-5 minutes and it takes you to Alexanderplatz through Potsdamerplatz. A cheap supermarket Lidl just around the corner if you need a bottle of water or a jogurt in the morning. We didnt buy breakfast, but there is a lovely bakery just opposite the Hotel (100 meters up towards Bulower Str) and we had a coffee and some sandwiches there for 8Euro for two persons. If you do stay at Lindemanns, you might want to visit an Italian restaurant nearby called Caruso (10 min walk from the hotel, Winterfeldtstrasse 35). We went there once and kept coming back every night, they have a nice atmosphere and the pasta is simply amazing.. also best Panna cotta I have tried ever. I'm not sure what the hotel would be like for a family visit, but it was perfect for a young couple on their first visit to Berlin..

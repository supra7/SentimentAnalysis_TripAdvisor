I stayed March 4th and wasn't expecting a lot from this airport hotel. As someone that works for a firm that has gone through the Ritz Carlton seminar, I'm sure this Marriott (which owns Ritz) had its employees go through this process. The room was fine, great pool, decent gym, frequent shuttle to the airport...all that was great. The free Internet with printer is a nice touch as well. Every single employee was amazingly friendly and solicitious - even when I was kind of lost someone would always go out of their way to offer help. There is a lot of construction going on which should be completed soon but it didn't negatively affect me. Good job, Marriott.

Stayed April 13-16, Todd checked us in with a smile! Went to Earth and Ocean every morning and had the Northwest Bounty, Crab, mixed mushroom and poached eggs. Delicious! Nick was our server and always attentive and friendly. Cocktails were really good and order the W Sexy fries, Penn Cove mussels and Wild Shrimp. A real Food Fest! Later, had dinner with Jen. She took on our party of 5 with humor and outstanding service! Room was spacious we were able to see Downtown Seattle lights. So Gorgeous! Thanks W! You took excellent care of us.

We have stayed in several resorts south of Cancun, and this place was great. Excellent staff and friendly service, great food & drinks, not far from airport, beautiful rooms and ocean view. A couple other resorts we stayed at there wasn't this kind of great service unless you were "preferred" with a wristband. The beach is amazing compared to many others in the region. Clear water, only a little seaweed, no rocks & pebbles under your feet, just soft sand and crystal clear water up to your neck! Plus didn't have to listen to small children screaming in the pools! We enjoyed the free hobie-cat rides out to the reef too. We will definitely be back to this resort. Feb 18-22, 2012 from Ohio.

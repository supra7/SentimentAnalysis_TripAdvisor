We recently stayed at the Executive Hotel during a quick weekend getaway....aka so my girlfriend could go shopping. I have stayed at a number of hotels in the Seattle area and consistently come back here because of the overall value. The location is awesome, only a few blocks from main shopping areas and within walking distance to Qwest Field, (Seahawks) or Safeco Field, (Mariners). The staff is friendly, the wifi is free and there is a Seattle's Best Coffee shop on the lobby floor. Our room has always been clean and the noise has never been an issue. The only reason not to stay here is because they are sold out.

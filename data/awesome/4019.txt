What can i say,The Zoetry is in a class all it's own.We were in the PC bldg 16 4th floor and what a view of the ocean.The room was huge and had a soaking tub on the balcony.The women get all decked out for dinner.The food was awesome.Room service was on time and the food was hot and tasty.The beach was wonderful as was the water.You can walk for miles in either direction..We will be going back soon.

My family has stayed at the Seatac Quality Inn several times and appreciate the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. They have an excellent breakfast and shuttle service. It's nice to see friendly faces when you go to the "city" from a small town. We will stay there many times in the future as needed, I'm sure. Thank you, Quality Inn.

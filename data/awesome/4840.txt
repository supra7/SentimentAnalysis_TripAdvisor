only 1 negative beach beds need to be upgraded to beds more comfortable like ones at pool, also provide chairs on beach also, also snorkling equipment at beach area, we have stayed at many resorts and will find it hard to find other resorts to live up to these expectations, we have had a wonderful experience, and already are making plans to return next may-june 2011, it would be nice for hotel to provide curtosy travel to cancun and playa carmen like other resorts provide, fantastic resort keep up these great standards it shows you do really mean you care.

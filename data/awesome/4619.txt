Everything about this hotel was awesome. The beach was incredible, the pool was great, the service was second to none, the restaurants were as good as any I have ever been to; 5 stars across the boards for everything. They had an entertainment team to offer activities throughout the day, evening entertainment, drinks and food whenever you wanted. The rooms were updated and modern, everything was clean, and the entire staff was incredible. There is no reason to leave the resort unless you want to. Go to Secrets Maroma, you will not regret it. We would definitely go back and definitely recommend it to everyone!

An amazing place!! We had a great time at Secrets Maroma and could not believe the choice of food in the restarants and the customer service. As everyone who stays is on an all-inclusive, you never have to wait for a bill or sign a check and there are no wrist bands. It also means they can do cool things like have a chef come out to the pool deck at lunch and make up fresh delicious burritos! There are no reservations required for the restaurants and we could always get into whichever one we wanted. The live band in the nightclub one night was great too, and the movie theatre's a great idea. The only downside during our stay was that as it was a busy period, the pool and beach chairs were very busy.

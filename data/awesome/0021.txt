Just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle for three evenings. They are undergoing a renovation and the newly renovated room that I had was fresh, had good amenities e.g., each side of the bed had a plug for me to plug in my computer! Colors are really nice. Workout room is nice as well. What makes this hotel so great is their staff. Top notch and makes everybody who walks through the door feel welcomed. Just amazing. The location of this hotel is excellent as well - walkable to everything. The link from the airport stops 2 blocks away from the hotel and is an excellent alternative to cabs and super shuttle. I highly recommend this property. Every time I stay here I just fall "in like" again!

We are from the UK and have stayed in several American chains but hadn't tried this one until now. We stayed 3 nights and will be adding it to our list. The room was excellent and although there was no free breakfast, it was only $10 which by UK standards is cheap and included cooked to order breakfast, fruit, juice, toast, pastries etc. Location is good, there is also a great shopping mall right nearby. We thought from previous postings we would be able to get a train fairly near but the reception staff thought not so we drove into Baltimore which was convenient but quite expensive to park. Would definitely try this chain again.

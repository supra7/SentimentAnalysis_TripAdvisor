Thank you, Moore Hotel people. Thank you for the location. Thank you for the quiet, clean, and large room. Thank you for the funky and tasteful decor. Thank you for the handsome but basic old-style bathroom. Thank you for all the coffee I could drink, because I'm a coffee lover. Thank you for not giving me silly frills that I didn't need and didn't want to pay for. Thank you for the computer in the lobby, and the comfortable lobby itself. Thank you for the extra blankets. Thank you for the lovely kitchen table setting, which was classy but not pretentious. Thank you for not charging an arm and a leg. Regarding location, It's not just close to the market, it's close to everything. It's convenient if you like to take public transportation, like we did. Moore Hotel has personality, it has soul, and if I ever need a hotel again in Seattle, it'll be the Moore. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the kitchen burners didn't reach a high temperature, making it not-so-convenient for cooking and boiling water.

I was happy with the room I got, but for a few moments wondered what I *could* have had. Upon check-in at around 1:30? the front desk clerk said that I had a specific number room reserved, but I had not actually requested it. Did I want to wait for that room or take one available now? Not knowing, and ready to go to my room, I told her I would take the room I can have right now. I had booked a King Premier so I hoped they were all pretty much equal. After going up to my floor, exiting the elevator and seeing the room number layout, I recognized that I had unknowingly passed on a corner room.... which I wanted. My bad for not asking some more questions when the front desk person checked me in. But later when I had to go get ice, I recognized that the (noisy) ice machine was right outside that corner room's door. So, I was fine being a few rooms down the hall, with a similar view. The room itself was very nice. Very quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. I wish I could have pulled the drapes closer together, I could not get them to fully close. So a crack of bright light wanted to keep coming in. Everything from this location is either up or downhill, some gently and some not, so be prepared for that. I didn't take advantage of the evening wine hour, but I loved the Arnold Palmer bar in the afternoons. Food was awesome, I ordered in for dinner two evenings and had breakfast once in the restaurant. Dinner 1 was orrechiette w/broccoli rabe and sausage, Dinner 2 was roast chicken - the best chicken I've ever had. Breakfast was rustic grilled bread with tomato sauce & eggs, and tropical green tea. Loved my stay here.

Wow! From the time of our arrival to the sad moment of our departure we where meant to feel like celebrities. I thought all the staff was in on it. I was waiting for cameras jump out any moment and yell " Surprise you are on The Lives of The Rich and Famous!" We where celebrating 25 years of marriage. We met my wife's sister and brother in law from New York, we are from California. We did not leave the resort as we had everything we came on vacation for right there at Secrets Maroma. Everyday was another adventure in Chillaxantion! The resort was soooooo clean. the staff was awesome to say the very least. We would like to give a shout out to Tirsa in the VIP lounge. She was so nice and spoke such beautiful English. She greeted us by by Mr and Mrs......... every day. We encouraged her to use our first names but she stated it was from respect to her guest, Roberto in the main bar\lobby was so nice and knew what we wanted before we even reached the bar. The food was so delicious. Room service was prompt. We just can't say enough. Thank you to the staff at Secrets Maroma for making my wife so happy. We will be back ASAP. Rudy And Tracey.

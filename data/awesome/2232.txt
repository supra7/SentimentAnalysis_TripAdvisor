I loved the Sorrento Hotel. It has an old fashioned ambience - rightly earned given its history - with lots of beautiful wood paneling in the lobby and a wonderful arts and crafts fireplace mantel. Our room, actually a small suite, was cozy without being cloying or cute, with a comfortable bed complete with comfortable linens, which weren't too heavy, a pet peeve of mine. The bathroom was immaculate with no trace of mold, though both the toilet and shower were a bit balky, though the issues were quickly addressed by the staff. The staff well may be the best part of the hotel. They were professional, courteous and helpful, the very best staff I have ever encountered at a hotel in Seattle, and indeed at a hotel anywhere. We will definitely stay there next time we go to Seattle.

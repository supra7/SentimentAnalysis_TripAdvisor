Secrets Maroma definitely exceeded any expectation we ever could have. The staff was amazing, the food was excellent, and the resort was clean and gorgeous. We had no problems while we were at the resort and we had the time of our lives. There is always something to do and you are waited on 24/7. We loved this resort and will definitely come back.

Visited for a conference. Beautiful hotel. Had to do a double take-- not your typical airport hotel!! I didn't try the restaurant, but conference food was excellent. Very fresh, nicely presented. Staff was great. Not great for tourist stay (it's a haul to city center). But excellent if needing to be near the airport!!

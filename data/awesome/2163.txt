We stayed twice at this hotel.....at the beginning of our trip and the end. It is a lovely location indeed, right on the waterfront! If you want this view, you have to book it! The gas fireplaces, windows that open, two leather chairs to sit in as well as a cute footstool, and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom decor is not hotel "run of the mill", very lovely glassed in shower and claw tub. Lighting was done with us gals in mind! Well done! We found the staff were courteous, friendly and accommodating.Their Six Seven Restaurant was really excellent, again with great views and very accommodating staff. I do agree with some others that the parking fee of 30+per night is too steep for this hotel. Otherwise, it's a lovely treat! Thanks for a nice stay!

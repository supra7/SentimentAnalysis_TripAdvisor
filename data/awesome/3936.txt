This was our second time back in a year and it did not disappoint. The facilities and location are both excellent but in my opinion what makes this resort number one is the staff and service. Never have I experienced a resort or hotel for that matter where every staff member carries a smile and looks genuinely glad to be there. Any time you pass a staff member you are greeted with a smile and an "hola". Any request is met with a smile and taken care of immediately. A special greeting to Kevin, the "pool nazi" who was very helpful and a pleasure to talk to. The world buffet for breakfast was the best and the Portofino, Oceana and Himitsu restaurants were all top notch. We didn't experience the French and Mexican restaurants. The beach was awesome and you could easily walk 3 or 4 miles in either direction and never once did we feel threatened. The bar has been set and now we fear that if we go to another resort whether in Mexico or anyplace else we will always compare to Secrets Maroma Beach

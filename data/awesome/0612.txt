The Inn at the Market was in a fantastic location right at the "Market". Our room was perfect...clean, spacious with quality amenities. We did not have a waterview room but we enjoyed the beautiful roof-top patio overlooking the water. The services were superb and when we come back to Seattle, we would not stay anywhere else.

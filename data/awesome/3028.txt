I agree with all previous positive comments.... Staff were very accomodating. I arrived early at 10am by myself and asked if I could drop my bags off. Staff told me I could check in and have a smaller room on a higher floor immediately or dump my stuff off, come back later in the afternoon and check into the larger room. I took the smaller one and was not disappointed. It was roomy enough for 2 people, everything was furnished really trendy, great view and I liked the hotel's focus on being green. Staff were outstanding, patiently gave me directions to the places I wanted to see and even went online to get business hours for some stores I wanted to visit. Great location, 20 minutes to the Experience Music Project (don't miss it, especially if you have kids...take them to the sound labs), 20 minutes to Pikes Market.

We stayed at this hotel for one night before starting our Princess landtour. The hotel reception had a lovely smell of freshly baked cookies which were given out at check in and were delicious. The room was spacious and had a coffee maker. There were 2 double beds and the mattresses were really comfortable. We had a lovely buffet breakfast in the restaurant and sat by the outdoor pool in the morning while we waited for our transfer to the airport.

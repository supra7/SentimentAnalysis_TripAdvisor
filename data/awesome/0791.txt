My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Ace hotel for 2 nights while vacationing in Seattle. I was initially afraid of the shared bathroom concept, but the perfect reviews from everyone proved to be true and I'm glad I listened. There was never anyone in the hallways or in the spotless bathrooms. If you understand and appreciate good, modern design, this hotel is for you. My boyfriend and I both even appreciated the music playing quietly in the bathrooms... our kind of music! The front desk was friendly and wouldn't let me carry my bags up the stairs. The waffles at breakfast are delicious and the whole hotel has a fun feel to it. We stayed in a plush, private hotel in Vancouver on the same trip and my boyfriend and I both prefered the fun vibe of the Ace to that hotel. The rooms have everything you need and deliver it to you in a quirky and unique way.

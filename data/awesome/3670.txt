We stayed at the resort for 6 nights from march 8-14. My husband and I traveled with our 19 year old daughter, who was probably the youngest person at the resort. We did not find it necessary to leave the resort - very clean, excellent service and fun entertainment. We quickly came to know the entertainment staff - Jesus, Miguel, Alex, Tonya and Guia...and others.They did a fantastic job of keeping us laughing and busy. We also very much enjoyed getting to know Chef Erik, who was kind enough to provide a fantastic tour of the kitchen facilities (VERY Clean and organized, by the way) and the food was delicious. The only negative was that the room was suppose to be "partial ocean view" - we could not see anything beyond the mass of trees outside our balcony. We also did not like the open "window with curtain" that separated the bath from the sleeping area. However, we spent very little time in the room, so we did not even try to change.

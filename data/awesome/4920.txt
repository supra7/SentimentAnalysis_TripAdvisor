This is the best all-inclusive resort we have been to. Maroma Beach, which you can see partly on my first picture, is the most beautiful beach you'll find at Riviera Maya. It has no rock at all. The Secrets is at one end of it and the Iberostar at the other end. You don't find many resorts between these two. The water in front on the Secrets is more calm than the one in front of the Iberostar. The beach is important for us so when we will return to Riviera Maya we will probably return to the Secrets. We usually like to change every time, we could probably find other resorts with the same exceptional service we had but with a beach that great, I really don't think so!

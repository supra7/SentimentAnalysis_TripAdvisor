Travelled to hotel with partner and friends for a one week stay. Overwhelmed with the level of service. The hotel was immaculate and the highlights were the service and level of cleanliness. Every member of staff welcomed you with a genuine smile and seemed happy to be there. Nothing was too much trouble for any member of staff from reception to chambermaid. We found the room service to be of excellent standard and a wonderful addition to the 'all inclusive'. The private chamber to allow the room service food and drink to be delivered without intrusion was a great thought-out extra. Although tips and gratuities were included in the price you could not fail to want to thank certain individuals for the level of service. We found the buffet to be excellent where breakfast and lunch was served. On our particular visit it was not open in the evening. The al a carte restaurants were very easy to book or get last minute tables.. We found the food in all the restaurants to be good, but not excellent. Again, the service made everything more than acceptable. The service around the pool was a particular treat with lunch time chefs serving hot snacks which were delicious along with continuous drink waiter/waitress service. The room was furnished to a particularly high standard and we wanted to take the bed home - it was so comfortable. The hotel also offered you your choice of pillow quality!!! We had a wonderful week at Maroma Beach and would not hesitate to return for a completely chilled out, indulgent holiday.

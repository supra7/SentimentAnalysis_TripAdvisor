I have been to 3 Adults Only AI in the Riviera Maya: Valentin Imperial Maya, Excellence Riviera Cancun and now Secrets MB....and by far the best: SECRETS Maroma. I have never been back to the same resort but have now found everything I love wrapped up in one resort so I will definitely be going back! The food, beach, pool and service were all extraordinary. favourites were Coco Cafe, Portofino, World Cafe and the Japanese restaurant. The service and friendliness of the staff was above and beyond expectation. THe room was lovely...and we had every detail attended to by our concierge. I loved this resort so much that I am considering their vacation club. YOU MUST GO..absolutely no complaints and no regrets!

I travel to Montreal frequently and think this is the nicest hotel in the city. Incredibly warm, comfortable modern decor, rooms and bathrooms have all amenities. Location is excellent, staff is great. Only small complaint is that the rooms that face Blvd Rene Levesque can be a bit loud with street noise. Other than that, highly, highly recommend.

We've stayed at the Hotel Max several times in the past few years. It is a wonderful boutique hotel with a full sized photo on each guest room door. After this welcome, you enter a very brightly decorated room. Each room has a minifridge, a flat screened TV and a bright bathroom. Formerly an old hotel, this has been updated with a very modern scheme. If Japanese food is your passion, you will love dining in Red Fin, the restaurant off the lobby. The Max is well located to go shopping, to Jazz Alley or down to Pike's Place. This is a great little place to stay for your getaway to Seattle.

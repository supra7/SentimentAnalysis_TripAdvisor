From the moment we arrived till we left the following day, we felt at home. The staff are super friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome the minute we arrived. The comfort of the bed, duvet, pillows was beyond belief ... it was like I imagine sleeping in heaven would feel like. The wine tasting as a fun event, the location is convenient to all that Seattle has to offer and the dining was superb. I highly recommend this as your destination hotel any time you travel to Seattle. The main reason we chose this hotel was Kimpton has a great reputation and their Seattle hotel was beyond our expectations.

I stayed for business in the Sorrento for one night and experienced the Fireside Room for the 1st night and then again prior to leaving Seattle late on the last night. From the time I arrived at the hotel, I was met with 1st class service where nothing was too much trouble. Their guys at the concierge were magic - they knew where to recommend restuarants and bars then even offered to drop us off and also pick us up after we did some shopping - rather then get a cab back to the hotel. Great location in the heart of the city. Friendly people, gorgeous hotel and the Fireside room is just lovely when the Seattle weather is not so great, food was fabulous and winelist recommendations were spot on. This is a true gem, understated elegance and professional warm genuine service. I wish I could've stayed longer than just a night.

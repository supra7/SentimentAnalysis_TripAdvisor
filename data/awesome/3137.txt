As you walk into The Roosevelt Hotel, you know you are going to be pleased with the accommodations. The front desk staff were very friendly. The conceirge was very helpful and had a great sense of humor. The atmosphere of the lobby is so relaxing. You can just sit in the lobby and admire the decor. It didn't matter that they were only operating on one elevator (due to maintenance). We were in no rush to get anywhere. Our room was absolutely gorgeous. We didn't have the best view but then again we were not in our room during the daytime to enjoy. The location was perfect, centrally located to many amenities like the Pike's Public Market, First Avenue, the Monorail, Barnes and Nobles just a step away from our front door, the Westlake Shopping Mall, had a free service transit system from certain points (which made it so convenient when we got tired) and had plenty of street entertainment. We played tourist and shopped until we literally dropped. Priceline.com did well for us. The only thing that might be useful was an in-room fridge.

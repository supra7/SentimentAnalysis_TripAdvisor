The Ace Hotel is a stylish, no-frills, sparkling clean place to sleep. It's a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum and Pikes Place Market, as well as many fine eatries. I had an inside room (quiet) with shared bathroom and found it perfect for my short stay in Seattle, but be warned that the Ace has a lot of stairs and no elevator. Also the showers in the shared bathrooms, fully tiled, generous in proportion and clean as a whistle, have no grab bars or safety mats. That said, I love this place and wish there were Ace hotels everywhere I travel.

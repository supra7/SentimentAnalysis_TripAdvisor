Everything about our stay was exceptional. Great location, literally steps from the front door to all that Pikes Market has to offer. Great Views, from either the cool deck or higher rooms. Great rooms, super comfy tempurpedic beds, nice bathrooms, etc. Amazing staff, every encounter was sincere, warm, and gracious. Special "props" go to Wynona. She took our last minute reservations and I casually mentioned we were celebrating our first babymoon. Not only did she remember but she actually got a gorgeous bouquet of flolwers that were waiting for us in the room with a lovely card. We were blown away and this helped set the tone for a GREAT vacation.

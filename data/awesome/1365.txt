Came to Seattle for a weekend with my mother and four year old son from Portland. It is but a five dollar cab ride from the train depot. Excellent. Although the hotel building is old and a bit shabby, our double queen room was clean and cozy. (We had booked a Cozy Double, but asked for the listed complimentary upgrade when available.) The shower head was nice and the room was comfortable for the three of us. This was my sons first time in a hotel and he had a blast! The in room coffee was delicious and strong and the folks at the Seattle's Best shop downstairs gladly gave me half and half to bring up to our room. The location is AWESOME!!! Very easy walking distance to Market, International Dist, Monorail to Seattle Center, and right across the street from the beautiful downtown library. We had a great time and my husband and I have book a room for our anniversary weekend in early February. And one last thing...about a block and a half away there is the very delicious Sweet Iron Waffles. Be sure to go there for an AMAZING six dollar breakfast!

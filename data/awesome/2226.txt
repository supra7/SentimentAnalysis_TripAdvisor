We stayed on Christmas Eve, enjoyed dinner in the Hunt Club and live jazz in the Fireplace Room before going to Midnight Mass at St. James Cathedral, about 2 blocks away. The room was well maintained, clean and comfortable. It has all the charm, and a few of the expected shortcomings (smaller rooms, bit noisy) of an older hotel, but nothing I would call a problem. I did not use the fitness center, but the hotel does have one, something I could not find listed on their website. The best part of our stay was the friendly staff. We were looking for a taxi during the morning checkout rush. In the midst of this very busy scene, one of the valets (Rob?) took us to the bus station in the hotel car. We also enjoyed excellent service in the restaurant and lounge. The staff at this hotel are the reason we would return.

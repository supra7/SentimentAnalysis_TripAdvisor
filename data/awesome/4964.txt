We usually stay at sandals and have been very pleased but because of a bad experience last year we decided to try secrets in mexico. We were so pleased. from our arrival to departure everything was excellent. we loved our oceanview room, although it could of been a little closer to the ocean. We were celebrating our 4th anniversary. There was a banner on our door , fresh flowers and chilled champagne waiting for us after our long journey there.The grounds were beautiful. The buildings could of been alittle more colorful but the beautiful ocean made up for that. The food was incredible for an all inclusive, presentation was great. Our favorite was Bordeaux, Funny Freddie and Phillipe were our waiters and they were awesome. All of the staff from entertainment , to housecleaning,were awesome, so friendly and really made you feel like they wanted to be there. The one complaint is the tipping. We would rather pay more then try to figure out when and who to tip. The pool waiters were also great especially Flore, we couldn't get over all the wonderful food they served around the pool,and the drinks were awesome!!! At sandals you couldn't even eat by the pool.I do wish the two pools connected so that you could enjoy the swim up bar when in the smaller pool. I also wish you could save chairs.There aren't that many and they fill up quick. The entertainment was good. We really enjoyed the saxophone, and guitar player. We felt the staff really went out of there way to make every theme night special. We were not ready to leave when it was time to go. We can't wait to go back!!!

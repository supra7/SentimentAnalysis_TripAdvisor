We were thrilled with every single thing about this hotel. The location was excellent with everything at our fingertips. The facilities were excellent and staff very helpful and charming. The lobby was stunning with a large sitting area, several computers, coffee shop etc. Bedding was of a very high quality with a wide selection of pillows available to suit anyone's needs. We used the ones normally provided and they proved a good choice. Rooms were spacious with two very comfortable easy chairs, tons of natural light, and quiet air conditioning we could set to suit our own needs. Plenty of drawer space. Several lifts so never had to wait! Immaculate appearance in every area we saw.

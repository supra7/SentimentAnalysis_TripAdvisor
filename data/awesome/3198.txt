We opted for the $5 requested upgrade for hhonours members, and the room was superb when we got it. At $65 plus the upgrade this was outstanding value, so much so we used it on our return journey too. Lovely spacious Doubletree, with gift shop and a very good restaurant inside it. Choice of food was excelent.

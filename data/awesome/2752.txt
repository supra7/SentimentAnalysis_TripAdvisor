We spent 4 days here before we went to Port Townsend for a wedding. We had always just passed through Seattle and wanted to see a bit of it. The hotel is several blocks south east of the main downtown area and is near the new library. Still everything is easily walkable. For instance, it is about 8 blocks to Pike's Place Market; maybe 6 blocks to Pioneer Square. This is a very nice, cozy little hotel. Amenities like a business center and fitness area are there, but are minimal. Also, no pool or spa. That being said, the price is also much lower than more full featured hotels. On the plus side, at 5pm every evening, there is a free wine tasting in the lobby that starts off the evening in great style. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The rooms are very big and well appointed. A small maintenance issue was taken care of immediately.

My two nights in the Travelodge's kid-friendly Sleepy Bear Den on the third floor were pleasant. I will agree with previous reviews about the hotel being in dire need of updating (both structurally & decoratively) but fast elevators & fancy artwork are not lodging necessities for me. Our first room did not have a fridge (I thought all rooms did but I guess they don't) & without hesitation, Dan graciously switched us to the Sleepy Bear Den, a room with not only a fridge but a VCR (which we didn't use, though, since the hotel only stocks kid movies, but "Sex & the City" was on so who needs movies)...& didn't charge us the higher rate! He was also very helpful with info about the city bus (which has a stop about 500 yards from the hotel). My friend & I found the hotel to be in a great location since it was within walking distance to the Space Needle & surrounding attractions, & it's near the interstate. Finding a parking spot was never a problem, & the area appeared to be safe (I was worried about my car but nothing happened). Our room was clean & contained all the standard amenities, & was quiet. The best feature was the wireless internet access in all the rooms...I logged right on & got up-to-the-minute info about things to do in the area. While I did not use it, I did take a look at the pool & it looked great. Breakfast was nothing to write home about...just a typical continental breakfast. But overall, I would stay at the Travelodge again & again as the price & location cannot be beat.

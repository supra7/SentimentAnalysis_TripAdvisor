We were very nervous before arriving, having read some critical reviews from the last few weeks ("tired, old hotel, patches on carpets", etc.) and were pleasantly, delightfully, surprised. Being Starwood Preferred members might have helped in our case. In any event, the room was great (recently re-furbished probably) and better located than our reservation had indicated. The staff were outstandingly helpful. The location was ideal - everything for first-time visitors was in easy walking distance. The highlight for us was the Seattle Museum of Art. Our restaurant recommendation : - the Pink Room (but make sure you get clear directions on how to find it - it`s easy if you know). The Paramount Theatre is a great venue if something interesting is on (it was) ; and the Benaroya concert venue is also excellent ; all these are within easy walikng distance.

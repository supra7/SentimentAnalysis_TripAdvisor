I have been to various all inclusive places. Secrets Maroma exceeded all my expectations with outstanding service levels of all staffs and a very good quality regarding food and beverages. As others said, an unforgettable experience at this incredible resort, in the most positive sense. Only two points of concern: mosquitoes were really a pain. And internet access its not really state of the art. Free access for one hour only in the lobby&main restaurant area, access from the rooms only with a surcharge. But these are only minor concerns. My expectations were exceeded, my level of satisfaction with Secrets Maroma Beach is 98%.

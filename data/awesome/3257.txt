Our family came together here for a cruise to Alaska. There were 28 of us and we came in from early Thursday to late Friday night. We held a family meeting and spent a lot of time in the common areas. The staff was very accomodating. Everyone from the bartender to the hotel clerks were cheerful and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay.

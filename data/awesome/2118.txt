The Edgewater was a recommendation by my travel agent, and as it turns out a great one. I was initially disappointed that there was no complementary shuttle from the airport, however, discovering that a luxury towncar would drive us for $35(USD) I decided a shuttle would not be required. Upon arrival the friendly staff were quick to open doors and carry bags. Check in was very quick and the front desk extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel staff were eager to point out attractions to walk to, attractions worth driving to, and places that were a must see such as the market at Pike Place. Over all our stay at the Edgewater was exceptional.

We loved Secrets Maroma. We booked an oceanview suite. Our first room overlooked the tops of palm trees and the the horizon. Not acceptable for us. We need to see turquoise water. However, we loved, loved, everything else about the resort. The people could not do enough for us. It was impeccably clean. Great entertainment. Food was awesome. . service fantastic. We are lovers of the Sandals Resorts. . .we found this to be better in some ways. We have already recommended this resort to others. We plan to return to the Secrets resorts.

This Hotel did very good by us they had our room ready early 3hrs early ...They recommended us to the best restaurants and also made sure that we had complimentary limo service from hotel to restaurant back to hotel which was great. We stayed on the 34th floor weather was great no problems with noises or creeking .The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable like sleeping on air . Thank you Westin Seattle for making our stay FANTASTIC

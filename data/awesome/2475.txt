This has to one of the best places I've stayed recently. Easy check in and out. Had a room with a great view on the next to the top floor. A very comfortable bed, nice quiet climate control, quality bathroom amenities, and a convenient electrical outlet right next to the bed. (I use a CPAP machine, and some places you have to practically stand on your head to get to an outlet.) Comfortable work table and good lighting in the whole room. All this at at a great Priceline rate. Priceline is sometimes kind of a crapshoot, (2 days later the Hyatt in Irvine, CA gave me - I'm not kidding- a room with NO BED) but this one was great! My first stay in Seattle, and I'd recommend the Westin highly.

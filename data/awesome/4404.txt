We travel the Caribbean yearly and this is the first hotel that I can say met our every desire. Service was the best we have ever experienced from Iliyana, Jessica, Alex in restaurants to Arecelis poolside along with Paulo at the pool, just to name a few, every employee greeted you. Any questions or requests were met immediately and followed up a short time after. The hotel is immaculately maintained.

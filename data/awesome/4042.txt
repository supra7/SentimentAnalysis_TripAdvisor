This was one of the best vacations we have ever been on! From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Everyone was at the resort was beyond courteous and super friendly! The resort was spotless and the rooms were kept spotless as well. One of the best parts of our trip was that one night when we returned back to the room, they had candles set up leading to the bed with rose pedals on the floor and bed. They also provided a bottle of champagne!! Very romantic! In our package, they also included dinner on the beach which consisted on lobster tail and steak! Amazing!!! To top it all off, the food at the resort was phenomenal. Every restaurant we went to (Italian, Steak house, Japanese, Seafood), we were blown away by how good the food was! To end the night, we ended it with one of the shows the resort put on and they were all entertaining. There were also plenty of activities to do at the resort during the day if you did not travel outside the resort for other activities. While there, we booked several activities through Amstar which is in the hotel lobby! We did an atv tour with Jungle Jim-Awesome!!, swimming with the dolphins, tulum adventure-highly recommended, and swimming with the whale sharks-this was a once in a life time experience!!! I could go on and on about how great our trip was, but if you are looking for a great place to stay, I guarantee you will be just as pleased!! Best trip we both have ever been on! Give Secrets a try, you will not be disappointed!!! One last tip, it is worth it to become a member of the preferred club. You get vip check in/check out service and you get some extra amenities that other guests do not have access to.

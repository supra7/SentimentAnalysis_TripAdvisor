I changed my reservation to this when noticed on Google maps that my car rental Avis was across the street. You will have most departement stores very close by, and the station for the monorail out to the Space Needle (1962 World Exibition Event) is less than a block away. The Swedes have a word for a little hideaway where you may enjoy the best in life; smultronstaelle. The Westin Seattle is like Westin Galleria in Houston; Hasslefree! I try to hold on to my money, but this was worth every dollar spent.

Booked two rooms at the Hilton in downtown Seattle for one night. We were arriving around 10:30 pm on Amtrak from Seattle and heading out on another train in the morning. Around 8:30 pm our train was held up because of an accident ahead of us. When I realized that it would be past midnight before we got to the hotel I called to ensure that our rooms would be held for us (enough though we had a credit card guarantee). The lady at the front desk told me that it would not be a problem. She then noted that I had requested connecting rooms with two double beds. She told me that they didn't have connecting rooms with two doubles, but had a king and two doubles that connected. I told her that it was perfect as the king would be for my wife and I and the two doubles for our two kids. Well, as the saying goes, a late train only gets later. It was just after 2 am when we finally arrived a the Hilton. The lady at the check in desk welcomed us and had our key packages all ready for us. She had me show ID and then handed me the keys. "I have had the connecting door opened for you and the beds have been turned down", she said. "I have also taken the liberty of giving you a late check out of 3 pm. Does that work for you?". I thanked her very much and we headed to our rooms and immediately went to bed for some much needed rest. Rooms were standard hotel rooms and beds were very comfortable. However, the main focus of this report is the excellent service that we received. Our needs were anticipated by the hotel staff ahead of me even asking. That is very rare in the service industry these days. Had breakfast in the restaurant the next morning and the server was very helpful with directions and things to do while in Seattle. Obviously took pride in his job and in promoting tourism in Seattle. Bell man was very helpful in getting us a larger cab for us back to the train station. Excellent, excellent service by this hotel.

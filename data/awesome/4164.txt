This was an awesome property for honeymooners!!! We stayed at building 15th in a junior swim up suite and it was amazing. If you are going doing peak season do not expect any honeymoon upgrade except the usual - champagne and flowers on your bed. The service is impecable - everything from constantly asking for drink orders to providing food everywhere including pool side - not to mention great formal restaurants like Portofino and Bourdeaux were my favorites. Hamitsu was a hibachi restarant was also good and reservation is only required if you want to get the food performance otherwise it is walking - not many people new that. Overall service and food exceeded my expectations. The night shows and night club added a great touch - classy!!! I left my brand new camera poolside and they found it and returned it!!! The work culture here had very high integrity, which made you feel very comfortable. Tips are not required but many people tipped because the staffs were so good. The only negative was they wanted to please your every wish so much that sometimes made mistakes such as another couple dinner reservations were mixed -up and my husbands lobster dinner was twice as expensive and they forgot to tell us - otherwise I would recommend this place hands down. Also - be ware lots of mosquitos, so bring long pants and lots of spray.

My husband and I just returned from a weeks stay at Secrets Maroma in Playa del Carmen. It was truly an amazing experience. All staff members were wonderful and helpful. The resort itself was impecable. The beach is truly the best. We were told the sand is actually eroded coral and that its never hot. It was so true because there were days the temperature hit 90 degrees and the sand was still cool on the feet. The beach was too die for....crystal clear turquiose water. Rooms where amazing. We truly enjoyed the double door room service cubby where they would leave your order without bothering you. Breakfast at the World Cafe every morning was such a treat. So many things for one to choose from. We especially enjoyed the crepes filled with fresh fruits...yum yum. I have been to many all inclusives in the past but this breakfast buffet was second to none....Amazing. All restaurants were amazing and no reservations are needed for any with the exception of the Hibachi at Himitsu. We never had to wait to eat, which was perfect. Coco cafe had a great selection of coffee drinks. It was a nice treat mid afternoon. Entertainment was great. Staff does a great job of making you aware of resort activities and each night you receive a pamphlet with your turn down service highlighting the next day's events. SPA was amazing. My husband and I had the couples massage. It was a perfect way to end a wonderful trip. I can't say enough about the resort. Wonderful pools, great service, amazing beach with the only down fall being having to return home after being spoiled all week. I'd like to thank our wonderful conceirge Roger (building 24) for making our stay so amazing. Thanks Roger!!!! AMAZING....AMAZING...AMAZING.

Upgraded to the concierge floor for $30 and it was well worth it. The hot and cold appetizers and free beverages were excellent quality at both dinner time and breakfast and the view is excellent. The fresh fruits were top quality and well presented. Oddly, or coincidentally, we agree with the previous reviewer about the sheets. They're way too starchy. We had no problems with housekeeping, but always, always use the Do Not Disturb sign. It's a hotel, and people come and go at all hours and the housekeeping staff has to do their jobs at all hours too. We had an excellent stay, and would recommend the Sheraton.

Had never traveled to Mexico before and what a place to start our experience! We didn't want to leave and can't wait to come back. We may never go anywhere else. Staff was magnificent and very accomodating. My spouse wanted coffemate and the concierge drove into Cancun (about 30 mi) to get him some! Beach was fantastic, accomodations were exquisite. Can't say enough. Everything was followed with; "It's a pleasure to serve you." and it really felt like it was!

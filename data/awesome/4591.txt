My husband and I went to Secrets for our honeymoon. It was perfect. The rooms were so beautiful and clean. The beds were very comfortable. As a matter of fact we both woke up the first morning thinking we were at home. Not a lot to do at night. That didn't matter much to us because we were in bed by 10:30pm. Food was very good. I've read reviews that said the AC didn't work. We didn't have a problem with that. It wasn't super cold but it was very hot and humid outside. Our room was comfortable. First night we didn't have any hot water. Maybe you just have to let it run? We took two showers and still no hot water. Wasn't a huge issue. We didn't leave the resort. There isn't much around and we were only there for 5 days so we didn't feel the need. We got a couples massage. I loved it! The spa is beautiful. I would recommend it. Don't go when you are pressed for time though. Make use of the aqua circut, sauna, etc. The ladies locker room was great.

We stayed at Le Crystal at the end of March and the website and all the reviews (as wonderful as they are) don't do this outstanding hotel justice. It was a treat from beginning to end - from the early check-in, to the chocolate covered strawberries, to the amazing service, to the room service request to bring up champagne glasses + china for coffee, cake, etc - all done with extreme professionalism and friendliness. The staff are absolutely the best. We were there for my birthday - we were originally given a free upgrade to the Superior Suite, but my son treated us to an additional upgrade to the Deluxe Suite - and what a treat it was. Ten floors up with incredible views, fabulous sitting room (we had 10 people there for drinks and hors d'ouevres and it was very comfortable), lovely mini-kitchen, incredibly comfortable bed and luxury bathroom. By the way, we got a super rate through Expedia. We had fun being tourists in our own city and enjoyed a couple of hours soaking in the roof-top hot tub and sunning ourselves on the deck - who knew we'd be able to do that in Montreal in March!!! Didn't have time to sample the Spa, but we were given a tour and it's really beautiful. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat and hope to go back again.

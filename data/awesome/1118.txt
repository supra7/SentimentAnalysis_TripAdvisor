I travel to Seattle frequently and have stayed at almost all the downtown hotels. I decided to try the Mayflower Park because they have a great bar, "Olivers," and a great restaurant "Andaluca." I made my reservations with the Reservations Manager Craig Packer and he couldn't have been nicer. We arrived late on a Friday night and had been upgraded to a lovely suite on the 12th floor! It reminded us of rooms at the much more pricey Fairmont Olympic! Since it's an older hotel, it has that European quality and from the valet to the front desk, the service is very personal and old school as well. We're definitely going to stay there again, plus the location right in the heart of the downtown shopping district is terrific! Bravo Mayflower staff...keep up the good work.

After a long flight on a terrible airline (Thomas Cook), am delighted to say the Secrets Maroma Beach Riveriera hotel beat all expectations. From gorgeous tasting food especially in the French, Itallian and seafood/steak restaurants, to a beautiful, breath taking beach and hotel altogether. To say the staff and entertainment reps could not do enough for us was an understatement. Everything and everyone were wonderful, the rooms were amazing, great beds that meant we slept amazingly and it was always the staffs pleasure to help us. I will definetly be going back. I cannot praise this hotel enough except to say this was money well spent and i recommend it to everyone!

We stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park for 2 nights mid-week. Although the exterior doesn't look great (old brick building), the inside was wonderful. The room was a decent size with a great bathroom and comfortable bed. We were on a higher floor and had a view of the Seattle Public Library. The wine hour in the afternoons was great! We attended this twice and it was fun to try Washington wines. The location is superb. Very close to Pike Market, the piers, downtown shopping, great restaurants, and a nice walk to the Space Needle. Parking was expensive but comparable to the rates at other hotels. Also - loved the wine theme as every room was named after a winery - a nice touch! Will surely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle!

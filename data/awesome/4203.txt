My husband and myself absolutely loved this place. Not action packed but simply relaxing and beautiful. Service, food, room, atmosphere everything was beyond expectation. The super blue waters, white sand beaches, awesome pools and tropical landscape all screamed paradise. We have 2 kids, so going to a adults only resort was a treat. Only advice I would give is to stake out your pool lounge chairs early because the good ones with some shade get taken pretty quickly, and although tips and everything is included a little extra especially at the pool bar goes a long way. I was looking for a family vacation just now and it made me long for a place like secrets but my husband doesn't want to take the kids to Mexico.

The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional! We had room 717, which was beautifully updated and QUIET! We traveled with our two-year-old, and we appreciated the extra help with luggage, the crib, and getting milk for our little guy's sippers. We caught the 4 a.m. Shuttle to the airport, which worked perfectly. We even swam in the heated outdoor pool despite it being 50 degrees outside. We got a good deal on our park and stay package and plan to stay a second night on our way home. Cons: none! I usually do not rate hotels with five stars across the board, but in this case I have no choice. Our stay was perfect!

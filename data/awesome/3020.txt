My girlfriend and I went for a weekend trip with another couple from Vancouver. Very friendly staff. Comfortable rooms with a very nice pillow menu :) Great touches like a complimentary cd of local bands and artwork from local artists really sets Max apart as a hotel that wants to provide a fun customer experience. Valet was great...and even let us stay significantly longer at no additional cost (extra half day). Added bonus- I love the fact they provide perks (discounts, free wifi) to people that follow them on twitter/facebook. Great way to promote themselves and interact with customers. Oh, and Red Fin is a great restaurant attached to the lobby! I will be returning here in the summer.

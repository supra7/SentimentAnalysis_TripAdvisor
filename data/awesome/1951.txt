We stayed there for one night last year. We booked at short notice via their website. I mistakenly booked a queen suite when I wanted a king. I called their reservation desk after I booked online and there was no problem exchanging it. For such a short trip myself and Mrs Majik decided to splash out and get their "Romantik" package. Check-in was swift. On arrival in the suite we were delivered a good bottle of Mumm sparking wine and a box of Theo's chocolates. Unfortunately though it seems to be a habit in North American hotels to advertise "champagne" and deliver "sparking wine", if you're fussy I'd call ahead to check. Mrs. Majik loved the chocolates so much she has spent months trying to find them in Vancouver. The package also included a 2pm checkout which is very useful when you are only staying the night. The room was a decent size and the king-size bed was bed huge. I've found hotel bathrooms in heritage style buildings tend to be a bit on the small side and this was the case in the Andra. They were well stocked with nice 'Stockholm' toiletries though. The suite also has a wet bar, desk and couch. The Andra is situated in Belltown and I don't think the website does the locale justice. The hotel fronts onto a tree-lined street with restaurants, bars and boutiques. It is within walking distance of all the major sites and attractions in downtown Seattle. That night we took the concierge's recommendation and dined at the Flying Fish, we were not disappointed. On our second afternoon we dined at the hotel restaurant Lola, for lunch. The food was good but be prepared to order a few dishes as it is a Meze (small bites) style menu. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back again next time we are in Seattle.

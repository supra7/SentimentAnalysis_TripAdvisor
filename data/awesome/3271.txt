This Hampton Inn is located very close to SeaTac Airport with a frequently-running shuttle bus. The check-in person was very personable and efficient. The lobby was relatively large, very clean, with a sitting area, computer and TV. The room was reasonably large and very clean with a comfortable bed. There was a very large, well-lit computer desk and a single chair. Free coffee and a coffee maker were in the BR. I was pleased that there was an electrical outlet right next to the bed (for a CPAP). There was also free in-room WiFi. Morning breakfast was very good. They had really good pastries (full-size donuts, maple bars, etc.), cereal, bacon, scrambled eggs, bagels, juice, coffee, etc. There was ample seating room. One really nice feature were free "breakfasts to go" in brown paper bags for travelers needing a quick getaway. There were also free newspapers (Seattle, WSJ, USA Today, etc.) This was our second stay here and we will return.

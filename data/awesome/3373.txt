As a Priceline customer I regularly get the Hilton and am always pleased. Airport pickup is prompt and friendly, I always ask for a room near the lobby and receive one with no problem. The rooms while not large are impecably clean, beds very comfortable, linens top notch. Nice easy chair and ottoman are appreciated. They've kicked up the bar menu a notch or two and have a good variety of items at reasonalbe prices and the food is excellent. Spencer's restaurant is as good as you get but can be spendy. (No worse than other fine restaurants.) A real plus is that they are located adjacent to the light rail station. You're just steps away from the train to downtown. Never a problem with airport noise. Hilton really does the job!

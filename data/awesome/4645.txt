We have been vacationing in the Playa Del Carmen and Mayan Riviera area for 7 yrs and this is by far the best resort! We went to SMB for the first time in April 2009 and loved the service and resort so much that we returned with friends in 2010. The beach is rated among the top 10 in the world and the personal service you get from the entire staff is unmatched. There are 7 restaurants on site and the food, presentation and service is top notch! There is something for everyone at SMB. The service around the pools and as well as on the beach are great - your glass is never empty! They even come around the pool and serve you appetizers - this place is heaven! We will definately be back!!

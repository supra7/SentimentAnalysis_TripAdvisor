This is a welcome destination for travelers overnighting at Seatac. We often stay here the night before an early morning flight or after an evening flight arrival, rather than make the 100-mile drive. Rooms are very comfortable and quiet. Check-in and check-out are quick and there's a thrice-hourly shuttle. However, you can also walk to the hotel through the Seatac light rail station in 15 minutes or less, depending on airline. What really distinguishes this hotel from other airport hotels is the high- quality, friendly service and the excellent food and beverage offerings. The restaurant is a very good steakhouse and the bar is convivial and well-stocked. You can also take the light rail from the adjacent station to downtown Seattle in about 25-30 minutes.

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park after we found an amazing rate directly through the hotel's website. We were a little leery about what we would end up with based on the price but we couldn't have been happier with our stay and recognize now what a great deal it was. The Hotel Vintage Park has a good location. Everything you could want to see or do in downtown Seattle is within walking distance. The hotel staff went above and beyond to help make our stay as convenient and comfortable as possible. We had a special event to celebrate during our stay and the hotel was very accomodating to all our requests Everything was done just a little better then we requested. The check in was quick and efficient. Our hotel room had a king size bed and was a great size. We had a couples massage and the massuese was able to put in two portable massage beds without moving any hotel furniture. The decor was pleasant and we enjoyed the Aveda toiletries. We appreciated that it had a little refrigerator to put our purchases from Pikes Place Market. We ordered room service the 1st night of our stay and were very pleased with the quality of the food as well as the service. Of course, the complimentary wine the lobby was a nice touch, though sometimes it was a little crowded. I can't finish any post about the Vintage Park without highlighting the amazing service that we received from Anthony, the head concierge. He really went above and beyond to answer all of our questions and we were pleased with all the recommendations he made about places to eat and things to do. This was one of the best hotel stays that we have stayed. Without a doubt, we will utilize the Hotel Vintage Park on any future trips to the Seattle area.

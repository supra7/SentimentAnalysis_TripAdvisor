We like boutique hotels and Montreal offers a lot of good choices but we tried Le Crystal because of the kitchenette with the expresso machine which we wanted for early morning risings. The standard deluxe suite was very comfortable and offers more room than many boutique hotels. The bathroom was very roomy. We found our suite clean and quiet. Lots of extras like robes, slippers, umbrella, bathroom amenities, flat screen tv, ipod playing alarm clock. Wireless internet access is complementary. The downtown location was great for our interests and needs, although a first time visitor may prefer a Vieux Montreal location. We also tried La Coupole, both the restaurant for lunch and the bar after dinner. Lunch was very good and the bar was comfortable with good service. Used the gym and enjoyed the view from the 12th floor. The outdoor hot tub looked like it would be great. Service throughout was very good. We had no complaints at all and the price at $200 per night was good value.

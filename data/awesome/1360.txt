My cousin and I stayed at the Executive her first night in Seattle, and we both loved it. The beds were comfy, room was clean, and the AC kept the room at a nice, cool temperature for a fitful sleep. The decor has an Art Nouveau feel to it, which might be a bit off-putting to people who prefer more contemporary surroundings. If you appreciate the (somewhat) unusual, you will enjoy your stay here. Staff were friendly and attentive. Location is excellent and close to Pike Place Market without being too close. Aside from typical hotel noises (neighbors opening and closing their doors as they left), we did not have to deal with anything annoying or distracting. My only complaint was the slowness of the internet speed, annoying but not a deal-breaker for me. I would definitely stay there again with out of town visitors.

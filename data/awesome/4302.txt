we arrived to be given upgrade to swimup room. beautiful pool and room. we didnt venture far from hotel for the full 14 nights , enjoyed all the restraunts and the day service around the pool . the beach was kept clean and raked every morning , the sea was clear and full of fish close to beach . never had a long wait for drinks either at the bar or waitress service , room service was great and we were tempted to stay at the room in our pool a couple of days because of great food delivered to your room . all in all a great time .

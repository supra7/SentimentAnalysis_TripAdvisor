Yet another wonderful weekend spent at a Kimpton hotel. My partner and I decided to drive to Seattle for the w/e and enjoy the downtown sights. With 3 Kimpton hotels to choose from, we opted for one neither of us had stayed at previously: the Hotel Vintage Park. It was a wonderful experience and lent itself perfectly to our much needed R & R! The staff was super - polite, friendly (without being over-the-top, trying to be your new BFF), thoughtful and quick. I needed an item, called to the desk and it was brought up to the room within 3-4 minutes. Same when we asked for restaurant suggestions - menus were delivered to our room in a matter of minutes so that we could peruse them. We opted for a Premier King room, a little larger than the regular King room. The extra space seemed a treat, no tripping over each other's things! The bed was sumptuous, so comfy and cozy with a lovely duvet to snuggle under. The high ceilings really gave the place a spacious and opulent feeling. The one less than perfect item was the placement of the toilet, right in front of the door when one walked into the BR. That seemed very odd. The morning coffee in the lounge is awesome! Really delicious and lovely to sip with the free NY Sunday Times (!!!). If you prefer, there is also hot chocolate with real whipping cream available... The front desk was very accommodating with a request for a later checkout, polite and smiling as usual. The location was great: a 5-10 minute walk from Pike Place Market and 5 minutes from the main stores. Return? In a NY minute!

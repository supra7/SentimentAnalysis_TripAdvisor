We stayed for 14 nights in this hotel for our honeymoon, and loved every minute of it.. The people and the service they provided couldn't have been better. There is 7 restaurants in the hotel, all serving amazing fresh cooked food. The room is really big with the most comfy bed and has the fridge topped up every day. Room service for drinks and food is available 24 hours. There is so much to say about this hotel, we simply couldn't fault it. Every need and want was catered for including all well none alcoholic brand names as part of the all inclusive. The beach is amazing and there are several pools with enough sunloungers for everyone. Don't miss the barefoot grill and the swim up bar is great fun. If you don't stay here, you're making a massive mistake..

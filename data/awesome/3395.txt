First the front desk staff were more than helpful. I checked in, retuned my car to Dollar (off site from airport), took the shuttle back to the airport, called the hotel for shuttle service back to the hotel and this all took me about 20 min. That included filling the car up with gas. The front desk staff gave me excellent directions! They have 24 hr shuttle service so getting to the airport for my 6:40am flight the next morning was a breeze. They leave every 30 min. The entrance to the airport is directly across the street from the hotel. I sat at the bar for dinner since I'm on East coast time and the dinning room wasn't open yet. I had the 3 little hamburgers and they were excellent! The bar snack was a generous portion of your very own tortilla chips and salsa. There are couches over stuffed chairs in front of a fireplace in the bar area so you don't have to sit "at the bar" or even at one of the tables to enjoy the time and relax. I had a sleep number king bed that was very comfortable and even though my room faced the airport I had a quiet night of sleep. The room is very nicely furnished; not worn and very clean. I didn't park overnight, but the person checking in before me did and it cost her $10.00. No hang tag no parking entry code or card required, just a parking lot..just saying.

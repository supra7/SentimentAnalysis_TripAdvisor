In my world, cozy is the highest form of praise for a space. The lounge, the bar, the restaurant, and the rooms all had that dialed. Classy, yet welcoming. Great service, but not overly formal. Not cramped, not cavernous. Just all around comfortable. Also, fresh ground coffee and a french press in the rooms! Great touch. I was there with large and exuberant bunch of friends and they handled us with aplomb. Definitely my top choice now of places to stay in Seattle.

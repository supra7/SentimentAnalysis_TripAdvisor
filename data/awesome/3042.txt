We originally booked a room before our Alaskan cruise and once we were there also booked for our couple days after the cruise. It is a unique hotel with a staff that is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We were impressed! The rooms were a bit small but clean, comfy with choice of pillow types and spiritually readings too. Each door is uniquely painted and the room key also is used to access the elevator. There were always staff greeting us as we entered and left on various journeys in Seattle and even helped us with bus routes to get to specific sites. The front desk folks always greeted us and we quickly checked in and out. Wi-fi access at hotel and restaurant was nice to have too. The Red Fin restaurant next door to the hotel serves delicious food attractively served. The sushi was yummy. There are options for a variety of foods to from seafood to burgers. Breakfasts were delicious too and prompt friendly service kept us eating there often during our stay. It even spoiled us a little for the cruise food. The hotel is an easy walk to/from the Westin hotel where we caught the Downtown Airporter bus to the airport. We would enjoy staying at the Hotel Max on future trips to Seattle.

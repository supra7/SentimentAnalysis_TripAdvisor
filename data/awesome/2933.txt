We stayed at this hotel with my starwood points for 1 night in September 2004. WE LOVED IT! I can't be sure if our room was typical, but we had what I considered to be a fairly spacious, corner room with wall-to-wall windows (which had ample covering to shut out the light for sleep), and great amenities. We had a view over the city, and the location was good, though we didn't spend much time in the immediate environs... The staff were typical W staff, with slightly cooler demeanors, but certainly not rude or stuffy. Notably, the bellman was very helpful with our loads of luggage (we stayed just 1 night, but were completing a week long trip)! Next trip to Seattle, I will definitely try to stay at the W!

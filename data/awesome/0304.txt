After a fishing trip to Alaska, my wife and I stopped off for three nights in Seattle (we're from North Carolina and wanted to visit this beautiful West Coast Mecca). We've been to Seattle before and knew that downtown hotels can be pricey, so we chose the Warwick which has an excellent location and is inexpensive ($135/night on the internet before taxes). It was a good decision. The Warwick is located close to Pike's Place and the Seattle Museum of Art (two "must" sees). The hotel is a little dated, but is well maintained. The staff is efficient and friendly. We had a 10th floor view of the Space Needle which we enjoyed. We wholeheartedly recommend staying here if you're looking for a first class hotel in a good location (excellent in hotel restaurant and others close by, Pike's Place, the Metro, the Space Needle and SAM). Next time we visit Seattle, this is the place we'll stay. PS: be sure to take a ride on the Duck-an bus/boat-which you'll see touring around. It's as fun as it looks and cost about $28/person for a land, lake ride-the drivers are funny, energetic and good natured).

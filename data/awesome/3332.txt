July 2006 - We stayed at the Courtyard the night before our Princess cruise to Alaska and were very pleased with the hotel. When we arrived at the Sea-Tac airport, we called for the free hotel shuttle and it arrived about 15 minutes later (we were told 20 minutes so it was early). Driver was very friendly. It was only a 10 minute trip from the airport to the Courtyard. Check-in was fast. Only problem was I thought we could get a free shuttle to the cruise ship but it was too far. But the desk staff did arrange a Town Car service to pick us up next morning. We were guaranteed a non-smoking room and got one. No smell of smoke at all. Room was large with 2 queen beds with down quilts, an overstuffed chair, desk and chair, vanity mirror and bureau with t.v. on it. Very clean. Bathroom was 2-part with toilet and tub/shower in one large room, with the sink and mirror in a separate area outside. Made it convenient. Dinner at Charley's restaurant in the hotel was good and reasonably priced--Western burger with fries and Patty Melt with fries each under $8.95. Breakfast buffet was good too with bread, bagels, omelet bar, fruit, hot and cold cereal, yogurt. We were very pleased with the hotel--especially the cleanliness--and would definitely stay here again.

Stayed one night before heading west. In order after our arrival: The valets were excellent. The check-in was very smooth; we were upgraded for no particular reason, which was nice. We had to use a keychain LED flashlight to find our room, however, since the hallways were so dark. And this was mid-afternoon. Still, the room itself was excellent. Nice window seat, no awful polyester florals, super comfy bed. We had drinks and a snack in the lobby bar before dinner -- good. If you are easily intimidated by trendy young things, the lobby bar might not be for you, as it was full of them on a Saturday night. We grabbed dinner suggestions and a reservation to Metropolitan Grill via the concierge. Good job there, if a little non-committal about where we ought to go. Breakfasted in the restaurant the next am -- very civilized, if pricey.

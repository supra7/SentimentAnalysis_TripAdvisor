We had a wonderful 7-night stay at Secrets Maramo in July: it was our wedding-moon get-away and everything about the place was just fantastic. The service was outstanding, and the people were super friendly and helpful at every turn (even one fellow went to a local store near his home for us for a hard-to-find item that we needed). Our wedding coordinator was Valeria, and she helped make the whole experience magical and hassle-free. We stayed at a swim-out room, which was awesome, and our package included the Preferred Club- which is the most excellent check-in experience we've ever had. We went with Antonio at Adventure Photo, and that experience was also terrific: he and his staff were very professional and he went out of his way to get some wonderful pictures of our special day. He made the photo session really easy and fun and we highly recommend him there. Terrific value as well by working with Adventure Photo! We were truly wowed by the experience and definitely will be going back!

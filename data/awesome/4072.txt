The hotel is amazing!!! We went to celebrate our "Silver Wedding Anniverary" The staff made us feel so welcome and special from the minute we arrived at the door. All the staff are so friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them! The food is excellent in all the restaurants our favourite was the French and Japanese. There is really nothing negative I say about the place. We stayed for a week but next time it will be at least 10 days as we didn't want to leave!

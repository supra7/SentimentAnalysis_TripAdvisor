I have stayed in numerous htels in Montral. This one is top notch. Forget about the Hotels chains or the online supersearches. This is the one you want to check in for a romantic stay or for an all girls night in town or a family stay near the Bell Center for a hockey game (what else). The Blue Lotus aroma in the lobby is divine, the room well designed, the bathroom spa-quality, even the Nespresso machine is delivering quality. The top floor terrasse with whirlpool and view to the city and Mont-Royal is relaxing before more shopping or dining out, any day f the week!!!

We had 3 awesome days here we will never forget. Of course my wife had to let them know we were celebrating my 50th. Soon after we checked in the champagne was knocking at the door. 2nd day the same happened. Service here is on top of the top. (if that was not proper English - it is now!) Awesome place to relax.....and hey - bring your pet. They get red carpet too!

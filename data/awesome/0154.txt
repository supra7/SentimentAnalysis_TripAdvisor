I have stayed in other Kimpton hotels and am always extremely pleased with them. This stay was for leisure with my young son and they made each and every one of us feel comfortable and welcome. Kimpton goes out of their way to make their hotel different (the goldfish in your room, the wine hour, the pet friendly environment, the complimentary toy from the toy box for the kids, etc...) but mostly they strive to serve and make you comfortable. Their staff are really friendly and helpful. The lobby is gorgeous and the beautiful books will keep anyone entertained while waiting for others (even a 2 year old!). They had great coffee and tea choices in the lobby and hot cocoa for the afternoon (with mini marshmallows and chocolate chips), which also encouraged lingering! The queen rooms are not huge but are well appointed. The location is excellent - 4 blocks from Westlake Center and 1 block from the train/bus tunnel which makes everything very convenient. The parking is valet and although it seems steep at $36, but was well worth it when you return to your already-packed car during check-out! Plus, they let you leave your car in the garage until 11 PM on the day of check-out, so essentially you can park for 2 full days for the price.

We stayed at the Inn for a weekend in the middle of September. Even though the hotel is in the front of the famous Pike Market, it is very peaceful and quiet. Our double bed ocean view room on the fifth floor was comfortable, very clean and generous in size. All employees at the hotel are very friendly, helpful and caring. The hotel has a small cute courtyard and a rooftop terrace with amazing ocean and city views. The location is a perfect base for exploring the old and new Seattle. We love everything about the Inn and will definitely come back !

Believe it or not I only stayed here for about 7 hours. I got screwed with an extremely LONG layover and was not about to spend my day at the airport. I booked a room at a hotel that had a shuttle service and Embassy's have always been reliable. Shuttle driver was prompt and a great guy. Check-in was smooth, fast, the two gals working were great. The hotel itself is an older embassy( i used to work at Embassy Suites La Vista Nebraska) so I find it easy to see the difference. Old none the less the hotel was clean, great decor, rooms were updated and perfect. I had just enough time to go to the managers reception before I left and the two working were such a treat. I checked out later that day, the front desk seemed a little confused that I checked in and checked out the same day but I explained it to them. Probably thought I was crazy but oh well. Wish I could have stayed longer, will plan on it next time that's for sure.

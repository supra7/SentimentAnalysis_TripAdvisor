What a change to have a Hotel anticipate your needs and dive right in to make your stay over the top! From the apples given happily to my kids by the staff at the front desk, to the umbrella and water bottles placed kindly into the car for us....Crystal went above and beyond our expectations. Thank you.....we'll be seeing you again soon! (the only down side is that my LOVELY children have to come back down to earth now that we're home!!!)

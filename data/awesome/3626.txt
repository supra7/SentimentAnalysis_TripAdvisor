My girlfriend and I usually find motels on the fly via the coupon books or the internet from our phone. As soon as we walked in, the staff immediately greeted us and made us feel welcomed. The manager was working and asked if we were planning to visit anywhere so he can provide us with coupon books and recommended a few local places to see and eat. The room was clean, but there was hair left in the shower drain. This was a bit disgusting. The mattress was a pillow top and was the most comfortable mattress I slept on in a motel for under $100 per night. So when we paid $29 per night, we were excited. The room also came with a king bed, mini refrigerator, LCD TV, desk, iron and ironing board, and toaster oven. The pool was clean and uncrowded, but a little small; the building was very quiet and clean. Having stayed in many motels, I can truly say this is one motel I look forward to staying at again.

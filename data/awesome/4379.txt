A perfect honeymoon, honestly. Everything was just as beautiful as the brochure showed. It's hard trying to find that special place, they all look the same in the travel agency guides, but this place...just wow. Me and my wife are planning a trip back to Secrets with her parents next year. The staff was soooo friendly and filled our every need. Even talking to other guests, we heard that they had been to numerous resorts, but nothing that matched the service here. From goofy poolside games to awesome shows at the theater at night, to a baby turtle release on the white sand beach, (we named ours Paul! ) we loved every minute of it. Exceptional service, room service, pool and beach side service, top shelf drinks, delicious restaurants catering to every type of cuisine. mmm, that breakfast with a shot of Tequila I miss.

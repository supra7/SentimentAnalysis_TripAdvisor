From the moment we checked in I knew this was going to be a good experience. The clerk at check-in was nothing short of sensational. The room was very large and very clean and very comfortable. I tried the hotel resturant my first night. Wow! My experience with other hotels has been to avoid hotel food. This is not the case at the Hotel Monaco's Sazerac. The food and service were excellent, in fact I ate here 3 of my four nights in town. I highly recommend this hotel with its caring staff and excellent food. Go Monaco!

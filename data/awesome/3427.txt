If you look for a modern, comfortable hotel near Schneberg district this a place to be. Spacious, clean and modern rooms. Super comfy beds and spacious bathroom. Excellent breakfast, almost like brunch for only 12,5 eur. Very friendly, no frills staff. I highly recommend! Only minus that the bathroom did not have bidet shower.

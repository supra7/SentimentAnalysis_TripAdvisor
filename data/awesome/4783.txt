We thought that our trip to Aruba was the best vacation spot, until we stayed at the Secrets Resort in Maroma Beach. We could not find one thing that we would not rate as Excellent/Outstanding. We would definitely come back to stay at this beautiful resort! The different choices in the restaurants gave us a good variety for eating out. It was nice to sit out at the pool or beach and have the staff offer you different things to try. The staff was always polite and very helpful.

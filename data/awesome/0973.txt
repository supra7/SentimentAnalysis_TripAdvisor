This venerable brick building served originally (in the early 1900s) as household quarters for automobile mechanics. There were other uses before its renovation as a hotel. Excellent value on Priceline: about $60 (vs current $149, less 10% AAA). Old building, wood floors creaky on occasion if you care. Occasional "bumps" perhaps in plumbing. Downsides: expensive ($20 valet-only / but secure, off-street) parking. Other reviewers complain of street noise but my room faced on Queen Anne Avenue at ground level and I experienced no disturbing noise. Earplugs and heavy drapes provided. No elevators; bell staff will help you to upper-floor (or to any) rooms, or ask for a first-floor room. Upsides: easy access to public transportation; a free scheduled shuttle to Pike Market, downtown/Westlake, Convention Center, Ferry Teminal; walk to Seattle Center/OperaHouse/Space Needle/Theatres. Safeway, Starbucks, Bank of America and many restaurants within two blocks. Very spacious well-lighted rooms (I estimate 750 sq ft, with large living/bedroom, ample kitchen/dining/work area, sizable bathroom, walk-in closet with terry robes); king beds, sofa, big TV, nice bathroom linens and unusual amenities, a kitchen area with dishes andflatware, apartment refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee, microwave, sink, charming decor. Easy working temperature adjustment. Friendly staff. Guest laundry in sister hotel (Inn at Queen Anne), 2 blocks. Flawless free wireless (about 1/5 of home high-speed, depends on user traffic and probably slower in summer) but ample for me). Generous included continental breakfast, generous hours. Newspaper at door each morning.

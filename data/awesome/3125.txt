After reading several really bad reviews, I bit the bullet and booked anyway. I have to say, kindness/service may be a season thing w/ this hotel, b/c I stayed during November, and service was incredible. Front desk, concierge, housekeeping, was all spectacular. Granted, one could tell there was hard feelings about booking through a travel website instead of directly through them, but that was just a small thing. It's location - PERFECT. Close to shopping, dining, and all the major tourist attractions. The room - although not fancy, it served it's purpose very well. I would highly recommend this hotel if it is not in their busy season, which appears to be late fall or winter.

We read reviews, looked at maps, and asked friends who had traveled to Seattle. The Mayflower Park Hotel was an easy and wise choice for us. Returning from a l0-day cruise, we needed a comfortable, well-located place to spend a few days. We were not disappointed. Our room was an upgrade, everyone associated with the hotel was extremely helpful, and the location allowed us to do all of the things we had planned for our Seattle Get-a-Way.

We spent a week at the Inn at the Market. We then went to Vancouver for a week, then returned to the Inn at the Market for another day. We truly enjoyed each and every moment there. The location is superior. It is a half block from the Pike Street Market. It is also a block from a bus stop. It is within walking distance from the downtown terminus of the light rail (about 4 blocks). There is a selection of restaurants in the immediate area. The stadiums are about a half hour walk from the Inn at the Market. The waterfront is even closer. In other words, the location of awesome. The rooms were very cozy and clean. The staff came around and asked if we wanted our bed turned down and left chocolates each day. The entire staff from the front desk to the cleaning staff were friendly and kind. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any visitor. There is also a rooftop patio with planty of seating and a great view of Puget Sound as well as the Pike Street Market. There are only 70 rooms so each guest gets plenty of attention. I will stay there again.

Me and my husband returned to this hotel after having a fantastic honeymoon last year and decided to return for our first anniversary.. There was nothing we could fault at all.. the food was still amazing, the staff we're outstanding.. The room survice was outstanding.. we actually left our phones out on charge and left our safe open buy accident and nothing was touched.. so trustworthy As this is our second time we will not be returning for a few years but can definately say in the future we will... BEST CHILD FREE HOLIDAT EVER!!!!

My wife and I have stayed here the last 5 times we've been to Seattle. It is an excellent hotel to stay at. It is very central so you can walk to the Downtown department stores, to Pikes Place Market, and many of the Theatres. The Monorail is nextdoor and there are scads of good restaurants close by, including Oliver's and Andaluca which are part of the Mayflower. Rooms are quite comfy, but not overly spacious, unless you book the suites. Service is first class and the rates are excellent. Most packages include parking and a delicious breakfast for two. We used to stay at other hotels in Seattle, but not anymore.

Our weekend stay was part of our honeymoon and we were completely pleased with the staff, rooms and ammenities. The bar/restaurant downstairs has two great happy hours (I believe daily) that make for a fun and vibrant stay. The rooms are very chique and the decor is neat and artistic. Walked to all major attractions or caught one of the free downtown buses. Alex the front office manager took care of us very well and I would definitely return as a result. In fact I am writing this review because of how pleased we were.

I stayed at W a couple of times attending company meetings. The location is very good (just blocks from Convention Center) and close to everything. The service is very good and the staff very friendly. The room is very nice and during my last trip I had the luck to be in one with a nice view to the space needle. Although I didn't have enough time, on the ground floor sometimes you will find a DJ playing music while you have a drink, really cool.

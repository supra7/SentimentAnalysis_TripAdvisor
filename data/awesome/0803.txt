Me and my wife try to stay there every February and love it, you get to meet alot of cool people at breakfast and there is a certain amount of commraderie that comes with community bathrooms, and please remember that ALL hotel bathrooms are community bathrooms. Breakfast was refreshing ( doesn't weigh you down all day ) and it is close to everything, bars and nightlife are all within walking distance and the staff had good suggestions. This is not for everyone but if you are cool and like other cool people and don't mind sharing or interacting with other humans than this is the place for you

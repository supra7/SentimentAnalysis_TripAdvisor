We stayed at the Inn for 2 nights and were not disappointed. It had a great location right at Pikes Market but also within walking distance of most other attractions and lots of shopping. The service was excellent from the time we arrived until the time we left. We were greeted daily by the bellmen and lobby staff. I personally felt that the staff went out of their way to accommodate us. My mother is in a wheel chair and where the hotel is located is very hilly and the bellman knew we were having trouble with the chair and the hills, so he gave us a key to the back door that was not on a slope so we could get the chair in and out without any effort. This is exactly the type of service that you can come to expect from an amazing place and staff like this hotel has. The bed was incredible - the best nights of sleep we've ever had away from home. We had our own private rooftop deck that was huge and so beautiful to take pictures from or just take in the amazing views. I would recommend the ocean/Pikes view rooms, as the sight every morning is breathtaking. Not only would I stay here again, but I wouldnt stay anywhere else!

Another positive experience at a Kimpton hotel! Very nice hotel, wonderful view from our room, comfy bedding, good shower, and super clean (and we're finicky). The staff is exceptional all the way down the line. Anthony the manager was so kind and accommodating to us at check in, filled all our requests. Front desk staff is friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff efficient, door men really courteous. Everyone greets you and wants to go the extra mile for you. Got to the wine tasting one night of our stay and it was nice, even though the lobby is pretty small. The location is perfect! Easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, art museum, Pioneer Square, waterfront and aquarium, and across the street from the famous library. Tons of good restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood, easy and safe walk even at night. Highly recommend Wild Ginger, Pink Door, Cafe Campagne. We would definitely choose this hotel on our next trip to Seattle, and recommend it to all our L.A. friends.

I went here for my honeymoon. It was Unbeleiveable. The hotel and grounds is gorgeous. The staff was extremely friendly and accomadating. They knew are names and everyone spoke English very well. The food was at a higher level then any other all inclusive I have ever been too. The spa was the best. If you are looking for a beautiful relaxing vacation this is the place to go.

I only stayed at this hotel for one night, but I really liked it. The room was very comfortable, albeit VERY tiny. But it was quiet and clean. Just a bit of a squeeze for the two of us that stayed there. The bathroom had a couple of design flaws but overall it was great. The door was at such and angle that you ran the risk of banging your knees while using the toilet. And just like the room it was small, but it was bright and clean and had nifty little towel shelves in the corner. The showerhead was actually tall enough to stand under instead of needing to crouch down and contort to get under it. The front desk and housekeeping staff were very friendly and efficient. I arrived 2 hours before check-in time so I had to wait, but they had lots of big squishy chairs to sit in while I waited. Then during check in, they took guests in the order they arrived. So the people who'd been waiting since 9:00 in the morning got to go first. My only real complaint is that it is a bit tricky to get to. Especially if you end up going down the road by the Holiday Inn. Finding a place to turn around and come up the right side of the road wasn't the easiest thing.

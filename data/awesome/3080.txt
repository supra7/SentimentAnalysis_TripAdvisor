"I have never had anyone work so quickly and effortlessly to make sure my needs were met." I am a frequent guest of the Hotel DeLuxe in Portland and thoroughly enjoy it. So when my business travels extended recently into Seattle, it seemed only natural to stay at the Hotel Max. I was pleased and thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay. When I was checking out at approximately 4:30 a.m., the front desk manager informed me that my car was stuck in the parking garage due to a malfunction of the elevator system. He said he had already called an elevator service, but due to the time of day, he had received no response. When I told him I needed to get to the airport to catch a 6:00 a.m. flight, he merely shook his head in agreement, made a phone call, and had a car at the front of the Hotel within ten minutes to take me to the airport free of charge. He also agreed to return my rental car to the airport when it was freed from the parking garage. He never hesitated for one moment trying to figure out what to do. I have never had anyone work so quickly and effortlessly to make sure my needs were met. There was no stress, no hesitation, no questioning. He handled everything with grace and extreme ease. My kudos to your staff and your management skills. I am looking forward to my next visit to Seattle.

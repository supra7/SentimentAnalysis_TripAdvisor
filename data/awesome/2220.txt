A friend took me to the Sorrento's Fireside Room for drinks on one of my visits to Seattle, so I knew I wanted to stay there when I visited again. This time, I met my sister from Montana (I'm from California) for a three-day weekend for her January birthday. We both loved the vintage feel, character, and elegance of the 100-year-old hotel. The Fireside Room, where we had wine each evening, paneled in original mahogany and filled with comfy furniture is warm and inviting. Our birthday dinner in the hotel's Hunt Club restaurant was excellent, and the waiter remembered to put a candle in my sister's dessert as I had requested earlier. Our room with two queens was fresh and lovely, the beds, loaded with pillows, wonderfully comfortable. The staff was friendly and efficient, especially the maintenance man, who fixed our TV channel problem immediately, and concierge Kody Kidd, who quickly answered all my pre-visit questions. If you like a smaller, historic hotel, a warm, friendly atmosphere, and elegant accommodations, you'll like the Sorrento. I'll go back for sure on my next trip to Seattle.

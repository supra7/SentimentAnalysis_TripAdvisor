What a fabulous resort!! We loved everything about it. The swimming - pools & beach - and the food are of the finest quality. We ate lobster & scallops nearly every evening. The service is excellent & they are very friendly & kind. I was not well initially & boy did they look after me - especially Edgar in Cafe World. The room we had was so spacious & comfortable. Other guests are friendly & respectful. Meet & greet was a little disappointing however & the isolation & awful access could be mitigated by more regular & free or cheaper transport to Cancun & Playa del Carmen for shopping, alternative eating out & entertainment. Having said that, it was hard to ever want to leave the place because it has everything you need. Good internet access in the lobby, mean mojitos & evening entertainment enhanced the pleasant ambience. I wish we had booked longer. Try though to fly with a nice airline. I booked late & could only get a Thomsons flight. We hated it - it was completely out of kilter with the quality offered by Secrets Maroma. Watch the shopping, too, in Playa - don't get duty free there. I may have more to say about the shopping on another page, pending outcomes. Also, know where you stand with the Mexican departure tax - no one seemed able to give us accurate information about this. But all of this did not detract from what was a brilliant holiday in a fabulous resort. It was paradise.

Absolutely beautiful. First class in every sense. Wonderful food, unsurpassed service, beautiful location; I could go on for hours. It was just a wonderful experience for us. We took advantage of the Save the Children dinner at Bordeaux (I believe every Tuesday night; $40/person but what a meal; and it all goes to charity), and it was outstanding. That said, our best meal may have been at Oceana. The service (and food) was amazing. Every time I finished a glass of champagne, our waiter, Misael, was waiting to refill it. He was outstanding (everyone was great, really beyond our expectations, but he deserves a special bit of recognition). We had a swimout room in the Preferred Club section; well worth it. Even though every room in our building was full, it felt like our own private pool (the whole resort was remarkably peaceful and quiet). Preferred Club gets you into a nice, A/C lounge with high end cocktails, a very nice continental breakfast, great food throughout the day, concierge for the building, etc. On check in, we were initially "upgraded" to an oceanfront room (without pool). It was beautiful and the view was beyond compare; however, we just really wanted a swimout pool, so second night we switched (they were very accomodating; we simply wanted the swimout)). Beach was absolutely perfect. Honestly, everything was. I can't imagine anyone not loving this place. We can't wait to get back.

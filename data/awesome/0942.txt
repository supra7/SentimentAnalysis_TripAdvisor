I was in town on a climbing trip and this was 'base camp'. Much of the property is converted apartments, so many of the rooms have large kitchens and sitting rooms. Wood floors, period furniture, and a somewhat quirky layout make this one of the most charming places I have stayed at. It's a short walk to Seattle Center and the Space Needle, as well as Queen Anne with its fantastic restaurants, shops, and yoga studios. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful as I bumbled through the lobby after 3 days on the mountain, with 100 lbs of wet gear. Very much felt like home.

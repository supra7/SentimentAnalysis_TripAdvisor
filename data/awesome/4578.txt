Just back from a week at Secrets Maroma. Had a swim-up in building 12. Perfect location. Room was amazing. Beach was the best I have ever seen. Pool was grandiose. Food was excellent. Drinks were a plenty. The service was out of this world! Congratulations to all the staff for making us feel like a million bucks! I will recommend and surely come back to Secrets Maroma

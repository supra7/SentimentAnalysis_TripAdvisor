My husband booked this hotel for my birthday last March. It was our very first trip to Seattle and we wanted a hotel that was close to everything. Boy, this hotel was IT! From the moment we arrived, we were greeting by the finest staff imaginable. Check in was smooth, informative and friendly. We arrived to our room to find that not only did it have beautiful views, there were little cupcakes and a handwritten card waiting for me as a birthday treat! This hotel was darling, absolutley perfect in every way. The rooms were clean and well kept, the staff was amazing and the location was unbelievably prefect! I am a kindergarten teacher with very little time off, but the next time I have a free weekend, this will be the place I come. It's been almost a year since we've been and we can't stop talking about it! Thank you to everyone for making my birthday so memorable!

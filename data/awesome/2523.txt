Booked through Starwood using the cash and Starwood points option. Stayed five nights. I was in town for a wedding and business. Early check-in was not a problem. I was given a king room on the 23rd floor of the North Tower (this floor is for Starwood Preferred Guest members only). Room was immaculate except for some stains on the carpet, but you can't change the flooring after every visitor. Big room with a sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Bathroom was spacious and well-stocked. Awoke each morning staring at the Space Needle and a vista-view of the harbor through a huge bank of windows. Natural light during the day eliminated the need to use lights. Bed was fabulous. All hotel staff were cheerful and helpful. Only complaint is that concierge staff should have a better understanding of the bus system. Room service menu was a bit slim late at night, but food wasn't bad since it came from two in-house restaurants. Very nice bar and huge lobby. Location is very good. A short walk to Pike Place and a two-minute walk to Monorail. Light rail to Lake Union across the street and bus lines run by the hotel. Easy to get a cab out front or with the help of the valet guys. My only major complaint is the hotel's charge for Internet access and use of the business center. This is obviously a trend, but I would have thought as a SPG member using points that I would have been given free 'Net and business center access. You can print your boarding pass for free, so that's a positive.

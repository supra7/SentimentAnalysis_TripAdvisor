This was a 40th birthday vacation. We had a group of 8 and your hotel was very accomodating to our large group. Your staff is very friendly and willing to do anything to please. The rooms and guest areas were clean, as well as the entire resort. We ALL want to make this annual trip, and hopefully bring some newbees with us next time. I could go on and on. THANK YOU for a fabulous stay!!!

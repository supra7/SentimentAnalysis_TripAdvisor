I have stayed at this hotel twice on business trips - one lasting 7 days, the other 4 days, and thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and well designed. (I particualrly wish I could have brought my family and young son since the bedroom has a separate door and the kitchette stocked with plates and silverware would be particularly helpful for a family vacation). The bathroom was very well-appointed and the soaking tub (with bath crystals was both spotless and relaxing). I had many late evening room service dinners and found the delivery timely and food to be very good (especially considering that by electing room service you are turning down the many great culinary options Montreal offers). The breakfast buffet while not extensive was also good. The health club is small but clean and nice and the pool appears lovely and not crowded. Staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Even though I have traveled on business, by staying a Le Crystal, I feel it's a tiny bit of vacation as well.

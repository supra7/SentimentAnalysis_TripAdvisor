This was my 4TH TIME to SMB and it was fabulous! This time I traveled with my spouse only and no friends. The check-in process was the best ever. We were quickly whisked away in a golf cart to the Preferred Club and advised our room would be ready in 30 minutes. And it was! We were in building 26 with a partial ocean view, one of the best views around. We were also welcomed with a bottle of champagne for our Anniversary and vouchers for the spa, wine and photos! Our concierge Carlos was terrific. We have never had a concierge as attentive, sweet and accomodating as him! He always went out of his way to make sure we were happy. We were happy to recognize staff from our prior visits. Edgar at the World Cafe greeted us every day at breakfast and always went out of his way to make sure we had an enjoyable dining experience. Neydi at the lobby bar is a doll and we were thrilled to see her again. We had alot of fun getting to know some of the new staff and their nicknames. Some of our favorites are Erick (Hombre Lobo), William (Calle Trece), and Roberto (Celia de Cuba). Be sure to book the Hibachi table at the Himitsu restaurant as soon as you arrive as they book up fast. We enjoyed dining at Bordeaux, Oceana and Portofino twice. We loved eating at Seaside Grill for lunch. Also, what other AI has chefs serving food in kayaks in the pools! Yes! I have pictures to prove it! If you're in need of spa treatments, this is the place to go! The spa by Pevonia is amazing. We booked a sports massage and swedish massage and had the luxury of enjoying the hydrotherapy circuit (sauna, steam room, pressure shower). Highly recommended! My only complaint is the AC in the lobby and restaurants needs to be turned down. There were numerous nights my husband was sweating in the restaurants since he had to were long pants and it was too hot. We made some good friends here and hope to come back again next year!

The Vintage Park is a boutique hotel. They emphasize some aspects of the experience and entirely ignore others. There is no gym or vending machines. On the other hand, there is excellent and friendly service. There is creative and tasteful use of fabrics and colors in the rooms making them feel far warmer than the usual corporate designed, big chain, big name hotels. While the hotel overall is relatively small, our standard room was quite spacious. The HDTV and the plush robes were a nice touch. Also, the wine tastings each evening were very well conducted with a knowledgeable host and good wines. We've had other tastings in hotels that were nowhere near as professional. The only negative aspect of our stay was that the bed was soft. Another negative, though not the hotel's fault, is that even at the ninth floor, traffic noise such as firetrucks and ambulances was clearly discernable. The attached Italian restaurant, Tulios, was excellent. I highly recommend it. Not cheap but worth every dime. If you don't mind walking a bit, the location is very good and safe. It is centrally located about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the Pike's Public Market and a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum. The free downtown public buses are nearby and can save you a lot of walking if you're not in shape to handle the urban hills of Seattle. I would definitely feel comfortable returning to this hotel.

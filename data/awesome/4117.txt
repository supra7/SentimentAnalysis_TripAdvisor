Me and my boyfriend went here for our first holiday. Most of the people are on their honeymoon or getting married out there but that didn't stop us having an amazing time. We found we were the youngest couple in the hotel, but this only made us get on superb with the entertainment team. We did activities with them every day and took a trip to Coco Bongos which was really good value and a fun night all round. We had the junior suite which was the most basic room, but it was perfect. Reading previous reveiws I was a bit worried about the bathroom situation as the toilet does not have a proper door, however there is a fan in there and so that was not an issue at all. The food was amazing. I would recommend to anyone that they go to the japanese restaurant and try the fried ice cream!! We was not overly impressed with the Mexican restaurnt, simply because the menu did not appeal to us, however they did do a nice steak,. We took a tour around the spa and it was top of the range, however it came across as over-priced and so we did not book any treatments on our trip. Would definitely recommend to any couple to take a trip here as they are sure to have a wonderful time. We also had photos taken by the photographer there to give us perfect memories of a perfect holiday!

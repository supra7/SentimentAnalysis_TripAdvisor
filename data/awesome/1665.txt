I moved to the Seattle Sheraton after two awful nights at the Westin Seattle. A devoted Starwood member, I have always understood Westins to be of higher calibres than Sheratons. In this comparison, it's exactly the opposite. Huge and beautifully appointed, the Sheraton Seattle is at the center of everything; Nordstrom, Niketown, City Centre mall, Pacific Place mall and a very short, straight walk to Pike Place Market. If you don't feel like leaving the hotel, the gym is AMAZING and the pool quite inviting - I wished I had brought my suit. Of the two towers, ask to stay on the renovated side. As a Platinum Starwood member, I enjoyed a generous, delicious spread each morning for breakfast in the Club Lounge and cocktails each evening. Hotel also features a convenience store shop to buy sandwiches and light fare, as well as an attached restaurant, the Daily Grill (although ridiculously priced), and a gift shop. One of the very best features of all, however, is the free Internet Link on four house computers in the lobby. LOVED this hotel.

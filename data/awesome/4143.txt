If someone doesn't like staying at this hotel they will be disappointed when they get to heaven. The views, grounds, beach, pool, food, service etc. was all amazing. Here are some of the specifics I loved about this resort. 1. The soaking tub on the balcony was incredible. So romantic and great after a long day in the sun. 2. The pool area is big enough that every day feels different from the one before. One day you can sit by the bar and take shots, the next you can lay in a beach bed secluded in the jungle type area, one day you can sit in a lawn chair that is located in shallow pool water. It never felt repetitive. 3. Every night out with my boyfriend felt like a new romantic date. The restaurants all have different feels and they are all equally awesome. I got super dressed up and we would go grab drinks somewhere before our dinner just like you would on a date. 4. You really are treated like royalty. I felt as though my boyfriend and I were the first guests the hotel had ever had. 5. For as popular as this resort is there was never a very long wait. The waiters are attentive. The bars rarely have more than a few people ahead of you. One time we had to wait 20 minutes for a table to eat. But who cares? You grab a drink and look at the ocean. 6. This resort is TOTALLY couples friendly. You didn't feel silly stealing a kiss at the pool or sharing a lawn chair at the beach. 99% of the people there were there for romance. It doesn't mean people didn't have fun (we had our fair share of drinks). 7. It was also all age friendly. My boyfriend and I are 25 and we never felt too young. There were all ranges of age groups there! There is a 100% chance I will be returning to this resort. I have stayed at multiple all inclusives and something was always missing. It wasn't romantic, the beach was average, the food was so so, it was all spring breakers etc. Secrets Maroma is perfection!

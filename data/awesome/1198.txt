This is an older hotel so the rooms are not large. Bathroom was a little on the small side, as was the TV. Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower. The bed in our room was very comfortable -- better than your average 3* hotel bed -- & they also provided bathrobes. We stayed during a snowstorm so we really appreciated the fact that the hotel has a good restaurant (Andalucia -- Spanish tapas) with excellent food & reasonable prices. There's also quite a good bar. We found the staff to be very friendly & helpful, plus the hotel is in a great location right in the center of Seattle. I'd highly recommend this hotel as great value for money.

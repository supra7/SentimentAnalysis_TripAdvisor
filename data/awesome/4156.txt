We have just had two lovely weeks at this hotel. It helped that there were no delays on our 10 hour flight out, we went with Thomas Cook. The hotel is really lovely, very clean and the decor is not overly ornate but all very stylish. Our room was excellent, we requested quiet and that is what we got, again very clean, had no problems with any critters in the room. On arrival, and after booking in we were taken to the VIP Service and given vouchers (which we knew we would not use) and had to sign for them but made it plain we knew it was a time share promotion, and after that we were left alone - no phone calls or other harassment! We went to the beach most days, and did not reserve our beds but had no trouble getting two, and in fact some people were reserving beds and we did not see anyone have their belongings removed, this must be when hotel very busy. The pools were all lovely. We did not have a swim up room but having read reviews can see that a lot of them do not get the sun. The food was really good, the buffet we went to was a bit of a disappointment but all the restaurants and room service was good. Did not use the spa, their prices could do with being somewhat lower.

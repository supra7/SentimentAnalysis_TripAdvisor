The whole stay was great. The room appointments were all one could ask for. The food was terrific, we enjoyed the quality of the meals and the room service. The pool was a lot of fun. The staff was very attentive to our needs. The coffee spot near the lobby serves great coffee. There are only two areas that were not positive: 1. The mosquitoes were ravenous and 2. The road leading to the Hotel was a horror. It was dirt and pitted and full of ruts. This gave us a very bad first impression and seems below the level of the Hotel to not fix it. All over a great place for a couple to stay.

I just came back from a stay at the Andra. Wonderful boutique hotel. I was getting a little worried from some of the negative reviews but found my stay very nice. Staff was nice, frette towels, starbucks coffee, new york times paper daily, FACE bath amenities. Nice modern decor. The only thing that needed work was the bathroom floor - it needs a good bleaching and scrubbing. I would definitely stay here again.

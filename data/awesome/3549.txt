This hotel was fantastic. My husband and I normally stay at chain hotels because they are "safer" as they have a set standard and are easier to predict, but decided to take a chance with this 5 star independent hotel. What a wonderful decision we made for our honeymoon! The staff are so friendly and helpful (helped us with subway and map questions) and the hotel is simply beautiful. It is chic and modern with a luxurious feel to it. Right up the street one block is St. Catherine's, which has lots of places to eat and shop. We also caught a hockey game at Bell Centre, which we could see from our hotel room. It literally took a few minutes to walk to the game! We loved this hotel, and will be going back the next time we return to Montreal.

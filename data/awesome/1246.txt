I cant begin to do justice to our experience of staying here last month. Helpful, oddball staff left us wanting for nothing and tolerated our drunken late night ramblings like champs. We thank you, sincerely. The rooms were lovely, remodeled and finished with modern amenities that meshed well with the historic qualities of the hotel. Windows in the rooms actually open! We had a great view of the Puget Sound and Pike's Place was a just around the corner. Tons of Bars and Restaurants within a stones throw. Another thing we liked was that each floor had its own color scheme. One floor reminded us of a vampire brothel, if such a thing could exist. needless to say, we explored the entire Hotel, it was just that kind of place. We all agreed it felt haunted and the receptionist told us that many a creepy thing has gone down there over the years. Anyhow, beds were cozy, showers worked just fine. Room were clean. Ice machine worked as it should. I cant think of a single bad thing to say about our 2 night there. HIGHLY recommended.

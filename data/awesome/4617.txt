Choosing secrets maroma for our honeymoon was the best choice we could have made! The staff were truly outstanding in the service they provided, the rooms were the ultimate in luxury and the food was of such an excellent standard that we are now missing it so much! Even though the hotel seems to cater for weddings and honeymooners you still feel like special attention has been paid to you, also being adults only was a nice change and made it a lovely relaxing environment. We really cannot say enough excellent things about secrets! Looking forward to going back! Oh and P.S. We were also pleased that we did not see one cockroach on our 2 week stay! :)

Great beach, responsive staff, and great bartenders! We had such a good time here. Beach or pool all day, nap in the afternoon, 5 star dinner and dancing at night. Who wouldn't love it. Trust all the great reviews and book a trip here. Japanese resturaunt is great...ask for Pablo. Swing bar is great on the beach...ask for Luis Andres or Edgar. Swim up bar id great...ask for Roberto. Paella made freah on the beach everyday. Spa was great too...ask for Mindy. Try to splurge for the swim out room. It it worth it just to have a nice patio and pool to hang out in the afternoon. Book a trip here and you will not be disappointed.

We stayed at the Crystal a few days before heading to Quebec City. The front desk staff was very nice and helpfull. When we arrived we told them our train tickets were all wrong and we had to puchase new ones. They told us not to worry and to go explore the city. When coming back, everything was sorted out! What a great service! The suite we had was beautiful with a view to the downtown area. The pool with the jacuzzi were unique! Awesome place to hang out at a rainy morning!

So much fun! I looked at all the Trip Advisor reviews before going. I dont understand all the negative reviews. It was amazing! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time. Some things to note -- we are in our late twenties and would say over half of the people at the resort were older than we were, but it made it feel more laid back and less "spring breaky". There were plenty of young staff, entertainment and drinking though to make it a ton of fun, if you wanted. Favorite word among staff and guests - tequila! FOOD - Must go to Himitsu - the japanese restaurant. Try to get a reservation right when you get there or before you go. Must go to El Patio - the mexican restaurant -- and DO get the Tortilla soup. Probably the best food we had at the entire resort. The drinks were awesome - good frozen drinks and beer by the pool, martinis at the bar near the lobby, free beers in the mini fridge, good house wine for dinner. SPA - The spa was fantastic -- I had a facial and massage. Very easy to make a reservation. There was also a smallish gym to work out in. They also had daily yoga and water aerobics. EXCURSION - We also booked a trip to Tulum from Best Day Travel, a tour guide company with an office at the front. We had a lot of fun going to Tulum. I heard getting to Chitzenitza though is very hard and a day long event. BEACH -The beach was beautiful and frequently noted as the most beautiful in playa del carmen. Not many other resorts on Maroma beach so the foot traffic between resorts is minimal. Very peaceful. We really didnt have anything negative to say about the place! I wish we had gone to the city, Playa Del Carmen, which is about a $20 cab ride away, but I guess for another time.

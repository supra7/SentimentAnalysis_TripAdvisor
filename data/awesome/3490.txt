My husband and I took our three kids (14, 10 and 4) to Montreal, and stayed in a suite in the Crystal. The room was really big, very pretty, with huge windows that made it seem even more spacious. Plenty of drawers and closets so that we could unpack. A nice kitchenette and space for eating. The pool was nice, as was the outdoor hot tub. The location was quite good ... too far to walk to the Old City, but just a few blocks from a nice area of Montreal with restaurants, the art museum, etc. It is also near two or three metro stations, although the very closest station is on a very seedy block. But we just used the other stations after learning this. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Excellent stay.

we stayed here for our 1 yr anniversary. we drove to montreal from washington dc so we arrived a bit tired and ready for some luxury treatment. this hotel provided exactly that. i had called in advance and Russell worked with me to have a handwritten note and some treats left in our room prior to our arrival as a small surprise for my husband. the staff was very willing to point us to the best restaurants and made great recommendations since we had not planned much ahead of time. we had a couples massage in the lovely spa in the hotel - i highly recommend allowing time to sit in the relaxation room after and enjoy some fruit and peace. the hotel was located right in the center of town, right off of rue st. catharine. we took a cab to old montreal a few times (about $10) which we highly recommend of "european" feel - cobblestone streets, cafes, souveneir shops, notre dame bascillica, etc. the amenities in the hotel were perfect - our room had a small fridge, great minibar options, fantastic bed/pillows, and molton brown products which are to die for. smell so good and make hair look perfect :-) we also had a large soaking tub which i enjoyed a couple of evenings. the bathroom was beautiful, clean lines, and spacious. there were 2 computers and a printer for guest use in the lobby. i guess i was just disappointed by the $26/night fee for the parking of our car. that seemed awfully high and should be discounted for guests over 2 or 3 nights. in fact, we loved our visit to montreal so much that we extended our vacation by 1 night (was just disappointed to be charged that parking for yet another night!!) we cannot wait to come to montreal again (the people are SOOO nice) and we will be looking forward to staying at hotel le crystal.

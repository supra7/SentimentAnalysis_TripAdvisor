We just returned from a stay at the Doubletree Seattle Airport on both sides of our trip to Mexico and where nothing but pleased. We purchased the Park and Fly Package and were very happy to discover that this package included valet parking for our car directly out front of the hotel, not off in a back parking lot or at an off site location like many other hotels. The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. The shuttle was an extremely convenient as well. I would highly recommend the Doubletree and plan on staying here again on our next trip.

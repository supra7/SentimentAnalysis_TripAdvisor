We wanted to stay in the area to visit family. As great as it was we would stay there as public transportation is close. Converted from an apartment building the rooms were most spacious. Large bedroom, sitting area, bath and kitchen. Some want only the most modern but you can't beat this atmosphere. Some must have a bar and restaurant. Right out the front is one of the top 20 spots in the city. Same restaurant has breakfast to die for. Four more food options in one block. 2 blocks a remarkable market to stock your kitchen. Friendly staff. $25 valet parking. A must stay.

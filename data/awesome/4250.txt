I was very worried about going to Mexico....but I took my ta's advice and went to this resort. It was spectacular! We loved it. The staff was amazing and really made my birthday and our anniversary each a special event. We loved the location, the food, the culture and most of all the luxery of the resort. We have traveled all over the islands and stayed at many Sandals resorts during the past 5 years. We felt the Secrets was a much more luxerious resort. We were very surprised and happy with everything about Playa del Carman. The town was so much fun to visit and shop for our souveniers. All around we had a wonderful time and plan to definitely go back to Secrets.

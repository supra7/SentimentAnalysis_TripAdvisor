The reviews I read before visiting the W hotel in Seattle led me to believe I was in for an unpleasant stay. However, I had no choice as the hotel was booked by my husband's company for a conference. The service was impeccable - everything was clean. We rarely saw the cleaning staff, but everything was always clean. The staff was also very helpful and friendly. The style is very modern. We really enjoyed having a comfy bench built into the entire window wall since we hung out with friends in the evening. I highly recommend this hotel.

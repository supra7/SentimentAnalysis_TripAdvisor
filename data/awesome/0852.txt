Very comfortable bed. The magnifying mirror in the bathroom is a little thing that makes traveling life so much easier. Enjoyed having an armchair in the room. But most of all, the staff was exceptional. All staff we dealt with were polite and capable, and many were friendly and helpful. We appreciated the tips and help from the concierge service. Our housekeeper (12th floor) was friendly and gracious. Extra-special thanks to director of operations Tarig G., who went out of his way to help us when my husband had to go to the hospital, and our tour group had to go on without us. Tarig made us feel that we were not so stranded as we might have thought. If we ever get back to Seattle, we would love to be able to stay at this hotel again.

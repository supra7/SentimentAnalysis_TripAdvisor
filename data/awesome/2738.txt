I checked into the Vintage Park for a weekend conference at a nearby hotel. The level of quality and service was head and shoulders above at the Vintage! I was delighted by the hot chocolate that was waiting each afternoon, and the evening wine tastings were relaxing. The staff was the friendliest I've encountered in some time. The room was clean, and the bed was soft and really comfortable. I can't think of a single thing I would change about my trip. I will absolutely stay at the Vintage on every trip to Seattle, no questions asked.

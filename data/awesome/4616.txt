I've been an agent for many many years and I have to say that finally we have an adults only all inclusive that can live up to the hype! I stayed in the Honeymoon suite with the private jacuzzi/plunge pool...Unreal! The rates are so good too! You get so much more for your money here. This makes being a travel agent easy and fun! Secrets Maroma gets an A+!

My husband and I stayed at the University Inn over a long weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We booked the hotel after seeing the great reviews on Tripadvisor. Everything about this hotel was great! The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. The area was quiet and the beds comfortable. We took advantage of the breakfast each day we were there. The staff kept the food well stocked and everything tasted great! We also got to enjoy the snack one day when we were there. We didn't use the pool as there were always quite a few people using it, but it looked clean and we saw staff cleaning it in the morning. We LOVED the fact that the hotel had a shuttle, as we didn't want to be looking for parking all the time. The shuttle drivers were great!!! They were helpful in explaining how to get around the city. They even offered to transport us to the Mariners game even though it wasn't on the regular route. Even though we didn't take advantage of the offer, we apprecieted it. I wish I could remember their names, so I could give them the thanks they deserve. I have absolutely no complains about this hotel and I would recommend it to anyone!

The Westin Seattle is a wonderful full service hotel right in the center of Seattle near most tourist sites. The view from our 20th floor room was great. The room was extremely quiet. The A/C system could barely be heard at all and street noise was almost non-existent. The room was quite large except for the bathroom. It was a little small as it is in the center of a round building. The only downside was the pool and hot tub area was full of screaming children when we tried to use it. Also, we were in the south tower and the pool was in the north tower which meant walking through the conference room areas in our robe. All in all, a great choice.

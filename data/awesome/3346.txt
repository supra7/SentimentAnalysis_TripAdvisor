My wife and I stayed here with our mini-dachshund in October 2011 during the Zombcon convention. The hotel staff went out of their way the entire weekend to make us feel comfortable and welcome. They also made our dog welcome by placing a picture of her on their facebook page as the featured pet of the week. The food in the restaurant while a little more expensive than what you would get outside, was wonderful and filling. If I had one complaint, it was the bartender at the end of a LONG day who served me a DiSaronno on the rocks in a glass that was severely tainted by detergent. Not the best way to end a day, but with him having been there since 7am and it was now 11pm, I can forgive it. All in all, we would love the opportunity to stay here again in the future.

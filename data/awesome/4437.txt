We just returned from the resort. The resort was wonderful! The accommodations were outstanding. The pool was beautiful, and the food was very good. We enjoyed almost every aspect of the experience. I read several of the reviews, and i cannot say that we had any bug or food issues. My only regret was that we did not stay longer. It is a very serene place, so don't expect to party all night, but the entertainment staff will keep things moving. I would go again in a heartbeat. We have stayed at 10-12 resorts, and this is probably our favorite!

My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 8 days, 7 nights. Our flight was late and we ended up checking in around 10 pm. True to the Secrets hotels, the minute we arrived we were released of all our luggage and handed a cold towel and a glass of champagne! This was our second visit to a Secrets hotel - we were at the Secrets Capri a couple of years ago. We were greeted with a smile and were checked in with the greatest of ease - all was good. We had requested an ocean view room but when they verified they informed us that our view would not be so great so they upgraded us to a swim out room - nice - really really nice. When we were showed to our room the gentleman assisting us with our luggage opened the door and said `"welcome home" - yes indeed - we were home. The hotel is extremely nice. The beach is amazing. The food outstanding. For people who are wondering whether you should spend all the money to stay here - think about this: no bracelet - no reservation required - on the beach drink and food service to your beach chair - its worth it! Try the meal in the wine cellar at the French restaurant - ask for Eddy - he is the Sommelier and so very knowledgeable with the wines. While we visited the spa only on the last day - I would recommend you check it out - it is truly amazing and so very peaceful. The only 'negative' I would mention is the pool - and this for two issues - one it is clearly not big enough for the number of people at the resort - the second is the business with reserving chairs - unless you get up at the crack of dawn you cannot get a chair around or close to the pool. The hotel claims that they have a no reservation policy for the chairs but it is not policed at all. Go to the beach - you always have room there - they have tons of chairs even if you show up at noon.

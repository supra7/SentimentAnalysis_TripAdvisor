We were a little nervous about our return trip to Inn at the Market. We'd last stayed there in 2001 on our honeymoon, and a lot can change in almost 10 years. Luckily, as we discovered, a lot can NOT change in 10 years, too. We found Inn at the Market much as we had left it: unbeatable location and great rooms. What we appreciated more on this trip is the sense that the staff has perfectly mastered the local feel of Seattle. It's not as formal as, say, the Four Seasons. But you also get the impression that the way you're being treated is very genuine. We used the town car service on one evening and felt like we were hanging out with a local on the way to our destination. That being said, if it's your first time in Seattle the highlight will be the location. It's impossible to beat being able to walk out the front door and head to the Market to grab some Daily Doughnuts or Three Sisters bakery for breakfast before the crowds get unbearable. It's the perfect home base for most anything you want to do. We walked everywhere--Safeco Field for Mariners game, ferry terminal for Bainbridge Island ferry, etc.

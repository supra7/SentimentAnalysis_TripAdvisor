This is a wonderful hotel! We have stayed here for the past several summers and always enjoy our stay. Skip the townhouse suite unless you have a large group. If you can, splurge on a deluxe waterview room. If you cannot, book a cityside room and be sure to use the rooftop terrace! Bring a glass of wine and watch the ferries and ships come and go. The location is terrific. The staff is low key and efficient.

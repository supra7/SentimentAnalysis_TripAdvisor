I'm ashamed it has taken me so long to write this review. I'll keep it simple - this place is incredible. The quality and choice of food is fantastic, but the service really makes this resort so special. We stayed for 2 weeks with original intentions of seeing the local area - in fact we ended up never leaving the resort once which says it all! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to give us a truly memorable holiday - don't change a thing and we will definitely be back.

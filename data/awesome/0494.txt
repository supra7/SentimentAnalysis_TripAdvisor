For location this hotel cannot be beat. Within seconds of Pike Place Market, great restaurants, Benaroya Hall and the Triple Door theater. Small scaled, but lovely. The rooms are nice sized, very comfortable beds, exceptionally clean, and modern. Also our room was very quiet. We love picking up food and a bottle of wine at the market, and having a picnic on the 5th floor deck overlooking the bay and the market. The hotel is expensive but worth it for a splurge. $30 for valet parking is steep, but the service was efficient and friendly. Cafe Campagne, the in house restaurant, is top notch as well. Fabulous food and terrific wine list. The main restaurant Campagne is still undergoing a remodel and I don't know when it will re-open.

The Shearton-Seattle was just perfect. The location cannot be beaten, the furnishings were luxurious/comfortable and the room was very large. I particularly enjoyed the spa-like bath, huge LCD television and the room was only 1-month old (new tower). I did not eat in any of the hotel's restaurants. It was a wonderful, 5-star experience!

We have been to all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean in the past 5 years and this was by far the best. The resort was gorgeous and was not packed with people. The rooms was nice and we received a free upgrade. Service was exceptional- staff would go out of their way to get anything you requested. Food was very good, especially compared to other all-inclusive hotels. The resort was primarily filled with honeymooners, and we were one of the only unmarried couples. That didn't matter to us since it actually added to the relaxing atmosphere at the hotel. This isn't the place to go if you want to party every night, but the poolbar in the afternoon turns into a pretty good drinking scene. FYI- the resort has high end liqour like Ketel One and Grey Goose, they just don't put them on the bar, so make sure to ask for them, otherwise the best you will get is Absolut.

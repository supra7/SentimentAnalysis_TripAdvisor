This is a great hotel.The beds make you feel like royalty. The are plush and the linens are crisp and clean. The shower is very nice, not a bath tob but a shower with a shower massager. It was great after a day in Orlando. The breakfast that comes with your room is excellent. Not your usual continental breakfast. There were eggs.pancakes, bagles with the usual juice and coffee.The staff was courteous and helplful. All in all a nice stay with a great nights sleep on the wonderful bed.

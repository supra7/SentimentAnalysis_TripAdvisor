My husband and I recently stayed at the Inn at the Market. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are friendly and very helpful. The bed was a Temperpedic bed and was soooooo comfortable. The rooms are very clean and spacious. We stayed on the City view side and had a great view of the bustling city below. We spent some time relaxing on the patio and took in the view of the sunset over Puget Sound and Pike Place Market below. The Inn is located at Pike Place, so, you are only a few steps (literally) away from great restaurants, talented fish throwers, cool stores and wonderful fruits, vegetables and flower shops. It's also around the corner from the 1st (original) Starbuck's. We went there first thing in the morning and beat the crowd. The hotel is also a walkable distance from the Space Needle. I think we made it to the Space Needle is about 20 minutes or so. We went to the Space Needle on Friday, the 13th, and learned that Bauch & Lomb has bought out the Space Needle that day to promote their BioTrue lens cleaner product. We were the 5th and 6th person in line that morning. The view from the top was gorgeous and there was not a cloud (or any fog) in sight. We met up with friends and had dinner at the Eastlake Bar & Grille. This restaurant has a great view of the Lake Union. Definitely a great place to kick back, have a beer and delicious food. We also went to the University of WA campus, Japanese Tea Garden, Chinatown and Mt. Rainier. Awesome trip all around!!!

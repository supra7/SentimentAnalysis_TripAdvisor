Stayed here one night. Inn is close to a Trader Joes, great restaurants and to the zoo. Hotel seemed safe although close by areas in the neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. I will stay here again though. Great, comfortable beds, fun triangle window...my twins loved the window! they also liked the hot chocolate and tea downstairs and the free breakfast. Yummy waffles. Great that there was a refrigerator and microwave. Overall, awesome stay!

We arrived at the hotel after a long flight from Boston with our 1 year old. The moment we stepped onto the property, the staff helped us feel welcome. They checked us in early (around 1:30) and gave us a room on the Puget Sound side. A few hours later, we noticed our fridge wasn't working properly, and they arrived with a replacement within 10 minutes to make sure our daughter's milk was kept cold. We enjoyed the pool on the top floor (terrific view!), though were disappointed that the hot tub was not working at all during our stay. Because of the time change, we were up bright and early with our daughter (sadly, around 3:30am the first few mornings.) My husband and I would switch off taking her down to explore the lobby while the other one slept. The lobby was quiet at that time except for the cleaning staff, who were extremely friendly and tolerant of our daughter running around. The best part about this hotel is its location. It's very convenient to the highway, so easy to get to, plus its a short walk from Pike Place, Westlake Center (monorail to Seattle Center) and lots of restaurants and grocery stores. We almost stayed at the waterfront Marriott but ended up getting a much better deal at the Renaissance, and I was glad we ended up where we did. Traffic down near the water would have been a nightmare. All in all, we were very impressed with this hotel and would highly recommend it.

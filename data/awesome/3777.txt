Secrets Maroma is the best all-inclusive we have ever stayed in. Last year we stayed at El Dorado Royale which is supposed to be gourmet, the food at Secrets was MUCH better. The preferred club is worth the extra $$, but you have to use it (Filipe is the best bartender ever!). The beach beds are also worth the extra $$. Kevin and Alejandro are wonderful. All of the service at Secrets is phenomenal. I was truly impressed. We had a couples massage followed by the hydrotherapy circuit and the following day I had a facial. All worth it! The spa is very nice. At the pool, there is no competition to get chairs, beds, etc. They do a good job of making sure people don't take their towels out at 7 and leave them all day. All of the service was exceptional. I can't emphasize that enough. I would highly recommend Secrets Maroma

My husband and I booked a little anniversary weekend getaway to Seattle and this hotel was so perfect. The service was amazing - from valet service to front desk to concierge. We were touched that they remembered our anniversary. The room was stunning - took our breath away when we opened the door. We definitely will be staying here again. You cannot go wrong with this hotel and we walked to Quest field and back that night - 15 minutes away!

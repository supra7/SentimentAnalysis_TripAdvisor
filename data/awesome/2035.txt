The location is fantastic. You have to pay a bit extra to get a room over the water, but it's worth it. It's a unique experience. This is a hotel that's part of your trip, not just where you sleep. There's a gas fireplace with a great lodge-style design: a bear ottoman, claw foot tub. The lobby/lounge is great (piano player and all). Even the elevators are designed well. Pike place market and other sites are walking distance. The bartenders at the hotel restaurant are super friendly too and there's a band on Fri and Sat nights. This was a solo business trip with an extra day and a half added on for visiting Seattle.

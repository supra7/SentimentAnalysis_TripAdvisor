Secrets Maroma Beach is simply an amazing place for a romantic getaway. The facility is immaculate. The entire staff, from Jorge the doorman to our personal concierge Yannik, to the wait staff around the pool and in the restaurants to housekeeping, was extremely polite and anxious to provide top quality service. A smile and friendly greeting were offered by every staff person we encountered, including the grounds crew and maintenance staff. The restaurants were fantastic, with a great variety of deliciously prepared options. Roberto, the sushi chef, is top rate! We ended up stopping there for appetizers a couple nights before hitting other restaurants for our dinners. Evening entertainment was varied and fun. The entertainment staff did a great job with daytime activities as well. Don't miss the Friday afternoon tequila tasting! The pool and beach were wonderful, with attentive wait staff even on the beach. The only drawback is there are a limited number of lounge chairs, especially with umbrellas, around the pool areas. The location is fantastic for a true romantic getaway; relatively secluded with a long semi-private beach. The only downside is if you want to do much tourist shopping. Taxi fare to Playa del Carmen is $20 each way (Cancun is $30-35), which makes a shopping trip a bit expensive. Secrets does seem to offer free transportation a couple days a week to go into Playa to shop, but we missed that during our visit. Local artisans were on the property a couple nights, which offer an opportunity to purchase tourist souvenirs without leaving the grounds. Overall, not a real knock against the location as far as we were concerned. We had a wonderful stay and would love to return again, and often.

From the time of check-in, which was fast and courteous, to the time of check-out, we had a great experience at the Doubletree Seatac. Their shuttle service was prompt and they are centrally located to both the airport and a variety of restaurants. Also right around the corner was a Thrifty, so getting our rental car was easy. The bellman made dinner reservations for us and advised us on proper attire for the restaurant. The front desk clerk gave us a business center key card so we could use the computer and internet, which was very helpful as we forgot to print a few things before we left. The room was beautiful and clean, and the beds were super comfortable! The bathroom had nice amenities as well. Our only criticism is that there was a $16 nightly fee for parking, which we feel should have been part of the cost of the room. Our experience here will prompt us to look to Doubletree for our next trip!

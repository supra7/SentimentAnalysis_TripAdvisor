The staff at The Sorrento Hotel were professional, friendly, and caring. They treated us like royality. My wife was having testing done at the Virginia Mason Hospital. We were not businessmen or professionals but pretty common folks. We were treated with the same excellence as though we were professionals. I wanted a nice comfortable place for my wife while she was going through her testing. Sorrento Hotel, it's accomodations, and staff exceeded our expectation. What a memorable experience. Thank you for all your service to us. We can't wait to come back. Al and Bonnie Kittle

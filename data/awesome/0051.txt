This stay was mine and my wife's first time at a Kimpton Hotel. We were very impressed, from check in, to the unique layout and design of our room, to the drinks at the restaurant connected to the lobby, this was a very good hotel. My conference was a few blocks away and the conference, along with short walks to Westlake Center, Pike Place Market, etc. were extremely convenient. The fish in our room was a "cool" extra too - we named him/her "Comstock." The best recommendation I can give is that I would certainly come back.

Visited Secrets Maroma for my honeymoon. I did extensive research before booking a resort in Mexico and decided to book with Secrets Maroma due to the fact that it had outstanding reviews, one of the top beaches in the world and it was an adult only resort. Due to the priceyness of this resort we booked during off seaso (Oct) and went through orbitz; all in all it was a good experience and we got a good price. The resort is located a short 20-30 min drive from the airport and is a 20 min drive by taxi into Playa del Carmen. The resort is absolutely beautiful and their staff is top notch; I don't believe we ever heard the word "no" once - whatever we asked for, we received! The beach is very amazing, white sand and warm, blue waters. Food was great and varied with 4-5 restaurants to choose from. If alcohol is your thing - it is NOT in short supply here! We hardly ever left the resort, there was so much to do with all the amenities, recreation and activities they provide. Do book a swim out suite - it's nice to be able to walk out into a pool from your balcony after a hot day of sight seeing! If your interested in seeing the Mayan ruins, Tulum and Coba are within a comfortable traveling distance. If you want to see Chichen Itza it is a whole day trip. I recommend Gudelio Alanis of Excel Tours. Great private tour guide and he will pick you up from Maroma. Also do check out the Secrets Maroma Beach Facebook page. Lots of great content from the resort and a great place for past and future visitors to share tips and experiences!

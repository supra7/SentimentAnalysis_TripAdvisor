We booked this hotel because of the positive feedback on trip advisor and the fact that it was an adult only resort. It didn't disappoint us at all. The food is out of this world, so much of it and to a very high standard and the different restaurants of the resort makes every time a new experience. Around the pool is very relaxing and the constant service of cocktails and canapes is wonderful and luxurious. Breakfast has everything and more that you could ask for - our special thanks goes to Elayne who cooked our crepes to perfection with a beautiful smile - in fact the attention to detail by the staff is something we haven't seen before and again our special thanks goes to the new waitress Liliana who gets a gold star from us. As a gay couple we had no problem to relax and felt welcome. No real downside, perhaps only to mention that you are really in the middle of nowhere and that you can't walk anywhere (although taxi's are reasonable) and that for us Cancun airport was a bit of a nightmare to get through customs and passport control as it's so busy. Thanks to everyone who made our holiday so memorable and enjoyable. Kind regards, Alan & Jean Noel

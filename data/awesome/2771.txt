We stayed for our 10th anniversary for two nights. The location was great for walking around to see the sights. The room was comfortable. The staff were accommodating. Being downtown at night there was the occasional police siren. I think this would be the case with any downtown hotel. We were on the 3rd floor, you could request a higher level room if this is an issue. There is a complementary local winery wine tasting from 5-6 in the lobby which was fun. Secure valet parking. Great Value.

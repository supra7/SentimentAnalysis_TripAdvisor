At Maroma 9/18/11-9/25/11 for our 3rd visit. And the service gets better everytime we go back. Maid service was great. Had the room cleaned very early everyday at our request. Then it was cleaned after we showered with turn down service. When reading reviews, I would love to know what hotels people stay at that are better than this. Please let me know, but it must be over 18, all-inclusive & 5 stars or better. Everyone we talked to absolutely loved it and all want to go back. Please note that it is true that they watch the chairs for those of you that like to claim a chair at the pool and then go to the beach for half a day. Saw peoples stuff get moved several times. The staff more than appreciates tips so treat them kindly as there are people from other countries that don't tip at all. Very much thanks to Paulo, Jaime pool concierges; Balbina, Aracyle pool waitresses; Lidia lobby waitress.

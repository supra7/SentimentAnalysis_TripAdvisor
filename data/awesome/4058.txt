This was my first trip to Mexico. My first experience at an All-Inclusive resort. And my first trip using Apple Vacations. Diana and I couldn't have had a better time. Everything was top notch. I was extremely impressed with just how clean everything was there. From the rooms, to the grounds, to the beach. Very nice. And the resort staff made us feel very welcome. We tried all of the themed restuarants and had a great meal at every place. I would go back there in a second.

This hotel is spectacular, it has everything you can need in order to have a good and relaxing holidays. the rooms are confortable and big, with also a jacuzzi inside and an open sea view. the complex is very well organized with all services and it is located near the sea. the beach here is fantastic, one of the best i ever seen, hard to describe... a speacial words for restaurants inside: there are 7 restaurants all with good food, you will never be bored to eat there. try the seaside grill that has a very good steak. even if the price is high I reccomend this hotel at least once in life.

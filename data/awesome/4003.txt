A perfect vacation place as a couple or with friends.. beautiful grounds and rooms and yummy food galore... The swimout suites are nice and the way to go with friends so you can hang out without the crowds, but you cannot swim to the pool from your room.. One of my favorite memories were the servers poolside and the great afternoon snacks they came by with, such as tacos they created personally for you or yummy sushi. The Beach on site is also great b/c it is calm and crystal clear, not to mention the small beach bar is a nice touch!

Our second visit to this hotel was Dec 23 2010. First visit was May 2009. Perfect location. Amazing staff. Views are great especially if not rainy or foggy. Had to delay initial reservation because of personal circumstances and IATM was extremely accommodating and understanding. The only place we'll stay at in Seattle.

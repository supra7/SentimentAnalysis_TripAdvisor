A great hotel in a prime location, we had top-notch service from the moment our taxi dropped us off until we (regretfully) checked out two days later. Everyone was accommodating and helpful, and we received first rate service everywhere we turned, including both the restaurant and the bar. Would stay here and recommend it to others with no hesitation. Thank you for helping make our visit to Seattle wonderful!

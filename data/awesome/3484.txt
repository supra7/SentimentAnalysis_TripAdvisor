Stayed two days at "Le Crystal". Wonderfull, competent and smiling staff. Fancy but simple design. My brother and I stayed in a Junior suite, the sofa bed is no supplement so go for it! There was a convenient alarm clock/ipod dock/jack to plug our computers and play music. The bathrooms are huge and very clean (with a rain shower), great amenities. The hotel is perfectly located in the city center, litteraly 1 mn walk away from a nice terrace bar and a club and rue Sainte-Catherine. Nice touch: as we where leaving the hotel on the last day of our stay the valet offered us two bottles of water right out of the fridge for our trip out of Montreal. Don't go if you are fan of huge breakfast buffets, the hotel only offers plated breakfast and a small continental buffet, (but the Marriott next door offers one of the biggest buffets in town). Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel. Nice bar and terace inside for an evening buffet. Definitely the best place to find a outdoor hot tub with a great view. Heated exit for the winter, big indoor pool and saunas are a must try if you stay there.

First impressions: The bellman and the front desk people both immediately demonstrated they were well trained and paying attention to their guests. The front desk lady provided great information (at a pace that was energetic but not rushed), helpful leading questions about the area, and major positive energy without bubbling or being insincere. The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core. The room was very reasonably priced and we like service, but service at a bargain is even better!

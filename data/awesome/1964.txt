Lovely older hotel in Belltown, recently remodeled in Scandinavian hues of beige, cream, slate blue & browns. Just steps to major shopping venues, and lots of excellent restaurants. Plus, interesting shops in Belltown. Very comfortable room with double-glazed windows afford a nice respite from the city. Design is modern, and warm. Room was large and comfortable (2 Queen beds on 7th floor). Lola, a Tom Douglas haunt has a great afternoon bar scene. Didn't dine there, but breakfast was excellent. Smaller, though adequate bathroom more than compensated for by large closet to stow bags and hang clothes. This is a room you can move into and enjoy rather than live out of your bag.

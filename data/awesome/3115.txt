This previous weekend my husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel In Seattle. We have traveled extensively throughout the world and thought you might be interested in our observations. We arrived Saturday Morning while a heavy wind and light rain made the area not so scenic nor enjoyable. The valet rushed into the rain to facilitate our baggage and park the car. He was extremely friendly and wanting to be of assistance. We could barely get into the lobby and the Concierge immediately made us feel comfortable with small talk as we were waiting inline to be checked in. At the Front Desk Peter Schmidt handled the many questions of incoming guests with humor and expertise. When it came to our turn I explained we were there for a wedding anniversary and he suggested a Jacuzzi room on 15th floor. We arrived at room 1508 and it was all as he had described. The views to Elliot Bay from the West window, Space Needle from the North were spectacular. The bed was made as to appear comfortable for arrivals and the Jacuzzi and bathrooms were adequately staffed with supplies. The room was immaculate clean, as if more of a model Hotel room rather then one in use. How to grade Excellence? Next trip to Seattle we will be staying at the Roosevelt!

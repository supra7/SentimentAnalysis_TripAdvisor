I'm a pretty seasoned travelor and this is the best resort i have ever stayed in! if you are looking for great service, food, beach, and pool - than look no further. every part of the trip, from the time we arrived to the time we left, we were treating incredible by the staff. i almost felt like the staff wasn't allowed to be in a bad mood! i've never heard, "My pleasure" repeated more in my life! Beach is about the best beach i've been to. It's extremely wide and very soft white sand - way better than many of the beaches i've been to in the caribbean. pool is outstanding and the pool side service is super. food and drinks are brought right to you at anytime. food - wow! like eating in a fancy downtown chicago restaurant everynight! even the steaks were really good! seafood great! hamachi restaurant was the best i've been to. sushi was good/not great. but overall the food was incredible for an all inclusive. drinks are all top shelf (if you ask for it). they have the grey goose and don julio but you have to ask for it. rooms are nice size with a very comfortable bed. ONLY complaint - you can hear alot of noise in your rooms - especially in the mornings with the birds chirping by 5:30am. it was very hard to sleep in because of it. and if you have loud neighbors next to you - you will hear it. even with that we'd wake up early order room service and relaxed in the room before hitting the beach and pool. just and outstanding place to go if your heading to cancun area. 25 minute cab ride from airport. worth every penny! we look forward to trying another secrets resort in the future!

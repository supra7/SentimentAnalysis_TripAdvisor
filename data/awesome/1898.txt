Stayed five nights at this beautiful modern gem in downtown Seattle. Housekeepers kept room well-stocked and sparkling. Studio Queen room came affordably with winter hot rate and it fits one neatly. Supportive warm bed, lighting soft yet plenty for reading, water never turns too hot or cold, all furnishings and fixtures in perfect working order and aesthetically pleasing. No problems with noise from other rooms or halls. Loved the room view to Top Pot Donuts and distant hills. Staff is ethnically diverse, from doorman to housekeepers to front desk. Front desk super knowledgeable and helpful for exploring Seattle. Sat in the "lobby" at night (it's more like a living room with a lively party in progress) and had a fine draft beer from Lola's, the on-site restaurant. Safe and fun even for a woman alone. Scandanavian chairs and sofas stylish and very comfy. Lola's food delicious, and Dahlia Lounge and Bakery (all from chef Tom Douglas) are right across the street. Hotel just 3 blocks from Westlake Center for Link Light Rail from SEA/TAC airport, and 2 blocks from downtown monorail and multiple bus lines. So transportation is very inexpensive. Safe neighborhood with superb luxury shopping, tourist sights, and exciting dining and music club scene. It's easy to stay fit walking around the Seattle hills. A fabulous place for a vacation.

We had planned to stay 1 night just to get away from the kids and relax. We ended up staying 2 nights because there was a snow storm. They gave us a discounted rate for the second night because of the snow. The restaurant was delicious! It was all decorated for Christmas and the snow was falling outside. It was an absolutely perfect getaway! The rooms were very clean! It is in the middle of all the shopping, restaurants and just a short walk down to Pikes Place. We are planning to stay there again next year!

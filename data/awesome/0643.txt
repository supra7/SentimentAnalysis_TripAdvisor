We live less than 20 miles from Seattle. It is great to enjoy our beautiful city like a tourist. The view from our room was spectacular. We watched the sun set over Elliott Bay and the Olympic mountains. The staff is very friendly. There are plenty of restaurants and bars to go to within blocks. And of course the Pike Place Market is right below.

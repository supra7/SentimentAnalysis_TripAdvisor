I am in love with the Hotel Andra!! Things didn't get off to the best start -and I was already nervous, as the Andra is a little outside our usual price bracket - as when we arrived (hot, tired and thirsty straight off the Victoria Clipper) our room wasn't ready. However, after profuse apologies when it still wasn't ready 30 minutes later, we were served with drinks from the bar and upgraded to a suite (with a view of the Space Needle). The room was immaculate. Every detail was just right and the quality was excellent. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The service was great - the staff smile like they mean it. The food in Lola's was superb... I would like to meet the person who has ever had a second 'Bloody Lola'... ( I would also recommend the Crocodile Cafe on 2nd as an alternative breakfast venue). The location was very convenient (i.e. easily walkable) for everything we wanted (Pike Place, Elliott Bay Book Company, Bumbershoot). We had booked an initial 3 night stay and returned for 1 night the following week, when we did get a regular room (along with a packet of 'welcome back' sweets) - so I can appreciate some of the previous negative comments about bathroom size - but I would love to get the opportunity to stay here again!

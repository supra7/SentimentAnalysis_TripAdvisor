This resort is exactly like the pictures on their website!! We had our wedding on the beach at the resort and had a group of nearly 20 people stay with us and it was absolutely wonderful. Definitely a good time was had by all. The beach is gorgeous, the pool is amazing and the entire resort is awesome. The staff is very welcoming and extremely helpful. The spa is nice also and the entire resort property is very clean. I can't say anything bad about this place and am definitely planning to return in the near future!

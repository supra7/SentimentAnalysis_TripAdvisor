Miauw is one of the most beautiful holiday experiences we have ever had. Every detail has been thought of in the rooms. We stayed in the White Suite and loved the design, the views and the location. Super comfortable king size bed bed, spacious gorgeous living room with gorgeous big windows and views of the Keizersgracht, and a full working kitchen with a table big enough for us to host a small, home cooked dinner party for 5 of our local friends on the last night. The White Suite was always impecaably clean, and also has great details like a Bang & Olufsen TV, and lovely Ren bath products. We stayed just before Chistmas and the room temperature was always perfect, heat easily and quickly adjusted. There is an Albert Heijn (supermarket) literally 3 mins away, a great coffee bar just next door (Screaming Beans) and so many wonderful restaurants and bars to choose from. Analik is thoughtful enough to leave a few essentials in the kitchen like tea, sugar, olive oil etc so that you dont need to buy these things if, like us, you take full advantage of being able to cook your own meals in the gorgeous smeg kitchen! Maybe I am biased or somehow understood this immeditately beacuse I am Dutch, and originally from Amsterdam and know the area well -but I honestly I don't know how anyone could have gone to their website and thought that they were getting a full service hotel experience, they make it pretty clear that you are getting a very exclusive apartment! As far as other comments about showers being small and stairs being steep- you're in the Netherlands! Stay at home or in a big chain hotel if you don't want to experience or cant handle the quirks that make Amsterdam so special and quaint as a city (tall and not very wide houses!) My husband and I will only stay here from now on when we come visit and honestly cannot wait to return!

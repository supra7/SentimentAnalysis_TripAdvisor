check in and out went smoothly. first room assigned was not to correct so new one was given. construction outside room for entire stay for new walkway cover was disturbing. could not sleep in due to noise. other rooms closer to the beach were not available. most of food service was good, this main is area that still needs work. fantastic service and response to requests. facilities were very great and beach was outstanding spa service was spotty and availability was not easy. late week arrivals ger left out a lot of weddings and enjoyed observing from afar special shows and programs were fun and entertaining entire group had a very nice time and would return again

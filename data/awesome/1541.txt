Veryt ice hotel, good price. Checkin was a bit long but lots of people coming here. A bit of a walk to Pikes Place but not too bad at all. Great workout room and decent pool with a hot tub the view from the workout area is super. Big safe in the room if you need it. Movies and shopping are in the immediate area. This seems to be a ood deal at $149. Nice TV and plenty of room for clothes storage. Good coffee and tea in room.

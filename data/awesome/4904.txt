We honeymooned here in March of 2009 and then returned for our anniversary in March of 2010. It was absolutely wonderful both times. This trip my husband surprised me with an upgrade to the oceanfront honeymoon suite; it was very large and well appointed and had a gorgeous view of the beach. The food was very good (we especially love the French restaurant, Bordeaux). The service from the concierge was always excellent, and we always had attentive service from poolside, bar, and restaurant servers. I would highly recommend Secrets Maroma for any romantic getaway, or even a trip with a group of friends.

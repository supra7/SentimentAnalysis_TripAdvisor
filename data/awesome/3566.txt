After much research my husband and I chose Hotel le Crystal for our trip to Montreal. We read the reviews and were not worried about our choice, however, we were not prepared for the first class treatment we received. The front desk staff were friendly and gracious. We just had to ask the question and they had the answer and if they didn't they found the answer for us. The suite we stayed in was large and airy with an espresso machine and a variety of flavours to choose from. The bathroom was huge and the beds were comfortable. I don't know why this hotel is not listed in the top 5 hotels in Montreal. It has a great location and the best staff I have ever dealt with in my life. (And we've been to Walt Disney World a few times where the staff are excellent). I stopped after checking out to let the front desk know how impressed we were. We will go back over and over if they keep giving this kind of service.

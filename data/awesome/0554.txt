We stayed at Inn at the Market for a weekend getaway - a kind of staycation. I love Seattle and we picked a great, sunny weekend in February. We had a deluxe waterview room which is exactly what we had - a deluxe view. We overlooked Pike's Street Market but had a perfect view of the Sound with all the ferries coming and going, and of the snow-capped Olympics. The sunsets were spectacular. The room was well designed and offered everything we needed - and it was clean. The bed was amazingly comfortable - two of the best night's sleep I have had for a while. There are so many fabulous restarurants in the area, it is hard to choose where to eat. Lots to do with so many famous Seattle landmarks within walking distance - perfect. Valet parking was worth it - and the valets were very helpful.

We just got back from Orlando and were looking for a comfortable, clean affordable place to sleep. Destiny Palms was unbelievable! The staff was great, the room was like a mini Hyatt--the furnishing was top class. My husband and I loved it! Looking forward to coming back next year. Les & Loreatha H.

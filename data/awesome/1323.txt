To be honest, if you need to go to Amsterdam, try your best to stay here. The nine streets area is probably the most unique Dutch experience you will have anywhere in Amsterdam, minus the Wind Mill... It truely feels like a village. Great restaurants, great bars, great markets, great atmosphere! We stayed in the White Suite and Analik was exceptionally accommodating. Loved the extra charm offered by the awesome view from the suite! We did not want to leave!

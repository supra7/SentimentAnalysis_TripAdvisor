This hotel helped us celebrate our wedding anniversary and a birthday. The beach is very beautiful with powder sand and blue clear water. The room was decorated nice and bed very comfortable not hard like at some resorts. Recommend that you use the American express rep for excursions, who was very knowledgeable and helped us have a great time. There is a catamaran sunset dinner package that is excellent through the agent. Also go to Xcaret for 1 day and climb Coba ruins as it it the only one left to do. We will definately return to this wonderful place. Food was good and no reservations needed except the Japanese one.

My husband and I picked Secrets Maroma to celebrate our anniversary after reading reviews by others. I have to say the resort was excatly as I expected. The service was great all around. It was always a pleasure to be served from the staff. The pool was great but I loved the beach -- nice white soft sand and the water was amazing. The entertainment staff is great. If you felt like relaxing that's fine but if you were in the mood to play volleyball, bingo, soccer on the beach, etc. it was always a blast. You can make the resort and your vacation as relaxing as you wish or as entertaining as you want. Never any pressure to get involved in the activities. I think everyone's experience is different but we had a swim out room and had no mosquitoe issues and we went swimming at night. One might have some negative reviews and I understand that happens but its what you make of it.

Our entire experience at Secrets Maroma Beach was wonderful. We cannot say enough about the staff, food & drinks! We visited the resort for our Honeymoon and checked into a ocean view room. Two days after checking in, a ocean front room became avaialble and we moved. It was the best decision of the trip! We cannot wait to go back! We were there for 9 days and never got sick of the food and didn't have to leave the resort once! We highly recommend this hotel to any couples looking for some R&R. <3

I really can't think of anything negative to say. I've been to Cancun/Riviera Maya area four times now (all different places)and this is by far the nicest. The staff was wonderful, the food was great, and pleantiful!, the drinks were top notch, the layout is perfect. We thought it was great for the honeymoon. No kids and all couples, many that got married on the same day as us. In short it was a great trip and we would for sure take a couple or two with us next time. Thank you Maroma Beach.

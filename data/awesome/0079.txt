My wife and I went via train to Seattle for shopping and a Seahawks game (preseason win over the Raiders), and we stayed with Hotel Monaco primarily for the location, previous reviews, and reasonable price. We found the staff to be friendly and courteous, and our spacious room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. This hotel has all mod cons with a nice restaurant attached. Most importantly, to me, was that we could walk everywhere we wanted to be - SAM, Pike Market, Pine Street and Safeco Field. My wife forgot her cell phone charger at home and the front desk staff offered to charge it for her - so thoughtful. Seattle is a beautiful city, and having a really nice place to stay helped us to relax and enjoy it all the more.

Just visited over July 4th and had a wonderful experience. Rooms were spacious and clean with great amenities. Service throughout entire resort was second to none. Every single staff member was friendly, attentive and ended each conversation by stating "it is a pleasure". Food was GREAT-especially breakfast, hibachi and Italian. The view of the beach from the infinity pool looks like a post card. Only complaints are (and I am reaching for these) music playing poolside was very serene/spa-like and crabs were running around grounds early morning/early evening. Hard to complain about such a wonderful place. I would return every year if I could!

A quality experience. I had never been to Seattle and the staff were friendly and welcoming and helped me discover things to do. The room was beautiful, if small, clean and homey. The food was great and the dining service was excellent. The hotel location was great with easy access to all the best things to do and see in Seattle. Stay at this hotel. You won't regret it.

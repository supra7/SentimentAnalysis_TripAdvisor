We couldn't have been more pleased w/the resort, absolutely every aspect was perfection. The appearance of the hotel and outside areas were truely outstanding! I felt like Maroma was even more elegant than Capri! I also, thought the restaurants were unique in each style & cuisine. I can't even begin to thank & commend All the staff absolutely kind & accomadating!

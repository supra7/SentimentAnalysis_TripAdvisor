The Roosevelt is a modernized older hotel with 1940's character. The hotel is ideally located in downtown Seattle about 3 minutes off the I-5 freeway and about the same to get back on. Nice decor, amply sized junior suite, parking available (included in our special rate), and staff exceptionally courteous and I am sure helpful should assistance be requested.

My wife and I were married at Maroma in early August and the entire week was perfect. We had 18 people there 12 of which were there for the week and every minute was perfect. We worked wit Cecelia, the wedding coordinator and she left nothing out. Everyone that went, most of which were not used to the "all-inclusive" were blown away. The scenery, people, food, and drinks were great. Our wedding day was also perfect. We had photographers, and the pictures were amazing, videographer, violin player for the ceremony, and dj at the reception by the pool. We were really treated like royalty! We are looking forward to go back for our anniversary as part of the package we get a free weekend. Be sure to goto the spa and get a massage. The pools there and the massage was the best ever and worth the money. 5 Stars all the way!

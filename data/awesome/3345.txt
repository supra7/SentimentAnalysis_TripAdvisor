I had a long flight from the east coast into Seattle, and arrived at 5:30 pm. By 5:45, I was in my room - so the location is a huge plus. You can walk from the terminal (following signs for the light rail) in about ten minutes; alternatively, they have a shuttle. I was greeted quickly and pleasantly. I had booked via a third-party site, and when I asked about a king bed instead of 2 doubles, they offered me a $10 upgrade for the king. I took it in a heartbeat. My room was on the 4th floor - very comfortable, great shampoo/soap, etc. Bed was superb. Staff was outstanding throughout - when I asked about the easiest way to get to my rental car facility, they offered to drive me, saving me a ton of time. Huge points for that! Free wifi in the lobby - for the life of me I don't understand why Hilton doesn't offer it in the rooms, but tat seems to be a corporate policy, albeit not a wise one. 7-11 is a 5 minute walk, and has a Red Box on site for those of us who rent movies to watch during long flights, there is a Denny's 5 minutes away for a breakfast option. The on-site restaurant offers their lunch menu at the bar all day long, so you don't have to break the bank for a good meal. Hotel itself would be a 4 star rating due to comfort and convenience, the terrific staff bumps it up to a 5 star.

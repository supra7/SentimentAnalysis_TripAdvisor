Westin Seattle staff went above and beyond for our 23rd wedding anniversary. Upgraded to one of two new rooms with the same great Seattle Westin comfort and a nice new modern look. The rooms decor was the main change with slick lines and the bed moved from its corner location providing more space and a nice luxury feel. Westin Seattle sets a high bar because the old rooms while only a little tired, remain luxurious right up to this planned rennovation. I have been hard on the Westin Brand as a platinum guest of spg because of the lack of lounges and upgrade amenities. But this stay included this lovely room and a nice bottle of champagne arranged by the front desk team and was splendid. I recommend the Westin Seattle in any room and look forward to the completion of the upgrades which are cominh ahead of the typical timeline. I hope the Westin Seattle adds some of nice features like amenity lounges and complimentary platinum parking etc. that are nice treats at their sister Spg properties.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel between 22.2.12 to 5.3.12 to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversary. The hotel was stunning and our room was lovely - partial sea view - but couldn't see it for all the trees! All the restaurants were good and breakfast was amazing with so much choice. Drinks were good and we found the wine by the glass to be better than we thought it would be. The staff at this resort are all excellent and nothing was too much trouble for them - service with a smile! Beach was lovely and plenty of loungers - pool was nice and warm and we liked to lounge there in the mornings but quite often it got a bit too noisy for us in the afternoon so we went to the beach. The Entertainments team were great fun and you just took part if you wanted too - no pressure. We had a lovely holiday here and would return in a flash if there were no large Corporate Groups - there was one of around 250-300 for part of our first week and another of about 150 for the last few days. Some of the last group were very noisy - shouting and swearing which we did not feel was appropriate in this sort of hotel as it promotes itself to appeal to couples wanting a relaxing time. Don't get me wrong I like to see people enjoying themselves but this was not good and it changed the atmosphere of the hotel. A number of other couples felt the same that we spoke to. I had read about this on tripadvisor after we had booked and emailed the hotel in December to see if they had any large groups booked and they said they didn't which I find hard to believe as most of these events are booked very much in advance. This was the only negative in an otherwise outstanding hotel with the best staff ever! Please sort this out Secrets!!

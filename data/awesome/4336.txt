From the moment we arrived until we left, we were treated like royalty! The pour excellents brands and the food was top notch. The beach is wonderful for sitting on, you can take long walks on the beach and also nice sandy entry into the beach. Lots of palapas on the beach. Really nice pool area with lots of spots for sunning and also lots of shady spots as well as umbrellas. Servers bring around small finger foods around lunch time at botht he beach and the pool and you can always spot someone who will bring you your favorite drink. The spa is a very wonderful experience and the deep tissue massage was great!

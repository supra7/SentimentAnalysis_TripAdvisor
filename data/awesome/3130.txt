Booked here for one night to visit Seattle. Had read mixed reviews . Gave it a try and dont regret it. The first and immediate impression was a positive one. We were welcomed by a man at the reception named Peter . He deserves a mention : Kind, extremely helpful and a very nice person . I travel extensively and doesnt happen often to bump into people like that. Room was extremely well furnished, care for details, very comfortable bed, breathtaking view, spotless , silent and comfortable. Location , for our needs , was perfect. Close to everything and not more than a ( pleasant ) 8/10 minute walk to the Marina . I will definetely return to the Roosevelt

You will struggle to find a better spot that combines luxury, location, uniqueness, and a friendly staff in Seattle. The Inn is beautiful and has a one of a kind feel. The location is close to perfect and after your stay whenever you see the market in picture or on television you are guaranteed to feel a bit of nostalgia. It is withing walking distance to many of Seattle's attractions. Unlike a lot of hotels/ inns it has a very unique feel to it and a bit more personality than the rest. The staff is always willing to help and offer advice... with a big smile. We had two nights here and it was definitely not enough! Hope to be back one day soon. Oh, and don't forget your complimentary Washington apple on the way out of the door.

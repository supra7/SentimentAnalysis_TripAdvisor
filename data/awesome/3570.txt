I got this hotel on Hotwire for a steal. It was a great hotel, location is wonderful, we walked to everything, good restos near by. Room was lovely, had the lowest category, still two rooms, two tv's, bath and shower. Did not eat in hotel, brought breakfast with us as there is a small fridge, microwave, kettle and dishes etc. Free WIFI, great pool and hot tub area. Was very, very clean. Loved the Molton Brown toiletries. Beds and bedding were great quality. Would stay there agin in a heartbeat. Much nicer than the Fairmont Queen Eloizabeth just up the street. Staff were friendly and very helpful, had a few issues with the fridge and they were up fixing it in no time at all.

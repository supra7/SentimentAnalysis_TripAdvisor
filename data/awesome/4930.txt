Our idea of an ideal vacation is to lie on the beach for five days and enjoy good food and drinks. Even after reading the reviews at tripadvisor.com, Secrets Maroma Beach exceeded all of our expectations. The beach is gorgeous, wide and clean. The water is clear and you can walk out a fair distance. There are an ample number of palapas -- very important for those of us who burn. One day the constant wind caused us to retreat to the beautiful pool, but that is hardly a complaint. Our room was beautiful. We selected the cheapest class of room and got a great price on the room and flight through Priceline. Our room was on the first floor, with a balcony that led to a river / swimming pool that winds through the entire resort. Excellent dining. The group dining at the Japanese restaurant was great (reservation required) . The French restaurant was nice, but nothing special. The seafood restaurant near the pool was especially good. The service was very attentive. We will definitely return.

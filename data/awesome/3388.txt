We (family of 4) had a king suite for one night before flight, and it was exactly what we needed. Even though we had a room facing the airport we didn't find the noise overbearing (blended with the air con "white noise") and the "sleep number" king bed (you can adjust your side's firmness) was very comfortable. However, the sofa bed wasn't great even for sofa beds, but they tried to make it more comfortable by putting a quilt on top of the springy mattress, which was fine for my kids who shared it (size was double). Front desk and housekeeping staff were awesome (the sofa bed wasn't made when we got there but the lady was there within 5 mins of my call to make it). My daughter accidentally left her Nintendo DS with all her games behind and they kept it in housekeeping until we went back to claim it upon our return to SeaTac a week after. We didn't park our car there while we're away but could have (we had discounted rates at Wally Park) for $10 a day, still very reasonable for its proximity to the airport. We'd stay there again next time we need to fly out of SeaTac.

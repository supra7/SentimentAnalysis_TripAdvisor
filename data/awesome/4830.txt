I want to start by saying this place lives up to all the great reviews that I had read in the weeks prior to booking this trip. Im not going to get as indepth as some reviewers, but I will point out the highlights. First and foremost, the service is what makes this place stand out. I have been to approx 10 nice all inclusive resorts, but none hold a candle to the service here. Each request of any staff member is met with " its my pleasure " and they really make you feel that way. Upon completion of your request, they always ask if they can do anything else for you. One example of the desire to please the guest, was when my wife asked for hair conditioner because the resort only carried conditioning shampoo, and the employee went into Cancun on his own off time, and purchased it for her. Every meal was excellent, the pool staff constantly brought around appetizers the entire day that were unique and delicious. The hand carved Al Pastor (marinated pork on a turning spit } by the pool each day was the best i've ever eaten. The drink service was never an issue, before you finished your drink by the pool the server was there asking if you wanted another. The drinks were all top shelf and nice and strong if you requested a double. The pools, the beach, the grounds and the restaurants all were outstanding. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone, but remember if this is your first all inclusive you will be spoiled for life. The only minor negative about this awesome place is that the Ala cart restaurants really enforce the long pants and sleeved shirt rules for dinner. It is true, you really do get what you pay for in this instance, the little more we spent for this resort was well worth it !!!! Thankyou Tripadvisor reviewers for the great choice.

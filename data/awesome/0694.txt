Our stay at the Inn at the Market was a delightful culmination of much planning by my partner and Noelle, a concierge at the hotel. When we arrived, our room had been upgraded to a 7th floor water view room (a birthday surprise from my partner) that overlooked the deck on the fifth floor. The room was spacious and quiet with a sliding glass window that actually opened! We were able to enjoy the sounds of the city and the cool breezes or shut the door and enjoy the quiet. The view was always beautiful. The hotel staff's attention to detail and impeccable service only added to our enjoyment. Noelle had put together a delightful surprise of fresh flowers from the Market and a wine and cheese basket and cupcakes and chocolates that I am still enjoying!

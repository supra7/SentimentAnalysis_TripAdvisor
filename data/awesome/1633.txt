I stayed at the hotel with my sister for a week in Jan. 10, and I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. We stayed in the Pike tower on floor 21, two double beds. We never had to wait more than a minute for the elevator which was nice. The room is really large considering most big city rooms are the size of closets. I am big on cleanliness, and the bathroom, shower curtain, towels, bed linens, etc were all clean. There was a nice big tv, but we didn't really use it. The hotel staff were all friendly, they have a concierge, but we didn't need their service, so I can't know how they were. The gym is on the top floor and it is two stories with tons of cardio machines and weight machines. They also have an indoor pool, and it doesn't have a strong chlorine odor. The valet parking is expensive, but with a downtown location that's just how it is. The Daily Grill is the hotel restaraunt, and they are super nice and the food is delicious. The breakfast was good and price was reasonable. We went for appetizers and desserts only one night, and still got top notch service. You get free internet in the business center, that is a big perk. The location of the hotel is close by all tourist attractions and shopping. I'd recommend this hotel to all, and I did notice dogs around, so they are pet friendly.

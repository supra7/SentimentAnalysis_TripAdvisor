From the contemporary, light-filled lobby to the very roomy, comfortable, and sleek rooms, Le Crystal delivers an exceptional, stylish, swanky experience. The lobby is hip without being offputting or unfriendly. It is well lit and there is no pulsating music. While there are glamorous people passing through all the time, the staff is friendly and we felt comfortable enough on one rainy day to play board games at a big glass table in the corner. Our room was extremely well-appointed and comfortable. The bed and linens are great, the bathroom was huge and the shower head wonderful (hot and powerful both). The products are good, towels plentiful, and the fixtures all modern and stylish. I would be happy to have the furniture and art in my own home. We were staying at the hotel over Easter weekend and the hotel went over the top to indulge guests (especially children) in candy and festivities. Lots of chocolate and jelly beans for everyone! We swam every day during our 5-day trip. The pool was cold but there was some sort of mechanical issue. Otherwise, it was the best hotel pool we've been too -- water not too chlorine-y, great seating for the grown ups, a nice hot tub on the adjoining outdoor deck, and an amazing view of Montreal. The gym, while small, is perfectly useful and has the same great view. The location is close to public transportation, in the new part of Montreal, and near some good restaurants. One negative is the hotel restaurant. We had breakfast there one day because my kids were begging. They ate from the overpriced buffet which, while European (maybe), was disappointing: dried fruit, cold cereal, mediocre fruit salad, etc. The service was inattentive and indifferent and we had to ask repeatedly for coffee refills (a must for tired parents at breakfast) and the check. Basically, you will be delighted if you stay at Le Crystal.

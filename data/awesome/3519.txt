I travelled to Montreal last April for when the UFC was in town and chose this hotel over Centre Sheraton and Mariott Chateau Champlain where the rest of my friends stayed for similar rates. All I can say was my hotel blew theirs away. Beautiful rooms, nice lighting, all the amenities, big bay windows, a great dual-spout shower (rain shower + side shower) and got a late 3PM checkout at no additional fee. Only complaint is how strict they are about letting people up into your rooms. They make any of your visitors check in at the desk first, and you cannot access the elevators without a room key otherwise. A nice bonus is the baskets of fresh fruit available free by the elevators every day, a good way to start the day right at no additional fee.. Superb location too. Right across from the Bell Centre, and Crescent street so you can crawl back to your room all liquored up. Can't wait to return this December!

My wife and I traveled to Secrets for a much needed vacation. We have been to a number of Sandals in the past and enjoy the convenience and ease of the all inclusive resorts, especially those catering to adults. We were thoroughly impressed with the Secrets Maroma. The resort is clean, well maintained, the beach is one of the prettiest in the world and, most importantly, the people couldn't have been nicer! I guess, when I compare the rooms we've had at Sandals in the past to the rooms here, I prefer the Sandals rooms though, to be fair, we always upgraded to suites at Sandals. The week we were there, I always had a fear of stumbling down the unmarked step in the sitting area of our room? Otherwise, the room was fine. The bed was really comfortable! We loved the food, especially the Japanese steak house, but all the restaurants were good. Since we're from the midwest, we really enjoyed the fresh seafood. The drinks were good, not watered down, with premium liquour on request. We didn't use the room service so I can't comment about it. We did upgrade to the Club level and found the folks there in the concierge were attentive to any and every need we had! We had a ball at the shows. No, they weren't Broadway productions but they were entertaining, made us laugh, and are certainly worth the time to attend. I'd highly recommend the resort. It is a terrific value!

Nice hotel! My second stay here; room is big, clean, and well-equipped. The service is excellent and the rooftop deck is a great place to end the day with a nice bottle of wine. Wonderful view overlooking the market and bay. The location is great; Pike's Place market is literally just steps away, and there are many great restaurants and activities within walking distance.

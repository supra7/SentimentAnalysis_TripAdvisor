We decided to stay here for three nights during our trip to Seattle. The checkin clerk was very friendly and said she would ensure we had a good view. We ended up on the 11th floor overlooking the airport and the Cascades. We had a balcony, the beds were super comfortable, room was a good size and clean. There are restaurants all around, plus two in the hotel. Shuttle to airport runs every 20 minutes. Great place and would definately stay again.

We stayed at the resort the first week of November. Every aspect exceeded our expectations. We have stayed at several very nice all inclusive resorts and this ranks near the top. I enjoyed the food at the restaurants and the staff was incredible. We loved the beautiful beach, one of the nicest beaches I have ever seen. Our room was great, very comfortable and clean. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I cannot wait to go back!

This was a great hotel. Check in efficient and we were given maps and local information. The room was very spacious, clean, quiet and not over-heated. A great location to walk to all key attractions - shopping, Seattle Centre, Pike market place. Would be happy to recommend this hotel to any of my friends travelling to Seattle.

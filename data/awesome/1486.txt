I'm an employee for Quality Inn in Vancouver B.C. I was a bit skeptical at first for booking at this hotel. Being an employee of a hotel, you know all the good and the bad. Upon check-in, I was pleasantly surprised at the service. There was a coffee station and a view of the indoor pool where you check-in. The two gentleman (sorry, I didn't get the names) at the front desk were exceptional. They were friendly, polite and made me feel at home. Parking was a breeze and included with the price! (Considering this hotel is downtown and central to most attractions. Most downtown hotels in major cities charge ridiculous prices). The covered parking was a bit dim and the parking gates were wide open. The elevators are a bit slow, so I opted for the stairs instead. My room was great! However, my key cards didn't work, but the staff fixed the problem right way. I was suprised the room provided a fridge at no extra cost. The beds were comfortable and clean. (I could not find one piece of hair!) The shower was nice and hot and the pressure was strong. I requested an ironing board and it came within 5 minutes. I didn't take advantage of the breakfast or other amenities, there was just too much to do in Seattle than to stay in my room! Overall, this hotel was superb for the value and quality. The service made my stay a memorable one. They never once hesistated to answer my questions.

I was placed in this hotel by the airlines because of problems with the plane. This is a great hotel. Friendly staff. The room was very spacious and very clean. We had a balcony that overlooked the airport. With the door closed, we were unable to hear any airport noise. We will definitely stay at this hotel in our next trip to Seattle.

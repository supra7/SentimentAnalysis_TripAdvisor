We absolutely LOVED our stay here. Very convenient location, lovely room, and excellent friendly staff. The onsite restaurant Sazerac is to die for, and has a marvelous happy hour! The hotel hosts a "wine hour" at the end of the day, and this was a great way to relax and meet other guests. They will give you a goldfish in a bowl for your room, during your stay, if you request it. I thought that was a really fun twist. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would LOVE to stay there again!

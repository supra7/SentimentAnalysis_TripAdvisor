The Westin is the place to stay! We stayed on the 41st floor and had a super view of the bay. looking toward the mountains and the space needle. The staff was outstanding--front desk, concierge, and the wonderful waitress in the restaurant at breakfast who made us feel as if we were at home. As others have noted, location is perfect for the walker. Our room was spacious and lovely, the bed as heavenly as advertised.

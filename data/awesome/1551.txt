The hotel is in a great location to easily walk to shopping, restaurants, and tourist places like Pike Place, Seattle Aquarium etc. The hotel rooms are spacious and very clean. Loved the fitness center on the top floor. Stayed during the Seahawks playoff weekend, did have one very loud drunk neighbor, but security came up immediately within about 2 minutes of calling the front desk. Also they have computers in lobby to check in and print your airline boarding pass.

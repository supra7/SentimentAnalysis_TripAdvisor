JUST AN F.Y.I., IF YOUR RESORT OR ANY SECRETS RESORT, PROMISES YOU AN ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL, MAKE SURE YOU GET IT IN WRITING, AT THAT TIME. My wife and I went on our honeymoon to Secrets Maroma Beach and it was great. It was so great last night we tried to plan our anniversary trip. When we were there, the resort told us that if we return within one year or on our anniversary, we would get free nights, per the amount of nights we book. Sounded great. Well, last night we called the Secrets customer service 800 number. First of all, we got the worst customer service I have ever gotten. I felt like it was a training call. Second of all, the lady told me that she could not help me, and that I would have to call Mexico, to try and get such a special. After trying to talk with the lady for 30 minutes, I hung up the phone, and we started to web search different resorts. Unfortunately for them, we are planning a trip in March, and our anniversary in September. Unfortunately for us, we really wanted to return to a Secrets resort. So in short, if a Secrets resort promises you a special for your anniversary, make sure you get it in writing! Then you will have it and you won't be told your making it up by the customer service lady. Good luck with your travel plans.

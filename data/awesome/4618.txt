This one got it right. From the fabulous nightime entertainment (Cirque du Soleil, Rock of Ages, first run movies) to the beautiful grounds, great ambiance in the restaurants, good food, spectacular rooms, great lobby bar, helpful staff, amazing pool and pool area. More like a Four Season's or Ritz Carlton than an all-inclusive. My list of things I loved about this place could go on forever. I'm not easily impressed but this place knocked me out. No stone went unturned to make this one of the best resorts out there. And I don't mean just all-inclusive, it's one of the best resorts! Stay here, you will not be disappointed!!! We went to another all-inclusive a week later and saw the difference. Secrets Maroma is head and shoulders above the rest. You do need reservations at all the restaurants no matter what they say. Sure you can get in at 10:00pm but not at 7:00pm without a reservation. The ONLY thing that was not good was the fitness center. Which was a surprise. It's not good at all.

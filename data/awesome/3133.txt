This was the first hotel we stayed in during our latest North American trip, and we were really happy with it. The Roosevelt has a great old world feel, with beautiful wallpapers and furniture to match. The staff are friendly and obliging, and the room was very clean. We stayed in a Deluxe Room, which I'm pretty sure is the smallest they offer - but for travel it was a perfect size. The best thing about the Roosevelt is its location to Downtown Seattle. It was by far the most convenient hotel we stayed at on our trip - easy to duck back to the hotel for a mid afternoon break, and safe enough to wander home at 2am after a long dinner and drinks. Perfect!

stayed from 5/9 to 5/14 we had a swim out room, weather, room, water temp. in pool, food was great. i spoke to a few couples that complained about reserved seats at pool and beach area. since i had a swim out room i had no problem. I did bring a blow up floater to enjoy in the pool. Stay clear of the time share people. I have read all the reviews before i left so i knew that the 200 dollar gift certificate was useless. They get you as soon as you finish checking in. Be firm, say no and if should be fine. The weather the week we stayed was great, no rain at all. the temps were high 80;s. I would definately recommend secrets maroma beach to any one looking for a nice quiet vacation. I have to add it was pretty formal. Men do need to bring slacks and a short sleeve shirt to get into the restauants at night.

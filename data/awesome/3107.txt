My husband and I stayed at the Hotel MAx when I attended a conference in April. I was a bit leary of the room sizes, after reading tales of small bathrooms (my husband is 6'3"). We had a Queen room and it was just fine. The amount of "nesting" room available worked for us and the bathroom (no tub, just a shower, but a roomy shower) was ample for leg room, head room, etc. We adored the art and the photography on the doors - So much so that we purchased the hotel's book that includes all the art represented in the hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but had drinks from very friendly and knowledgable barthenders. The front desk staff was great..... they really worked to help me figure out when "Survivor" would air! The only (tiny) complaint was when we checked out, the gentleman who helped us grabbed a windex bottle and sprayed down the counter before we could turn around to leave - Hmmm... did we have cooties??!! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Great location and great artsy atmosphere.

I had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful hotel over the weekend. The moment you walk through the door you will be enchanted by one of the most beautiful hotel lobbies in Seattle. The inviting Fireside Room makes the perfect place to read a good book or drink a cup of coffee while you catch up with a friend. The room that I stayed in had one of the most comfortable beds that I have slept in. I usually have a rough time sleeping in hotels but slept like a baby. Many thanks to the hospitable staff for all of their hard work in making me feel right at home.

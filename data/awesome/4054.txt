Everything was wonderful for our honeymoon. Very accomodating and friendly staff, tons of food everywhere, even on the beach they have chefs a couple times a day. Only thing I do have to say is that we couldn't seem to get drunk drinking the mixed drinks. Stick to wine, beer & straight shots if your looking to enjoy the alcohol. The entertainment shows were great & they have alot of activities even if it rains. You will never have to leave the resort unless you want to shop because the resort's shops are limited. I read on here people had to wait for dinner with beepers, we didn't have to wait once & didn't have to buy anything to get us into dinner faster. It is like any other place when you go out to eat, when it is busy, there may be a little wait. We were not approached at all by the timeshare people.

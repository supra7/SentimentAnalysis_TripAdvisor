Secrets Maroma Beach is an All-Inclusive Adults Only resort located between Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a huge ocean view suite with an indoor and outdoor jacuzzi. The king sized bed was very comfortable and the room kept clean daily by excellent housekeeping staff. Beautiful clean white sandy beach and turqoise water. All the staff were extremely pleasant and went out of their way to provide superb service. Eight restaurants provide ample choosing of wonderful food. Plenty of liquid refreshments. A large heated pool as well as two separate hot tubs. We used the spa services which were fantastic. We will go back again.

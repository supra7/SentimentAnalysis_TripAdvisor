This is the fourth time that I have stayed in this hotel and it never fails to impress. The rooms are not huge but they are adequate and they have all that you need to for a comfortable stay. I was particularly impressed by the bathroom which, for once, has instructions on all taps etc which are intuitive and easy to understand. How many times have you been standing there wondering how to make the shower work only to be hit by a jet of cold water when you least expect it? AT least that doesn't happen here. The restaurant is excellent and good value for what it is.

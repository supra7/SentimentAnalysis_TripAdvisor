We recently took an Alaskan cruise and flew in one day early and stayed at the Westin. This was a great place to stay because you could easily walk down to Pikes Place and even Pioneer Square. We did the underground tour, which is filled with great history of how the city was actually built and you actually walk around underground. Tip: We took shuttles and found out that they were incredibly more expensive than taking the taxis. We paid 17.00$ to get from the Westin to the dock and 18.00$ from the W Hotel to the airport.

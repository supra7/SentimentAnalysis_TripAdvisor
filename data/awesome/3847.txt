We visited Secrets Maroma in May. We stayed with 50 of our friends and family at the resort. It is a beautiful place with excellent service. The staff was friendly and helpful. The wedding process was easy and pretty stress free. Leading up to the wedding I e-mailed with Valeria, the wedding coordinator. Once we got there we met with her and she made the process easy so we could enjoy our time with our friends and family. The day of the wedding everything went as planned and we had a wonderful day. This resort definitely caters to weddings and groups but they do a good job of keeping the groups seperated. We married in the gazebo by the pool. We were concerened about noise from people in the pool but everyone was very respectful. Our only complaint about the wedding process was the photographer. They took excellent pictures but the day we were leaving we met with them to view the pictures and were told if we want to purchase the DVD with all the pictures we needed to pay $400 cash right then and there. It was very unprofessional. The food and restaurants were great. The 24 hour room service is awesome. The restaurants do not take reservations so it can be difficult to seat large parties. The resort obviously caters to groups and weddings but the restaurants are not really set up for them. It all worked out but sometimes we had to wait awhile to eat dinner. I think they need to allow reservations for parties of 6 or 8 people to accomodate some larger groups. The food by the pool was awesome. Everyone seemed to love the taco cart. The spa is a must. A beautiful space with great services. Take them up on going early and enjoying the steam, sauna, and pool before your treatment. This is an awesome resort. It will change your mind about all-inclusive resorts. This is how it should be done.

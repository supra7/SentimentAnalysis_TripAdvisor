Attending a conference in Seattle recently, I am so glad I stayed at the Sheraton. It is readily apparent that this facility was carefully thought through. Everything is convenient and the service is top-flight. The location is close to everything, too--shopping, restaurants, the convention center, tourist attractions, and so much more. The restaurant is quite nice and the lounge area is tasteful and relaxed. The room was so clean and quiet plus the linens were elegant as so comfortable. I will definitely stay at Sheraton again--and am looking forward to it!!

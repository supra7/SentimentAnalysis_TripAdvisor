Stayed two nights at Hotel Max, Friday/Saturday. Good deal from Groupon $109 per night including Wifi and parking. Limited by the hotel age, the management have more than made up for in service and amenities. Everything is clean, modern and well appointed. We had a Queen Art room on the 7th floor. Shower only (and the smallest shower we had ever experienced) the bath products were Aveda, bed linens lovely, Italian coffee delish, cool robes (2 not 1 0 very good) and a really good hair dryer (not those puny ones). Only criticism was the room safe was not affixed to anything, set on a shelf and the weight of the door made it rock precariously off the shelf. Danger waiting to happen. We enjoyed Happy Hour at Red Fin which was very good. Gym was small but had brand new machines. Staff were really good, appreciated the door persons - they were friendly and helpful. We will return, perhaps upgrade to a larger room to fully enjoy the hotel. If you like the boutique experience, highly recommend this hotel.

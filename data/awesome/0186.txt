I stayed here for two nights in July. It is a very nice hotel, located within walking distance to the water Pikes Place Market, Pioneer Square and some shopping centers. Its a nicely appointed, beautiful boutique hotel. Staff was great; service was excellent. Free wireless if you are a Kimpton member. They also gave me $10 free from the minibar for being a member! Wine hour was a nice way to relax at the end of the day. I turned down the complimentary pet goldfish. Unfortunately I missed the fortune teller and massage. Pros: Location, great staff, beautiful hotel, wonderful service Cons: can't think of any aside from not being able to get a late checkout Summary: Loved this hotel. I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

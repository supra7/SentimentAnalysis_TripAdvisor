My boyfriend and I visited Secrets at the end of August 2011 for one week. We were not sure which resort we would get, but were beyond delighted and relieved that Maroma would be our destination. We've stayed at several all-inclusives including Sandals and Iberostar and this takes the cake. Everything was in working order, the cleaning service was great and we requested with our concierge anything special that we needed. All of the service was top notch, the couples we met and staff was incredible and fun. Our main hang out was the swim-up bar or gaming bar. And our favorite restaurant had to be World Cafe (ask for Yuri!) with the Japanese in 2nd. The rooms were immaculate and there were screens outside of the patio glass doors to keep mosquitoes at bay. That was probably the only issue that we had, mosquitoes, but it is Mexico. And they do provide repellant wipes in the rooms. We had fun going bike riding around the resort (guided) and I wish we had done the kayaking and other activities too. I think I over packed bringing blow up floats, special thermal cups and beauty and health products galore. There was really no need for all that here at Maroma. 24 hour room service came in handy with the Secrets box. We used it more than I expected. You may have to experiment with what you order though. The beach was clean, with great service and you could grab food on the beach or pretty much anywhere. Did a little bit of the entertainment stuff, but that was not really our thing. You really could stay on the resort for your entire trip. They have gift shops and vendors, although they are very expensive. You may make out better at the airport! We did go to Tulum & Xel-ha as well as Party Hopper. You can book at the hotel and even charge those to your room so you only have 1 banking charge. Basically, everyone made the stay at Secrets Maroma so easy and comfortable I would love to go back. And since I enjoyed it so much, doubt we would book at the other locations.

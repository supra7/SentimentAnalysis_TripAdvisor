Just arrived from a 5 day stay at this hotel and I must say it is one of the best business hotels I have ever stayed. Not just rooms and restaurant are great, front desk is amazing and WILL go an extra mile for you. Arrived at the same day Canadians were playing at the Center Bell. Concierge provided tickets easily. Rooms are spotless. Everything works fine. Service is outstanding. Definitely will stay here again. One block from St Catherine where you can find shops, cinemas and restaurants. A couple of blocks from whatever you need. Stay here, I do recommend and if you doubt me, please read my other reviews and you will see that I don't say that often.

We stayed at the Inn at the Market for one night before a cruise. We chose room 810 for the view and were not disappointed. Another reason for picking that room was space. We were on a 2-week trip with varying clothing requirements so we needed room for 4 large suitcases. Our luggage nearly disappeared in the closets and alcoves which kept the room looking tidy. The view of Puget Sound was outstanding. The hotel is attached to our favorite Seattle restaurant, Campagne, right at Pike Public Market and near good shopping. Very safe neighborhood for walking in the evening. We were also happy that an AVIS lot was close to the hotel so that we could drop off our car and walk downhill with our luggage.

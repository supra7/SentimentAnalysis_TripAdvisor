I have been a regular guest at the Sorrento Hotel since shortly after it underwent its first major remodel. I cannot remember the year but it has been at least 25 years, give or take. I estimate that I have checked into the Sorrento, for both business and pleasure, at least 75 times, probably more. These stays have been up to a week in duration. I did not think that it was possible for the Sorrento to improve on the quality of service. But they did. The economic meltdown caused many of the hotels in which I stay around the country, the Sorrento included, to eliminate or cut back on some of the guest amenities. However, the Sorrento has more than made up for this with the continued friendly, professional and genuine hospitality of its staff. In addition, in terms of the really important things in a hotel -- comfortable bedding, clean and well-appointed guest rooms, concierge services, on-site dining (the Hunt Club), room service, Internet access, prompt and accurate reservations and check-in -- they are the hotel that I use as a benchmark against which to compare other hotels. Their concierge and front desk staffs are top flight. If you do not choose to dine in the Hunt Club, something I recommend that you do at least once, their concierge is extremely knowledgeable as to the local restaurant scene. I recommend that you have him make your reservations. It seems to work a little bit of magic with regard to seating and level of service. I can unreservedly recommend the Sorrento Hotel.

My husband and I spend 4 nights here in January 2011. I have to say my expectations were certainly exceeded and I would absolutely come back! Check in - Great first impression, moist towel, champagne, very nice staff. Word of warning -they bring you over to a second desk and try to get you to sign up for a time share presentation and offer you spa coupons and free bottle of wine if you do. Don't waste your time, the resort is too amazing to waste a minute of your time! Food - Very good, we really enjoyed the resyaurants and ppolside snacks. Tip - you need to ask for your drinks to be made with premium alcohol. Service - Outstanding! Room (Partial ocean view) - We loved our room! Comfy bed, beautiful balcony and view, clean and all around great. Fully stocked mini bar - just let your concierge know what beer and beverages you prefer and theywill stock it daily to your liking. The room service was fantastic, they brought us whatever we wanted, not a long wait. Only negative is that you can hear everything going on when someone is is the bathroom - not very private. A nice touch was that they left incense in the room daily. Pool - Wonderful, couldn't ask for more! Loved the swim up bar, floats, and pool volleyball. Get there early for a good spot, people reserve the lounge chairs super early! Beach - Beautiful, great for swimming and walking. The beach makes this resort a standout from others. The beach-side bar has cool swings to sit on instead of bar stools! Wasn't too crowded. Activities - Not the best in the world. None of the shows appealed to us, so we didn't check them out. They have a nice nightclub and the yoga classes were nice. Honestly, we mostly just ate and lounged at the pool or beach are were totally happy. Very relaxing. Didn't check out the spa services so can't speak to that. If you are considering this resort, I highly reccomend! I would definitely come back!

We honeymooned here and loved it! We had a beautiful ocean-front room which was clean and new. The beach is incredible- powdery white sand and warm aqua water. The service throughout the resort was amazing, everyone was so friendly! The food is endless and delicious! The French, Italian, and Mexican restaurants were incredible!!! Fun activities offered throughout the day and night. We can't wait to go back!

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this resort. From the moment we walked in as they "welcomed us home" to the moment we said goodbye, every moment was simply incredible. The food was amazing. The staff could not do enough for you. Every request was met with "It's a pleasure". Our suite was amazing with a breath taking view of the resort. We stayed in building 24 which was not part of the preferred members club and we felt like royalty. I do not believe it is necessary to upgrade. The beach was to die for. The sand was like sugar between my toes and I have never seen such blue water in my life. We had a couple's massage and although the massages themselves were not the best, the spa amenities were well worth it. I cannot say enough about this resort. It was well worth the money, if not more. I am counting the moments until I can return.

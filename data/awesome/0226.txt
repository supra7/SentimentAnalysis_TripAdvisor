I live in Vancouver BC and decided to travel south to Portland and Seattle for the weekend. We hit Portland first, then on our way back we stayed one night in Seattle. After that longgg drive from Portland, I was exhausted and needed a good night sleep. The Monaco definitely provided that. The front desk staff was friendly, did my check-in in about 2 minutes...which was great because I was dying to just lay down. The room is a good size, large enough to park our baby's giant stroller in front of the closet and we still had room to walk around it. The bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and stocked with Aveeda products. Everything looked newish. I slept like a baby all night. Will definitely stay here again.

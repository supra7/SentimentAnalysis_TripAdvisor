I live in Washington, so I suppose I am biased. However, this was one awesome hotel. The rooms were very modern, but you could still tell it was an old building. Overall, the rooms are small but it was such a nice hotel it was worth it. It's also located in a great area. It's a few blocks up from Pike Place Market, and right next door to a Starbucks (although, what in Seattle isn't next to a Starbucks?) My only complaint is that the walls were very thin. We weren't able to sleep well because the people next to us were very noisy. However, I asked the staff to talk to them and they quieted down shortly. Also, the music in the hotel lobby was perfect.

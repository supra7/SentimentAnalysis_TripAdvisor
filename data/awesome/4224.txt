As far as all inclusive resorts go, this is top of the line. Food was fantastic and plentiful. Rooms are nice. We had a room that was classified as a partial ocean view but would couldn't see any part of the ocean. It didn't bother us though. At this particular resort, there is no real benefit to upgrading to the "preferred club." We didn't do it here but spoke to others and they confirmed that it wasn't worth the additional money. Pool was beautiful and large so you didn't feel overcrowded. They won't let you reserve chairs by the pool prior to 10am and they really monitor it. We actually liked that. Overall, it was a great vacation and everyone we spoke to at the resort said that it was one of the best places they have ever stayed!

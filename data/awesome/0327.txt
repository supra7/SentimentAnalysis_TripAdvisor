I have stayed at the Warwick for many years. It is very well priced for all that you get. Location is excellent. Close to everything. The staff always goes above and beyond. The food is fantastic, most rooms have a great view. We always get a room looking directly at the Space Needle. If you smoke they are one of the few hotels left that allows smoking. Which in all fairness to the smokers, I believe that it is your right to smoke and if you are paying the price for a room, they should all have smoking rooms available. Equal rights, we all know that Seattle prides it self on that .. The Warwick is the best value for the price in all of Seattle. It is true that the parking is 27 dollars, but there is a public lot across the street. Most hotels in the area charge more then that. They have a very nice pool and spa area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to our city.As for the noise, all hotels in the city have noise. That is just the way it is in the city. Sirens and buses.

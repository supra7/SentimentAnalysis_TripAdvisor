The hotel was beautiful and kept very nice & clean. The room was great- good size and a sleep number bed! We didn't hear any planes as it is across from SEA-Tac. Southcenter, a huge shopping mall area is just minutes from the hotel and you can walk to 13 coins a super fun & good food 24hr restaurant.

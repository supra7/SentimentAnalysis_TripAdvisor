just back today from a 2 week stay at this wonderful hotel,staff attentive couldnt do enough for you,food great with an excellent variety you must try the japanese restaurant at least 3 times...drinks whatever you want you get!!! Entertainment staff keep you going all day if that is what you really want.Spa is a must it was heaven. Only downside for us some of the guests for the weddings spoilt the peacefulness of the resort a little by being drunk early day to late evening.(several weddings a day making it a regular occurance) Would love to go back again!!!!

This was both mine and my husbands second time at the resort. My daughter and her husband also came with us for their second visit. We stayed Sept 20 thru the 27th and it was wonderful. We decided during that visit to join your Vacation Club. We knew this was the kind of vacation we would do again and again so it made sense. We are planning to go to Punta Cana in April. Barbara V

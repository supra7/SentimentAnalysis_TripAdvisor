We were overall very pleased with the hotel. The location was an easy walk to most places (including the harbor for ferry travel) and had a convenient underground stop for anything further out. The room was not huge but big enough for a king size bed, desk and cabinet with drawers for clothes and a minibar. The bathroom was plenty spacious and amenties were good. The bed was comfortable and my hubby loved the pillows! There is a good restaurant and bar on sight - and the people there were very friendly. The only constructive criticism we would give is the Concierge and Bell staff could've been more helpful. They were not rude - very nice in fact - just didn't seem to well informed or knowledgeable. We asked things like travel times or train / bus stops, etc and they didn't seem to know - and when we asked for help with a taxi, we could generally flag one faster than they could get one. It wasn't bad enough to keep us from staying there again - just a little frustrating.

The hotel was wonderful; the booking service was not. I called EXPEDIA, tripadvisor's parent to book the hotel. The operator had trouble making the reservation. I called Customer Service to get help in rearranging dates for my 2 day reservation. I had called the hotel and spoke with a friendly staffer who told me that since reservations were mader through Expedia and they had paid: they had to request the change. She said thechange was fine from the hotel's viewpoint. The Expedia rep told me the reservation could not be changed because the hotel would not allow it. I asked to speak to asupervisor. I got Mallory. Mallory claimed to fix things for me. The next day Iarrived at the hotel was treated very well, even upgrade to a suite for a minor inconvenience. The next day the Hotel informed me that Expedia only booked me for 1 day. They corrected the situation for me. I called Expedia Customer Service to ask about this. They had no explanation. They were a 3rd party service company not affiliated with Expedia; they werre in the Phillipinnes and they could nit give me an address or names of any Expedia officers because that is against company policy. THANK YOU HOTEL ANDRA, I LOVED YOUR SERVICE. EXPEDIA, YOU WERE A HINDRANCE AND YOU HAVE SINCE TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS MY FAULT. Indeed it was I used Expedia.

Very centrally located for shopping and night life. We walked to the Ballgame and then headed to a Jazz bar in the evening. Lots of good restaurants and close to the fish market. Simply had it all. The Hotel allows pets and we didn't encounter any problems...just the time it took to cuddle and coo over the dogs. Rooms are well equipped but pillows were questionable and I like a well lit room so it could have had a little more light. The Hotel restaurant was fun, especially sitting up by the cooks. They seem to genuinely enjoy entertaining you.

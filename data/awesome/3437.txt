We loved our stay at Lindemann's - we found a modern hotel that was so convenient to all public transport making ideal for getting around Berlin. As well it's located in a really nice district: safe with an abundance of good, reasonably-priced restaurants. The staff could not have been more helpful. Our days started with a gorgeous buffet breakfast which truly set us up for the day. Even though we picked one of their smaller rooms it was bright, spotlessly clean with a really comfortable bed. Would we go back? You bet we will!

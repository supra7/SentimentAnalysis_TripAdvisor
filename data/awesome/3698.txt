Confirming what everyone else says about this place. An absolute dream. The service is quick and friendly. The food is fantastic, especially at the restaurants (real 5* food and presentation). The main pool is gorgeously warm, which is why most of us drift around drinking cocktails in it! There is always a sunlounger available with a handy waiter regularly checking if you want anything. Adults only,so no pesky kids. If you want all inclusive I would recommend this place, it's easily the best I have been to anywhere.

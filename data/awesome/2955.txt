I have been to Seattle many times but this was my first time I stayed at Hotel Max. The Hotel Max is in a perfect location. Macy's, Pacific Mall, Pike Market, the tready restaurants are within walking distance from the hotel. The staff of the hotel are very professional, friendly, and attentative. The space in the room is somewhat smaller than most other hotels that I have stayed at, but given the location, cool stylish decor and most helpful staff, the smaller space didn't really matter. I always always enjoy going to Seattle, staying at Hotel Max just made it even better!!!

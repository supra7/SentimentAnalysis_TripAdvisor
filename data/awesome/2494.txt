After some coments of some people. I was kind of concern about my stay! My experience was great. the room was at 27 floor and the elevators were fast...and I didn't wait that much for them. The rooms were very clean, and the carpets were clean! The bed was excellent, one of the best ones I ever slept. the barthroom was clean and very nice. Swimming pool was kind of small, the hot tub was very big with great view of town!

Beautiful, romantic rooms. Staff who treat you like you are the only guests. Very Tentative and hard working beach wait staff tending to our every need. Beautiful beach, sugary white sand, clean water for great swimming. No rocks or coral to ruin a swim! Long beach for walking. Free use of kayaks and sailboats. Numerous restaurants -French, Italian, Japanese, etc. Fabulous food and drinks (not weak ones either!) that we really enjoyed. Paella made fresh daily on the beach is surely not to be missed! Tennis courts were nice - just bring plenty of water to drink! We had a very peaceful and memorable time at Maroma. We were sad to leave but plan to return in the near future. Do not pass up the opportunity to stay at this fabulous adult resort. You will not be disappointed.

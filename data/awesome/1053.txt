The Mayflower Park Hotel is beautiful, charming, and an absolutely wonderful place to stay. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, the rooms lovely and comfortable, and the hotel, overall, is elegant yet inviting. In planning our pre- and post-cruise stay in Seattle, my friend and I wanted to find a nice downtown location, and a unique hotel that would add to a great vacation experience. The Mayflower Park far exceeded those expectations, and our stay there was memorable in and of itself. The cruise package, which included transportation to and from the pier, as well as breakfast in the excellent Andaluca restaurant, was great. No worries, no stress - the staff took care of everything, and we had a great start to our travel days. I would also like to extend a special "thank you" to the manager at the registration desk for his kindness. When we returned from our cruise on Sunday morning, we were exhausted. Although it was still before check-out time (and long before check-in time), I asked him when our room might be ready, and he offered to call us as soon as it was available. Not 15 minutes later, we received the call AND we had been given an upgrade to a suite. It hardly needs to be said that we were treated very, very well at the Mayflower Park, and highly recommend this marvelous hotel.

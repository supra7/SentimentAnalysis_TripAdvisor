We had the most relaxing vacation ever. We were well taken care of, thank you Carlos. You are great. The room we had was the best. I am keeping then room number a secret. The beach is beautiful and the sand like powder sugar soft. The staff is so helpful and friendly. I asked my husband to build me a secret box at home. I am still waiting, only home a week though. Thanks secret maroma for the great vacation, well worth the money.

Imagine the courtyard of your most beautiful fairytale, this is what you will see when you arrive at Inn at the Market. White lights, fountains and beautiful benches adorn the exterior courtyard as you wisk your way through the circular door into the firelit lobby with smiling staff greating you. The staff were so pleasant and even though my daughter called them many times a day from the phone in the bathroom ( because she thought that was " so cool") they still complimented her on her outfits and hats every time we went through the lobby, even offering fresh baked cookies and cupcakes. The room was beautiful with nice linens and an amazing view. Being an original building to downtown and the Market, you might think it outdated but not so. They have kept the charm but updated the furniture and finishings in high class. The rooftop patio is something not to be missed. Even though we were there in the winter, we took our hot drinks and wore our complementary robes up to the rooftop to watch the ferries drift across the water all lit up. People watching and hearing the sounds of the city at night were so fun. When the chill got to us we continued the fun in our room with the floor to ceiling windows that opened to the railing and city below. The night we wanted to go to dinner the Inn's towncar and driver happily drove us and came back to pick us up, free of charge! Gratuities are welcomed and please tip well as these kids are so kind and work very hard to be gracious. Overall this was a perfect stay, within the same block as the Market and the Original Starbucks And a French bakery that is soooo yummy. Enjoy the best view in the city and in my opinion, the best staff. We will definately be back in the summer to take part in the rooftop BBQ's and a glass of local wine.

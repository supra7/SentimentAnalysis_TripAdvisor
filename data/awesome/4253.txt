I couldn't find a thing wrong with the resort. Tip: If you enjoy a pamper, visit the spa for a Hot Rock Massage and ask for Bertha. Trust me. Very comparable to The Valentin or The Excellence. Unvbelievable beach, best in the area. It is a quieter night life here, and I found the resort to be popular for weddings.

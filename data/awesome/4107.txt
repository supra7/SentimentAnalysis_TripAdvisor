My husband and I just arrived home from our honeymoon at Secrets, and we still cannot get over how wonderful and absolutely perfect it was. From the moment we arrived, we knew the service was top class. The staff checked us in quickly, gave us all our information, and escorted us to our room where our concierge was waiting the show us around. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean, and the grounds provide for quiet spots around the property and privacy if you are in a first floor swim out suite. The beach was gorgeous, and the pools where amazing. The pool closest to the beach has a great view. It rained a couple days but there was plenty to do around the hotel, and many activities to choose from. The food was unbelievable. They have a FULL breakfast spread in the morning and a great buffet lunch. We chose to eat at the pool side cafe most days, which had an excellent menu. The portions for the entrees and appetizers where perfect size. Not huge like we often see back home. If you wanted to eat more, however, you could. At lunch you could pretty much find all you can eat sushi anywhere and any day. We ate at every option and never had a bad meal. They were all great! We will be going back for one of our anniversaries! Again, the one thing that stood out for us was the impeccable service.

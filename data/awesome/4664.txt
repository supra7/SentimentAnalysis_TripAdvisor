Secrets Maroma Beach was the perfect location for our honeymoon. The service was excellent, the resort was super clean and everyone was extremely friendly. My husband and I truly enjoyed our stay and we will definitely go back again and again. All we kept saying is "why have we not traveled here before". We would totally recommend Secrets Maroma Beach to our friends and family. So if you want a beautiful getaway then this is the place to be!!!

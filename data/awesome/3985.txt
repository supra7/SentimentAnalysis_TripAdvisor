After reading unfavorable reviews on Trip Advisor, our travel agent Michael McHugh from Dream Makers Vacation Services was able to switch our travel plans to Secrets Maroma. We can't thank him enough. What a switch! This resort was amazing! First the beach......soft white sand.....fish swimming around you in the ocean.....clear blue water. The food....delicious and plentiful. The breakfast buffet was unbelievable and our favorite restaurant was Bordeaux, the French establishment. Damian our waiter couldn't have been better! The room....clean...modern and cool. The spa....refreshing and relaxing. The atmosphere... even though there were many honeymooners and we were traveling with our adult children, we never felt uncomfortable. The service....everyone went out of their way to accommodate us. The staff was friendly...from the wait staff to the baristas at the coffee bar. We can't wait to return.

This place is everything the reviews have said and more. Trust me, I must have read every tripadvisor review out there choosing a resort for our honeymoon. Maroma beach is a beautiful resort, with great food selection and quality, and AMAZING customer service. Ive been to 2 other all inclusive resorts (Jamaica and DR) and this by far surpasses them. The staff anticipates your needs and goes out of their way to take care of you without being over bearing. The food was great. Loved breakfast and lunch the most. Options for everyones taste and diet. Not that you can stick to a diet here. For the reviewer who complained about portion sizes  they are perfect since you are getting at minimum 3 courses every meal. Not to mention you can order seconds! If you are thinking about staying here, go ahead and book it. You will not be disappointed.

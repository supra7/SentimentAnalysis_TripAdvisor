We recently spent 3 nights At the Warwick Hotel,Seattle, Wa. We had a king room with a sofa, facing the Space needle on the 9th floor. Room and bath were clean with nice amenties. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Bill, the Concierge, who offered walking routes and general tips for tourists. We didnot eat in the restaurant except for one Happy Hour, but heard @ the Tourist Bureau it was a good restaurant. If traffic and construction noise is an issue, ask for a high floor or perhaps the back of the hotel We could here the noise a bit, but it wasn't an issue for us.Excellent location and price[$92/nite]

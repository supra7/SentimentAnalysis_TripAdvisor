The hotel is central located on intersection of Seneca and 4th ave. The light rail to airport is on street down. Taxi to airport costs $32, but there is no point of taking taxi with the stop so close to hotel. The hotel has a modern deco and young clientele. We stayed for the Friday night, the lobby was full of people chatting and drinking. One thing we did find peculiar is that the hallway is dimly lighted and well air conditioned to the point it felt chilly for a summer day The internet was free at lobby but will cost $15 in the room.. The room was large compared to some of other hotels we stayed in Seattle. The room we stayed had a large king bed and sofa by window. The room was clean and looked spacious. The people at front desk was friendly and helpful. We had a early morning flight and asked for wake up call at 3:30 am. We had a personal call in the morning at the exact time. Some hotel has automated system for such calls, a personal call makes it specially nice. There are a number of good dinning options near the hotel. Downtown Seattle is also full of coffee shops. We went to the pier, which is not far away, and enjoyed the beer and some seafood. Overall, we liked the service, the room and the location.

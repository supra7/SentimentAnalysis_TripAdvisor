This was our 3rd trip to Riviera Maya & 1st to Secrets Maroma Beach. We upgraded from our previous trips and I was worried if we would get our $$ worth - it was well worth the extra expense. The service, food & cocktails were definitely 3 notches above the other resorts we've stayed at. Every picture on their website is true-to-life and the rooms were impeccably furnished. They have a no-chair reservation policy, which we loved. The resort was at maximum capacity, yet we could hit the beach between 10 & 1 and still find chairs in the shade! It was so nice not having to run out & save a chair at the break of dawn every day! The gym was nicely appointed. There were 3 ellipticals, 3 treadmills, 2 stationary bikes, 5-6 weight machines, dumbells & a variety of other accessories. It seemed there were always 2-3 people waiting for a cardio machine, so 2 additional pieces would have been nice. Otherwise it was a nice size and a very nice space. The beach was the nicest we've seen. Absolutely gorgeous. However, the only down-side to a 'rock-free' beach is no good snorkeling directly in front of the resort. You would have to book an excursion for that. Walks on the beach were fantastic. The beach was empty for miles in one direction. (There were a few empty resorts/mansions that were fun to explore.) The spa was amazing. We booked massages and were told to arrive an hour early for use of the facilities. This entailed use of their hydrotherapy area. It was a fantastic series of hot/cold pools with jets for every part of your body. By the time they called us for the massage...I almost didn't need it! The pools were amazing! Our week at Secrets was fantastic. We are busy professionals & parents who seem to never get the opportunity to slow down. Secrets made it very easy to do this by catering to our every need. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a week of relaxation and pampering.

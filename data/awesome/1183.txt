We travel every year all over the world and this hotel is simply one of a kind. All the staff is friendly, helpful and great attitudes. They go far beyond what is expected. Hotel is beautiful, clean and feels like you are staying with family. Hotel is convenient to all attractions, I have visited seattle before but will always stay at the Mayflower from now on. What a wonderful experience.

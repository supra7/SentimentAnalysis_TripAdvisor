We stayed for 3 weeks at Destiny Palms Sept/Oct 2011 and were pleased with it. The rooms are rather small, but the beds are wonderful. especially after a full day in the parks.The staff are excellent, specially Chuck the Resort Manager, who was always on hand to solve problems. Some have criticised the breakfast, but for their usual guests-3/4 nights its fine, but it does get boring after 3 weeks. Perhaps some changes and some fruit would help. The small cooking facilities in the rooms are very useful and generally adequate.Location is first class, everyone knows the 192 and you cannot get lost. Our room was always cleaned, but we think the time is near for a very thorough clean, as some areas are looking rather grubby Overall it is very good value for money. Important for us Brits and we would certainly recommend it. Geoff & Mary Corwall, U.K..

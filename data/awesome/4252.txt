I can only say that our stay was fabulous. We had a group of 23 for my daughter's wedding -- and everyone had a marvelous time. The wedding planner Cecilia did a fantastic job coordinating our special event . The photographer's gave us fantastic memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. The rooms and food were beyond expected for an all inclusive resort. What else can I say except everyone wants to go back!

The service at Secrets was impeccable. The entire staff was extremely friendly & helpful. The room was wonderful, except that the temperature was a bit warm, especially during the last day of our trip. We could not adjust the air conditioning any lower than 75 degrees which made the room uncomfortable to get ready in. The location of the resort was perfect -- very beautiful, & very well kept. I enjoyed the polite & upbeat staff at Secrets, who never failed to provide the best service. The food & drinks were delicious & always easily accessible. The room temperature was what I liked least. Also, our room was right above the night club, which made it difficult to sleep some nights because of the music below.

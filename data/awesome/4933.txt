Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!!! The service was unbelievable, every staff member was so helpful. The rooms were very clean and luxurious. The food was great, breakfast and lunch by the pool or on the beach were fantastic. The dinners were a little generic but still tasty. The beach is unbelievable and though the resort was fully booked there was always a lounge chair available. The grounds were so clean and well presented. We cant wait to go back!

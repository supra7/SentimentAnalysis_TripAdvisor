The resort is beautiful, the beach is amazing and the service is second-to-none! We did a five day stay, and the only complaint is that we didn't stay longer. We had a swim out room (recommended by our friends), and it was really worth it. It was great to hit our own private pool whenever we got the urge. Our favorite restaurant was Bordeaux (French), though we never had a bad meal. No reservations required, outside of the hibachi table at the Asian restaurant. We skipped it. Highly recommend reserving a beach a beach bed for the day. Cost us $40, but it was worth it. Spa facilities were very nice, and the services were wonderful. My wife and I did a deep tissue massage and an aromatic mud wrap. Heavenly. The foundation for our amazing experience was the staff. We were greeted with smiles and hellos from everyone, and truly made to feel like VIP's. These folks work so hard to make sure you want for nothing! Make sure you take some tip money, because these folks deserve it. Also, brush up on your Spanish if you can. Everyone will appreciate the attempt, and help you learn along the way. We will definitely be back next year. It can't come quick enough!

I took a plane into Seatac, and then walked to the light rail and rode the train into downtown Seattle for $2.75. The hotel was only 2 blocks away. I attended the convention for 2 days and was able to leave my bags at the hotel until late on the night I was leaving for no extra charge. The hotel is a beautifully restored and updated hotel. Nice workers and very clean. The only odd thing was the amount of plug -ins and the locations of them. The bathroom had only one plug in, and no counter. It was a pedistal sink with a small shelf above it. That was a little inconvienent. In the room all the plugs were on a long strip at the floor level, and one on the desk lamp. The bed was a bit firm, but not uncomfortable. Nice robes were provide, and the walk in closet was very spacious. One morning at 6 am I heard a loud yelling coming from the street, I got up to see a couple local homeless people arguing, but found it entertaining. The location was very centrally located to shopping, the Convention Center and if I had wanted to go, the Space Needle. I got the room through priceline, for $99.00, which is awesome for this type of hotel. I would recommend it to anyone.

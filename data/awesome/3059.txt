We stayed one night during the week and were completely satisfied. Plus we were able to book a deal that included a lower rate on the room, free wifi, and free valet parking. I booked queen sized bed online and upon check-in discovered we had been mysteriously upgraded to a king for the same price. The front desk and the valet attendants were very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant next door is amazing. The rooms aren't tiny, but they are not extremely spacious - it is probably too small for someone traveling with children. But for the two of us it was perfect. We will definitely stay here again if we have the opportunity.

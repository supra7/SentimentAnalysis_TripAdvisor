My husband and I recently went on our honeymoon here. It was totally awesome! Don't hesitate booking here- you will have a great time. I will list some of the good and bad: Bad: I am a light sleeper and found the room to be a bit noisy at night. I think the walls are pretty thin. They also were quite confused about our transportation. If you book your room and flight directly through the Secrets website, the transportation to and from the airport is included. However, no one at the resort has any clue about this policy. We had to scope out our transportation on our own. It worked out just fine, but we were surprised the resort people were so confused about what seems like a simple policy from their own website. The only other complaint I have is that our turn down service was inconsistent and one night at 11pm (!) a worker knocked on our door to "refresh" our room. We were already sleeping! Good: EVERYTHING ELSE! Overall, we had a great time, would totally go back if we could, and would totally recommend this place to anyone!

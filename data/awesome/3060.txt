Great location, very helpful staff, clean, modern rooms, comfy bed. Heck of a deal. We'll definitely stay here again when we head to Seattle as a couple. If you're traveling with kids, this isn't the place. For that we'll probably stick with the Westin a couple blocks down (bigger rooms, swimming pool, etc.) But we may just have to leave them at home more often now that we've discovered Hotel Max.

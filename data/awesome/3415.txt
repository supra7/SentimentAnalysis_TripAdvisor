Priceline set me up there. Easy walk to the terminal (it's the closest of the local hotels). You can watch the planes take off and land, but their windows are fantastic and the sound is not bad. The sleep number bed is a kick, but for some reason, mine wouldn't let me change the number. This and the Doubletree are my best SeaTac experiences.

I just have no word to describe this place!!!!!!!!! everyone was so nice and made you feel so welcomed for being there!!!! They treat their guest like royalty in every single way!! There is awesome entertainment all the time and so much to do there. Do not book to many outside excursions cause you are going to want to stay and enjoy the stunning pools and the beach. Everything was perfectly clean and food is out of this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just the perfect place for a honeymoon!!!

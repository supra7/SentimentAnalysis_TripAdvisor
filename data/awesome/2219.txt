We have stayed here several times because of the hotel's proximity to medical facilities and it is such a welcome respite. The staff is just wonderful and always accommodating from the front desk to housekeeping. Their beds are just wonderful and I always sleep better than at home. I love the french press coffee in the rooms along with the extra thick towels and bathrobes. The furniture is starting to show wear a little, but is still comfortable. The fireside room is a wonderful place to unwind and the bar is a true classic that is hard to find these days with its warm, wood interior and always incredible bartenders and wait staff. This is my favorite hotel in Seattle.

We have stayed at few all inclusives before and have had some hit or miss experiences. Most recently, we stayed at LeBlanc in Cancun (LeBlanc is very, very nice, check out their reviews. If you want to stay in Cancun I recommend it greatly!) and if I had a choice, I would choose to return to Secrets in a heartbeat. The grounds and buildings are beautiful, clean and nicely decorated. Food was the best I've had at any all inclusive resort and I love that they don't require reservations! The drinks were very made well and they had a wide selection of beers. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and the 24 hour room service was great. Most notably though, was the service at the resort. Everyone, I mean everyone, was incredibly nice and helpful. They really made the trip special. I do, however, have one pretty major complaint. We booked a swim out room that was located right in front of the concierge desk (each building has its own concierge located on the first floor), when the concierge shows up at 9 am things get very loud. Between greeting everyone walking by, shouting things at other staff members, helping customers and ringing phones our hopes for sleeping in or relaxing in our room were dashed. It was SO loud and SO disturbing that it really forced us out of our room earlier than we wanted each day. So, if management reads these reviews, please ask your concierges to use their inside voices!! OR, put them elsewhere! So, when you book your rooms make sure you are nowhere near the concierge desk! Other than that, I would recommend this resort to anyone and would love to return some day!

Overall Summary: Outstanding customer service, excellent value, competitively priced, comfortable beds, sumptuous linens. If you havent yet stayed at the Radisson SeaTac, I highly recommend that you give it a try. There are so many wonderful aspects to this property, but the exceptional customer service is why I always return. Located directly across the street from SeaTac International Airport, its a five minute walk to the terminal or a three minute ride on their courtesy shuttle. The Central Link (light rail) station is two blocks north  you can be downtown in less than 40 minutes. The rooms are very spacious, well laid-out, sunny and extremely quiet  even the ones facing the airport. The mattresses are very comfortable; linens, duvet and pillows are luxurious. The towels are of excellent quality, highly absorbent and fluffy. The complimentary toiletries are by Asira, all with a very nice, fresh scent. If you book a suite, the living room area is a wonderful place to unwind after a day of sightseeing. Housekeeping does an amazing job  your room is always spotless! Bonus: You are able to open a sliding window, to get fresh air. The property has a business center, indoor pool, fitness center, restaurant and bar. I encourage you to have at least one meal at their Gateway Grill  its fabulous! The breakfast buffet is an excellent way to begin your day and the dinner entrees are superb. (I have not ordered room service but my expectation is that it is equally exemplary.) As if everything so far wasnt enough, Ive saved the best for last. The hospitality at the Radisson SeaTac is second to none. It begins with the gracious courtesy shuttle driver at the airport, then a friendly wave from the groundskeeper, and continues with a warm welcome at check-in. Housekeeping will ensure that youre comfortable; the restaurant and bar staff will treat you like a long-time friend. Be sure to enroll in Club Carlson, because I know youll want to return to the Radisson SeaTac!

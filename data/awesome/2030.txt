We celebrated our anniversary here and were very pleasantly surprised. The ocean view is spectacular combine that with a fire place and comfy loung chairs and it is a great getaway. We got a great deal from Travel Zoo - if you are patient there are a few deals for staying at this property.I was concerned that being on the Seattle waterfront we would end up hiking up hill to do anything. However, they have a shuttle that will pretty much take you any where. We went to an IMAX film at the Seattle Center, spent some time at Pike Place and headed up to Queen Ann Hill in the evening - they were happy to take us and pick us up when we wanted. The restaurant is expensive but very good. The lounge has a great happy hour and if you can't get a room - at least go by and check out the view from the lounge.

I recently traveled with friends to Seattle for the Picasso Exhibit at SAM and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful treatment we received at the Inn at the Market. From the moment we arrived, our car was whisked away to parking as we checked in to our beautiful townhouse, water view, suite. WOW!!! The room was impeccably clean and had everything we could have possibly needed. The Staff was welcoming and down to earth. Their dining recommendations were great! Even after checking out, they allowed us to stay parked, held our shopping purchases as we continued to shop and when our car was delivered, it was already packed with our purchases and luggage! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Inn at the Market Staff! We WILL be back!

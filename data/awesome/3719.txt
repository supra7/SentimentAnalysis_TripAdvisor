Adults Only hotel, Great service, great food, drinks, and one of the most beautiful Ive seen ever. No way to get a better beach, since Maroma Beach is one of the best beaches in the world. The Hotels concept is very good balanced. Hotel is about 1o miles North of Playa del carmen, and to get off from there you need a taxi.

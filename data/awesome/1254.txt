We were recommended this hotel by a friend and we are so pleased we booked it. We are a young couple on a budget travelling around the USA for 6 months, this hotel is excellent value for money. Upon check in the staff were more than welcoming, offering tips and info about the city, they also let us stay in a room with better wifi signal as I had to do some work whilst staying here. Our room was HUGE, comfy, clean, nice big closet and a nice view. Tons and tons of tv channels and wifi signal was superb. We had a basin in the room and acces to a shared bathroom, the bathroom was always available, and clean. The shower was powerful and lovely and warm. The best part about this hotel is the location, walking distance to EVERYTHING, brilliant spot in the city. The bar next door nitelite is great for happy hour and a game of pool, $2 a beer. I would definitely stay here again, thank you for a brilliant few days.

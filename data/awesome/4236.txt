My wife and I have stayed at numerous all inclusives in the Cancun/Playa area and Secrets Maroma is the best by far. We had an amazing 8 days. The grounds and beach are clean and gorgeous, the food and drinks exceeded our expectations (we ate at all the restaurants), the spa is the nicest spa we have ever gone to. The best thing we can say about the resort is the service of the entertainment staff the waitstaff and bartenders. They are just the nicest people in the world.. Bring lots of singles with you and tip them well, they deserve it. We were also pleasantly surprised to find such a nice gym, we worked out every morning. We will be back for sure. A few tips: -Make sure to bring suntan lotion, it is very expensive to purchase. ($25 per bottle). -Don't call the U.S. from the room, use your cell phone. (It was $5 per minute to make a call). -The house wine is good but not great. Bottles to purchase are very expensive. -Get the rack of lamb in the Italian restaurant and Veal Chop in the French restaurant -Don't miss the spa and the hydro-therapy, it's spectacular -Men can wear shorts if you eat outside or at the Seafood Restaurant/Steakhouse

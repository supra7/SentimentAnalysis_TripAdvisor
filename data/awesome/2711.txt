I stayed for 4 nights while a meeting was in town. The first night my room overlooked a parking lot, and even though it was a fifth floor room, it felt like I was looking into the headlights. They gave me a new room the next day and the whole stay was very easy. The hotel was clean and stylish and very well located The only downer was that the workout room could not have been smaller. It had room for a stack of dumb bells, a bike, treadmill and eliptical. That was it

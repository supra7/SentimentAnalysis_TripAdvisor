Myself, my husband and my son went to Seattle for a couple of Mariner's games. We've stayed at the Crown Plaza before for Seahawks games, so we were comfortable with what we booked. We had a suite with a queen-size fold out couch in the living room and a king-size bed in the bedroom. Everything was very clean and the beds are so comfortable with their down duvets and mattress covers. We needed extra pillows for my son and the front desk was very quick to bring them to the room. The Regatta Lounge had some wonderful live jazz music and the drinks and food are very tastey. The location of the hotel is very central and everything is just a small walk or cab ride away. This hotel is great for families and couples alike.

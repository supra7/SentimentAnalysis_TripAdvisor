We stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach the week of May 8th. Everyone was exceptionally nice and the resort was very clean. Our suite overlooked the pool area and the gulf. It was absolutely beautiful. The activities staff were very energetic and enjoyable! We really had a lot of fun and plan on staying in another sister resort next year that is suitable for families. The downside would include the long process to check in. It was a bit clumsy as we met with 4 people and received a sales pitch. We enjoyed wonderful meals but every time I would order a glass of wine, I was told that it wasn't very good and should purchase a bottle. We eventually gave up on the wine. Have already highly recommended this resort to family and friends.

The one night stay at this hotel went on w/o any problems. We checked in early with a very friendly staff. Our room was clean and had plenty of room. The managers special at night was great which we spent the entire 2 hours at. The breakfast the next morning was awesome. We used their free shuttle to and from the airport. The price could have been a little cheaper.

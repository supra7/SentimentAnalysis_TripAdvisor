We visited SMB from 10/22/11-10/29/11. Hurricane Rina hit during our stay and the Staff was very reassuring and accommodating. They did their best to keep everyone updated about the storm, while still securing the facility. They made a conscious effort to ensure all guests felt safe. The wait staff was fast and friendly, even around the pool and down on the beach. The entertainment group was great! There were different interactive activiteis each night (2 people in our group "tried out" for Idol). So much fun! During the storm, they made a Movie Theater in one of the ball rooms and had Wii Games, ping pong, and pool to keep us entertained during the hurricane. When the weather was nice, the beach and pools were great to lay around by. The food was very good at each restaurant as well! My sister had her wedding at the resort and it started raining 2 hours prior to the ceremony. They were able to move it inside, set up the ceremony site and reception tables very quickly. It was still extremely beautiful!! Each hotel building has a personal concierge. Our concierge was fantastic. We had a TV on the fritz and needed a new scale (small things), but they fixed/replaced them that day. Also, if you like having your room tidied (which I do), they have someone come in the morning to make the bed and replace used towels and then a turn-down service each night (where the following day's weather forecast and activity agenda is provided to you). I am planning to stay either at the SMB again in the future or at another Secrets, if I plan a vacation outside of Mexico. They definitely won me over!

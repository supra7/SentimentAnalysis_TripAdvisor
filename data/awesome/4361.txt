I just returned from SMB yesterday and wish I was still there. I traveled with a friend and had a wonderful, relaxing time. We were upgraded to a full ocean view room as soon as we arrived and it was awesome. The service everywhere was awesome, the staff always responds to a thank you with "its my pleasure." My friend and I tipped alot while there but the servers did not seem to expect it. The service and food at the beach and the pool were great. We spent most of our time at the beach but spent one full day at the pool and only by pure luck did we get chairs. That would be my only complaint about this resort.... not enough pools and definitely not enough chairs. The Barefoot Grill at the pool had wonderful food. Our room was great, in building 12 close to restaurants, but still not a long walk to the beach. The entertainment staff was great, getting the guests involved but not pushy if you didn't want to partake. I never saw a single bug (not a mosquito or a fly) the entire time at the resort. The beds were comfortable. The room service was prompt and good. I want to say thanks to Ana the sever at the beach and to Adriana at the front lobby for all their help and great service. I will definitely come back and woul recommend this resort to anyone.

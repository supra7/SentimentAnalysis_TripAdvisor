Comfortable, really clean, nice people. A great hotel, very near to disney parks. Breakfast was good too, but the breakfast-place was too small. Everything else, just perfect. The room had microwave, fridge and even an iron. Bed was big and comfortable. Employees were nice and eager to help with everything. A really good experience, we will be back!!!

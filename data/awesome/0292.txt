I have been staying at the Warwick for approximately the past 15 years. Every time I return, I am greeted with a warm welcome back. Stayed for New Years, again, this year watching the fireworks from our room with a birds eye view. Good deal for what was a very busy night. The staff are remarkable from the valet all the way to the front desk manager, and you know who you are. I would highly recommend this for the service, convenience and an overall pleasant experience. The rooms are clean and spacious. The corner suites are very nice. You can park your car and walk throughout downtown Seattle, Belltown, Space Needle even Pioneer Square. A good deal is the Warwick Escapes which includes your room, parking, breakfast for 2 and all taxes.

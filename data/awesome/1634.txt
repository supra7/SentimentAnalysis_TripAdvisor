We got this hotel on priceline at the last minute and ended up in the new tower on the 24th floor. My only complaint was that the sheets on the bed were horrible, for some reason they did not go all the way to the foot of the bed and my feet were on the mattress. I am not sure what they were doing with that concept. Other than that, avoid the valet parking if you can, we did and were directed to park a block away at a rate of $28 vs $39 for the valet parking. Not only did we save $11 we also saved what looked like 30mins with all the people standing out front in the morning waiting for their cars. The location is great, it is a short (definitely not long as someone else said) walk to the market and all of the stores are right in the area around the hotel. I would easily stay here again as was a good overall experience for us.

We were here a few months after its opening in 2008 and liked the place. Coming back was better. The few things that needed improvement were all taken care of I would not hestitate to recommend Secrets Maroma. The food was much better than 10/08. Actually we did not have any complaints here. The bars were stocked with the good stuff. (the Don Julio and Kettle one is kept under the bar so you have to ask for it while the good Cuban rums were on the top shelf). Beach wonderful, pools wonderfull. Staff has lots of good energy. I kept a travel log on my trip if anyone is interested

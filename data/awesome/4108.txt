We stayed here the first week of May for our honeymoon & were absolutely amazed! We had a Preferred Club Ocean View room & it was spectacular! We didn't even end up using the indoor jacuzzi or the outdoor soaking tub b/c we spent so much time outdoors on the perfect beach! Hotel staff would come around every so often and remove towels from the chairs, so that there weren't so many chair hogs, and we were usually able to find a spot on the beach w/o having to get there in the early a.m. which was nice. The restaurants were great! We went to the restaurant next to the pool every day for lunch and the Hibachi japanese restaurant was our other favorite. I'm a vegetarian who also eats fish and there was always plenty to choose from everywhere. We definitely plan to go back here and we will do the preferred club again. We thought it was worth it, the appetizers and such were the best! Service was outstanding throughout the resort, we felt like royalty! The shows each night were lots of fun and definitely worth checking out. The pool was a bit crowded and everyone hogged the floaties, so we would just wait until 4 pm or so when people were leaving to use the pool and floaties, that was the only time they were usually free. Pool chairs were a little harder to come by then the beach chairs. I cannot wait to go back to this resort again!!

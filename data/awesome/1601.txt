Can't believe some of the ordinary reviews - this is a very good Sheraton with a wonderful lobby and an easy walk down the hill to the harbour and the Pike Place Market. There's free internet in the lobby and the rooms are five star in our opinion. The beds were hgeavenly to sleep in and we didn't hear any noise, the sign of a really good hotel. Really friendly staff too so well done to the GM who seems to personally answer a lot of reviews...it's tough keeping everyone happy all the time, and some people are downright negative. This is a great location to base yourself in this historic city near the harbour. Go to Anthony's overlooking the harbour for dinner for the freshest seafood you'll ever taste, including the famous smoked salmon fillet. There's also a little breakfast place right in the Pike Place Markets - locals told us and it's atmospheric with yummy oatmeal and local preserves. Thought the famous fish throwing was a little overrated, but the marketplace itself is good fun to explore. Shopping is good in Seattle too. The sheraton also has a little shop in the morning to get good breakfast to go, so we really loved this place.

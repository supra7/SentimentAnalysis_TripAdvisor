The hotel was very clean, service was excellent and food was good....better than I expected. The selection of restaurants was great; but if you're are traveling with a group of 8 or more (like us), it was difficult to accomodate all of us at one time. But after the first night, the restaurant manager in charge coordinated dinner for us during the rest or our stay. This helped!!! The Spa was excellent, my wife loved it. May have been the best massage she ever had. Pool was very relaxing and beautiful, although it can be a challenge to get chairs. Pool staff was very accomodating.....food and drinks all the time. We had an beachfront room and the view was outstanding. Overall, I would definetely recommend Secrets to others....it was a great trip!

I chose the Mayflower because of its downtown location. it is close to the Westlake Station on the Light Rail line to Sea-Tac Airport. The ride into town is just $2.75 and takes about 45 minutes. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do downtown. It is very close to Pike Place Market. The hotel has lovely rooms and the room rates and parking are both more reasonable than some of the chain hotels in town. One of the few hotels with complimentary internet. (Thank you!) We found the Mayflower to be charming and welcoming.

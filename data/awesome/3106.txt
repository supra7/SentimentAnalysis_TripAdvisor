Since the Inn at the Market (another fantastic property) didn't have rooms during our final night in Seattle, we decided to try out the Max after walking by it while in Seattle. Upon walking in, you can tell that the hotel is definitely hip and different, in a good way. It has real style, with nice original art and comfortable furniture. I hate cookie cutter hotels and really enjoyed ths hotel. You'd expect the staff to have attitude, but they were genuine and friendly and always greeted us when we came into the hotel. The hotel feels very new, and clean and stylish - the rooms were big enough to sleep in, but you definitely wouldn't want to hang around in them all day. Bathrooms weren't big either, but I don't spend much time in the bathroom and don't really understand hotels that have bathrooms almost as big as the room. The rates were great compared to anything else in Seattle at the time and we'd definitely stay here again.

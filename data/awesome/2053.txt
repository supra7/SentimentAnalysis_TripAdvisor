Just back from a 5 day stay in Seattle. Loved this place we had a waterfront room and requested a balcony. My husband thought I was crazy hearing how wet the Seattle weather is. Well we had beautiful sun every day and were able to have cocktails on that balcony every night and enjoy the sunset. Hotel was within walking distance to Pike's Market, Space needle, kerry park and the ferry to Bainbridge. Last two days was even able to see Mount Rainer from our balcony! Hotel employees were so nice and helpful. Great having a quality restaurant in the hotel. Beautiful waterfront seating area in the hotel where you could enjoy a book or glass of wine. Only negative was the cost of parking our car, it cost more than our car rental!

We stayed here for two weeks to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we knew it was somewhere special. Our building 22, which was furthest away from the beach but nearest to the main lobby building, was perfect. We also had the most fantastic concierge Deyanira who looked after us wonderfully. She was there 6 days a week and was always smiling and dealt with all our questions and saw to all our needs so professionally. She was so happy for us on the day of our anniversary and was nearly more excited about it than we were! By the end of our two weeks it was like having to say goodbye to a dear friend. It really is a beautiful resort, you can find peace and quiet if that's what you like or join in with activities if you prefer to be more active. We are not really beach lovers but here it was our most favourite place. We enjoyed room service but felt the quality was not as good as in the restaurants, but still enjoyable. We had a swim up room and loved it, especially first thing in the morning. For the whole two weeks there was never anyone in the pool at the same time as us, so it felt like our own private pool. The maids did a wonderful job of keeping our rooms spotless and fully stocked with toiletries. We had such a relaxing time and cannot wait for a return visit.

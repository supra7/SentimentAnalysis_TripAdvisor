food great tried al 7 restaraunts plus the buffet no complaints there service excellent. small coffee shop dont normaly like coffee abroad but loved the lattee here not forgetting the sandwiches n cakes on offer yummy. room large could see the ocean in bed only downside there was an interconnecting door so you could hear your neighbours.goodsize pool plenty of comfy lounges waiters always supplying as many drinks as you can consume in one day americans seem to take advantage of this but they are on vacation as they say they could get a little noisey as the day went on. food was brought round at lunch time around the pool followed by ice lollies or you could try the seaside grill or buffet or even al a carte. fab beach,hotel,pool,food just go book it.

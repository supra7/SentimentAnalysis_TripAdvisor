I stayed here for 2 weeks in february last year. I had been to a few beautiful hotel but this one is spectacular! it has them few extra benefits such as secret box where you can order room service and wouldnt have to be disturbed. Food in the complex was amazing. couldnt fault it. Loads of restaurants to choose from and loads of different types of food. Something for everyone! champagne out at breakfast nice touch. Rooms where beautiful and very spacious, with jacuzzi baths. Cleaned to highest standard everyday. Entertainment was great. lots of variation and choice. They had shows on such as fire shows, tributes etc. They had brand new films on big screen in theatre after the shows. They had beach parties, bbq's so much to do. For people who like more relaxed entertainment they had a piano bar with singers.The team also did pool and beachgames and activities during the day. Did not have to join in if you didnt want to. Staff couldnt do enough, really friendly! Beautiful beach, beautiful place will definately go back! Couldnt fault anything in this hotel everything was perfect! Perfect for a couples holiday, wedding or honeymoon!

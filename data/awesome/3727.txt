Just spent a wonderful 5 days at Secrets Maroma. All the reviews explained how we wouldn't be disappointed and they were right on the button. The room, grounds, restaurants (Sushi is excellent, the veal at the French Restaurant is superb) and beach were top notch. Only complaint is the AC in the Lobby/Lobby Bar should have been set 5-10 degrees cooler. Nearby golf is pricey but a decent experience as well. (Good idea to pack 18 balls rather than pay $13 a sleeve.) The best compliment for the management is that even though the resort was at full capacity during our last three days, one would have never known it. No crowds on the beach, at the pools or waits at the restaurants. And just an absolutely professional staff (especially the Cabana crew, Kevin, Cley, Alejandro) attending to your every need and multiple Caipirinhas. One can easily understand why they are #1 on the Riveria Cancun. Well done Maroma!

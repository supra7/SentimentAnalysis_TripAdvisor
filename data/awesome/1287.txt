We had just returned from our Alaskan cruise vacation, and the Moore hotel is only 5 mins taxi journey from the pier. If you have a small bag, its walkable. However, we had a lot of luggage so had to get the taxi. It cost no more than $8. The Moore Hotel is in a fantastic location. Just a couple of blocks away from the pike market place and Westlake centre. The rooms were huge and the walk in closet was excellent. We booked two rooms and stayed for 1 night. The rooms were ready when we checked in at around 10:30am. The bathroom was very clean and the reception staff were very helpful. There is also a free wireless internet access in the lobby if you have your own wireless enables laptop. Also, there is fixed computer in the lobby which offers free internet access. There is no breakfast nor complimentary coffee, but who needs that when there are 100s of Starbucks around you! I would definitely be staying here again if I visited Seattle.

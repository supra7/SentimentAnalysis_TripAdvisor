Was concerned about booking this hotel based on some reviews here but we left the hostel in search of a better deal. We asked to see one of the rooms before we booked and our person was more then happy to oblige. The rooms have some new furniture and are very clean, however there is still some wear and tare. We booked in and found out that a Costco card saved us quite a bit per night resulting in a total cost of about $65.00/night. Amazing when compared to our private hostel room which was clean but had a bunk bed but lacked a private bath in an inconvenient location at 99/night. One concern that I share with some other reviewers was the street noise. This is greatly reduced by closing the heavy curtains (which result in a pitch black room) and the noise I did hear was completely tolerable. I am sure this is the best value in Seattle and will be returning. The Good: Awesome value, Very Clean, Location and the best service ever! The Not so Good: but still totally tolerable: Somewhat rundown, and some street noise. Also, a three machine fitness center...but it didn't seem busy. The verdict: Had great sleeps and I will be back.

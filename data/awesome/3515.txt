Vacationing in Montreal in November was a great idea. The Le Crystal was a fantastic choice for our family. Upgraded to a larger suite. Great with two teenage boys. Staff was excellent and very helpful. Close to everything including metro, arena, shops, and restaurants. Hotel had very nice indoor pool and outdoor hot tub. Staff was helpful and responsive throughout stay. Would definitely stay here again.

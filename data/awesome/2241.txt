I stayed at the Sorrento last weekend and had a fantastic time. The staff had taken care of everything for us and was very accommodating to our requests throughout the weekend. We really enjoyed the decor, the location was a great jumping off point, and the lobby is a great setting for hanging out with a cup of tea when you're not out on the town. Add in a really friendly staff and you can see why I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

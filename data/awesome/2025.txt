We have stayed here several times, the first time was on the city side, okay for one night only but quickly moved to water view. The water view is great !!! However, check the location of your room as you do not want a cruise ship blocking your view. We were upgraded the last time to a junior suite which was fantastic !!! The staff were all polite and very helpful, especially Eric and the hotel manager, Tanya. Getting around is easy. You can do a flat walk down to the aquarium and across the street, up into the parking lot is an elevator that will take you to the Pike Place Public Market. From the market it is an easy walk to downtown or to Pioneer Square. We have eaten all three meals at the hotel and the food is among the best in town as is the view. The rooms and bath were very clean and soaking in the claw foot tub while looking at the water was very relaxing. Loved the decor in the rooms, lounge and bar. Our only negative comment is the high price parking and not being told there is a tax on the parking. We hope we have a chance to visit Seattle and would definitely love to stay there again.

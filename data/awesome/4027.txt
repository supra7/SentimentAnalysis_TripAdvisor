Arrived to a chilled glass of champagne . Staff were very attentive and were checked in very quickly. We upgraded to a swim out room and really enjoyed a relaxing swim after a long day sunbathing by the pool or beach which were really busy. But beware of mosquitoes, we must have had around 60 bites between us at the end of our 10 day stay. Food, drink and service were excellent will definitely be back.

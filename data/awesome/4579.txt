We stay at Secrets August 8 - 18 for our honeymoon. This hotel exceeded all of our expectations and then some. When you arrive you are greeted with a drink and cool towel. Taken up to your room within minutes. The hotel is beautiful! Our room had a great view of the ocean. Inside your room is the whirpool tub for two. We loved this! We would rotate between the pool side and beach. We never had trouble finding a chair anywhere. At the pool around lunch time they walk around with all kinds of different food. Chicken on a Stick, shrimp, tacos, etc. sometimes we did not even eat lunch we just let them bring things around to us. Down by the beach they cook out of a giant wok, it great! The beach is gorgeous! Perfect white sand, gentle rolling waves, cleaned everyday. If you walk down the beach about 5 min there is an abadoned mansion of some sort, we took some great pics there! The resturants were amazing. The French and Italian were our favorites. I can not say enough great things about this resort. We had a blast and the resort is just beautiful. We are waited on hand a foot every second of every day. We did a couples massage at the spa which is also beautiful. It was expensive but worth every penny. Book this hotel you will not be disapointed! Absolutely amazing.

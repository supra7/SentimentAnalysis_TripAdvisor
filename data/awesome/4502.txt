left what we call paradise [florida] only to arrive at another paradise "secrets maroma".but at this paradise you are treated like royalty from the time you check in till[boohoo] you have to leave. if you like layed back,great food and drink, spacious suites,white sandy beach and no kids we found it. my second trip with some non- believers who have been converted and have spread the good word. look to have 15 couples next year.

The W is always a great stay! Have stayed here several times and am still overwhelmed by the hospitality, helpful staff, and amazing hotel rooms. Front desk was very helpful at recommending late night dining. Earth & Ocean bar is beautiful and the drinks are well worth it! Bliss bath products add a great touch!

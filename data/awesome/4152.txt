Our daugthter 1st went to Secret's 2 years ago and recomended my wife and i go last year which we did. This trip was our 2nd time back. Have visited many resorts in the past ... Aruba, Punta Cana, etc but this is the best. The service - friendly staff / beach - sand / pools / everything is above and beyond what we have experienced in the past. A special call out to the pool attenedants Paulo and Jamie who spent the week making sure we had everything we could possibly want at the pools and beach. Roger was our building host and made sure everything was right. Yannik, our host from last year also stopped by and checked in on us. The beach and water are one of the best. Restaurants - good mix of food and high quality food. We will definetely be back next year for our third trip. Only complaint was we thought the temperature of room could have been set a bit lower.

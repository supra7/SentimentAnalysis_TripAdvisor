This hotel is very nice, the Lobby and hotel room was clean. The room was well equipped. The breakfast was good (although there was food in the pictures, but not on the actual buffet) and had enough different things to keep it slightly new each day. The showers took amost 5 minuts to get warm, but were great once they did. The pool was on the smaller side, but was clean. Room service is provided by the onsite Houlihans. If you plan to stay at your resort a lot, this is not the hotel for you. But if you want a decent place, with a good value, that is clean, you will not find a nicer package.

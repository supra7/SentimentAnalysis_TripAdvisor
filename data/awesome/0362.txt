WOW, What a great location and view for a vacation to Seattle, The service is top notch and the location to everything Seattle is great. The market is in your backyard, easy walk to downtown, the pier or Seattle center. I wanted one more day to just sit on the rooftop deck and take in the views of the bay, the market and the mountains.

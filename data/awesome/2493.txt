Spent one night prior to cruising and got a great rate on Priceline. Perfect location, super comfortable beds, spacious rooms, great views! Easy walking distance to almost everything - Von's (for Seattle's Best Martinis and Manhattans), monorail (to get to the Space Needle), and Lola's (for a delicious breakfast!). Also very close to the cruise terminals. Bathroom was a little small, but adequate and very clean.

My hubby and I stay here every time we come and go from Seattle (which seems like a lot seeing as we are from Juneau). Just about every time we've come through, we've been able to get an upgrade. We love that the hotel is so close to the airport, you don't even need the shuttle if you want to stretch you legs a bit. The last time we stayed, we were in what I think was the "older" wing, and even then, the carpets and everything was immaculate. The newer wings and the towers are beautiful. I absolutly love their beds...soooooo comfortable. We would highly recommend this place, even if you're staying for a few days. This isn't a low end hotel, so I expected extra fees. Just seems to be what the nicer hotels do. So yes, internet and parking are extra, unless you get an upgraded room, where sometimes wi-fi is free. And of course, the nice warm fresh cookies on arrival...I'm a definite sucker for those! Over all, this is a beautiful hotel with very clean and comfortable rooms. We love it!

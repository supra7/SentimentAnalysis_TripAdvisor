This is the perfect location, the hotel is clean, the beds comfy, the views from the deck awesome, the staff alert and helpful, plenty of restaurants around, lots to see and do within walking distance, the public transit is free in the downtown area for a little further jaunts, lots of unique shops to explore, lots of architectural details on the buildings, lots of green spaces, lots of good seafood, jazz, chocolate and coffee. Great day trips from here too.

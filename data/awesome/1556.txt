We were 2 couples - ending a whirlwind trip in Seattle and outter areas of Washington State - ending up back in Seattle for 1 last night. This hotel was great! There was a lot of hustle and bustle as it's connected to the Convention Center - but the location was perfect! Right in downtown, near great restaurants, shops, movies, breweries, light train rail (train system) 1 block away, Pike Place Market was about 6 short blocks away, great city and Puget Sound views, efficient staff, many available computers to use in lobby. I would definitely stay here again - VERY clean, comfortable bed, good night's sleep. Room was a decent size as well.

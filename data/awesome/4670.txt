This was our second time to go to the resort, the first time was great but the second time was incredible. The food was so much better and the hospitality was excellent. They took good care of us the first time but this time was great. The grounds were so much more lush and the room, we could not ask for a better location. Even though we did not upgrade to an oceanfront they put us on the fourth floor with an incredible view. The only thing I could say is I wish they had more resorts like this one in either the Cayman's or Turk's and Caicos.

This hotel does a lot of things right: My favorite being the fireplace in my room. It shuts off automatically after an hour, so I'd wake up, turn it on, and then right when I was about to turn in for the night, watch it until I fell asleep. It made my winter stay in Seattle so cozy. Also, it's a short walk to Pike's Place. A small thing I adored, was that they actually have bottles of shampoo and conditioner, instead of those tiny travel sizes. Of course, you can't take it with you, but who needs 1,000 mini bottles of shampoo? They're saving the environment and that is just damn nice. Every morning, I had breakfast on the water. The breakfast food is to die for and the wait staff impeccable. I recommend the oatmeal, made with heavy cream and infused with ginger. A hot cup of coffee, and a few of the bay, it's hard to beat this hotel for a dreamy spot in Seattle.

I've stayed at this hotel many times this year for business and have had a really good experience overall. All of the staff members I've encountered have been friendly, from the front desk staff to other staff members encountered on the elevators. The rooms have always been immaculate and the hotel is well-maintained. Room service is quick and the complimentary beverage service in the morning is great. The location is within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shopping. The only thing so-so thing has been the restaurant food and service at the italian restaurant inside the hotel. The prices are average and the service is slow so I'd recommend checking out the other restaurants in the area before eating here. It isn't that the restaurant is particularly bad, it's just that there are a lot of better restaurants within close walking distance. All in all, a great place to stay for business or to use Marriott points for a long weekend.

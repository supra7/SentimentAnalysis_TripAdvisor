My boyfriend and I stayed here in April 2011. We are both 24, and were by far the youngest people to stay here, and it was the relaxing trip that we needed!! We had a swim out pool room which was great when you had had enough sun, and wanted to relax before dinner with a beer. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The beach was amazing! White sand beaches and warm water made the pool almost unnecessary! There is a cute bar on the beach with swings, and they have a bbq for lunches. I was very happy with the food! All the restraunts were good, and I am a vegetarian and they were very accommodating with many options. It was easy to get into the restaraunts, andthe breakfast buffet was amazing!! Im pretty picky with food and was impressed to say the least. The staff were great. friendly, professional and helpfull! we tipped them alot and they deserve it. I just stayed at Pueblo Bonito and the level of service there did not even compare!! (Dont go there if your life depends on it). At Secrets the staff would always say "my pleasure" and seem genuinely happy to help you out! Aother plus was the no wrist bangs, and you didnt have to sign for every single thing which in my opinion for all inclusives is redundant. This resort was a breath of fresh air amongst so many bad resorts in Mexico! We will be returning, if not to Maroma, to another Secrets! From now on I dont think we will be staying anywhere but for an all inclusive type trip!

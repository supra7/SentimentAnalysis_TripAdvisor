We just got back from Secrets Maroma Beach where we had a group of 80 people down there for our wedding. It was perfect! Everyone loved the resort and the service was truly impeccable! The rooms there are top-notch no matter which category you are in. We had people in all categories and everyone raved about their accommodations. Our wedding on March 26th was the best day of my life. The staff set up our ceremony on the beach and then we did a cocktail hour followed by a pool-side reception. The wedding coordinator, Cecilia, outdid herself entirely! She is the BEST! Our guests had so much all week - from sailing to beach volleyball and pool BINGO they kept those who wanted to be busy busy and left those relaxing alone. The food is also incredible. We only had one group dinner so everyone was able to experience the fine dining at the resort. We have been to all three Secrets properties in Riviera Maya now and are traveling to their Sanctuary Cap Cana property next month for a delayed honeymoon. Secrets is our favorite brand! If you are on the fence about whether or not to visit Secrets Maroma Beach, please take it from us and treat yourself! It's a true paradise!!!

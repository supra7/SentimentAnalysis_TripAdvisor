This was a great vacation. It was our 10th visit to Mexico, so it is fair to say we have seen it all. This was by far the best. Food had lots of choices, better than average. The rooms were the best. Lots of towels and bar changed every day. Very quiet. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept. The pool was outstanding, which was very important to me. Beach lovely. Weather exceptional. Staff so helpful. Drinks were plentiful and every type imaginable. My one complaint was the very, very uncomfortable furniture in the main lobby. Met a lot of very nice people from all over the world. There was no rowdyness or bad behaviour. I have been back only a few days and have already talked friends into going in November. I am always hesitate to recommend places in case my friends do not experience all that I have enjoyed. However, Maroma is the exception to the rule. I am in my sixties and have needs that others don't , but no problem here. Everything was exceptionally clean and no worries. We will certainly be back, God willing. This would be classed as 15 out of 10.

I don't usually have time to write reviews on travel rating websites but I thought I'd take a few minutes here to give some feedback on my recent W Hotel experience. I travel at least 4 times a year to Seattle solely for business purposes and I absolutely love Seattle! But more importantly I always stay at the W. I was just there a couple weeks ago for 3 nights and I just realized how friendly and wonderful the staff is there. Specifically Brian (I think that's his name) who answers the phones went way out of his way (I was feeling a little under the weather) by sending one of his employees to a local drug store to grab medicine. Not only did Brian have the medicine delivered to my room but he also had 2 cold gatorades brought up as well. Talk about talking care of guests which is why I will always stay at the W. Also I love the Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the mornings!

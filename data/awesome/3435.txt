Great location, great value, very friendly staff, and the rooms are beautiful - small, but very modern and clean, with a fantastic bathroom, and a powerful shower. The location is brilliant for visiting all of Berlin, as it's right by a metro stop, and there is a bus stop just across the road. Much better than a 3*, will definitely be staying here on my next visit to Berlin!

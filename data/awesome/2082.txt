This hotel's location is prime for all that Seattle has to offer. You are in walking distance to all attractions and then if that's not enough, they have a shuttle that can take you for free. This hotel is very unique in design and full of history. You also have great views from the rooms and the lobby. I would recommend this hotel and return to this hotel every time I stay in Seattle. The staff were helpful and understanding.

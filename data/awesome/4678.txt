When welcomed, that's exactly what we were told as we were given a cool moist hand towel, "Welcome home!". This place is beyond fantastic and the service is exquisite. My wife and I cannot speak highly enough about this place. It is far better than we expected. We went ahead and got the Preferred Club service considering it was our honeymoon and felt it was worth the expense. The spa area is amazing. They definately go deep on the deep tissue message for sure, but very nice. Next time I'll probably go with something a little less intense or not do it right before we leave to get on the plane. The night life at this resort is very entertaining with fire shows, bongos, live themed theater action, etc. The resort will keep you as busy as you want or you can be as relaxed as you like. I believe there were quite a few people there when we went, but with all the room, all the activities inside and outside of the resort, all of the restaurants, pool, beach, etc., we never felt crowded or had to wait on anything whatsoever. It never seemed like there were ever many people there. I know I'm missing so much but without giving away all the little things that make it extra special, I'll have to stop with this. If you want to have an amazing and unforgettable adults only trip with beyond exceptional service and beauty and no wrist bands, Secrets Maroma is without a doubt where you need to be.

My husband and I and friends really enjoyed our weekend stay. The rooms were just as advertised and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Lola was also very good. We didn't get to try Assaiggio but we heard some other guests talking about their great experience there. The location is near shopping and the Market. Our room rate was comparable with other hotels we considered but I think the Andra rooms are larger on the average. Would definately recommend to others.

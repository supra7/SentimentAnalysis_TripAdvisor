Great hotel in downtown Seattle. Bathrobes and bath shoes included. Great location--near Starbucks, downtown shopping, etc. Great service. Canadian Coast chain seems to do a top notch job.Rate was reasonable. Can walk to all the attractions. A better value than other downtown spots. Rooms a bit small, though.

Overall, I have to say that we loved this place. We were there celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary and since having children we haven't traveled outside the US since 1998. It was a much needed break from the kids and life in general. This was the perfect place to do this. The beach was beautiful, the resort was quiet but there was also tons of fun to be had by everyone. The great thing about it, was that you could go crazy have a blast or keep to yourself and relax without being annoyed by noise and craziness. We only have 2 complaints..we booked a swim out preferred club suite (which is extra $$) and the pool was so cold, we couldnt even use it. We found that a little annoying because like I said, you pay extra for that..I would recommend a heated pool so that the pool can be enjoyed anytime of the day. The other one was the jacuzzi in the room. The water was yellow from the spigot and when turning on the jets, black specs of Lord knows what filled the entire tub..this was a little annoying as my husband and I were really, really looking forward to relaxing in that hot tub! We couldn't even use it and we even tried more than once with the same result. But really other than these 2 concerns, this place is great! The staff works very, very hard to accomodate you we actually felt compelled to tip them even though it is not required. You should try this place, you will love it!!!

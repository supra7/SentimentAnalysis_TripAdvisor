Just got back this morning (26th June 2011) with my wife and 2 friends after a 2 week stay at Secrets Maroma. After last years vacation we persuaded our friends to come with us this time and we were worried that we may have over sold the experience to them, no such worries as the standards of the rooms, restaurants, pool service, entertainment and staff was even better this time around and we couldnt fault anything at all. We have been to Sandals in Jamaica, Cuba, Antigua and the Bahamas each year since 2005 prior to visiting Secrets and although we felt their resorts couldnt be beaten, our last trip to Antigua in Sept 2010 was very poor in comparrison with hardly any staff to look after guests and the food choice was a real letdown, as this was very soon after our first visit to Secrets Maroma in June 2010, this was a massive contrast in all areas. We will certainly be back again in 2012 as the staff may us all very welcome. It would be very hard to single out any staff out but we did have great service from Paolo at the pool, Freddy at Breakfast and in the French restaurant and also from Lidia in the evenings in the lobby bar who will even give you a dance as she shakes your cocktail. One area which often gets missed is the service from the maids as you never really see them, but rest assured, our rooms were spotlessly clean whenever we came back to our room during the days and evenings. We reccomend visiting all the restaurants rather than visiting the buffet every night as this is where you really see the standard of service and food choice. By the way, the beach has got to be up there with the best of them, lovely clean sand with drinks brought out to you throughout the day and chefs bringing out food samples all day long.

The Vintage Park is an older hotel in downtown Seattle. It has been upgraded to modern standards and is a beautiful place to spend time. A modestly sized gathering area just off the lobby offers free wine and cheese every evening, in keeping with the "wine" theme of property. Each floor and room has a wine theme that carries through to the decorating. High rise nature of hotel kept street noise out. Roomy and comfortable standard king. Highly Recommended!

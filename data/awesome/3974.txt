I was at the Secrets Maroma Beach Resort for a business meeting. While I didn't have time for all the activities, everything else about the hotel was excellent. From check-in service to the meals and the hotel room, The breakfast and lunch buffets offered so many selections it was hard to choose. The quality and cleanliness was also outstanding. I could find very little wrong during my stay. The staff is well trained and works hard to keep the guests happy. My one complaint was the drinking glasses in the mini-bar were filthy, but they were quickly replaced. I would definately recommend this hotel.

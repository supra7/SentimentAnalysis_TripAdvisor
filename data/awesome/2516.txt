My husband LOVES this hotel. He' LOVES the location and the overall everything aboutt his hotel. I love it too! We stayed here in October of 2008, and now we are headed back to Seattle for leisure again, and I HAD to get this hotel again. There were no if ands or buts about with my husband. Its close to downtown, the rooms are big and spacey its walking distance to everything downtown, the gift shop in the hotel is one of the nicest's I've seen in a hotel.

2nd visit to the resort and everything was great, will not go into the same things everyone else has disucssed but will give some details about what I noticed this visit vs my visit in Nov. 09. Negative - Much busier, need to get to the pool or beach by 9:00/9:30 am to get a chair, saw people "reservering" there chair as earlier 7:00 am. - The people by the pool were more of a rowedy, loud music, more drinking, nothing too out of control but not a relaxing. - Numerous corporate events, a few of the resturants were closed for events - The beer never seemed to be cold, maybe cool, but not ice cold. - Due the higher occupancy, i could hear more noise in my room. Positive - More live music, events, entertainment - ie characteristic drawings (sp?), live music in the bar, bungee trampoline, movies, etc - Swim up pools - they are now heated you can use them, they also put up small sections of fence at the end of the buildings for more privacy, HUGE improvement Overall still great and will be returing in Nov.

The rooms were good, fridge, microwave, coffee. Free breakfast with a lot to choices. So close to all Disney properties which is great when you're worn out and just want to get back to the hotel bed. The staff was very helpful & gave great directions for our shopping trips. Chuck, the manager was on top of everything. If he heard there was a problem, he wanted to speak with that guest even if someone had already resolved it. He made sure everyone was well taken care of. My granddaughter was very excited when she saw an armadillo at the lobby door one night. She hoped to see it again but no luck. The hotel staff would probably not appreciate that but she was thrilled. Go figure!

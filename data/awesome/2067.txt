I spent a week at Edgewater and loved it! The location is great - right on the water. The staff was very friendly. The Six Seven restaurant was wonderful with a beautiful view of Puget Sound. The room was extremely clean and having a fireplace in the room was a great touch. I had a cityscape room and had a great view of the Space Needle from my window. I would definitely stay at Edgewater again.

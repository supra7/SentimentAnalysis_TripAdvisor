The entertainment staff is amazing!!! At the resort, you can relax and be solo or you can participate in the many activities at the resort. The staff is extremely friendly. The spa is amazing. There is a wide food selection and it is unbelieveable!!! Maroma Beach is more beautiful than Cancun with a quieter atmosphere. You will LOVE it!!!

This is a great hotel and love to stay here when going down to Seattle to shop. It is steps away from the shopping district , Nordstroms, and Pike Place Market. It's clean, comfortable, and located in a safe area of town. I have no problems walking back to the hotel at night by myself. If you book through Priceline you can get some killer deals....anywhere from $65-$85 a night. Standard prices are from $185 a night so it is well worth it to try on Priceline. Only negative comment I have about this place is the last time we stayed here there was a dog in the next room(dog friendly hotel) whose owners were out past 3AM...The dog could hear us in the next room and was scratching at the door and whimpering all night. I called down to the desk twice before security came up and took the dog with them. I love dogs, however, didn't get much sleep that night, and tfront desk didn't seem to take my complaint seriously when I called them...

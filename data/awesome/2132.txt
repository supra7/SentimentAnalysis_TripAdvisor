I did Travelocity Secret Hotel and got a killer deal on this hotel. Based on reviews, I was expecting the smallest room on the ground floor city side. We were supposed to have a queen room - that's all. When we checked in, I asked if there was any way to get a Water View above the first floor and my wish was granted with an upgrade to a King with no extra charge! This is an older hotel, so the sliding door had some "air leakage", but the temperature was maintained between the automatic system and the fireplace. 4 big fluffy pillows, and extra leaning pillows. The decor is definitely Pacific NW, so some may think it's a bit "hoaky", but it's really quaint. Your foot rest by the fireplace is a big bear! Fun! Front Desk and Parking staff were very accomodating. They offer late check out at no charge which was wonderful. Walking to Pikes, Space Needle and Pioneer 'Square all easy distances. Harbor view was fun too.

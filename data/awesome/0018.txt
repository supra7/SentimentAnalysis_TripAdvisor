Perfect hotel with a delightful front end staff. Stayed one night, wish I could have stayed longer. Woman on front desk duty was professional, informative and understood what many front desk people fail to understand -- the guest is important and does not know anything about the hotel or the area. She was just as perfect as the hotel. Would stay again when traveling on 95.

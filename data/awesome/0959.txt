My husband and I stayed at the MarQueen to participate in the annual St. Pat's Dash to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The staff were friendly, kind and most helpful. Any need was met promptly and with a smile. The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The room had noise abatement windows and they sure did the trick. Despite being in a noisy and busy area of Seattle, we slept like babies! The price is very reasonable for downtown Seattle and the location is within walking distance of many, many tourist attractions such as the Space Needle and other venues that Seattle is known for!! If you come to the Pacific NW, the MarQueen should definitely be on your itinerary

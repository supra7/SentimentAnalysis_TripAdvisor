This place was great! We thought because of the price, smaller size and age of the hotel we would have a slightly out of date "historic" hotel waiting for us - HOWEVER, when we walked in we where thrilled to find a beautifully updated hotel. The location is perfect for Pikes Market and other downtown shopping and dinning within walking distance. Our room was just right and very up to date and the bathroom spotless. The staff were extremely nice. From the doormen, valet, desk clerk to the concierge. Everyone was helpful and professional. The concierge reccommened excellent restaurants within walking distance and within minutes we had resservations and the local movie theater times printed and in our hands. We were impressed and will not only return to the Mayflower but will recommend it to friends. Lloved this hotel, staff, location and price. You won't be disappointed!

I stayed at Secrets Maroma for four days this March as this was the venue of choice for my company's offsite. Starting from the reception and all the way to the rooms and food, I've been very impressed and enjoyed it tremendously. The resort is rather new (I was told it's 2 years old) and it shows in everything - from very contemporary room decor to restaurant silverware. I really enjoyed most of the food (except for sushi, which was rather not good), while we did not try all of the restaurants, and liked the fact that food was served on the beach. Most all-inclusive hotels do not allow food on the beach or near the pool. Another thing I liked is the lack of wrist bands. Their location justifies that, since it is rather hard to get into the resort area if you are a stranger. Yet, it was a nice touch. The alcohol is another thing worth mentioning. From fruity mixes and down to strong liquor, there were so many choices - and their pina colada was super tasty! Last but not least, the breakfast buffet was very impressive and had so many choices that it would take a month to try everything that's available. Now, onto the cons: - it is a couples' resort and it is adults only (so you need to leave kids at home) - the Internet is quite expensive - it takes some time to get here from the airport - it is very secluded, so in order to get out and about, be ready to spend some $$ on the cab. A ride to Playa del Carmel will be at least $20

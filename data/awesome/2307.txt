I loved this hotel. First, it has a wonderful entrance--a circular driveway cut into the street corner, which makes it oddly hard to find. You drive up, enter, and find yourself in a turn-of-the-century lobby, which leads to an intimate concierge desk on one side and a bar on the other. Every time I went in and out, something exciting seemed to be happening in that bar! I was also really impressed by my room, which was old-fashioned but modern at the same time. Everything has obviously been restored and revamped since 1909, but in a really tasteful way. The bathroom still looked old-fashioned, but all the fixtures worked in a very new-fangled way. I approve! I wish I could have stayed a little longer, in order to enjoy the comfortable bed properly, and experience that bar!

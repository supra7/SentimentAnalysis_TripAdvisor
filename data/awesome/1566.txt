Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 5 days in June and everything was great. We booked a room in the club level (33rd floor) and it included free wireless, free bottled water, and continental breakfast and afternoon snacks in the club lounge. All the staff were friendly and the city view we had was cool. We didn't rent a car because of all the mass transit options, plus parking looked expensive everywhere. Pikes Market was a short 5-10 min walk from the hotel and we rode the light rail (LINK) from the Westlake Station (a 5 min walk) to Safeco Park and the Airport for only a few dollars each way. The monorail to the space needle is only a 5 min walk from the hotel and on the clear day we were there the view was incredible. We walked to dinner every night with no issues.

I am a Diamond lever, frequent Hilton guest (60 to 100 nights a year) This is a great Hilton and near the Seatac Airport. It is clean, well-managed, has excellent staff (they even has valet parking), the check in people are well educated (thank you Conrad) and informed. The rooms are "spotlessly clean" and well lit. Perfect. The manager of this Hilton deserves a promotion. The risk free Hilton!!!! This one should be the flagship for the fleet!

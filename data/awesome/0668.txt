My husband and I spent 4 nights here on our honeymoon. We could not have been more pleased. The view is simply amazing in the waterfront rooms and from the rooftop deck. Our bed was made of memory foam. We even tried the mattress test with the glass of wine and jumping on the bed. It worked! So comfortable we are thinking about getting one for our home. The concierge were so nice and extrememly helpful. Noelle especially. We booked the inroom massages as well and were very happy with them too. I can not recommend this hotel enough. We will never stay anywhere else in Seattle.

We loved the Hotel Max! The room was small, but reminded us of Europe! We had a corner room with windows on two sides...one with a view of the courthouse and the other had a beautiful tree (live art!). Speaking of art...Hotel Max has some fabulous art on the wall. This is a trendy hotel, but they have given extensive condsideration to the comfort of their guests. The bed was fabulous...from the comfortable mattress and pillows to the fine linens. The staff was wonderful and helpful and gave us extensive information about how to get around Seattle and where to eat. Their fitness room was small (two treadmills, two cross-trainers, and some free weights) but we were the only ones in there...so might be just right for the demand. The attached restaurant was convenient for drinks, though one of their bartenders wasn't very attentive. The location was great....a few minutes walk to the market. We had to move to another hotel for a conference and were very disappointed to leave the Hotel Max. I would definitely stay there again!

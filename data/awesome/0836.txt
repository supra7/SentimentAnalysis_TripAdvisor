My husband and I stayed here for three nights. Two of the nights were paid out of pocket under AAA rate and one night was a priority club reward. We arrived at 11pm and the check-in staff was prompt and friendly. I am a priority club platinum member. The clerk upgraded us to an executive suites on the 33rd floor with sweeping view of the downtown and the harbor. The room was comfy and spacious. The windows were spotless. Each night, the houskeeping staff placed a bottle of lavender scent bedsheets freshener on the bed. I ended up collect the bottles with us to treat the bedsheets in the hotels we stayed in the rest of the trip. We also had complimentary continental breakfast served on the 32nd floor . The breakfast has fruits, bagels, muffins, pastries, cereals , yogurts, juices, bottled water and sodas. The coffee was a little weak. Everyday, we took two bottles of water with us from the breakfast to drink around town. The location is not bad. But It is NOT in the middle of everything. It is within walking distance to Pike Place market, West lake Mall, waterfront and pioneer square. Be prepared to walk uphill from the waterfront back to the hotel. As one of the reviewer has pointed out, the elevators were slow and they hided behind the beams in the hallway that made it easy to miss them when they finally arrived your floor. We had waited for 12 minutes one time to get on a elevator. We didn't have a car with us when we toured Seattle since the parking was expensive at the hotel ( as well as in other hotels in downtown Seattle). It was $32 a night. But we found it pretty easy to get around in Seattle w/o a car. We went to Pike Place, water front, West Lake Mall, art museum, China Town, Pioneer Square on foot. We went to Olympic Park and Ballard Lock by bus. We went to Space Needle and Music Experience Project by monorail. Finally, we went to West Seattle on a ferry. The sunset view from West Seattle to downtown Seattle was awesome and not to be missed!

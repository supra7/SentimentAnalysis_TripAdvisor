We stayed two nights at this hotel. It was our first time staying at a Kimpton property. We booked a king room and were upgraded to the lovely Chateau Ste. Michelle suite. What a treat! My pet peeves about traveling are cleanliness and odors. The suite was clean, beautiful and luxurious and odor-free -- and super quiet. The photos on the hotel's website are accurate. I loved the little touches like having a magnified makeup mirror in the bathroom. The closet even had leopard printed nighties and fuzzy socks for purchase in case you forgot your jammies or your feet got cold. Kimpton hotels have a sense of whimsy in attitude and decor. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They do a great job of making guests feel welcomed. From 5 p.m. - 6 p.m. each night the hotel hosts a complimentary wine reception in the lobby. We enjoyed cozying up to the fireplace and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. I highly recommend this hotel and the Kimpton brand. Also, it is worth it to join the free loyalty program. As members we received free wi-fi, a $10 "raid the mini-bar on us" coupon, and the room upgrade.

My husband and I just returned from a week long vacation to Secrets Maroma Beach, and I definitely did not want to leave. I can't think of one bad thing to say. The resort and beach were absolutely gorgeous. The beach was immaculate and the ocean water clear and warm. The main pool with swim up bar was awesome, the water was heated which is great when you have an overcast day. Never had a problem finding a chair by the beach or pool. The food and drinks were excellent, we found the bartenders were quite generous with the liquor :-). The service was superb. Everyone we met went above and beyond. The wait service at the pool and beach was great as well. We booked a basic room and thought it was outstanding. Could not see the ocean, but we had a lovely tropical view and we spent all the daylight hours down by the beach and pool anyway. We ordered room service for dinner one evening and the food and service were top quality. We had no worries while staying at this resort and truly enjoyed a relaxing, pampering week in paradise.

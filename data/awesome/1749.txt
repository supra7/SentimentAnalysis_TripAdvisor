We recently stayed at the Sixth Avenue Inn for one night to explore Seattle after our cruise ended. We were impressed with our stay. Even though check-in was 4pm we arrived at 9am hoping we could leave our luggage and to our surprise the courteous staff checked us into our room. I wish I remember his name because he was very helpful with tourist destinations, restaurants, etc...For the price it is a great deal and excellent location. It is only 4 or 5 blocks from Space Needle and 2 1/2 blocks from the monorail to Space Needle and the light rail to the airport. The Seattle trolley also stops on 7th ave right behind the hotel and takes you to Lake Union. The waterfront is a short 15-20 minute walk and there is a nice restaurant on property with a huge food selection and a Mcdonalds on the corner. The room had 2 queen size beds and were very comfortable. We did not have a car but there is parking at the hotel. One time when walking by the front desk I heard the clerk tell another guest it was $15 to park and once again the courteous staffer told this guest not to worry about leaving the car in the parking lot after they checked out and to enjoy the sites of Seattle that day. When we checked out we walked 2 1/2 blocks to the Westport rail station and took a train to the airport for $2.75 each person (better than the $50 cab fare from the airport to the cruise dock).All in all if you are looking for price, friendly staff, perfect central location, great comfortable room then sixth avenue inn is the place to go...I would recommend it.

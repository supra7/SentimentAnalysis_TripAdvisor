Came to town for a Seattle Seahawks vs Arizona Cardinals NFL football game. The Westin in downtown was great for this trip. Room was updated, clean and quiet. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Bed was comfortable. No complaints at all about the hotel. We did not eat or drink at the hotel so cannot comment on those things. Hotel is about 5 blocks from the Pikes Place public market and another couple to the waterfront. Seattle public transportation is very convenient to others areas and buses are free downtown. Rode the new Central Link light rail from Sea-Tac all the way to the Westlake Station (1.5 blocks North of the Westin) for $2.50. (*Have to ride a connector bus 1 Mile from the airport to the Tukwila Station until the rail extends to the airport in Dec 2009.) On game day, rode the FREE bus from the Westlake station to the International / Chinatown station which is only a few minute walk to the stadium. The Monorail to the Seattle Center and the Space Needle is just across the street to the South. We bought a City Pass and used it to visit the space needle twice, the pacific science center, an Imax movie, the Science Fiction Museum and Music experience, the seattle aquarium and a harbor cruise.

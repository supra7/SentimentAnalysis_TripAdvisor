Our express 8 hr visit, may have been quick but it had everything we needed, and nothing we didn't, we wheeled our bags across from the airport with no location troubles just as dusk settled, the room was clean, beds comfortable and welcoming, and after 24 hours of travelling, any little thing could have jared our mood. The welcoming hot apple cider was an unexpected treat, subtle and warming a wonderful delight enjoyed by all members of the family. We ate at the hotel restaurant, a little more upmarket than our usual, but we were after convenience and real food, and we enjoyed a magnificent feast, though disappointingly for all too tired to fully digest it all.(Follow the head waiters suggestions, he knows what he is talking about and enjoy the spectical of the presentation). We had to depart before breakfast, but chose not to waste time eating instead of sleeping so picked up a few nibbles from the well stocked shop (don't forget to look for the Sleepless in Seattle night wear) rather than order room service. Perfect.

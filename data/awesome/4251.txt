LOVE this resort. We had an amazing vacation. The service was impeccable and we had anything we needed when we asked. All of the staff are extremely pleasant and accomodating. The food was excellent. The entertainment was fun and we met a lot of great people! I can't say enough about Moises (our concierge on the beach) and Elisandro (our bartender at the Preferred Lounge). They were fantastic. We plan to be back again for sure!! The sales pitch to get you to go to the vacation club presentation is a minor annoyance. All you have to say is "no" and nobody pushes you into anything. I am on vacation and do not want to sit through a sales presentation so we just declined. Not a big deal. Enjoy this fabulous resort!!

Spent two nights at this hotel after our Alaska cruise. What a great hotel. Perfect location, great restaurant and the service was prompt and professional. We had a very early departure for the airport and a bell man was present at our room as we requested and cab called right away. I'd stay here again anytime. Oh, and the pool with the view of the city is special.

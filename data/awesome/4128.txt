We picked this location because of reviews we read and we were not disappointed. This was an amazing location and I can't think of anything that I would do differently. The food, drinks, beach, accommodations and the personnel were exceptional. We enjoyed meeting other people but appreciated the quietness that comes from not having children around. We love children and hope to take our 4 sons w/ us next spring break for another all-inclusive vacation. However, we know the experience won't be the same. The advise I would give future guests is to check your Secrets box because sometimes items are left in it and you might not be aware of that. We upgraded to an ocean view and don't regret it. We also used the preferred club multiple times a day and would recommend it. It was a nice location for meeting others, asking questions, light snacks, a cocktail...we enjoyed it. LOVED the spa too and would not hesitate to use it again. The only bad part of Secrets Maroma Beach is leaving it. We hope to return there sometime in the future.

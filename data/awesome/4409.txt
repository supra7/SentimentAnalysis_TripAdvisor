The obvious and expected things that are done for you on a vacation are easy to notice. The bed being made, the towels exchanged, the room cleaned. The not so obvious or expected things are what set people apart. The small things like remembering my name and being treated like I am somebody special. A smile and a geeting by name when walking around the resort will make anybody feel good. The "customer service" on the beach is just as noticeable as by the pool ,or even the front lobby. You are a "customer" on every inch of this resort and they take pride in serving you. The entertainment staff were outstanding. This was not just a "job" to them. Even noticed some of them going out of there way to pick up trash that had blown into the brush area. Not thier job but didn't matter, looked as tho it was very natural thing to do...working as part of a team that is. Something everyone could take a lesson from. The Secrets Maroma experience was awesome. Having been to other resorts in the Bahamas, Cancun, Riveria Maya, and Jamaica. This resort stands above the others we have visited. Thank You for making it a memorable experience. Mark and Vi N.

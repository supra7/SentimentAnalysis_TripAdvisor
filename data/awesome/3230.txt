I'm surprised at the negative reviews, I'm a regular Priceline customer, staying at the Doubletree usually once a month and have never had a bad experience. Granted it's a large hotel and I don't like hiking to a room in another zip code. I always ask for a room near the lobby and am always accomodated. The rooms in the wings are larger than those in the tower and if you get wings 2 or 3 closer than walking to the tower wing plus no elevator hassle. The rooms are always clean, the beds great, bedding and bath linens top notch. They recently have gone to flat sceen televisions throughout the place which was overdue but is greatly appreciated. I've always found staff friendly and every request granted. Airport pickup runs every 15 minutes. The cookies are a nice touch too. I'm always pleased when my Priceline bid results in the Doubletree

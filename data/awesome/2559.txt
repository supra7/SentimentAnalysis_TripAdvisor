What a wonderful stay. I wish we had ended our Alaskan Adventure here rather than starting it. We were spoiled. The stay at the end of the trip in the Anchorage Hilton was not heavenly by any stretch, but I have entered a review on that so I won't elaborate here. From the valet, to the reservationist, we were treated like family and by name by bellhops and the concierge. We had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. The room was huge, with floor to ceiling windows, and a view that was nothing short of magnificent! The beds are indeed heavenly. They are the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. Better get moving Hyatt!!! At half the price of the Grand Hyatt Seattle this place is a steal. The room was well maintained during our stay and we always had fresh ice. Check out was equally as delightful. The concierge offered wonderful dining recommendations with the exception on one that I have seen reviewed here. Don't expect a lot at Oceanaire and you will be delighted. Drinks at $12 a piece, out of half the oysters and don't get me started on entrees. After being called they assured the concierge that they had razor claims (A Personal Favorite of mine). Well, not only did they not have them. They were also out of a couple of fish dishes and salmon as well. What kind of restaurant runs out of half of their entrees. We politely told them thanks, but we were leaving!! Anyway, if you are in Seattle and want to feel luxurious....this is the place to head!

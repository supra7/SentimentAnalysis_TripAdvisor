I had stayed there as a part of the week-long conference program. I would say the location is not the best in terms of access limited by traffic during rush hours, but this is something beyond their control for now. The hotel provided an excellent example of what an ideal value for money was. The staff was excellent, they took care of everything before our arrival. The service was prompt and did everything to make us comfortable. Food was exceptional, too. Of course, the rates might be on a little higher side, and I might not have stayed at this place if I had to pay for myself. But for business travelers and for those who want access to everything within 10 minutes of walk, this is an ideal place to stay.

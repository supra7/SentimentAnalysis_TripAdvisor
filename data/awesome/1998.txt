The hotel is pretty new, rooms are quite nice but avoid the ones on the ground level since it could be noisy. The hotel staff is also super friendly, The breakfast is very special, so do not miss it! The hotel is not in the center of Rome but it has an easy access to the touristic sights by both subway (8-10 min walking) or bus. I'll defenitely come back to Principe Torlonia in my next trip to Rome. Enjoy!!!

We stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach and found the hotel to be everything that everyone said it was. The rooms were clean and beautiful and the service was impeccable. The only slightly negative thing was that the ocean was a little rough right in front of the hotel with 2 foot waves typical the entire time we were there. The actual sand was great and there were no rocks in the water. We found the restaurants to be very good especially the seafood and steak house. All in all, would go back in a minute.

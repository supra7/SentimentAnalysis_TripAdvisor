My wife and I had never been to Cancun before. All I can say is Secrets took care of everything. Absolutely the best trip of our live's. The beach is so pretty. The staff are so nice and helpfull, and the food is great. Bring at least one pair of paints, so you can get in to the nice resturants. Enjoy!

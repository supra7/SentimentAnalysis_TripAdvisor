Upon arrival in the a.m. well prior to check in times, we were greeted by the valet who was pleasant and efficient. We left our car and bags with him , so that we could spend our day walking downtown and enjoying a fabulous lunch at Maximillans overlooking the Sound in Pike's place market. As parking in this area is a challenge, the valet convenience is something to take advantage. We enjoyed dinner at the hotel's more casual french cafe, Cafe Campagne, as the more formal Campagne is closed Mondays. We were very pleased with the service and our meal, both were in a relaxed french cafe tradition. After dinner we enjoyed a view of the city lights from the 5th floor balcony of the hotel...which is open only to guests. If it was a warmer night it would have been a perfect place for a glass of wine after dinner.

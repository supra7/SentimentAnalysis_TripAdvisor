Wow, I stayed here for my honeymoon and it could not have been better. Now, my wife and I are not accustomed to luxury so every tiny detail was a pleasant surprise. Ie they change the elevator carpet every night at midnight to display the new day. Also our room had a beautiful bathroom the size of a new York apartment lol jk but it was large with a double size bathtub and marble tile. The service was great extremely helpful and courteous. The only downside and this is not the hotels fault but Seattle esp. This area is very hilly so if u are fit have no worries everything is accessible from walking but if walking is problematic U may want to find a different location. Since I don't mind walking thus is definitely my new go to for Seattle if I ever come back or recommend.

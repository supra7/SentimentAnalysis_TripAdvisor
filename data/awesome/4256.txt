I would like to say thanks to all of the people on Trip Advisor for helping make our decision to go to Secrets Maroma Beach. It was everything everyone said it would be. The all inclusive is definitely true. There was no extra charges at all except for the spa and certain bottles of wine. Our Concierge Janik was amazing and did everything possible to make our stay amazing. The entertainment staff made our stay very entertaining. Alejandro, Cici, Giovanni, Thomas made all the activities around the hotel a lot more fun. We met great people at the resort and all of the employees seemed to have smiles on their faces the whole time. The only issue we have with the place is it seems they are trying to get to fancy with the meals. I eat at a lot of nice places and the food seemed like it was hurried and dressed up a lot instead of great flavor. That is the only issue and believe me it is minor. The room service was amazing because of the service and the time it took to get the food. The beach is unbelievable and the views are gorgeous. If anybody has second thoughts about going take it from me it is worth the money. R & L

I was traveling alone to see a concert and was very surprised by the level of service I received. Everyone was nice and helpful with walking maps and directions for me. The location could not have been better and the free valet parking that came with the internet deal saved me $30. Better than that, when I checked out at 12 the next day, they let me keep my car and luggage there free until 4pm! I was able to do some wondering without having to repark my car or pay for street parking. The room was small, but suitable. What it lacks in size it makes up for in creature comforts and style. The king sized bed made for the most comfortable sleeping experience of my life! The linens and beading were high quality and there were more pillows that I knew what to do with. The value was unbeatable. I look forward to returning to the Hotel Max.

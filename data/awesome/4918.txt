My husband and I traveled to Secrets Maroma for our wedding anniversary and experienced the best vacation ever. The hotel grounds were breath-taking, quiet and relaxed; our room was so beautiful and extremely clean; and the food and service were phenomenal. We kept remarking that the employees were so friendly and welcoming that it was obvious that they must be treated very well by their employer: happy employees = excellent customer service. There's always an activity to attend or a beautiful view to enjoy. We can't wait to go back!

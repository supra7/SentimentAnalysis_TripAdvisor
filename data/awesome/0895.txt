Our 3rd time at Royal Suites We, this time a group of 6 people from Finland, just returned from our 5th trip to Punta Cana and 3rd stay at Grand Palladium Royal Suites, which is now called Royal Suites Turquesa under the new brand name Royal Suites by Palladium.Why somebody in general travels to the same resort another time or many times to Grand Palladium Resort Royal Suites???. In general I would say simply: when you take the same target another or more times, you know how to have your enjoyment there.In our case the answer to many times question is very easy, because we`ve been and seen to some other resorts also in Punta Cana Playa Bavaro area.1) Grand Palladium Resort is large enough for 1-2 weeks vacations (4 hotels, about 12 restaurants, lots of bars), works well and is a well-maintained nature beach paradise. 2) Royal Suites Turquesa is just for us: - peaceful relaxation, - good food and drinks, - spacious beautiful seaview rooms with jazucci in/outdoor, - own pool with swim-up bar (thanks to Danny, Santo) - personal contact with the kind personnel- good service with nice humor3) We especially liked the Royal Gourmet Restaurant, which was new to us. Thanks to Juan, Ana, and many others for taking care of our needs.4) Royal Suites Turquesa recepcion and lobby is a nice place for spending your leisure time with newpapers, internet access and good drinks. Thanks to Edward, Daniela, waiters and all others for good services. 5) Newly opened Renova Spa is just in front of Royal Suites. 6) One of the best things in my mind is that the hotel management is all the time doing a good job to keep the wheels rolling.7) Finally, as I have heard the resort is continuously developing for our next trip, and so we have started to plan our next trip to Royal Suites.Have a good vacation wherever you travel, but be aware where you are going to!Frequent travelers from FInland Europe

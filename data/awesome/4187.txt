I've just returned from a week staying at Secrets Maroma Beach, and it was (quite simply) amazing. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, nothing was too much for the staff at the hotel...the Customer Service was top draw. The food was excellent in all the restaurants, especially the veal (French restaurant). The Asian cuisine was great as was the Italian, Oceana and even room service. The rooms are unbelievable. We booked a basic tropical room but upgraded to a swim-out room upon arrival. Fully recommend these rooms. Marble tops in the bathroom, large walkin showers, minibar (with Corona OJ, water, coke, fanta and sprite) massive 4-post bed, jacuzzi, sofa, desk and table. We were lucky enough to stay in a honeyroom suite for the first night (although not on honeymoon) over looking the beach. These rooms have a jacuzzi outside overlooking one of the top 10 beaches in the world. Separate kitchen, living room, another jacuzzi inside, twin shower (with 4 heads), separate toilets/sinks. The pool is great but the beach is the main draw. The beach has six separate double beds you can hire for the day ($30/$40 depending who you see!). Normal sun beds are free of charge and you can pick up a towel on your way to the beach. There's a bar on the beach which doesn't have seats but swings...great for chilling out on with a cocktail or beer. There's so much I've missed out, but this truely is a magical place. The staff will probably bend over backwards for you if you ask! This is perfect for special occasions and I doubt anyone will find anything to fault...if they do they must be very miserable! Will definitely return one day.

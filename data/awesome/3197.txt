Very conveniently located by the airport. Shuttle service is great, comes every 20 minutes. Staff is very friendly. Wide variety at the breakfast buffet. The layout of the hotel is very nice, not like you typical airport hotel. Beautiful landscaping. Hotel is close to the lightrail that goes all the way to downtown, so no rental car needed. Overall great experience.

We stayed at Secrets for 4 nights over our spring break. We had never experienced an all-inclusive before, and we now feel as if we are ruined forever. The staff at Secrets was so attentive to every single detail, that we can't imagine being better treated anywhere. Every single interaction with the people who worked there was a treat - from Sandra (our personal concierge) to Adolfo (our entertaining chef at Himitsu) and all the helpful bartenders and servers during our stay were so friendly and so warm. If you are looking for a short-term relaxing getaway, this is a fantastic choice. We are already planning on coming back...

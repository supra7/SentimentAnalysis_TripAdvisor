This hotel is amazing, great service, has a restaurant with a great view. The staff is very helpful and willing to go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The restaurant in the hotel has amazing food, and reasonably priced. This hotel is centrally located 8 blocks from the Space Needle, and 3 blocks from Pike Place market. There are a variety on great little restaurants and cafe's within walking distance of the hotel if you don't feel like eating in the hotel restaurant. If you are taking a cruise this is the best place to stay as it is right on the pier and staff at the hotel will be able to walk your luggage over to the pier where your ship is departing from. All in all this was an amazing experience and I will definitely stay there again when I go back to Seattle.

My husband and myself stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach 10th MAY - 24th May 2010 we celerbrated our 35th wedding anniversary there. We can not speak more highly of the staff nothing was too much trouble for them to do for you. As for the resturants you could not fault them especially the Japanese and the Italian. The service around the pool was fantastic. The Lobby staff were briliant. The rooms were spotless. I must mention the Coco Cafe fantastic coffee and cakes. Last but not least the night club thanks too the DJ's for playing my rock music.

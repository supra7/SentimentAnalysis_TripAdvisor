I travelled with a friend to a conference last week and stayed for 4 days at this hotel. No complaints whatsoever, staff was great, pricing (we did get a reduced nightly rate and free internet due to the conference) was good, no problem with the internet reception as well. Beds very comfortable and had an awesome view of the Sky Needle from our room. Good location in the city, easy to walk to many sightseeing destinations. Would stay again without hesitation.

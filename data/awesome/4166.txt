We stayed at Maroma during the last week of May and first week of June,we loved every minute and would love to return someday.As with any hotel it cannot be totally perfect (even though they try) and i will put across a few little niggles that they could improve. We were greeted at reception with a glass of champagne and cool towel and given a rough guide to the hotels facilities by the reception staff,we were informed the room we had been allocated had 2 separate beds instead of one king-size which we were a bit disappointed with,the guy on reception sensed this and informed us that a different room would be ready the following day,also we were expecting an anniversary banner on our door and a bottle of champagne in our room which wasnt there, I definitely say this was our travel agents fault though and not Secrets, I mentioned it to our concierge and he sorted straight away. Our concierge by the way was great, very friendly and knew our names from the first day,i asked if it would be possible to change a few items in the minibar and 10mins later it was done.I think i have worked out however that if your British you will be placed in block 20 which is furthest away from the beach although it is nearset the restaurants. Pool - The pool was great although to get a really good position you need to there for 8.30 - 9.00. We found the service by the waitresses around the pool to be good and on many occasions they would just fetch us another cocktail without us asking. Beach - Wow were my first words as we walked onto it for the first time,the sand is so white it hurts your eyes and the water is a stunning colour,again the best sunbeds go early. We had our lunch on the beach a couple of times cooked by the chefs on the BBQ and i only found out on the last day about the food menu the waitresses carry round with them on the beach,this was also really good food.I participated in the beach volleyball nearly everyday which was great fun and i also scored a cracking volley at beach soccer :) Food - Breakfast and lunch buffets at the world cafe were great, massive selection of good quality food,no complaints whatsoever. Evening Dinner - Im trying not to just say everythings amazing so i will say that maybe service was a little slow some nights,the one thing that did annoy me a little however is the dress code.It says the dress code is smart, fair enough it says long trousers but if im not allowed in with a pair off expensive three quarter jeans,shirt and espadrilles on why should someone with a baggy tshirt pair of baggy chinos and a baseball cap be allowed in the same restaurant, I would have looked a lot smarter than many others in there.The food itself was generally very good and the fillet steak was lovely. We also enjoyed our daily trip to cocos for our frozen mocha which again were lovely All in all the resort was brilliant,and i would recommend it to anyone

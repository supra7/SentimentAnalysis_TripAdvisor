This was by far the best resort experience that my wife and I have had. The resort is big enough to have every amenity possible, but small enough that you can get across the resort in very little time. The pool atmosphere was great and the beach was fantastic. This was the best beach, by far, that we have been to in Mexico. They had entertainment each evening and there was plenty to do should you want activity. The food across the board was also outstanding. We also experienced first class service across the board. We encountered a few couples that had been to over 20 resorts - this was the only one they had returned to a second time. I am recommending this resort to everyone I know.

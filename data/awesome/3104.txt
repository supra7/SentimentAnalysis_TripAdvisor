I stayed at Hotel Max for 9 days during a conference in early June, and it was an extremely good value. The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center. For the price, I don't think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle. The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young (nearly all under 40 years). The rooms are quite small, (although not all the same size for doubles), and the room was clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet. The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink (I thought it was malfunctioning), but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasn't hip enough to figure it out. One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew. Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor. The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests (internet service in rooms requires an extra fee). The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights. The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways (I was sharing a double room with two other people). My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it. It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong. We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty. The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market. Don't miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue. Both are yummy.

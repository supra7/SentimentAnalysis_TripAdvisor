WOW! Loved everything about this place! The service is unlike anywhere else I've ever been! No matter who you approach with any question or request, they'll take care of you and end the service by saying "It's a pleasure"!!! Food was extra delicious no matter where we ate, whether the "all you can eat" buffet or one of the seven restaurants from the day one to the end of our stay!!! Pleasant, quiet atmosphere! Spa was extraordinary with unprecedented services!!! Incredible shows, and fun club dancing every day!!! Crystal clear see-through water on the beach with beautiful warm clean sand!!! WANNA GO BACK SOOOOO BADLY!!!

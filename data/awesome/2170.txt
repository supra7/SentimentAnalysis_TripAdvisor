We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. Location is fantastic and we had a beautiful view out on the bay. Loved the room except we were wondering how much a patio or deck would add to the bill. We loved the sounds and smells of the bay. Our first night we just sat by the fire and looked out the window! Magnificent. I dont want to stay anywhere else! The room was comfortable and we loved the decor and the optional open bath. We recieved nothing but outstanding service from all employees. We did not visit the restaurant but we did sample the room service menu. The items we recieved were delivered in a timely manner and the food was delicious! The Location is within walking distance to most attractions and those that are not it is easy to hop on the frequent passing transit system which is free during the day. There is a charge for parking at the hotel but we decided our vehicle was much safer there than the alternatives. Its much easier to get around Seattle using the transit system opposed to trying to drive and park. The hotel even has a complementary shuttle offering to transport you to and from the Seattle attractions. We didn't have a need to use that service as the weather was quite accomidating. I definitely recommend this hotel as the best in Seattle but only if you enjoy sounds and smells of the bay! There are many boats coming and going at all hours and there is the aroma of the sea water and the activity on the bay.

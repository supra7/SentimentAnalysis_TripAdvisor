Excellent hotel!! My friend stayed here the night before we flew out of Seattle. The proximity to the airport is excellent. The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was great with since and space outside for a second person to get ready in the morning. The only negative was the hot tub. The hot tub was luke wam and the jets had a mind of their own and would turn on whenever they wanted. Other then that the hotel was great. Beautiful area!

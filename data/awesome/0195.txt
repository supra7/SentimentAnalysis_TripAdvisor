We travel extensively with our three teenagers, and never have we stayed in a more comfortable and accommodating hotel than the Monaco. The kids loved the gifts awaiting them, and we all bonded with Nicole, the goldfish who kept us company during our stay. (As a side, self-sufficient Nicole took care of phoning room service when we left the room so we didn't attend to her needs -- just enjoyed her company.) The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable. The decor was contemporary. The restaurant had interesting, fairly priced offerings. The quality of a room service food was equally high. We have definitely added Kimpton Hotels to our list of favorites.

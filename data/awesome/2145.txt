What a beautiful old hotel! we originally booked water view for my beau and me, and city view for my teenage son. When we arrived, they upgraded us to a premium water view room (larger with claw foot tub, etc.) and my son to a water view room! The rooms were clean, quiet, the sheets very good quality, the fireplace romantic, the views splendid. Not your average spendy room, like we just had in vegas. Valet guys were prompt and professional. as were the front desk staff. Room service prompt. The fee to park a car overnight a bit high. my only complaint.

We were in Seattle for a conference and opted for the Max because it was much less expensive and the conference venues and we were intrigued with its art theme. The lobby decor is fantanstic and the rooms are simple yet comfortable. The bed is very comfortable, especially after a 5 hour transcon flight. Great location, walking distance to all the major Seattle attractions. Before we left my wife called the hotel twice with questions about ammenities and local transportation options and the staff was always friendly and helpful. We found the front desk and lobby staff extremely friendly and helpful at all times. Two points of criticism, the wireless internet is painfully slow. If you're going to charge $12 for a connection at least upgrade to wireless G, better yet don't charge at all, hardly any other hotel does these days. Second, the breakfast at the Red Fin is way overpriced and the quality is inferior to surrounding establishments. My wife's eggs came out overdone twice, and my pancakes with coconut and macadamia nuts sounded great but were very bland. On the other hand, the happy hour at Red Fin is fantastic.

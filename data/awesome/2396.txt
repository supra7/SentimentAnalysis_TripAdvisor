I've stayed in the Westin Seattle on about 10 occasions in the last 2 years, all on business. It's a great business hotel, with large, comfortable rooms, no hassle internet access, good bathrooms, peace and quiet and often great views.The location is extremely central and convenient to shopping and restaurants. The food in the restaurant in the hotel and on room service gets very samey after a while but it's not bad. My only quibble is with the breakfast offering, which is poor compared to its sister hotels the W and the Sheraton. The Cafe is noisy, service poor and there is an overpowering smell of cooking fat which isn't pleasant when you're jetlagged and a bit nauseous. I generally go for room service breakfast instead, though it is horrendously expensive, even on expenses. Outside of that, though, it's a great hotel and my first choice for business stays in Seattle.

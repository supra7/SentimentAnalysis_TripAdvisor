We found this hotel on the internet after doing some research for a hotel with a good location in Seattle. We didn't want to rent a car so the location of this hotel was great. We were able to walk to Pike's, the Needle and all sorts of restaurants and shopping. By the way, there is an excellent italian restaurant just a half block up from the Warwick, Assaggio's, it's a must do! But for $88/night we got a room with a city view on the 15th floor. They even accommodated us to be right across the hall from family members who we met there for the weekend. The decor is a little dated and it could use some updating. But we had one of the best experiences there with the friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely stay there again.

This was our 8th trip to the area and have stayed at 3 other all inclusives and Secrets Maroma was the best yet. The food and service is what made this resort stand out from the others. The beach was very impressive with sugar white soft sand and not a rock to be found. Our ocean view room in building 16 was perfect, as we could hear the waves from our balcony. Thanks to the entire staff for making our tirp wonderful.

My husband and I stayed for 1 week right before Christmas. The resort was so beautiful and clean. The service was fantastic. Beach, perfect! The food and drinks were better then any other all inclusive we have been to. It was romantic, and even when at full occupancy, felt private. The rooms were beautiful with great linens, a fantastic HUGE jacuzzi tub and sensual smelling soaps, shampoos, and lotions. This trip brought back intimacy into our marriage. Sometimes it is easy to get caught up in the kids, work, etc and not focus on each other. This trip will give you a great chance to connect. We travel quite often and have never loved a resort this much!

I was pleasantly surprised with this hidden gem. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the property was very clean. and the room was really nice. The bed was so comfortable and you can't beat the low rate. The location was convenient and we could walk to several nearby restaurants. I would definitely return to the Destiny Palms.

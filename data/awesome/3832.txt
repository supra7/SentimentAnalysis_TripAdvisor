Our group of 8 were moved from Capri to Maroma on the 4th day of our trip due to it being oversold. We were thrilled to say the least. Maroma is everything we had anticipated and more! Everything about this place is top notch. I have never stayed at a property with such outstanding service. We were of course given the lowest category room, furthered from the beach and it was wonderful and beautifully appointed. We have already planned our return trip for next year. I can't imagine how anyone can have anything negative to say about this place. Food was great, always found chairs on beach and poolside. Entertainment staff was outstanding. See you next year!

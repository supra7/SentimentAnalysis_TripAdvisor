We have just returned from our honeymoon at Secret Maroma and we had such a wonderful time. As it was our honeymoon we were hoping to upgrade our room when mentioning we were honeymooners but we didnt need to, we had a junior suite with the most amazing bed we have ever seen. Clean and spacious with a jacuzzi bath and champagne for our arrival. The staff were very friendly and would do anything to make you comfortable and were always attentive. The beach was postcard perfect, I noticed they even removed the seaweed early in the mornings, burying it before the guests awake. The food was gorgeous at all of the resturants the Mexican was our favourite. Be prepared to be spoilt and take your appetite, as food is available 24hrs a day!

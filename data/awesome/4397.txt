I'll write a short review because I could go on and on about how great this resort is. Pros: -Service is second to none -food is fabulous -property is well maintained and beautiful -rooms are spotless -beach 9/10 Cons: I'm really having a hard time finding a complaint about this resort.... I guess the batterie was dead in the bathroom scale...but I'm sure if I would have called the concierge they would have had it fixed in 5 min, then appologised 20 times for the inconvienence. Thanks to the incredible staff for helping us have the best vacation ever. other tips: -swim up rooms are really nice -make sure to take advantage of the 24 hr room service..(nothing better then an awesome prime rib dinner at 3am) -tipping isn't required but the staff work very hard and go out of their way to please you so don't be cheap...tip a couple dollars here and there.

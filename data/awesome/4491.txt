Just returned from a unforgettable vacation at Secrets. Every aspect of our experience was 5 star! The service was exceptional from the Bellmen to the room service! Every employee was gracious and accomidating! The maid service was excellent and on our last evening left towel swans surrounded by rose petals on our bed! Nice touch! Our room was a swim out and was well worth it! The water was warm and so clean! Like a small slice of Heaven! Also enjoyed the heated pool even though it was crowded! The beach is spectacular! Warm water, sugary soft sand and no seaweed! Lovely! Food was great and highly recommend the show at the Japanese Restraunt. I really enjoyed room service however. Food was good and always hot! There is nothing better than breakfast in bed! I did find that tipping did not make a difference in service, yet the service was so good, that I felt tips in some cases were warranted. The employees were always happy even when they did not think anyone was around! You simply could not be in a bad mood here! We rented a car and visited Playa and Tulum. Driving was not difficult but heard that the police are very strict about seatbelt use and restriction of cellphones while driving. Don't do it unless you want to get stopped and get a ticket! It was a little scary seeing police on the roadside with automatic weapons. Despite this, we had no issues and felt safe in this region of the country. If u get a chance, go diving in the cenotes! Wow what a great experience! Even though u might not want to leave the beautiful resort, activities in this region r great! Diving, cenotes, ruins and snorkeling etc. u won't get bored!

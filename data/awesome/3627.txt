Because we got this room so cheap I was expecting the worst I was so pleasantly surprised! The room was clean and the shower was cool! The room was small but it was just me and my husband so it was great! When we go to Disney we always stay there and get dining plans as well but if we decided to stay outside of the World we would stay here for sure. There is a McDonald's in the parking lot and a sit down restaurant! It's just down the road from Disney too!

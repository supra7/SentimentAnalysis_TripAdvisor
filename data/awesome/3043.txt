When we drove up we were met curbside by a valet who got our luggage out, parked our car etc. We were shown to our room, which was just great. It was a corner room on the third floor (I understand the corner rooms are a little larger). The room was spotless, and the staff was just great - helping us with where to go, with restaurants, events going on in town etc. The location was great - close to everything. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The bed was especially comfortable; and there is a pillow menu for the type of pillow you like.

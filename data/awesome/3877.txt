In May we went to Secrets Maroma Beach Riviera and had a absolutely awesome experience! We opted for the Preferred Club Junior Suite Swim-out on the first floor facing the ocean. Absolutely breathtaking. We loved facing the beach area, and being so close to the Barracuda Bar and Barefoot Grill. We stayed a week and was able to take full advantage of all the restaurants on property. Highlights were the Portofino and the Bordeaux Restaurants. A 5-star experience! We also joined the Perferred Club for a few dollars more and got preferred EVERYTHING....check-in/out; personal concierge; preferred club lounge (fabulous!)....definitely a plus for our trip. We also indulged and got the beach-side lobster/steak private dinner for two...delicious! And we indulged in a day at the spa....WORLD CLASS for sure!!! We did attend the presentation to "buy" their timeshare-type program which was very informative, though we did not buy...we did think twice about it because we were so in love with this property. A HIGH recommendation from 2 retired folks living in Surprise, AZ. BTW....May weather was perfect!

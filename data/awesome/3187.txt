We had a nice stay at the Seatac Doubletree. Very friendly service, clean hotel and nice breakfast. The only downsides are that the hotel complex is huge, meaning long walks to the farther "wings," and that the advertised free internet is only available in the lobby - internet in the rooms is expensive. Would definitely stay here again before an early flight out of Seatac.

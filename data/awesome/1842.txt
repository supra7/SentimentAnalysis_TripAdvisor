We chose Hotel Andra based on recommendations from a friend and travel guides and we are so glad we did. Service was great, the rooms were very clean, comfortable and quiet and the hotel's location was an easy walk to Pikes Market and many nice restaurants. We would definitely stay at Hotel Andra again if returning to Seattle.

Inn at the Market was an absolutely exquisite experience, made all the more so because it was a surprise gift from my teenage daughter. She knew that I had been lusting to stay at this jewel of a boutique hotel ever since I read the wonderful review which Sunset Magazine gave it. Every time we passed by it when strolling through Pike Market, I would say: I wish we could stay one night at Inn at the Market. We live less than an hour's drive from Seattle in the Tacoma area, so we don't usually do overnights in Seattle. Besides, we are loyal Best Western guests, and Inn at the Market is more than double the rate of even the finest Best Western motel. Inn at the Market is quintessential Seattle - friendly, casual yet elegant, pleasing to the senses, practical. For reasons unknown, we were upgraded to a suite with gorgeous water views (my daughter insists she did not tell the hotel that we were celebrating my 55th birthday). The location can't be beat - in the heart of Pike Market, next to a fine (but pricey) French restaurant. The hotel itself houses a breakfast and lunch cafe which we wish we had tried, as the food fragrances were yummy and the place was packed. All day in-and-out valet parking (extra charge) made it easy to tour Seattle without fearing the loss of precious parking. In short - this wonderful Seattle hotel is worth the splurge in every way, shape, and form. Claire B - thanks for leading me to this place. Nancy W - your love and generosity made this hotel an added beautiful experience.

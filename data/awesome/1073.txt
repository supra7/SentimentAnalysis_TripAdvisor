This hotel has everything any of the best hotels offer but with one advantage, a warm homely appeal that made our fantastic stay in Seattle even better.It was recommended by friends that have stayed there numerous times and keep going back.Friendly staff, great rooms and in a good location.Our two adult children had a twin room with two bathrooms, excellent!

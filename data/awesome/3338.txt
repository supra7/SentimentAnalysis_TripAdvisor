I was concerned when I read some of the other recent reviews found at this hotel but I have stayed here a few times in the past and was trusting my past experience. I'm glad I did. I did not find or experience the complaints expressed by others. I fly alot for business and have stayed in many hotels where the rooms are much smaller for twice the price, especially east coast or in the larger cities. The furniture in the room was fairly new as I saw the manufaturing date in the drawer of the nightstand and it matched the other pieces in the room. The carpet in the room looked and felt new and was deep green. Not the gold carpet shown in the hotels pictures. The queen size bed was clean, comfortable and did not feel dated. The exercise room did have a mix of older and new equipment and it did all work. The hallway carpet was being replaced durning my stay so it did make it difficult getting to my room but they helped with my luggage. The hotel is 20 or so years old as are most of the hotels in the area, but I have seen improvements at this hotel over my previous visits. It was fairly quiet as I did not hear the cars or airplane traffic in my room. The biggest thing this hotel has going for it is the staff. Being the housekeepers, shuttle driver or front desk they are alway very friendly, helpfull and responsive. They really make me feel welcome. Not home but close. I have stayed in other chain hotels in the area that have a little nicer lobby and common areas but not worth the higher price of the room. for my money these guys are still my best choice.

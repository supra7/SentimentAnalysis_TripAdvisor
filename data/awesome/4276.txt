Just returned from 8 days - we will be going back! This is a place best suited for those that wish to relax, although they have plenty of activities. The vibe around the pool is calm unless you choose to join in with the entertainment staff. They do a great job of not bothering you and letting you choose to participate or not. We felt the food was wonderful, the staff friendly and very helpful, superb service. The beach is the best we have been to and we have been to many.

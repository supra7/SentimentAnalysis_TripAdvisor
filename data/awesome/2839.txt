I've stayed at the W two years in a row now for the Seattle Rock and Roll Marathon weekend. The location is great. This year I took the light rail from the airport and it was a breeze to get to. The staff are very good, very helpful. We had numerous changes with our 3 reserved rooms and they were accomodating with all of them. The dark lighting is too much in the hallways, definitely, but the rooms are very nice. The beds and pillows are the best. I never want to get out of bed! The Bliss products are always amazing and I love that they are never stingy with them and will always replenish! :) I never have to worry about parking, but I know that the cost in downtown Seattle is awful.

We were only there for 3 nights, but those nights were fabulous. The cleanliness and service were impeccable. Great variety of food and top notch restaurants. Everything highest quality. New furnishings in our room and our concierge (we were in the preferred club section) made us feel like royalty. Everyone seems to truly want to make your vacation the most enjoyable one you've ever had!

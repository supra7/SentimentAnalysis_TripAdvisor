We have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Sorrento Hotel In Seattle, Washington. We stayed in a Sorrento suite with two queen beds. The hotel, while older, was very nice and charming. Beds turned down at night with chocolates on the pillows is still the norm at the Sorrento. Pillows galore. Each bed had six. We would like to give special mention to the staff. They made our stay enjoyable in every possible way. We had difficulties connecting to the internet the first hour we arrived. An IT person, Andrew, was sent to our room. He figured out the problem and had us up and running within a half hour. Not only knowlegeable but very polite and friendly. That was how we found the whole staff. The concerige was always smiling and willing to offer suggestions for meals and had maps available for the guests use. We toured around the city for our 5 days and the hotel has a car available, free of charge, for destinations within a 2 mile radius. Every driver was also so friendly and offered suggestions for restaurants and sights to see. Each made a special effort to make sure we were dropped right at the door of our destination. Seattle is a city that definitely has a lot of rain and the Sorrento is prepared. Complimentary umbrellas are supplied for your use. Another example of the effort the Sorrento makes for their guests to ensure a pleasant and comfortable stay. Our visit receives a 5 out of 5 rating. We would definitely return to the Sorrento.

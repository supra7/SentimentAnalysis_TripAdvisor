Wow! What a Wonderfully Wild, Whimsical W hotel. Though I live in British Columbia, this was my first time that I have hopped across the border to hang out and stay in Seattle. This was also my first time staying at a W Hotel. After reading reviews on this hotel, I was skeptical as to whether or not the service and ambience of this hotel would render a pleasant stay or not. My skepticisms, however, were put to rest shortly after arrival at the W. I booked a 'Wonderful Room' (i.e. basic room) at the W for 2 nights in mid-February '07. Here's an overview of my stay: Pro's: -Service: Speedy & Friendly. Staff aimed to please. Upon check-in, I received a complimentary room upgrade! I was even given a complimentary toothbrush/tube of toothpaste when I informed the front desk that I had forgotten mine at home. -Ambience: Everything at this hotel is modern and very cool. There was a DJ playing in the lobby Saturday night! -Rooms: Functional and Beautiful. Comfy beds and nice sized LCD TV. Housekeeping also supplied new toiletries/towels etc. each morning! -Location: No need for a car or anything! Everything in downtown Seattle worth doing is in walking distance. Con's: -Pricing: The room is worth the price if you have a view or get some sort of discount. Room service and amenities, however, like most hotels of this calibre, are outrageously overpriced. -Bathroom: Cool sink! Great toiletries! But the tub is very average and drab. -Hallways: Woulden't hurt if they were brighter. -Restaurant Servers: 50/50. Staff are attentive and efficient, but not always warm and inviting. Overall: From check-in to check-out, I had a great experience at the W Seattle. The hotel is not exactly cheap and it is not without its shortfalls, but it should not be overlooked when booking a room in this gorgeous city!

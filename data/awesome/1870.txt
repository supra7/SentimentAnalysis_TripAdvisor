This hotel is great. The location was fabulous. I traveled with my two young children and could not be happier with the location. We could run out for a bit to be tourists and still get back in time for naps. The hotel was a short walk from the market, the shops, the monorail, etc. The food available for room service could not be beaten, especially the pizza. The room was comfortable, clean and stylish. I would go back.

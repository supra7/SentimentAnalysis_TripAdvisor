We have just recently returned from a 2week stay at the Secrets Maroma, and well what can I say, it blew our expectations out of the water, The hotel was amazing and so far the best AI that either one of us has stayed in. The hotel itself is kept immaculate as well as the surrounding gardens, The staff do an amazing Job and nothing is ever too much for them, I especially like the extra touches they do, On the first full day of arrival I asked at the breakfast buffet if they had Eggs Benedict (as i had seen it on room service) this was not a standard breakfast option, but they went and made it for me anyway!! Rooms We had a Tropical view which was nice and private and not looked upon. The bed was just about the most comfortable we have slept in and will def be a miss. The bathroom was very nice but the jacuzzi bath i thought the pump wasnt very strong. Restaurants Great choice and you can eat at them as many times as you like within your stay, Again the staff are polite, prompt and do a wonderful service. Our particular favourite was the Mexican although they were all nice, we found the Italian to be our least favourite Beach/Pool Beautiful soft sands and the sea was nice, warm and clear, We didnt really hang around the pool much but there were plenty of areas and beds available, ohh and I did like the out door hot tubs. Excursions We only did 3 trips Cancun nights (inc-coco-bongos) -maybe it was all the hype that was built up around this place, but we found it a bit of a disappointment and not worth the $75 we payed chitzen itza- Definitely a must do, especially if you only plan to go to Mexico only once, It would be a shame not to put this amazing place on your list.!!! only one fault is that the buffet meal wasnt very nice and you also had to pay for your drinks. All in All we had an amazing holiday and would considering returning and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

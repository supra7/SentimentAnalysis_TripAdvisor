A really nice hotel; comfortable beds, clean design, quality furnishings and fixtures, windows that open, and decently clean. When I travel I like to be comfortable- The Max is an older hotel refinished to modern standards without losing the original charm. If you are looking for a great hotel in Seattle this is it (unless you go for artifice).

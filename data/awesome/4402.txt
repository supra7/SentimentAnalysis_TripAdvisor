Usually when we've stayed at an All Inclusive, there always seems to be some sort of issue,whether its about the food, beverages,staff, availability of restaurants on the premises, etc......but with this Secrets.....spectacular in every respect. The suites were incredible and rank among the best we've stayed in. Food was excellent in all respects and the liquor was top shelf. No matter what liquor you wanted in your drink, it was never a problem. I also found that EVERY staff member we encountered was friendly and couldn't do enough for you. They really made us feel special in every way. No matter what time you wanted room service, it was there quickly and was always excellent in both its quality and presentation. The pools were wonderful, and it was so nice to have a heated pool when the weather would change. I would definately recommend the concierge service. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer to fully appreciate a First Class resort. We will definately be going back and I can't wait..... Don't miss out on this wonderful place.

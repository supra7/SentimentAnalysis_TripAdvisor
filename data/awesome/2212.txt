We just returned from our first trip to Seattle. I looked around for hotels and this one stood out as it had great reviews, a fantastic location, and great rates. It lived up to all the reviews. It was a beautiful hotel and room. Our bed was super comfy and the room had wonderful touches with a book shelf and wet bar. The hotel feels like you stepped right back into the 1920s. And the location is fantastic!! Within walking distance of several of the great neighborhoods - we never had to take a cab. Also, we ate dinner at the Fireside Room our first night there and it was wonderful. The crab cake was divine! I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Seattle and recommend it to everyone!

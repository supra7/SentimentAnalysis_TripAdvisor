My mother and I stayed here the night before embarking on a cruise. The staff was friendly, helpful and informative, and the service was efficient, without having to wait for someone to help us. Our room was very clean and spacious as well. We were very pleased to have found this hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an all around upscale experience!

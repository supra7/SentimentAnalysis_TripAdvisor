This place was really great. It was expensive, but you can't beat the fact that they had L'Occitaine bath products. Room service was great, the bed was amazing and the hotel was centrally located downtown to most of the waterfront activities. Taxi and public transportation was all easy to find and use in this city. There are a lot of really cool, different neighborhoods/ areas in Seattle.

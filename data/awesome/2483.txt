We enjoyed our three-day stay here immensely. Within walking distance, you can find a large drugstore, good restaurants, a downtown shopping mall, the monorail to the Space Needle and it's within a doable walking distance to Pike Place Market. Their on-premises 5th Street Cafe had excellent food. Starbucks coffee shops close by and Starbucks coffee for your in-room coffee maker. The staff was courteous and friendly. On our first night in Seattle, having arrived by Amtrak from LA, we had a bad experience at another hotel we had previously booked on line and Westin allowed us to check in at 9 am at no extra charge.

We stayed at SMB from Dec 11/11-Dec18/11 for our Honeymoon. We stayed in a third floor, partial ocean view room (Villa 15). This was our 4th trip south together and have also traveled by ourselves. We have stayed at another Secrets brand two years ago, SSS. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at SMB. The service, staff and amenities were superb. Freddy at World Caf breakfasts did an amazing job! In comparison to SSS I would have to say that the food was better at SSS  not to say that SMB had bad food it was delicious. However SMB wins over SSS for best beach- it was spectacular. I really enjoyed that the beach and pool lounge chairs had pads on them. This may not mean much to you, but after laying on them all week, you appreciate the cushion! Also we always enjoy the top shelf liquors and excellent service. They do make you truly feel at home. We would return again to SMB in a heartbeat! If you go, you will enjoy it. I am not sure that I would pay the extra money for a swim out room or prestige clubyou spend most of your time at the beach/pool.

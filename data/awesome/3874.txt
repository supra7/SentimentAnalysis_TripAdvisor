We had not been before nor had we spoken to anyone before booking, so we did not know what to expect. It surpassed all of our expectations - food was great, drinks were top shelf and they did not stiff you at all, the service was impeccable, all of the staff was super friendly, there was tons to do, the rooms were clean and very nice, and our wedding went amazing. I was especially concerned planning a wedding from home mainly over email, but it went smoothly and the night was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an awesome and reasonable vacation, whether to relax or party, which was our main reason!

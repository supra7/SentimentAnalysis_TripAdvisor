Our first Embassy Suites experience. What a great surprise. The room really was a suite - meaning separate living room and bedroom. My husband gets up much earlier than me and he could just close the door to the bedroom! Other "suites" we have booked, at different hotels, are sometimes nothing more than one big room with a half wall dividing it. It had a fridge and a microwave, too. You can go down to a "welcoming party" in the atrium each evening for snacks and pop or cocktails (free). The breakfast comes with an omlet station, eggs, pancakes, hashbrowns, bacon, fruit, breads, juices, coffee all included in the hotel rate. It was pretty darn good, too. We will be looking to book more Embassy Suites in the future!

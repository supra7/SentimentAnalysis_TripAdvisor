I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for top-notch service in an exquisite setting. The staff is friendly and accomodating and the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. I have stayed in other Caribbean all-inclusives before and Secrets Maroma Beach blows them all away. The beach is pristine, the pool is large and beautiful and the food was terrific. Nearly everything we ate was delicious and the resort provides those extra touches, like a sushi cart and ice cream passed out to guests around the pool and 24-hour room service, that make it a exceptional experience. The cocktails were well-made (try a frozen mojito!) and the bars offered a variety of top-shelf liquors as well as several types of beer, which is a nice touch at an all-inclusive resort. Our room (a partial view junior suite) did have a view of the ocean (4th floor) and was clean and well-maintained. The nightclub (open till 1 am) played some dated music but was still a fun place to end the evening. This resort exceeded our expectations in so many ways and we will go back as soon as we can!

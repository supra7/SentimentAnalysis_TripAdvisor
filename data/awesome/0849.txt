Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for a few days at the end of October. We got a complimentary upgrade to one of the rooms on the Priority Club floor. Our room was HUGE with a fantastic view of the whole city. The room was very clean, and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on in a hotel. A light breakfast was provided in the morning, not much of a variety, but it was sufficient enough to fill our bellys til we could have our "real" breakfast down at Pike's place. The Light rail/bus station was 3 blocks from the hotel, a big plus since we didn't have a rental car. Seattle has the best and most convenient public transportation system! The hotel is pretty much walking distance to any attraction, shopping, or resturant that you might want to go to. I didn't have too much interaction with staff, but what interaction I did have was very friendly. There is a airline check-in kiosk in the lobby that you can print your boarding passes from. Overall a very convenient and comfortable hotel to stay in!

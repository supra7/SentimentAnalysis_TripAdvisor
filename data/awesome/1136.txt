Mayflower Park Hotel is a rare find in the busy downtown area of Seattle. I stay in a lot of Hiltons and Sheritons around the world and this historic hotel beats them all. The staff was very friendly and helpful and available at all times. I stayed here on business but this would be the perfect place to vaction with your spouse or family. Although they have excellent resturants in the hotel, you are surrounded by some of the best dining Seattle has to offer. Shopping at the Westlake Center is easy as it is connected to the hotel. The elevated rail to the Seattle Center has a stop next door. The Waterfront Area and Pike Street Market is a short pleasant walk of a few blocks. Overall, you can't beat this place for your next stay in Seattle!

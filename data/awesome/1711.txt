We had a fabulous stay at the Sheraton in Downtown Seattle. We stayed in the remodeled Union Tower in a King corner room. The room was decorated in shades of chocolate brown, caramel & cream, very tasteful, roomy & clean. The staff was helpful & courteous. This hotel is within walking distance of many of the things to do in downtown Seattle. We had a fabulous weekend & would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the downtown area.

Fabulous personnel and personal care. We had a corner room (paid extra for it) which was fabulous. Location was pretty good and for a smaller hotel good service. Parking cost was excessive at $34 per day plus taxes which came to $42 per day all in. Tulio's is a terrific restaurant in the hotel. Great for breakfast and dinner. Menu a little restricted, but lots of nearby places to go. Wifi fair. Great Service hotel.

My husband and 6 month old baby girl stayed here July 14-16, 2006. We LOVED the room, very spacious and clean, and we really liked the all-white sheets and duvet cover. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the requested crib for our daughter was delivered immediately after check-in. The free breakfast was great and so nice to have after being on the road for a week and a half--it saved us a trip out to pick up breakfast. One nice plus is the beautiful park directly across the street from the Hampton Inn. On the night we arrived, we didn't feel like going out with the baby and wanted to stay close. We took a walk over to the park and there was "Shakespere in the Park" going on, with a huge crowd, and a beautiful lake just beyond. We said that each time we're in Seattle before flying out of SEATAC after visiting family in central WA, we're staying at this Hampton Inn.

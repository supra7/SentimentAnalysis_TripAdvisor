My husband and I have stayed at several all inclusives in the Carribean but nothing comes close to Secrets, it's in a league of it's own. This was also the first time we had stayed in one place for 14 nights so it had to be good. We needn't have worried - the rooms were very comfortable ,the beach was magnificent and the pool areas very well kept and inviting, there was always somewhere to sit even if you come down mid-morning. The food was superb, we sampled all the restaurants but liked the Oceana the best, but every meal was special. The Service was in a class of its own, everybody smiled and went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. Altogether a wonderful holiday,thank you Secrets we are already planning a return trip! I should add that I'm a very critical traveller and not usually given to such lavish praise. Our only ctiticism would be the watersports centre which was an Aquaworld franchise.The trips were expensive and the staff asked for tips before you had even got into a sailing boat - perhaps Secrets should take this in-house?

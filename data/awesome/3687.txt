We have had 5 different stays at resorts in this area or mexico (secrets maroma twice.) We keep comparing secrets to all others bc of their superb customer service, awesome beach and very friendly activity staff. This resort is above and beyond all others went to do far! The food is pretty great when looking at the others as well along with the spa. We just came back from Mexico this week and wish we wouldve booked with secrets instead. Thanks for being such a great resort and we will for sure see you soon!

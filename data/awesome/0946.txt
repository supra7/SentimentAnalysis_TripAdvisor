Yes, this hotel is a bit older and lacks an elevator and the quirks of being an older building, but we were very happy that we chose the Marqueen during our 4 night/5 day sightseeing of Seattle. Our room was more like a small apartment, consisting of a small kitchenette with a booth for eating, a room with our beds and a tv and a separate sitting area with a chair and a love seat. It was perfect because it allowed us to spread out a bit and really relax during the time we were in the room. The first night it was a bit loud outside and I had trouble sleeping, but that was because the temperature was such that the AC didn't run, and I'm used to sleeping with a fan... the problem was easily resolved by just turning the AC fan on for the rest of our stay. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. The one doorman in particular (which I caught his name) was great with directions and helping with bags, etc. The hotel was also in a great location-- out of downtown, but an easy walk to Seattle Center and the monorail, with lots of bus routes nearby. I'm not going to lie though, we did tons of walking-- bring your walking shoes :) Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel and would stay again, as well as recommend it. If you're expecting the Four Seasons or the Hilton, you may be disappointed. But if you're okay with some charm and have realistic expectations of a building build in 1918, Marqueen is the place for you.

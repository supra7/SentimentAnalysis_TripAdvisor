First, I went to the resort for a relaxing vacation with my husband. We both work long hours at high stress jobs so the purpose of the trip was to relax on the beach. If you are considering this hotel, you know the benefits of an all inclusive and have read tons of other reviews. Let me tell you the things that stood out to us that some of the other reviews did not touch on: The Property - The overall feeling of the resort is much more high end than some others we have been to. No cheesy comforters or super-themed dcor. The buildings and grounds are immaculate and the staff is up early every morning cleaning. It feels very high-end and spa like. Its also the perfect size, not too huge but large enough that you can people watch! Service - The service was truly amazing. From the check in, to the concierge (we were in the Preferred Club) to the wait staff everyone was extremely attentive to our needs. Safety - We were a little hesitant to go to Mexico but felt completely safe, easy ride from the Cancun airport. We took private transportation - highly recommend this. The Food - We loved the food, but we are very adventuresome and enjoy trying new things. If you are a very basic eater - quesadillas and chicken fingers - this might not be the place for you. We loved the seafood restaurants and the passed appetizers they had around the pool in the afternoon. Also, they had plenty of bottled water in the room and at every bar and restaurant so that was not a concern. The Pool & Activities - We did not take any trips of the resort, just enjoyed the pool and the beach. The lounge chairs are super padded and comfy, the beach is nice and if you want to participate in volleyball or yoga there is a great activities staff. We also attended one of the night shows - a circus type - and it was amazing. Overall I would highly recommend this property and the Secrets brand in general.

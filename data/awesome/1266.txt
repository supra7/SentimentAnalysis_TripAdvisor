Stayed 2 nights - our first trip to Seattle in 10 years. Was super impressed with the Moore - leopard skin carpets, high ceilings, double room was larger than my previous house. The location is as good as it gets, 2 minutes from Pikes Market, heaps of eating options close by and felt like the heart of the city. Service was fine, although we rarely used them, room was spotless and for my two boys (4 and 5 yrs), it was honestly the highlight of our holiday to the NW. Highly recommended.

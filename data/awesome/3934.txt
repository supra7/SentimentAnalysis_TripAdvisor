My spouse and I recently traveled to Secrets Maroma Beach (Sept 17-24, 2011) and cannot stop talking about the experience. We have been to Mexico many times and have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts. Other resorts' food is "Let's just eat the chips" quality, while Secrets Maroma Beach provided us with food we looked forward to eating. Of course there were a couple of restaurants we did not like, but the others more than compensated for those. The service is unparalleled. We stayed in the Preferred Club and thought it was well worth the extra money. We went the the club nightly and felt like we had a personal bartender (thank you Angel). We simply cannot say enough positive thngs about this resort and its staff. We will be returning next year and staying a few extra days.

We made the reservation one day before our planned stay at the Monaco, Seattle, and they told us that the only room available is a room with a king bed. I asked if they can upgrade it to two queen beds and they told us they will do their best to accommodate our request. And to our suprise, at our registration, they automatically, upgraded our room to our need and they we very welcoming and inviting. Thank you all staff.

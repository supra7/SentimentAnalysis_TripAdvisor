I booked a stay at the Edgewater by complete surprise as it was a Priceline Name-Your-Bid pick. I am so pleased that we were able to stay here and that Priceline matched us with the Edgewater. It was everything we could have hoped for a night's stay in Seattle. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The views from the pier were stellar. We had a really comfortable room on the top floor and I loved having the fireplace even on a summer's night. It makes for a really cozy stay! We definitely got what we asked for: Four-Star hotel in Downtown Seattle! Now I know I can stay at the Edgewater when I'm in Seattle next time!

My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma for 9nights in June for our honeymoon. We stayed in Preferred Club building 16 on the first floor with the swim out room. We used the pool EVERY day. Our room didn't get a lot of sun on the porch area, but it was great for an afternoon or evening swim after dinner or a long day at the beach! We loved the preferred club lounge, great for the internet, snacks, and great drinks!! Restaurants were excellent, even the buffet was wonderful!! I heard a lot of mixed reviews on the mexican restaurant but it just happened to be our favorite. The steak was delicious. Room service was also great. I ordered at least a snack at least every other day! They will deliver practically anything to you within reason as long as you are specific as to what you would like. We went into Playa Del Carmen one day (23$ cab ride each way from the resort). We had been there before but just wanted to get out and walk around for the day. If you aren't up for shopping, don't go! We also did a snorkeling/catamaran trip we booked through American Express. It wasn't our favorite. It was at the marina right down the street from the resort. It took longer to get in and out of there because the transportation was so disorganized then it actually did to snorkel for 3hrs. (Keep in mind it was only a 10min ride from Secrets!) We WONT be doing that again. Beach is beautiful!!! We only used the large pool once.... We rented beach beds 2 days we were there and it was worth every penny they charge!! We didn't move all day!! I would absolutely return to this resort again and again. Thanks to the wonderful staff for a great trip!!

This hotel has everything, a perfect location in the heart of Seattle, fantastic rooms, great views and very good service. The atmosphere of this property is very special with chill out music on the floors and a very cool and stylish interior. If you stay there, check out lounge and have a few cocktails! The only downsite I've recognized are the high parking costs.

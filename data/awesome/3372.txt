I'm a very frequent visitor to Seattle for business, and my needs require me staying near the airport. I enjoy the fact that with the new light rail station at SEA open, it is easy for me to walk from the terminal to the light rail and across International Blvd on a convenient sky bridge right to the base of the Hilton Hotel. This is all under cover except about a block from the skybridge entrance to the hotel. Sure, some walking is involved, but it beats waiting in the dismal dingy shuttle van corridor for a hotel ride any day - even in the rain! Staff are always friendly, courteous and helpful. The flavored ice water and apples in the front desk area is also a welcome relief after a long flight. Hotel is updated and fresh in decor. Rooms are comfortable and above the normal standard for Hilton in terms of bedding, wi-fi speed (at the typical pricing structure) and amenities. The restaurant on premises is Spencers Steak House. It is a nice restaurant but rather overpriced. However, there are other things available in the general area. There is a breakfast kiosk with Starbucks coffee and lighter breakfast items which is nice for a quick morning departure. I am normally picked up by work colleagues and the location on International Blvd is also convenient for traffic coming and going in either direction on the busy main drag. Overall a wonderful hotel with fine service, best airport location and good night sleep!

Stayed at the W Seattle with my fiance in April 2005. We really liked it. In fact, I can't think of any negatives! We booked the room online at the Starwood website and got a GREAT deal...far less expensive than one usually pays to stay at a W Hotel. The entire hotel is very stylish and fun. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the city. The linens & towels were great--soft, good quality. The bed was also really comfy. The only glitch that I can speak of occurred on our first night. We hung out in the bar and ordered an appetizer to snack on. Something in the kitchen got screwed up and our order (which was pretty simple) ended up taking over 30 mins to get to us. The bar staff was really apologetic about it. Later, we ordered a dessert to share--same story, kitchen problems. Long story short, the staff were very kind and seemed really embarassed about it. They comped us both the app and the dessert. We left the bar pretty happy and left the bartenders a good tip. I would definately recommend the W for anyone who wants to stay someplace fun and different that has a good vibe and great style.

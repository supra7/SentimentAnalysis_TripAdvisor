Whenever i go to Seattle ..either Business or Pleasure i always stay at the Monaco. The rooms are great, the beds are heavenly and the extras they have are perfect!. They also have an evening wine hour, morning coffee. Sazarec's food is amazing too. The location is great , you can walk to just about anything in the downtown core. The staff are always happy and they have the best guys on the front door who make you feel like you are coming home each and everytime. I will always stay at the Hotel Monaco and would never hesiate to recommend it !

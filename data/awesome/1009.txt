Remember Eloise, the little girl in the children's books who lived in the Plaza Hotel in New York? Well, I wish that was me, and I wish the hotel were the Mayflower Park. I was in Seattle for a ginormous conference in the Conference Center; I was avoiding sprawling conference sites like the plague. I wanted peace. Elegance. Beauty. Quiet. All that I got at the Mayflower. Andrew S.in reservations handled my complicated reservation without blinking. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. The hotel is quaint, elegant, not too big (12 floors), next to Nordstrom flagship store, short walk to Pike Place, about 10 minutes from the convention center... what's not to love? Plus that, I am pretty neurotic when it comes to sound, but the hotel was really very quiet, with minimal street noise. Oh, and Andalucca--a first rate Mediterranean restaurant is on the first floor. After the conference, my oldest friend (from grade three) drove down from Vancouver to spend a day visiting with me, and she found the hotel every bit as perfect. Thank you, Mayflower, for a truly wonderful stay. It was heaven.

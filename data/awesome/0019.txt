Wonderful stay, clean & nice room (had a coffee maker, frig & microwave). No complaints on my room at all. The staff were Terrific!! Very helpful with double checking my directions and even finding better & faster ways for my routes. The hotel is in a great location (right by the mall & 95) -- The pool was a bit small but the pantry came in handy! I would definitely stay here again!

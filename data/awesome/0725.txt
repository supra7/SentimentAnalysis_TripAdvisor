Just arrived home from our trip to Seattle. We had a wonderful time at this hotel. We had reserved a partial water view room and were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a 7th floor townhome suite with a dramatic panoramic view of Elliott Bay. Absolutely spectacular ! We didn't touch our car for 3 days. Everything was close, and we also took advantage of the free bus line that stops at the end of the block. We ate breakfast at Baccos (next door) where the staff was very friendly. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this hotel !

I was quite surprise when we got the the hotel the manager on duty did upgrade us to a higher floor where we had great view of the skyline and space needle. She did empathize with me about the fact that the address is not recognized in some GPS, bringing you in a residential neighbourhood instead of downtown Seattle. I wish they would have told me that when I made the reservation saving me a 30 minutes of chaos in a new city. Nonetheless, we had a great time and it was a walking distance from Pike Place Market. I am planning to go back with my boyfriend first week of November.

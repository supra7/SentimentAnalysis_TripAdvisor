The Moore Hotel is an old funky hotel that was clean and comfortable. We had 2 queen beds (3 of us stayed there), and our room was quite large. The bathroom was a decent size with a shower. Some rooms share baths, but our on the 5th floor did not. We opened onto the street but were not disturbed by noise. The people who ran the desk - particularly Robert, Liz and Emily - were amazingly friendly and helpful. Robert gave us restaurant tips and seemed to make his choices after he talked with us a bit and could tell what we might be interested in. The service from all 3 was warm and friendly. We felt right at home. The location (on the edge of Belltown) was great for dinner at night and the Market and sightseeing during the day. We will definitely stay here again.

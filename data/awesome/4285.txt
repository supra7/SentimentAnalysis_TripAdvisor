My husband and I spent 5 days at Secrets Maroma Beach and had an absolutely amazing time!! The staff was fabulous, the food was fantastic and the property was gorgeous. We were able to enjoy a couple hours at the spa, which is by far the most beautiful spa I have ever been to!! The fitness center had everything we needed to get ina few workouts while we were there, too. We were very impressed with all of the food - we had severl 5 star uality dinners and loved the lunch by the pool each day. We loved playing pool volleyball with Sebastian. Kevin was always at the pool to help us get the perfect spot to sit each day. Uzeil was always coming by to see how we were and to rope us into the next activity (including American Idol, which was SO much fun!) I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about the resort and the staff!! We will definitely be back.

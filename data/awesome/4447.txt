My Husband and I travel around 3-4 times a winter (Cleveland weather, yuck), rarely stay at a resort lower than a 5 Apple (Apple Vacations) and rarely at the same resort twice. Secrets Maroma will be one of those rare times. The resort beautiful and the service even better. At most all-inclusives the food is ok here it was better than all we've been at. Even the house wine was of good quality. From Yuri taking care of us at breakfast to Paulino bring us drinks around the pool everything was supurb. Thank you all.

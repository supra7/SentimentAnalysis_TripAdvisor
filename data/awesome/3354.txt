Stayed here one night and was very surprised and impressed with the service from the staff. Although this appears to be be an old hotel a recent upgrade has resulted in a modern clean comfortable feel. Housekeeping clearly take pride in their work, the room was spotless! Rooms are very comfortable and modern, big flat screen TV, and all the usual necessities. I got to my room around 11pm and ordered room service which, although expensive, was good quality and arrived relatively quickly. The service from this hotel was outstanding, when I arrived in my room the air-con was VERY noisy, also the iron in the room did not operate without sticking to my clothes. I called the desk not expecting them to really being able to do anything as it was almost midnight, within 5 minutes there were two knocks at the door, the first a guy with a brand new iron, the second was a maintenance guy who was able get the noise down considerable, he told me if I wasn't happy they would move me to another room. Breakfast in the morning at Spencer's was very good, a great espresso and probably the best scrambled eggs I have seen in a buffet! Only down side to this hotel was the enormous walk if you want to go anywhere, if you are parking your car here, I would suggest parking it in the public lot opposite the hotel and ask for a room close to the lobby.

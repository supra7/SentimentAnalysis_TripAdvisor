I will keep this review short and sweet. My husband and I stayed at The Inn at the Market 1 night before we were getting on a cruise to Alaska. Like other reviews have stated, from the moment you pull up to the valet there is someone there to assist, greet, and make you feel 'that special something' that only a certain level of customer service can provide. ALL of the staff went above and beyond for us. It happened to be my birthday and we were upgraded to the 2 story condo.....and there was cupcakes waiting for us...incredible!! The roof-top deck is SO beautiful!! I highly recommend you bring a nice glass of wine, and that special someone up there with you to see the sunset.....again incredible. The beds were great, the view amazing and the overall feel of the Inn is very special. Thank you to everyone at The Inn at the Market for making our stay so wonderful. Autumn and Lenny

The breakfast buffet offered a variety like none other we have experienced! The staff is friendly and eager to please. Chefs bringing samples of food to the pool area throughout the day was a special treat! The eight restaurants offerings make a unique Mexican experience. The beach is beautiful and was not hot on the feet! Unbelievable! While we did not use the 24-hour room service, we were impressed it was offered. You will not be disappointed!

Good location - halfway between Pike's Market and Seattle Center. But that also means you need to walk to get to either one. Room was fine. Older, nothing fancy, kinda tight for a family of five. Nice to have a fridge. Quiet at night. Very helpful and friendly staff at the front desk - they gave us lots of local suggestions for restaurants and activities. Two computers in the lobby available to guests. Handy! Our view was across a parking lot to the 'Gentleman's Club' across the street. We didn't explain what that was about to the kids. :)

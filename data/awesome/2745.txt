This hotel was the most reasonably price in Seattle for its category and its outstanding downtown location. The nice extras include an evening wine reception and all-day superb coffee in the lobby. One of the best restaurants in Seattle is right next to the lobby, Tulio's. My bargain-priced room was small but perfectly clean and gleaming, modern design, well lighted, elegant furnishings with professional decor and a super-comfortable bed. The staff was attentive to requests and delivered gracious extra help that surprised me. The lobby area is intimate with plush seating to sit and read a book or chat with a friend. I definitely received a boutique hotel experience and the staff seemed to take pride in offering it. On the second night I upgraded to a more expensive room and it was very large and lovely with a gorgeous view of the nighttime lights of downtown buildings. This hotel offers far more for the price than I would have expected, and if anything isn't right it seems they can't wait to solve it for you. That's why I will return. One detail: for free Wi-Fi (normally $10) you must be a "Kimpton Member," so just go online to Kimpton's website and sign up for free membership.

We stayed at Secrets from Dec. 7th through the 12th. We couldn't have been more pleased with our trip! It is absolute paradise. Every positive review written is exactly true. Beautiful resort and grounds, breathtaking beach, fabulous room with very comfy bed, top-notch service, and wonderful food. We were treated like royalty. It was the best vacation we have ever taken. Building 26, room 2630, had a great view. Our concierge, Carlos, worked very hard and took excellent care of us. We paid extra for the preferred club. While we had a great view, internet access in our room, and a private check-in, we did not use the private lounge much as there was no need. There is plenty to drink and eat out by the pool and any restaurant. Not sure we would do preferred club again but we are already planning when we can return!

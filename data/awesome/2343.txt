Wonderfully comfortable accommodations. Other hotels in Seattle on the other side of I5 and are all hustle and flow--Sorrento is not a formula hotel. Genuine warm reception from the lobby bar, front door/valet parking, concierge, and reception desk staff (much better than the Olympic or Sheraton). Even the cleaning staff will seek to assist guests. Room interior appointments were charming and very clean. Will stay there again anytime, might try Room 608, the Sleepless in Seattle room. This is the only hotel in Seattle where I slept well.

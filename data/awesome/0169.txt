A friend and I were stranded in Seattle with my two miniature dachshunds and needed a place to stay that not only had a jacuzzi tube in room for us girls but that had a room big enough for the pups to enjoy luxury as well. The Monaco staff was super accommodating and excited to meet the pups. They had a board with all the dogs that were staying in the hotel and a cookie jar full of treats! Our room was the end corner unit so there was plenty of privacy and there was more than enough space for the pups to spread their legs to relax. The room service was extremely delicious. The only negative was that my friend decided to open the $10 razor in the goodie basket before looking at the price! So not really a negative towards the hotel but just a heads up for travelers! The extra plus was getting free wine at the attached restaurant!

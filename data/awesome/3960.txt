My husband and I visited Secrets Maroma Beach for the fourth time in late Aug/early Sept. It really just keeps getting better! We didn't arrive at the resort until after 11:00 PM due to plane "electrical problems" but had no problems getting checked in quickly and efficiently and taken to our room. This is the first time we reserved a swimout and were happy we did. We really enjoyed it! The grounds have grown so lush with the beautiful tropical vegetation that the swimouts are a lot more private then they were when the resort first opened. Our first visit was about about 2 months after the resort first opened and we have returned yearly since then. We didn't get to all the restaurants this time but did enjoy Portofino, Bordeaux, Himitsu, Oceana, and of course the World Cafe for breakfast. Barefoot Grill is our favorite lunch spot. I think the already very good food might even be getting better!! We really love everything about this place but our biggest reason for returning every year is the wonderful staff. We look forward to seeing the friends we have made over the years. They are hardworking, warm, friendly, interesting people who go out of their way to make your vacation the best it can possibly be. You will receive great service no matter what, but if you are able, please be generous and tip them. It is greatly appreciated and can make a big difference in their lives. Paulo, Ana, Aricela, Galbina, and our new friends Yazmin and Alberto we are looking forward once again to returning to see you and all of your wonderful co-workers at Secrets Maroma Beach next year!!! We'll be back!!

Amazing. Best resort we have ever been to. Traveled Dominican, Bahamas, Mexico, and more and have not stayed in a better place. Service hands down best you can find. Great pools, privacy, food and atmosphere. Staff opens doors before you even think of walking through one. At one point during the vacation I said to my husband while laying at the pool that I wanted something plain and American like a deli sandwich, not even three minutes later a staff member walked by offering ham and cheese on white bread...how much more plain can that get? They read your mind at this resort and it is excellent!

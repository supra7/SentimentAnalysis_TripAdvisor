We went to Secrets Maroma for our honeymoon last year and returned again this year because it was such a great experience. The staff is friendly and they wait on you non-stop. Anything you want - all you have to do is ask. The facillities are clean and very well kept. The rooms are large, very comfortable, and clean. The grounds are pristine and the beach is fantastic. There are various choices for dinner at the many restaurants on the resort and they are all delicious. You never need a reservation unless you want to book a special dinner. We recommend the wine cellar dinner at the french restaurant. The entertainment group always has something for the guests to do and they get people involved - watersports, beach & pool volleyball, soccer etc. There is a nightlife too. If you don't want to leave the resort for activities there is plenty to do. We will definetly return!

From first arrival until the day we left, we had the time of our lives. The resort was so well kept, the staff was amazing and truly had a desire to help and serve you. We never wanted for anything because all we had to do was ask for it! The pool is great, the beach is amazing. The food is well above average with some restaurants truly out of this world. The pool side is the place to be during the day...want a drink? They are there to serve you or you can hit the swim up bar. You want food? There is a seaside buffett or you can head to several other sit down restaurants. Don't want to get up? No worries...you can either wait for the pool side chefs to serve you or you can order through the waitress...want something off the menu? NO problems!! We cannot say enough. It truly was an amazing experience for the entire 10 days we were there...if something could go wrong, it would have over that long a stay. Need to exercice? Great gym...bball courts...tennis courts...long walks or runs on the beach. They have it all. Easy to book excursions, although we had a hard time leaving the resort. As far as safety...no worries here. Everything felt comfortable and safe on and off the resort. 10 stars...you need to experience this place.

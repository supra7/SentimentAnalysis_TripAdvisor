When the employees at Secrets Maroma tell you that you are family and "Welcome Home", they are not lying. I am not a traveler who stays in all-inclusive resorts - but with this one I have no complaints. Everything you needed, from your room to great hospitality was there - with a lot of fun added on. If you wanted to get away the spa was to die for. All the staff were friendly and eager to teach you some Spanish, hang out with you or give you some tips about travelling around the area. There was great snorkelling, wonderful food - and all the rest and relaxation I needed. If you are a group of friends, a couple or just want some alone time to yourself at a fabulous resort - I would highly recommend Secrets Maroma. Yes, the prices are steep but worth every last Peso or Penny!

I've previously stayed at the Pan Pacific in Seattle and stopped staying there because it had no heart and soul. I figured I'd give the Hotel Vintage Park a shot this trip because I liked the location and love Kimpton properties. I was not disappointed. Upon arrival, the cozy but elegant lobby was warm and inviting on a cold Seattle Sunday. I went to the front desk to see about checking in early. Not only did they check me in early but they gave me an upgrade from a 1 queen room to a 1 king room with a sitting area. Thanks! I enjoyed the fresh water with lemons in the lobby all day and the wine tasting at night. When I was there, both nights, the vineyard itself came to the hotel to do the tasting. Classy! They also had hot toddy's as it was cold. The room was fresh, elegant and eclectic. It was comfortable and while a few things (like brass fixtures on the door) were a bit out of date but most of the furnishings, carpet, wallpaper, etc., were very modern and stylish. The bed was super comfortable and I slept great. I loved having three windows with a nice view (room #810). An added bonus is the amazing mini-bar with delightful drinks, snacks and sundries. The chocolate covered bananas were delicious. The turn-down service was wonderful and surprising for the price I paid. Housekeeping was stellar as well. In responding to other reviewers, I noted no unusual smells, the fixtures (including lots of granite) were top notch. This is an eclectic property but should appeal to all except for those who think a mall hotel is nirvana. This property is a delight as it is affordable, well located, well furnished and the staff sets it apart. I can't recommend it more!

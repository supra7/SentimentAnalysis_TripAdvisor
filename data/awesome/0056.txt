Stayed at the Hotel Monaco on 11/27 and wanted to share my experience. First off, I stayed at the Monaco in Salt Lake CIty some time ago and really enjoyed it as I was traveling with my dog and it was quite accomodating. For the Seattle location I was celebrating an anniversaru with my girlfriend of one year. We went with an upgraded room with a soaking tub which was awesome. Room was immaculate and comfortable. Plus, the staff left a bottle of chilled champagne on ice for us in honor of our celebration. Only stayed one night but would have loved to stay more. Definitely check out wine hour in the lobby 5-6 as its a lot of fun.

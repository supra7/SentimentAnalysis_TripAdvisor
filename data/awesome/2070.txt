This hotel is located right over the water of the sound. We chose a a full waterfront room. The northwesat theme of the hotel and rooms makes for a veritable little retreat. We were viewing the wildlife of the ocean including sea otters, seals, huge jellyfish and big fish of all sorts in the water from our window. To the right of us within a100 yards cruise ships were docking all weekend. Dont be afraid to get the rooms closest to the cruise ship terminal because it is still very quiet. The ships are completely quite when entering and leaving the dock. During the day we were treated to the normal boat traffic and business of the port which was interesting in and of itself. At night the lights from the loading docks way across from us danced on the the water and made shimmers on the waves just like the moonlight. The windows in the hotel open without screens and let the seabreeze air in. I slept like a baby every night! If you cant afford the full waterview the city view is still worthwhile in that the lobby is beautifully furnished with a classy northwest decor and floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views.Even the restaurant was very very good for breakfast and dinner. It also featured non stop windows with the sea and mountains beckoning and both indoor and outdoor seating. We ate breakfast outdoors on the deck and it was just perfect perfect. WOW. Staff is friendly and willing to go the extra distance for you.

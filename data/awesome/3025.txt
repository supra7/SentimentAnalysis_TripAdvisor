The hotel was was nothing but conventient and affordable. Just down the street from all the downtown shopping, dining and attractions such as the space needle, pikes place market and some shopping malls. The service at the hotel was verry efficient and friendly. The food at the sushi bar was very memorable. The only down side are the small rooms and elevators. But oh well, didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Overall very clean and comfortable.

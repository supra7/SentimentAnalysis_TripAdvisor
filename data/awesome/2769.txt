Pros: 1. Location in downtown Seattle close to everything 2. Very friendly and helpful staff 3. Clean, well designed rooms with nice bathrooms and quality features. Also very quiet, never heard noise from the hallway or other rooms. 4. Value. We got our room for $100 during Christmas weak 5. Complimentary coffee in the morning and wine tasting at night 6. Free, fast Wi-fi. This should be standard for hotels but some still charge Cons: 1. No drawers to put clothes 2. The fitness center is very small, only 3 pieces of cardio equipment Overall: I would rate this a 4.5, but since I can't I will bump to 5 based on the value, location, and generally pleasant feeling of being in the hotel.

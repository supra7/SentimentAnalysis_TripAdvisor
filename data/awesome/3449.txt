This is a really nice hotel and excellent value for money. I knew what to expect after being on this site but my friends were walking past and saying this place looks nice and I had the delight to tell them it was where we were staying! We had large rooms on the 3rd floor facing the road, all very modern and clean with great shower so was right up out street. The staff are very friendly too, as was almost everyone we met in Berlin. If you're looking for cafe's restaurants local then the area around Nollendorf Platz is the place to go, Maassenstrasse has some nice place to eat al fresco. If we come to Berlin again we'd definitely book here again.

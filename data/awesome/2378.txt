This is how a hotel is suppose to operate. Best service and ambiance of a large hotel since the Palmer House in Chicago, which is tops. Located three blocks from Pike Place Market, this conference hotel does it right. Though it has nearly 900 rooms, it operates like a much smaller hotel because it has numerous elevators, helpful personnel, and creates an atmosphere that says "we're glad you are here." We were at an international maritime conference and stayed five nights, six days. From the moment they greeted us at the curb to put our luggage in storage until our room was ready to checkout, the staff was primed and ready. And actually smiled, a trait some hotels need to teach their personnel. I'd stay here on my own dime, not just business. Only knock is the $7.95 charge for 15 minutes of computer.

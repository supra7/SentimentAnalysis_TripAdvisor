We were thrilled to get a reservation and water view room at The Edgewater Hotel in Seattle. This hotel is beautifully decorated, super clean and very comfortable. The service is impeccable, the room was superb, and the food and beverage is delicious. Our Front Desk Agent, Emily, could not have been more kind and efficient. She handled every detail of our stay to ensure we were very happy. We loved it so much that we extended our trip for an additional night. We can hardly wait to get back to the Edgewater hotel to relax and enjoy the extraordinary service of the entire staff. Thank you. Stella & Richard Livoni, San Diego

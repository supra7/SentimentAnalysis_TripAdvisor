I choose this hotel as I had a friend staying here as well. On whole the stay was super. The staff treated me with class. Every interaction was professional. I am in a wheelchair so dealing with the hill meant using cabs. BTW Seattle finally has accessible taxis, for most of the time I lived in Seattle there weren't any and you to rely on Metro. The food at the hotel was superb, I had a marvelous burger and the clam chowder was super. I was served by room service and the staff was gracious at all times. The Laundry svc was great as they did a short notice pair slacks in and back in four hours! A note on the accessible rooms. I stayed in a dbl queen and king and they both were a bit narrow between the desk and front of the bed. The bathrooms were large but lacked sufficient grab bars at the tub and toilet. Made transferring very difficult and unsafe. In addition I would upgrade the bath seats to sturdier models. I would return as I loved the beds they were an oaisis! I will stay again overall a great time. Loved the art in the lobby bar and the great photos in the rooms.

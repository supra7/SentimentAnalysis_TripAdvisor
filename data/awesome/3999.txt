We were at Secrets Maroma from Aug. 20 - 27th. It exceeded my expectations. From the moment you arrive, you are treated wonderfully. We were met with a drink and taken to the preferred check in. We were not bothered regarding time share and were taken to our room by Carlos after a quick drink at the bar. We had a swim out in building 26. The room was amazing. Well stocked mini bar, never had a problem with the AC, in fact kept turning it down as it was getting a little cool. The pool was awesome and never had a problem getting chairs in our desired location at the infinity pool. The food delivered by the chefs was nice. We ate in the Seaside Grill 3 times and the grilled shrimp was good. Tried all the a la cartes except the Mexican. They were all exceptional. The beach was nice...try the swing bar. Spent most nights at the Lobby Bar and it was open well past 10pm. Had room service once for breakfast and once for dinner. Arrived quickly and hot! Morning buffet was terrific. Can't tell you anything negative. Yes, had a few bug bites, but not even close to what we get here in Ontario when you go up north for the weekend. And no kids!! That was the best (and we have kids). Will definitely return, not next year, because we have to take the kids next time! I loved it. Don't listen to the bad reviews...preferred is definitely worth the little extra.

This was our second hotel in our vacation and we were delighted by how beautiful the resort really lived up to the pictures on their website. They welcome you with a hotel towel and sit you down to check in to your room. The beach area is gorgeous, it reminded me of Hawaii. The food was also very good, especially their Italian restaurant Portifino (Rogelio was great). A hidden gem is also their Coco Cafe, with Araceli. It had the best coffee drinks and roast beef sandwich. We were upgrade to the preferred lounge and really enjoyed the free internet, cocktails, and food served all day long. In the pool area, there is food passed along in trays all day long. Service is really quick for drinks. The room was spacious, beautiful, elegant, and perfect for honeymooners. When you order room service, they use a secret door so you are never interrrupted. We really didn't go to any of the entertainment events at the resort. We stayed at Secrets Maroma for 5 days and 4 nights. We loved it there and would go back in a heart beat.

We had a short stop-over in Seattle and chose to stay at this gem. No regrets at all. Wonderful rooms, great staff and service experience; very competent and helpful with good advise for both restaurants and cultural experiences. On top of that a lovely patio and perfect location. Close to Pikes Market, to the first Starbucks and life in Seattle. Don't miss this!

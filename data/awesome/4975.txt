* Arrival in Cancun - since this was our first visit, we opted for a private transfer vs. the tour companies group option. We were happy we did. The company, Cancun Transfers, had a staff member with our name outside the terminal and a vehicle waiting. With refreshments on route, arrival at the hotel was prompt (despite the bumpy road for 1/2 mile to the property). * First Impressions.....classy/elegant, yet not pretentious. From the cold towel and champagne at check in to the sincere greetings.This is an outstanding property where your satisfaction is the goal of every employee. Say high to Roberto, one of the concierge staff in Building 14. He could not do enough to ensure your stay was memorable. * Room... all of the suites are very similar. It is the location that best meets your needs that should be considered. We opted for a swim out room. The first room was adjacent to the hot tub which ran continuously and was a bit noisy. Requesting a change, they promptly offered a few options. Building 12 was the match as it had sun for 3/4 of the day which made for warm water and plenty of lounging. The building was near the main lobby and all the restaurants. Check out their on-line property map to see the various building locations. Our hot water was hot, not an issue. Internet at 54 Mbps made the Skype calls home on the iTouch easy and inexpensive. * Food - Excellent... only the Italian restaurant did not meet expectations. Everywhere else was great. We went to Oceana twice as its seafood was Outstanding. * Property-Pools-Beach.... All an A+ and never an issue to get a lounge chair. * Gym... used it daily at 7 AM or so and never an issue with obtaining equipment. Sure it is a bit small; however, it filled the need for a week. * Off property options... Free golf @ $35 + Cab = $55 is still a great deal and worth taking your clubs along.The affiliated course, Playa Paraiso golf club is only 10-15 minutes away. Overall, the test is would you go back.... YES.

For $84 including tax & service fee via Priceline this was a great deal. Airport shuttle runs 24hrs/day - my [delayed flight] arrival @ 2:15am - shuttle was waiting. Very close to airport. Check-in was fast - was given TWO cookies! - and a room in the main tower (for the least amount of walking). The room was large and comfortable. The beds were great and plenty of pillows. Room had a sink/mirror area outside the bathroom and a second sink/mirror area in the bathroom with toilet/bath/shower. Room was very quiet - no noise from street/airport or hallway. Only downside was no free Internet in the rooms - there was a wired Internet connection in the room for which you could pay by the hour; free wireless could be had by going down to the main lobby - and room service and parking (which I didn't use) would be very expensive. Hotel is within walking distance of a number of eating places.

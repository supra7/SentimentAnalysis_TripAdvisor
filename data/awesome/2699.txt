Sometimes luck of the draw is luck; picked this hotel out from hotels.com on the train into Seattle. It was great! The rooms are very comfortable -- leopard print terrycloth robes are funky! Nice location near downtown attractions. The staff was exceptional. I left my cell phone in our cab and the front desk staff got it back for me within 20 minutes. Definitely would stay there any time.

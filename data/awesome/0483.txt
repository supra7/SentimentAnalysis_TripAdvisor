Hotel is Seattle's gem. My daughter and I were having a girls vacation for her 18th birthday and high school graduation present. We had a view right into the public market and out onto the water. Beds are great and they have turn down service with chocolate, who could ask for more! Only complaint is the small shelf in the bathroom for toiletries. With two females it was not enough. The soaps are great, but the lotion they put in the rooms is divine! Already have another reservation for next month on the books. Please don't forget the roof top viewing deck for a great view, especially at sunset, but do bring a sweater or blanket.

We went here for our honeymoon in October. It was more than I had expected!! The hotel is beautiful, like a postcard. The beach is pristine and secluded. The staff treated us like royalty. It was the most relaxing vacation I hav eever been on and I would recommend this resort to anyone who wants a romantic getaway!! All the food and drink you can eat and can do as little or as much as you want. Very relaxed atmosphere. Its off the beaten path of all the other Playa hotels which I loved, not in the city of Playa which is nice and never had to be hassled by street vendors like when we traveled into town. Would absolutely go again!!!

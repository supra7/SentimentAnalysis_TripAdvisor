Having vacationed in Mexico for the past 25 years and staying at many of the resorts offered. Our stay at Secrets was by far the BEST experiences we have had. From the great service to the amazing restaurants, not to mention the gorgeous beach. This is the first time ever we could have stayed another week. We miss you already and will be coming back.

I've visited several all-inclusive resorts over the last 8 or so years and this is one of the best! The food was fantastic, drinks were delicious, resort was beautiful, but the thing that made this resort top-notch was the customer service and their attention to detail. You genuinely feel as though employees care if you're satisfied and happy on your stay. We stayed in a preferred junior swim-out suite - what a great amenity! We didn't have a view of the ocean because we were on the first floor, but it was amazing and so worth the extra fee. Also worth the extra fee are the beach cabana beds. Our beach concierge, Jamie, was AWESOME! He brought us anything and everything we needed before we even asked for it. This was one vacation I will definitely not forget and Secrets Maroma made my birthday a perfect one :-).

We worked with Dream Makers Vacation Services to book this trip. Michael McHugh was amazing and was able to make this trip so easy for us. Everything was at our finger tips. We were made aware of flight changes well in advance of our trip. Michael coordinated the new flights with several options, our transfers to and from the airport and the resort and booking our VIP stay at Secrets. The room was clean and beautiful, the service outstanding. The food at the french and italian restaurant was excellent. I would avoid the Mexican restaurant. The beach was warm, clean and beautiful. The food and beverage service at the beach was constant and they made sure they accomodated us and met to our every need. The spa was beautiful and the service outstanding. This is the first time my husband used the spa twice during one vacation. It was amazing, relaxing and just beautiful. I would certainly recommend Secrets Maroma Beach. If Mexico is not your thing, get in touch with Michael at Dream Makers - he will make great recommendations and faciliate the whole process. Thank you Michael.

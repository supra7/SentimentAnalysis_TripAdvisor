My wife and I spent one night at the Hotel Andra. We enjoyed every second of our stay from the time that we were greated by the friendly Valet until we checkedout the next day. The room was nicely laid out and clean. The flat screen was nice. The shower had a nice dispenser for the shampoo and soap. There were 2 very soft robes. A small fridgerator was stocked with water, soda, and beer if you liked. We brought our own drinks and used the fridge. We had a drink in the nice quiet lounge adjacent to the resurant. We left our car there while we walked to the Mariners game. They stored our bags until we got back. The staff was very pleasant. I'm not sure how they remebered our names. That was a nice touch. I will definately stay here again. Thanks

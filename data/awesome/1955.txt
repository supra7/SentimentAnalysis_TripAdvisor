This is our second stay at Hotel Andra - we love everything about this boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. Andra is pet-friendly and welcomed our small dog with a gift bag of dog bones! We love spending the morning in the lobby by the fireplace with treats and coffee from the Dahlia Bakery (across the street). With all of the Tom Douglas restaurants nearby, you don't have to venture far for excellent food. We enjoyed meals at Lola, Serious Pie, Etta's and the Dahlia Bakery - all great food. Location is great for downtown, Belltown and the Pike Place Market. We enjoyed and appreciated a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite - the room was perfect! Seattle is my hometown, so I know it well - and think that Hotel Andra provides a wonderful base camp!

I had a great experience. The room is clean, cute, and unique. I loved the bathroom. I actually booked my room thru Priceline and when I got to the hotel they had a good deal on parking thru their website so I asked them about it and they gave me free parking so it doesn't hurt to ask. Everywhere in Seattle you have to pay for parking so can't really complain about that. The service here was great. 6 blocks straight down to Pike's Place if that's where you really want to go. The heater in my room worked fine (a little loud but that's why man invented earplugs) and I kept my bathroom door open so the heat would get in there...kind of a no brainer. I would recommend it as it's unique to Seattle and it was a very clean hotel. Plus it has different pillows on the bed so if you want firm or soft, you have a choice!

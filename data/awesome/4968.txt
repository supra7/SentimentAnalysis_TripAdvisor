My wife and I had a great time at this all inclusive resort. The staff were very friendly and provided great service. The seven different restaurants were good with a nice variety but we really enjoyed the 24/7 room service and the minibar. The beach was one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. Really big fluffy beach towels and nice beach lounge chairs. Some of the beach lounges had broken reclining mechanisms however. Nice variety of free water sports. Great food and drink service at the beach and around the pool. We enjoyed the outdoor grill near the pool and had our lunch there most days. The chefs were always happy to make things to order. The heated pool was great on some of the cooler days. The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom facilities were very nice.

We booked Apple Adult Only Square Deal and were booked at Secrets Maroma. We couldn't have been more pleased with our accommodations! Everything was smooth from check-in on. Each building has its own concierge - very helpful! Have never had more outstanding service - all the waitstaff were extremely pleasant. We have stayed at 6 golden apple resorts before, but Secrets Maroma Beach has the rest beat!

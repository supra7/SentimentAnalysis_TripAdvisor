I looked at many places as a suitable destination for our anniversary. After a couple recommendations I decided upon Secrets Maroma Beach. I don't think we could have been happier. The grounds were immaculate, the beach fantastic, the food was great and the staff was amazing. We could have spent our entire trip on the grounds and been happy but we did take a couple tours to Mayan ruins and spent a couple wonderful days shopping in town. In all, it was one of the best trips we've taken.

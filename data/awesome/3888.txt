None of the complaints I have read about this place in the reviews can even come close to matching the positive experience my new wife and I had at SMB. Great service. GREAT FOOD. Perfect beach. Pool was fun - without being rowdy. Best part was the service - be it room service coffee in the morning, the strolling waiters and servers at the pool, the romantic dinner on the beach (worth the cost) or just about anyone there on the property. We spent our honeymoon totally relaxed in our swim-out room or at the pool/beach and didn't worry about a thing.

My husband and I went to Secrets Maroma for our anniversary 11/4/10-11/8/10 and were more than pleased with the trip! We had never done the all-inclusive thing so we tried it and are now hooked! We plan to make this an annual trip. We cannot say anything negative about our experience- and have been to some nice places! Our room was beautiful and very comfortable...ladies bring conditioner for your hair though. We were prepared to experience "Montezuma's Revenge" after hearing Mexican horror stories so we were very cautious at the resort at first but realized that we were the only ones doing that and we discovered that the resort's water filtration system is great- we never got sick at all and the food/drink is FABULOUS! Especially the pomegranate tequila (La Pinta) and the omelette bar at breakfast!! I would recommend (and have) going to Secrets Maroma for a vacation where you can absolutely unwind. Also for transportation we used Olympus and it was also very fast and reliable- well run!

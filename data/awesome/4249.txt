LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT!!! I will go back FOR sure! Its 5 star all the way. The room is great. Staff is SUPER friendly. Food -- oh my god -- AMAZING! There is nothing bad I can say about Secrets Maroma Beach! I took pics and it looks just like its pictured on their website. What the site doesnt show you is how they plan excellent activities if you want something to do, how friendly everyone is that is working and staying there, and how much variety they offer with their cuisine. Its all great. The beach is amazing. BEST beach Ive ever been to. I HIGHLY recommend it. I had preferred club access which I enjoyed but if you cant afford the upgrade, dont worry, you wont miss out on much. I was marginally disappointed that for the money spent, they dont offer a shuttle to and from the airport but they are contracted with a very pleasant and reputable taxi service which will charge between $80-$100 to and and from the airport. Also, they have an amazing SPA but it all cost extra and not within my budget after spending so much just to go there but once you're there, trust me, you wont have tension and you certainly wont need the spa! They do offer access to golfing but all at additional cost as well but I want interested in that. Check out www.cheapcarribean.com for great rates!

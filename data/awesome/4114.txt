We celebrated our 25th anniversary while staying at Secrets Maroma Beach. We have traveled to many places throughout the world and were extremely pleased with SMB. We stayed in the main building and had a huge penthouse room. We were so glad we stayed in this building. It was very quiet. The maid service was very good. We enjoyed the food and thought the entertainment was good as well. This is the choice if you are wanting to experience romance and quiet. We now realize how much more relaxing a vacation is without children. We love children, but feel like expensive, romantic vacations are no place for young ones. The pools and beach were awesome. We loved the fact that SMB does not tolerate any chair saving at their pools. We are early risers and found that the pool employees adhere to the 30 minute rule with no exceptions. This is the way it should be. If you put things on pool chairs and you are really not using them, your things will be moved after a half hour. We loved renting the beach cabana as well. It is well worth the $40/day fee. The service was awesome. Overall, we loved this resort. We cannot wait to go back in the future. Special thanks to Paulo and Kevin.....excellent service!

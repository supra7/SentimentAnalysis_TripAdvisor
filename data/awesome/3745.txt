This was a brief stay taking advantage of a special preferred rate. The place is one of the nicest we have stayed at regardless of the cost. This was September and the hotel was quite full with an amazing number of rooms blocked for group activites such as weddings and anniversaries. Primarily groups of couples and friends in 20's and 30's with parents. Amazing displays of wealth at times. Not an inexpensive hotel, but service, rooms, staff, beach, food, activities, pools, drinks, views, exercise room, sand and again service were fantastic. This was especially evident in our 1st 24 hours and may have been more special than usual because we were somehow placed in the "Preferred guest "contingent for our short stay. Only wish we could someday share this experience with our whole family....

The Warwick was so much cheaper then all the other hotels we considered in downtown Seattle. We were skeptical, but it had great reviews, so we booked. The Warwick truly is an awesome deal! Very nice looking on the inside, rooms are nicely decorated, and views of the Space Needle are an extreme value for money! The Warwick is within walking distance of pretty much everything. Even the monorail is close...oh and Macy's! The parking is expensive, but I believe this is the case in all downtown hotels within large cities. We loved everything about the Warwick, with the exception of the high speed internet...its not free...they tried to charge over $10 per day for it! Honestly, this is so common now...this should be an included amenity at all hotels. Even Super 8 offers it for free! Other then that we loved the Warwick and will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Seattle.

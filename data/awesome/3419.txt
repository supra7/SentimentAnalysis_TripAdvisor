Very nice stay. Right next to airport. Room was large, with 2 very comfortable chairs. Sleep-number bed was neat, but not the most comfortable. Very nice excersize room with several pieces of equipment. Decent indoor pool. Good customer service. Negatives: Air conditioning was very hard to control and won't fully cool during the hottest Seattle days, but those days are few and far between. No breakfast provided - for $115 they could provide a bowl of cereal, milk, OJ, and banana, but they want to charge you $15 instead. Very poor. Also, they only had one computer internet terminal, so if you don't have your own laptop it can be hard to get online. Overall very nice stay. Quiet with large room and decent amenities.

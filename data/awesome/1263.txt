Hotel was conveniently located....close to many restaurants, Pike Place Market, etc. We walked to Pioneer Place with no problem. Our room was nicely furnished, very clean and quiet. I am a single parent travelling with my young child and would stay at The Moore again without hesitation. Great value for the price.

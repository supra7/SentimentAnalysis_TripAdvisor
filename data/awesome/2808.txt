I stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park for two nights while in Seattle on business and found it to be excellent. The staff was friendly, accomodating, and fun (I was there on Halloween and they wore subtle "costumes" and had a big box of candy at the desk). The room was warm and cozy with deep colors, many lamps (no harsh overhead lights), and a comfortable bed with nice linens. The bathroom had a large granite counter and Aveda bath products. The hotel offers a complimentary local wine tasting each evening, and this was a highlight. Again, the staff was terrific and they taught us tricks you can do with wine corks and actually gave several of us full bottles of the wine we had been tasting to take with us. I don't often find myself in Seattle, but the next time I do, I will be staying at the Hotel Vintage Park again!

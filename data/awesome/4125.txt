What a great time my family and I had! It rained the first couple of days and then the sun came out. The food was great the staff was friendly. 24 hour room service and concerigne service, you cant beat it for the price compared to other places i've stayed. the beach is beautiful, didn't like the long bus ride to Aquaworld(first one on last off). better to find locals to snorkel. the shows were fun and the activity staff was great. thanks see you again

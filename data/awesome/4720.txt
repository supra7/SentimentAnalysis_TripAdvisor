Secrets Maroma Beach was great, this place is beautiful. We stayed in a ocean view preferred room and had everything we needed. Service overall was incredible. Really enjoyed the beach, nice sand and clear water. The activities team organizing the daily sports were awesome! Beach volleyball and soccer was a blast,:soccer on the beach, wow what a work out! Overall the food was pretty good, we unfortunately didn't go to the World Cafe until the last day, great breakfast there. Most mornings, we opted for room service, which out of the 3 days we ordered, 3 were great. Out of the remaining restaurants, Portofino the Italian was the best. El Patio- was very good and would recommend the flank steak. Oceana unfortunately was not too tasty, the scallops had no flavor and were overcooked. Himitsu regular dining was very good, although the night we went for the tepanyaki table it was not so so. The ginger dressing salad really needs some work, there are plenty of great recipes out there, any would be better than the one used. If lounging on the beach, order some food, everyday we did it didn't dissapoint. Also, if they bring out the grills to cook on the beach, try it. we had really tasty and fresh sea bass and salmon. In general: Beautiful place to stay Staff if very nice Plenty to do Bring your appetite Bring your thirst

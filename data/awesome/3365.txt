This was the second time my husband and I stayed at this hotel within the last couple of years. We actually booked the hotel through Priceline and were very excited when we found out that the Hilton Conference Center had accepted our $50/night bid. We spent four nights there. Each day the room was cleaned and if ever we needed anything, we made a call up to the front desk and it magically appeared. We were very pleased with the cleanliness of the entire hotel. I had dropped a nickle on the floor in the morning and had forgotten to pick it up. I was really surprised when I came back and found the nickle on the nightstand. I appreciate honest housekeepers! The exercise room is filled with Precor machines (with individual televisions and headsets) and was amazing. The pool is not heated at this time of year, but it is clean, and there is an amazing hot tub outside for the polar bears! The entire staff was great and especially the guys at the front door. They were always willing to help without being too pushy. The light rail is literally steps away from the hotel, making it very easy to get into Downtown Seattle. It's cheap, too. $5.00 round trip! Also, Washington State's largest mall, Southcenter Mall is only a few minutes away. Yes, we had to pay for parking and high speed internet access, however, since we paid such a small price for the hotel, we didn't mind the extra cost to stay here. The only thing that could have made it nicer was if they had pay per view movies that we could watch. There were plenty of television channels to choose from (DirecTV) but it would have been nice to be able to watch a movie if we had the choice.

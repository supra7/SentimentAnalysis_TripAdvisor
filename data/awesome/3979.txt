Our honeymoon was wonderful thanks to Secrets Maroma Beach. The food was wonderful the staff was wonderful and we were treated wonderful. When you first walk in the staff says welcome home and they made you feel like home. We had a great time it was very peaceful and clean. Also room service is great and they have a small door on the side of your room door so you do not even have to open your door they put the food inside which as a entry way for them and your room and you can get the food when you want. The spa is amazing!!!!!! I cannot say anthing negative about this resort. If you are trying to convince yourself about this hotel just say yes and book it!!!!!!!! My husband and I are going back for our anniversary!!!!!

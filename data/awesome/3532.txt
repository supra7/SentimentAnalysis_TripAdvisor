I only stay at hotel crystal when i go to montreal and I travel there alot I used to stay at the W but this hotel his hands down in its own league. The rooms are great the service is very good the only thing i only ate at the restaurant one time and had chicken and thought it was so so pool on the roof is great with an open air hot tub out side. I usually travel with groups of friends to montreal for hockey games or ufc and they cater to all of our needs thanks alot truly great hotel

I was exhibiting and attending a conference in the compensation and HR industry for my company (---------------) at the Seattle Convention Center. I was looking for a nearby hotel with a resonable price just for myself (not traveling with family). This hotel more than met my needs. It was within one block, the room was big enough, the front desk staff were friendly, and the price was right. It was also near the bus lines, stores, and only 7 or 8 blocks from Pike Place Market. I booked it through the hotel's website and that helped me see the different size rooms and prices. I had a room with a queen size bed. It was on the 20th floor and the elevators worked fine. The "room" was actually two spaces, one for the bedroom part and the other for the siting area with a small coach and desk. There was a step down/up between them, so you have to be careful about this if you easily trip (klutzy). The bathroom was not big and sometimes it took longer than expected for the shower water to warm up, but it was more than adequate for my needs. It was warm for Seattle during my visit and the AC was OK--not great. The hotel itself is from the 1930s, so it has character and an comfortable lobby for sitting. Overall, liked it and would stay again on a business trip and perhaps also for family travel based on room sizes.

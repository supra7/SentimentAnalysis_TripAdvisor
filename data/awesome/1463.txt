I am an individual who chose this facility for my lengthy stay without any prior knowledge, knowing that I would be able to move to any number of highly recommended places at any time. I chose not tonfor a number of reasons. I was amazed bynthe quality of the staff at all levels. They were consisitently kind and professional, and for my specific need, compassionate. And although I tried to minimize my requests, the few that I had were met with concern, ambition and dedication. I got to know my new friends on a personal basis and there are far too many to mention here. Many staff went above and beyond in meeting my needs. Now for the location, the only word being ideal for so many things. Surrounding neighborhoods are safe and surprisingly artistic. Daily Walks, or in my case wheeling in a wheelchair, were very enjoyable. People need to be aware that while the shuttle is there for your convenience, it is also important to know that the drivers have cruise ship obligations amongst others, so it is necessary to always be prepared to take a cab. They can almost always accommodate you with at least a days notice. Rooms were exceptionally comfortable and if anything was lacking, it was only a friendly phone call away. I would have preferred an ice machine on every floor, but this was only because I was unable to use the stairs and had to wait for a sometimes busy elevator. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff...all of whom should be commended, maybe in the form of a raise :). Highly recommended!

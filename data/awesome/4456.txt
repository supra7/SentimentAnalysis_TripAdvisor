As soon as I arrived at Secrets Maroma I knew it would be a wonderful trip! The looks of the place are just amazing, and the way the staff treats you is superb. The room was wonderful, clean and spacious. There are so many amenities that you really do not need to go off of the resort to enjoy yourself. If you are looking for a thoroughly relaxing vacation and to be treated like a king or queen, this is your spot!

Location - check Quality & Comfort - check Price - check My husband and I stayed at Hotel Andrea the first 3 days of our Washington State vacation. The location makes it an easy walk to all of the downtown attractions and restaurants, the modern rooms were very comfortable and their advance booking discount made it a steal in comparision to other upscale hotels in the area. Their in-house restaurant seals the deal for the times you are too tired to go searching to top-quality dining. Eating at Lola is not to be missed! We stayed at the Warwick Seattle, which is right next door the last day of our vacation, and Hotel Andrea is head and shoulders above their neighbor.

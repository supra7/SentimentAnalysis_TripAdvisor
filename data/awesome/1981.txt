My family of four spent only one night at Hotel Andra as we were visiting other places in the Pacific Northwest, but we would have loved to have had more time there. The place is decorated beautifully in rich chocolate brown, green and blue. The decor is funky but very tasteful, warm and inviting. Everyone we encounterd there was very polite, helpful, attentive, happy and just really seemed to like their jobs! They were very young and all quite attractive as well - not that this matters - just an observation. We would love to go back!

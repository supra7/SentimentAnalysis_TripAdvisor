The Inn at the Market was awesome. You can not beat the location right at the market. The room was very large and the beds are really comfortable. Our room had a partial view of Elliot Bay. Don't miss the rooftop deck which has to have the best view in Seattle short of the Space Needle. The staff was very friendly. Highly recommended. We'll be staying there again in the future.

We flew in early Sunday afternoon before a Tuesday cruise so we could see the sights in Seattle. The front desk recommended an excellent overview tour that afternoon - and that evening I fell ill. My temperature soared to 101 degrees and I couldn't leave the room. The other reviews talk about the beautiful rooms, wonderful beds, great location - all of it is true. However for me, Anthony, the chief concierge, was a godsend. He went above and beyond the call of duty - sending me chicken soup, and when I was a bit stronger (and with the kitchen closed) he went into the kitchen and boiled me two eggs, himself! I have never experienced such caring attention in any hotel before Hotel Vintage Park. Recommend the hotel to friends? No - I would insist!!

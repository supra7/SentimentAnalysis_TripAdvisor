We stay at University Inn regularly when we combine medical trips with recreational activities. We enjoy the quiet rooms, easy parking, the swimming pool and friendly staff. We love walking through the University District - sampling many different ethnic foods. The Inn appeals to both my teenager and my fourth grader.

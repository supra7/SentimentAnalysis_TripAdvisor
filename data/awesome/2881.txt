I was stuck in Seattle for three extra days due to the East Coast blizzard and found my home at the W. Many Ws make me feel about as cool as Homer Simpson, and yes, if you want to see people wearing black, you can find them here. That said, for an old guy on business I was at home at the W. Brian, the guest services manager, got me a great room at an outstanding price. My corner room was spacious, comfortable, and worked very well for me. Staff suggestions were good (Serious Pie being a good, reasonably priced pizza place a couple of blocks away, good suggestion). Great room, great view, comfortable bed, nice amenties. Extremely centrally located, convenient to everything downtown.

Not sure what people are complaining about. First I booked via Priceline got a great deal and was placed on the 31st floor facing the sound. I had a great view no complaints. The elevators were plenty fast up and down in a few seconds. The room was great, great bed and TOWELS. Probably the best towels I've come across in a hotel. One of the negatives is the rip off parking. Luckily there is the Westin Building(incidentally a major internet data exchange spot) via a walkway that had parking for $22 (but beware there the workers are illiterate and try to over charge because they don't understand the concept of 24 hrs). The staff at the hotel was excellent, extremely helpful. The one girl that was in the "special" starwood preferred spot took about 25 minutes out of her work to try and print something out for me. Another worker from Toronto sent me over to Chinatown to a pretty good hole in the wall Chinese place. The only other complaint - pay for internet. For a hotel that is charging alot (if you arent getting a discount) I find that + the parking fees actually low class and not something you would expect in a 4 star hotel. You shouldn't have to pay by the minute or to use a business center computer. Lower class hotels offer free wifi and computers. all in all for comfort, location, views, etc.. I give this place an A Overall I would go back in a minute, waking up to the great view and the central location to EVERYTHING and the decent price I paid made for an excellent visit last week to Seattle.

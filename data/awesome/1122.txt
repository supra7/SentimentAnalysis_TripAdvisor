We stayed 4 days/3 nights, and during that period held a memorial party in the Fireside Room for a recently deceased family member. Andrew Harris in catering did a great job putting together the party for us, as we were all from out of town and had no one on the ground other than him and his staff. Everywhwere we went in the hotel, whether Oliver's Bar or the front desk or the valet parking or housekeeping, people were kind and patient and seemed to know that what we needed was just plain comfort and minimal stress. By the end of our stay, we felt as if we had extended our family to include the hotel. I would enthusiastically endorse and recommend this old hotel to anyone visiting Seattle. Not only is it extremely well-located wrt local sights, but you're in for a treat when you come 'home'.

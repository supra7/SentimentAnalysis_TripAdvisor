I was impressed by the customer service. The front desk and other staff were very helpful. There is a good snack provided in the afternoon and there is a great breakfast in the morning. It was very clean. The bed and room were very comfortable. There was a lot of attention to details. The only thing was a weak shower head, and they thanked us for letting us know so they can fix it. When we were choosing the hotel, we knew we did not need something super fancy, just clean and comfy, so we could spend more on the vacation. But as soon as we arrived we knew we would stay there again. There is also a shuttle service that takes you to local attractions.

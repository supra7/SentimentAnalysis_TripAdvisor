I like the Westin Seattle. I've stayed there twice in the last few years -- including once in the fall of 2008 and once again in January of 2012. Both times it was exceptional quality -- very good service -- clean, comfortable, luxurious. I like hotels that clearly train their staff to attend to the needs of the guests -- with a smile and courtesy and sophistication. In fact, I can't think of any problems with this hotel except that the cost for parking is extraordinarily high, as some of the other reviewers have pointed out. And -- the parking is also kind of bizarrely located. As I was driving around the block for the 2nd time, I recalled that when I stayed there in 2008 I also found the whole setup to be a bit of a puzzle. Signage would help. Anyway -- great hotel. Wonderful staff.

The Hotel Monaco is one of my favourites, we have been back several times over the last 10 years and it is still wonderful. The location is fantastic and you can walk all over downtown Seattle from there. Some of the rooms have an interesting flair with bright colours reminicent of Alice in Wonderland, we were a little disappointed last time not to get one of these fun rooms. The beds are amazing and so comfortable. The restaurant is still great after all these years with a southern flair. My children love the hotel and the special goldfish pet they get at check in! This is a great place to stay where everyone feels important including children

Couldn't ask for a better location in downtown Seattle. Lobby is bright and fresh. Desk staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. There was a convention going on so it was pretty busy...but never felt crowded. Room was clean and seemed to have been remodel recently. I was on a high floor so I had a good view. Bed was comfortable and it had soft sheets and pillow cases. Best part (IMHO)...exhaust fan in the bathroom! Why don't more hotels have these?

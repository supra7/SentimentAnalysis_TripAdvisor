I went to Mexico with my mom and cousin and absolutely loved it. It was my first time there and my cousins tenth time..We didn't even know what Resort we were staying at, until we got to the Airport. We landed in Mexico and a personal vehicle pick us up and take us to the resort. We got the Resort and were greeted with a glass a champagne. Then we got escorted to our room, our room was absolutely beautiful and felt so homey. We then went to the pool and beach, there we meet the entertainment staff, (Tania, Alfredo,Jaqueline, Omar and Meme). These guys worked their butts off. They were full of postive energy, hard-working and they had a really good sense of humor. These guys were the best, they entertained us, played activities and were really good company. I am glad to have met such wonderful friendly people. I definitely can't wait to make my next reservation to go back to Secrets Maroma. And get the chance to spend my next vacation with them again. This is an excellent Resort to go too, I would highly recommend it. They offer beautiful clean rooms, the beach was gorgeous, the staff was like no other and the value was worth it. The excellente staff, made my trip even more exciting!!

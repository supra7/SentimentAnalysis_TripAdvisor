My wife and I stayed at Vintage Park for her birthday and our 2nd anniversary. VP is located only about 2 blocks from I-5 but you never seem to hear or notice it. It's location is perfectly suited for quick access to Pioneer square, Pike Market or the monorail to Seattle Center. We stayed in their luxury suite (there is only 1) on the top floor and everything was incredible. The suite had a 4 poster bed with the most luxurious coverings, fireplace, jetted shower, plasma TV, sitting area and spa tub. Overall it is around 900 sq ft. The staff was extremely attentive to every detail and the room was spotless, new and richly furnished. Our only "problem" was that something was wrong with the chimney and a lot of smoke got into the bedroom. When we told the staff, they sent up housekeeping and maintenance immediately and they cleaned the entire fireplace and ran an ozone machine in our room to remove the smell while we were gone. When I reported the problem in my review, the hotel manager wrote me back personally and apologized, promised to have all the chimney's cleaned right away and asked to make our next reservation personally so she could accomodate our inconvenience. The hotel is a bit small (126 rms) and does not have modern conveniences like a pool or fitness room, but if you want a charming and attentive hotel for a special occasion, this is the place to stay. The evening wine reception and Aveda bath products are nice additions and the attached restaurant makes for convenient dining (our room also came with $50 per evening credit towards the restaurant). All in all it was probably the best hotel stay I've ever enjoyed and will definitely consider there again in the future.

First i would like to tell you that i have read all the reviews leading up yo my honeymoon on oct 24th 2011. The hotel was nothing but perfect just as i read in the reviews the food was amazing and beach was incredible. The staff down there was awesome especially julio the bartender in lobby bar and jesus was amazing with all the activities he really gets you involved. Met alot of great people down there from all over the world. My friend got sick down there had some stomach issues just thought it was a small bug he had. Next couple of days went on and he wasnt any better so i suggested to his wife to check out the hotel doctor on site and so they did and found out he had a intestinal problem and they gave him 2 shots and some antibotics. The doctor called everyday to check on him which i thought was great because some doctors dont bother to call you back in the states where i am from. All in all would recomend this hotel to anyone and i would definitly go back in a heart beat.

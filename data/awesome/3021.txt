I was here for 2 nights and liked it alot. Everything is very stylish and modern. Loved walking through the hallways and looking at all the art on the hotel doors. (see pictures) My room was decorated in burnt orange and white with sexy crome finishes in the bathroom. Flat screen tv, coffee maker and even an ipod doc! (though the ipod doc only played music, it doesnt charge your ipod - but hey - an ipod doc in my hotel room - how cool is that?) The fitness room was fine, it has free weights, a couple of running machines and a couple of elliptical machines. The ellipticals and running machines have tvs attached so you can watch tv while using them. One of the ellipticals squeaked, but eveything else was good. The staff was great. When I was looking for a theater, they found it online and printed out a map with directions for me. I liked it so much I bought my roommate a gift card for a nights stay so she could check it out.

Had a great three night stay this past weekend(Oct.20th-23rd).....my wife and I were in Seattle for our 28th anniversary.The location was great,it was easy to get to and easy to explore Seattle's wonderful tourism sites from.If you like to walk,your minutes from everything or use the Edgewater's Town Car service to catch a classy ride!We were on the second floor and had a awesome city view,the stadiums were really lit up in the evening across the calm glowing water.The restaurant and lounge provide great food and service along with the beautiful view.The rooms were very clean and the tub was fun,you have a view of the TV and also out the scenic window!We will be back!

I stayed here for five nights in one of the Penthouse rooms for an average rate of about $100 a night. Overall, this was a great value. The rooms were quite large, modern and clean with really nice bathrooms and a terrace seating area. The employees were all very nice, especially the guys at the front desk who were always friendly and eager to help. The area around the hotel is just fine (I cannot understand why some reviews say it is rundown or unsafe). It is about 5-10 minutes walk from U and S Bahn stations and 15 minutes to the Schoneberg area. Wifi is a reasonable 10 euros for three days. I would certainly stay here again: one the best values for the price in all my years of international travel.

We love this hotel! It was not our first time here and we are never disappointed! We flew into Seattle for a relaxing & fun weekend. The Hotel Monaco is right in the middle of everything you would want to see or do. We walked everywhere and used the light rail to the airport. It's right around the corner just past the Starbucks. Within two blocks in any direction there are great restaurants and we have met many interesting people in the lobby at the wine social! The room was large and very comfortable and you can actually get two people in the bathroom. The service was wonderful. The staff was friendly, knowlegeable and made good suggestions.

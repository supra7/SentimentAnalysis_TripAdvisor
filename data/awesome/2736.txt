This is the second year in a row we stayed at this hotel in the days after Christmas and we will most likely be spending a couple of nights next year as well! We are regular travellers and we can say sincerely from experience, the hotel staff at this hotel is top notch. We stayed in one of the double deluxe rooms during our stay and for our family of four, the room was both cozy and spacious. If staying, you won't want to miss the the reception hour with in the lobby with Ally. Ally keeps the atmosphere festive and light, providing a entertaining hour of fireside chat. Ally is witty and warm, She will fill your glass while wearing a smile and if you don't gesture back, expect to be compssionately roused.

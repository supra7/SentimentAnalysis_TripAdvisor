My wife and I just returned from our honeymoon at Secrets Maroma Beach. We stayed in the junior suite with a walk out to the pool...we would recommend an ocean view instead. Highlights include... Great room Incredible and friendly service from all the staff Great food and lots of options Beautiful beach Great pool Lots of activities We encountered tropical storm Rina...the staff did a great job of preparing for the storm and were very quick to clean up after. Thank you for a great honeymoon and a great vacation.

I stayed in the Hotel Andra for 4 nights while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center; it was a quick 6 block walk from the hotel. The hotel was wonderful. I arrived early, and was able to check in right away. The room and bath were exceedingly neat and clean. As others have stated, the bed was so comfortable, and because I was so close to the conference, I could sleep in a bit longer in the morning and enjoy it! I had room service two times; both times the food was terrific, and arrived hot and in a reasonable amount of time. It was a bit overpriced, but there is a huge selection of restaurants in the area you can take advantage of. The only complaint was the charge for internet in the guest rooms - many cheaper hotels offer it for free. I would definitely stay at the hotel again, and would recommend it for any travelers, whether for business or leisure.

My husband and I stayed at this wonderful resort for 14 days - flew from Manchester on 22nd August, 2011. After so much research into planning and booking our holiday, we found this all inclusive Gem and based on the incredible reviews..we took the plunge! What can I say after all that has been said about this place...I just don't think that I can add anything more positive if I tried....absolutely no negatives whatsoever and if you do read any then I guess there is just no pleasing some folks...just a few words then...... Resort - beautiful, calming ambience, fabulous rooms (all of them), incredible beach and sea (no stones/rocks just velvety sand underfoot), gorgeous grounds and perfectly laid out. Pool areas - wonderful and perfect with service to match. Beach - amazing beach lovers paradise. Rooms - Spot on, clean and huge with the added luxury of the Secrets Box...plus incredible room service. Restaurants - All brilliant...the food is exceptional. World Cafe breakfast is to die for! Service - The best service we have ever experienced in our lives. Every member of staff goes out of their way to ensure you are treated so well. Memorable staff for me are Edgar (head waiter at the World Cafe) whose beautiful manner and respectful ways will stay with me for as long as I live, Yuri at the World Cafe (fantastic fun guy) and the lovely Freddie (World Cafe waiter), Juan at the Bordeaux, just wonderful. We have never returned to the same resort twice, but we have already booked for next year - do not be in any doubt about SMB resort....this is the best holiday choice we have ever made!!

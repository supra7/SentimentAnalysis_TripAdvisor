An absolutely amazing hotal. My husband and I stayed here for our first wedding anniversary and we couldn't have asked for more. The resort has everything you could ask for and the staff are so freindly they go out of their way to do anything for you. The restaurants and bars are great, serving lovely food and drinks. The beach is also fantastic, with pure white sand and crystal clear seas. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone considering going to Mexico for a holiday and I will certainly be returning to this resort in the future.

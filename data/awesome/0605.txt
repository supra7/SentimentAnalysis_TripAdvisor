We just spent our 20 year wedding anniversary at the Inn at the Market and couldn't have been more pleased. It felt like a perfected "boutique" hotel. The staff were extremely warm, friendly and helpful. We have actually NEVER experienced the type of service and hospitality that they gave. So many details were handled by them in our 3 night stay with such a "happy to serve you" attitude. They made great recommendations for restaurants after taking the time to figure out what we love! When we arrived in our room there was a scrumptious dessert and anniversary card waiting for us. The room was very large and big windows were fabulous! We stayed in the deluxe waterfront. Bathroom was a good size as well. All linens were of top quality! The bed was the most comfortable bed we have had in any hotel, including Westin ;). One thing that really surprised us was the quite. The building must have been of high quality because we literally did not here ANY hall noise, street noise (even with our window open) All of these positive experiences combined (which have been issues we have experienced dissatifaction with in many hotels) made for a perfect anniversary celebration. My husband and I are so glad we chose the Inn at the Market and will definitely be back again!

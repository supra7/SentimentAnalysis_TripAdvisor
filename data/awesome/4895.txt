My wife and I stayed for six nights during the last week of April and absolutely enjoyed our stay. We upgraded to a swim-out pool room and that ended up being a great decision for us. We would typically spend the morning and early afternoon at the beach and then head back to our room to enjoy our "private" pool at our room. The room, service and food were all great. The restaurants are all very good and the quality of the choices is really amazing. We had no complaints about our stay, we would go back in a heartbeat!

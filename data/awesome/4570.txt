We stayed from Oct 14-19 and it was great! The staff was so nice and never expected a tip. Though we did tip often, they were very gracious when we did. The beach, grounds, and room were very clean and well kept. The only thing we would not do again would be to stay in out swimout preferred club. The swimout water was ice cold because the sun never hit it. Also there is only one lounge chair and its not like you can get another one because there is not room for one. I have stayed in many other resorts and upgraded to the preferred club and had ALOT more benefits than what Secrets has. We will be returning to the resort next year and getting a higher up room with a view and not upgrading to the prefered club.

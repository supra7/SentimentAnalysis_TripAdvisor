Of late circumstances have found us staying at 5 star on-airport hotels. I find them convenient but very expensive, spotless, cold and lacking in any sort of character. The Marriot, by comparison, was cheap, cheerful, cozy and welcoming. It's a very short shuttle from the airport. I asked at the desk if I had booked our room with breakfast. (I couldn't recall.) For $20 he gave us an upgrade which included the full breakfast for us both. The hotel is one of those old style designs where the pool anchors the main floor surrounded by lots of greenery. Alongside is a dining area, because of renovations the only one available at the moment. The rooms rise square on the four sides of the pool. Here is a tip - never stay in a North American hotel on a Saturday night if you can avoid it. There's a ninety percent chance there will be a stag party, a hen party, a wedding party or a sports team staying somewhere in the hotel. There's a good chance somebody will be running the halls, shrieking, at 3 in the morning. Kudos to Marriot. We were on the fifth floor and it was quiet as a mouse all night. The room was clean, had all the amenities and was absolutely fine for an overnight stay. At breakfast, buffet style, there was none of that dreadful scrambled egg in a warming tureen. A chef cooked your eggs how you wanted them on request. The service was crisp and friendly. The previous evening a delightful barman served us drinks and kept us amused, a passing staff member helped us print our boarding passes. We give the Marriot full marks for service and for caring. It was refreshing to be so well treated.

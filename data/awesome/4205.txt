Well we celebrated our honeymoon - May 17 to May 24. And what can I say. We used Tripadvisor ourselves to book this trip and we were not disappointed. We stayed in Building 25. And it was fabulous. Our concierge Roberto was on top of everything and greeted us every single day. From the cleaning staff to the waiters/waitresses in the restaurant and on the beach, they all did a fantastic job..... We never had an issue with hot water, or turndown service and the 24 hour room service came in handy most nites. Plus where else can you go and get food and drinks delivered to you right on the beach. SECRETS Maroma u guys truly are amazing. We are so glad we booked our honeymoon here. The beach was amazing, the food was superb, the room was phenominal and our swim out was nice and heated. We are already planning to come back next year for our 1st Anniversary. Thanks again, Jay & Di

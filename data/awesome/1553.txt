We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle before taking an Alaskan cruise. The hotel is lovely-- with great restaurant and a breakfast bar in the lobby for a quick bite. Lovely rooms, beautiful pool area.The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is just 4 blocks fom Pike Place and a stop on the Hop-on Hop-Off bus route.

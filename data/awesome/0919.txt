I recently stayed at the Inn at Viginia Mason on a business trip for the first time. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. It was charming, quiet, roomy, and offered much more than I ever expected. The Rhododedron Restaurant adjacent to the lobby had excellent food and service. I can't wait to stay at the Inn @ VM on my next trip this summer and sip a cocktail on the rooftop deck with a great view of the city and the water. A great way to relax at the end of a work day.

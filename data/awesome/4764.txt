We traveled to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon from June 28-July4. The entire trip was amazing. Everyone that works there is super nice and goes out of their way to be accommodating. The food at the restaurants was amazing, definitely 5 star. One of the best things about this hotel is that the hotel filters its water. I know over the course of the week we both accidentally drank some and neither of us got sick and I never heard of anyone else we met getting sick. The beach is beautiful and secluded. When we were there we met couples on excursions and after telling them where we were staying everyone said they heard that it was the nicest. I'm so glad that we picked this resort because it was more than we could ask for, especially for our honeymoon.

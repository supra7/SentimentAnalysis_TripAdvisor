We stayed at the Vintage Park for Easter weekend and from the moment of arriving until leaving we enjoyed our stay here. We arrived after 3 tiring flights and 24 hours from the UK. On arrival we were advised that we had been upgraded free of charge. When we got to the room on the 11th floor we were simply blown away with the quality and finish of our room. We have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and we have never been unhappy with the quality, price and assistance we have been received from the staff. We would definitely return to this hotel and would advise anyone to stay here.

We had planned to return to Seattle for one last day before heading home and elected to stay at Marriott's Sea-Tac Hotel using points. It was a comfortable place to stay - we were upgraded to the concierge floor so we had plenty of food to eat for our two night stay, and it was quiet enough to rest and for my husband to do some work. The pool area looked very inviting but we had no suits with us and we appreciated the on-time free airport shuttle. We would definitely return here again!

Just returned from our second delightful stay this year at the Mayflower Park. We had a 5th floor suite -- lovely sitting room with separate bedroom. My husband normally rises earlier than I so this is a perfect arrangement for us. A wet sink bar with coffee maker in the sitting room allows him to sit at the desk to write while he enjoys morning coffee. Comfy sofa, armchair with ottoman and cocktail table and windows on two sides make this room a pleasant place to hang out. We enjoyed a terrific lunch and breakfast the next day in Andaluca and had a nightcap in Oliver's after the baseball game. Both rooms are attractive and friendly environments. This hotel is a real winner and we feel totally at home staying there. We'll be back...

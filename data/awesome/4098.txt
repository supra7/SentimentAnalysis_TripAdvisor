My daughter and I loved our trip. The service at Maroma was wonderful, and everyone of the staff was helpful and courteous. The food was very good, and we particularly enjoyed the Italian and Japanese, as well as the breakfast buffet. I liked that there were always lounge chairs available at the pool as well as the beach. My only suggestions would be to keep the rooms a little cooler. (it was particularly warm on the 3rd floor at night). Also, I wish that I had known it was going to be all couples. It was a little awkward being the ONLY non-couple there. But we still had a wonderful time, and would definitely consider coming back.

My plane had a bird fly into the engine and the airline put us up at the Marriott. I was super depressed - until I walked into the place - it was nice! Their rooms are modern and big and comfortable. The bed was heaven, especially if you have the whole thing to yourself! The atrium area was so nice that I regretted not having a swim suit. The bar/lounge was kind of small and expensive but other than that it was a great hotel to waste some time in.

Though we only stayed one night, we had a fantastic experience. Booked on-line which was very easy and even received a much appreciated reminder e-mail a week out. We were a little worried that the hotel would feel dated from a previous visit several years ago and some on-line traveler's photos but we were amazingly surprised. The upgrades and renovations are terrific. We lucked out with a full view of the market. My brother who lives right around the corner normally steers his guests to the Four Seasons but after visiting our room, stated that he will now always recommend the Inn at the Market.

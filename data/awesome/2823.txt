I stayed here with my 21 year old daughter for a girl's weekend in Seattle. We had never stayed in a W, and we both loved it! We thought the price was very fair for a great city location within walking distance of many restaurants and two Starbucks. My daughter and I loved the cool, hip atmosphere and special touches such as flavored water & morning coffee in the lobby. I'm not sure why others have complained about the rooms. Our room with double beds was very clean, spacious, and stocked with spa-like robes and Bliss bath products/shampoos. Everything looked pretty new, with upscale trendy decor. The Westin Heavenly Beds were plush and very comfortable. Parking is expensive in a nearby garage, but that's typical for all downtown hotels. Once we parked, we never needed to drive our car since we were able to walk whereever we wanted to go. It's located in the bus "free zone" so you can hop on a free bus and get closer to many popular destinations such as Westlake & Pacific Place shopping centers. Walking to Pike Place Market is possible (about 6 city blocks away), or shorten your walk by riding the free bus for a couple blocks and get off near Pike Street. (Unless you know what you're doing, be careful not to take one of the long "express" buses, since they don't make as many stops). I highly recommend the Purple Cafe & Wine Bar which is only a block away. The food was great and the ample selection of wine flights which is a fun way to try several good wines. The W is definitely not for everyone, especially not for young children, not for elderly, and not for anyone wanting lots of amenities and pampering. I highly recommend the W Seattle if you are wanting a great central city location and a unique hotel experience.

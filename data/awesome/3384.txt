We stayed at the Airport Hilton for the final night of our trip to Seattle. We had hoped to continue our stay downtown, but the hotel for the conference we had attended was not available. I am really glad it worked out this way! The airport Hilton is a lovely hotel and appears to have been recently remodeled. The room was very large and comfortable. Food from room service was great. Most notable for this hotel is the beautiful courtyard. Staying at this hotel near the airport also made catching a morning flight stress free - just a quick ride over in the hotel van.

i stayed at the embassy suites for a week while i attended a conference there for work. it totally exceeded any expectations i had. the bed was perfect. i meant to look at the brand before i left so that i could get one at home, but i forgot. the room was clean, the shower was comfortable. free happy hour every night includes beer, wine, and a full bar, plus snacks. i would stay here again for business, but it's too far from the center of town to stay on a tourist trip.

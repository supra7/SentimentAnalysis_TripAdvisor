My wife and I went to the Secrets Maroma Beach for a 4 day convention and then extended our stay for 2 additional nights and we just loved the place. The service is absolutely amazing, everybody is sooo kind that you can't avoid noticing it, not only are they kind, the service is also fast. The bars, the restaurants, the quality of the food and drinks is just right. We stayed two more night to celebrate our anniversary and our concierge sent us a bottle of sparkling wine, flowers and a huge band outside our door stating we were celebrating. Great! The beach is beautiful, no rocks, the water sooo calm we could just lay our backs against the sea and relax. We would skip breakfast and wait for the pool restaurant to open so we could order ceviche and shrimp cocktails to our beach palapas. The disco is great and also the small caf where you can have a quick espresso and a banana muffin in the morning. The themed restaurants are also wonderful, the portions served are very generous and the quality is 100%. I didn`t really like the pillows, too hard for my taste. Also the shower had a funny way of working, at first it would be cool and then too hot, the electricity would go off several times during the day but I suppose this isn't the hotel's fault. At the beach I would highly recommend asking for Bloody Caesars, wonderfully tasting cocktails.

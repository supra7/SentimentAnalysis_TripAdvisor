I highly recommend the Seattle Westin! The beds were great, the shower was great, the view was fantastic (ask for a view of the SpaceNeedle!), the decor was beautiful and I absolutely loved everything about it! Pike Place Market is a short walk away BUT be aware that it is a very steep walk to the market!! We purchased a pre-cruise package with the hotel stay and transfers to/from the airport with Princess CruiseLine. When the Princess CruiseLine forgot to pick us up and were just awful for us, the Westin's evening manager stepped in and kindly upgraded our room even though it wasn't their fault. Even the service was amazing! It was my first trip to Seattle but it won't be my last...and I will definitely stay at the Westin again!

We were there for our anniversary. Everything was perfect during our stay 8-27-9-2-11. We had a preferred oceanfront room in building 26. We were upgraded through the preferred club's concierge Carlos, and our building's concierge Carlos was great. We had the preferred club's extras, and Joel the bartender in the preferred lounge was very accomodating. We ate in all the restaurants, Bordeaux, Porotofino, El Patio, Himitsu, and Seaside. Bordeaux was outstanding, our favorite, and Pablo,our waiter there became a friend we will see again. Eddy, the sommelier and he served our 34th anniversary dinner we had privately in the wine cellar. I had the spa services, and Mirabella gave me the best facial I ever had, and Anna gave me the best hot stone massage to relax me. I give SMB the highest rating, and we will be back, this time in the winter months.

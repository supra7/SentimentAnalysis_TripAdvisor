What a wonderful experience! Your facility is just breathtakingly beautiful, the beach is clean and clear, with soft white sand. The pools are beautiful and well kept as are the grounds. What truly impressed us the most was your staff. The entire staff of Maroma Beach could not be more welcoming and accomadating. From the hostesses and hosts, waiters and waitresses, pool concierage, front desk, entertainment staff, bar staff, the service was second to none. The food was also surprisingly first rate, delicious, and with variety. This was our first all inclusive experience and we are planning on coming again. Kevin, Lilly, and Moeses were just a few of the wonderful people who work there.

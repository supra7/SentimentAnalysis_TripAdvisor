Planning a wedding is no picnic so my new husband and I were ready! Secrets exceeded all of our expectations! We did the Prefered Club Swim out Jr Suite - well worth it. Included with that was our conceirge service. Yanik couldn't do enough for us! The rooms were big with a huge amoire with lots of closet space. We didn't even need to bring a toobrush, they provided everyrhing..they also had mosquitos wipes in our room (we didn't need them though). Our swim out was perfect. We would swim before dinner as well as after a night out - sometimes we brought back our new friends....room service would bring us drinks, pizza and salsa 7 chips right to our swim out. The food there is awesome as well as the many specialty drinks they offer. The beach there is the prettiest i have ever seen. The water is so clear and the Angel Fish swim right up to you. The pools are great as well. They keep all the pools very clean as well as the grounds. Secrests is a definate MUST! I can't wait for our next trip back!

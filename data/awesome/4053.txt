My wife and I decided to return to Secrets Mroma resort this July, after having hosted a desintation wedding there in October,2010. We wanted to relax and enjoy more of what the hotel had to offer. 2nd time is a charm. The service, food, and accomodations were as good this trip as they were in October 2010. Service: Impeccable- More service than you could ask for; very accomodating. Foods: Top notch, from extraordinary buffet breakfasts to gourmet dining in the restaurants. Being an Italian New Yorker, I must say... Pasta dishes in Portofino were delicious! So, if the breakfasts and pasta are good, you can't go wrong from there. Daniel runs a tight culinary ship!. Drinks: Top shelf at all bar locations. Have been to other AI resorts that cut corners on drinks..not here! Drink what you like. Spa: Beautiful and clean. Pools: Always clean Beach: well kept with good beach service for food and beverage all day. Rooms: Beautiful, clean and well appointed. Grounds: Manicured and clean. Comments: 1) great place for destination wedding ( Cecilia Reyes/Wedding Coordinator and staff are #1 with a Star!) 2) Please tip the staff. How could anyone with good conscience receive such consistancy in good service and not tip? We've noticed that tipping, although not necessary at AI, is still not exercised.. The staff at Secrets Maroma are good. A little (tipping)goes a long way.

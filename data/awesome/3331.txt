After staying two nights in the Redmond area for a conference, my wife and I booked this hotel for the last night before our flight home. The hotel lobby had a large fireplace and comforable couches. My wife commented that the pool area (which you pass on an elevated walkway as you make your way to the elevators) looked like something you'd see at Disney with lots of indoor trees/plants. Our room was clean, quiet and nice...but the bathroom felt a bit small. The breakfast buffet was well stocked with all sorts of hot and cold items and also had two cooks on hand for made to order eggs (including a Salmon Scramble which was delicious). We stayed on the top floor (Conceige level, received an upgrade with Marriott points) so the room had an elevated ceiling and I was very impressed with the quality of the decor.

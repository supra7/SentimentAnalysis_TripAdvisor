I recently stayed overnight at Hotel Andra for a "stay-cation" and would highly recommend the hotel for both personal and business trips. The hotel is in a great location...walking distance to all the downtown shopping, Pike Place Market and many restaurants. The staff is very professional and courteous. The rooms were very neat clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. Would definitely go back!

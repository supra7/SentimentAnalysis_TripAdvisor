We've stayed in several hotels near the Seattle Airport, and this is our fav so far. Quick and friendly shuttle (even at midnight), quick check-in, and a really nice, clean, and comfortable room. Bed was heaven after six weeks of travel in Europe. Breakfast was the usual but good: croissant, yogurt, excellent mixed fruit, ham, and (probably once-frozen) scrambled eggs, decent coffee. It cost a bit more than the Holiday Inn Express, but it feels much nicer--beddding, decor, etc. Another big plus--VERY quiet. We chose 3rd floor (4th is smoking, 1st too near ground noise), turned on the room fan, and slept without interruption....aaaah.

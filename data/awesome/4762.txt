Just returned from a quick last minute 3 night trip to Secrets Maroma from St. Louis. It was our third visit over the last 1 1/2 years. To keep it simple, Maroma is simply the best place we've ever been to. We have traveled extensively through Mexico and the Caribbean over the past 33 years and the only place that even comes close is Royal Hideaway, but Secrets wins out due to the staff. The beach is the best we've ever seen in Mexico and compares with Grace Bay in Turks. The grounds and landscaping had filled in since our last visit in August of 09 and the place looks wonderful. Food continues to be top notch, service in every restaurant is very attentive as were the bartenders. The beach service folks, like Anna, work very hard. Many of the same staff are there that started the day Maroma opened. They have been superbly trained. We've convinced several of our friends to travel to Secrets and they have returned with the same feelings. WE have also been to Secrets Capri 3 times and to Silversands once. Capri is a bit more intimate and the rooms at Silversands are top notch, but the beach at Maroma is the real difference maker. Occupancy was at 85% when we visited earlier this month and the place didn't seem a bit crowded at all.

We Traveled to Secrets for our Honeymoon. The last minute decision to upgrade from a swim out room to a ocean view with a tub on the balcony was never regretted. We also booked the prefferred club, I was hesitant to do so due to the mixed reviews, but very happy we did in the end. When we arrived there was quite the wait to check on, but being preferred club we were whisked away in a golf cart and in our room in 20 minutes. The staff was amazing, the bartenders were awesome. We spent most of our time at the pool and swim up bar. The beach was very clean and beautiful, some people feed the fish so they have no problem swimming right up to you. We didn't have a problem with mosqitos while we were there. The food was good, my husband is very picky and he ate well while we were there! My favorite was the World Cafe breakfast buffet...Huge and satisfying enough to get us through mid afternoon. We only ordered room service once and there wasn't a problem with it. We didn't have a problem with time share hassles or large groups. Everyone was very respectable. We never went to the disco. The nightlife was pretty slow while we were there, which we didn't have a problem with, drinking and being in the sun all day really takes a toll!

I was there for my daughter's wedding. Everything was perfect; surpassed all expectations! My first all-inclusive vacation, and I'm planning a return trip. Rooms, service, food, beach, pool, staff were superb. I felt like royalty the whole time I was there. The resort is couples oriented; I traveled 'solo' and staff sometimes didn't seem to know what to do with me when I did things by myself (my other travel companions were 'couples'). A small inconvenience that in no way affected the wonderful service and attention. Our favorite group gathering spot was the pool bar in late afternoon. I recommend their coconut ice cream!

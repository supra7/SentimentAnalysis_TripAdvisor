We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is almost centrally localed, brand new interieur, very stylish and simplistic. In addition to the good location the staff of the hotel is very friendly and helpful! This hotel is great value for money - especially if you are on a short city trip to Berlin! We will probably go again to Lindemann's in Berlin!

We only had 1 night in Seattle, so wanted somewhere that was central to attractions and this Hotel delivered. Upon arriving a few hours early from the train station, we where greeted with a friendly welcome and they checked us in straight away. As we where from overseas, we where very happy to be given a room on the 5th floor with views towards the Space Needle, so that was a really bonus to us. The hotel staff where all really friendly & helpful. They gave us maps, directions & suggestions on what to do or try while in the city. Room - as mentioned above we where thrilled to have a view of the Space Needle. Our room was clean, neat & tidy. Decor was not modern, but it was all tidy & nice - I'm there to see the city, not the decor of a room personally. Good space, with fridge & I really liked that that had actually glassess, instead of plastic cups that you are normally given. Also had a room safe. We experienced no problem with it being noisey. Location - right across the road from a Grocery Shop (had wine & dinner that you can buy). 2 min walk to Western Lake Centre & appx 7 - 10 min to Pike Place. We didn't eat at the resturant so can't comment. There was lots of resturants around this area for choice though. Also there was an old style cinema right across the street. Also they had somewhere to store our pile of luggage the next day while we where out exploring the following day, along with a lounge style area to also wait in. It was exactly what we wanted - some where comfortable to sleep for a night, along with a great view.

My wife and I chose Secrets for our "second honeymoon". We stayed in a swim-out honeymoon suite, which may have been more space than we needed, but it certainly was very nice. We have stayed at other all inclusives in Cancun, Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta over the past four years, and Secrets Maroma was clearly superior in every way to any of them. There are so many positive reviews about this property that I won't wax on too much, but just to hit some high points: All the staff were outstanding The beach is incredible, probably the best we have ever seen, and we travel a lot The food was great, true restaurant quality We don't drink too much, but the house wine and mixed drinks all seemed quite good quality. An earlier review criticised the watersports equipment. This must have been addressed as all of the equipment was of excellent quality. The power did go out twice during our stay for less then an hour each time, and it really wasn't a problem as it was mid-morning. We only had one "issue". My wife was the one voted to drop the kids off at camp on the way to Cancun, so she arrived seperately and quite late at night. Her transfer from the airport was messed up by the transport company contracted by the hotel, and this was quite stressful for both of us, but the hotel stepped right in and made great efforts to put it right. We unreservedly recommend this property.

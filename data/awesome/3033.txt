This was the second time I've stayed in the Hotel Max and the beds are just as comfortable as I remembered. After a long-haul flight they were just perfect. The Red Fin restaurant in the hotel was excellent and the staff were friendly and sociable. The hotel itself has a fun character and is covered in some interesting art. The central location is ideal for touring Seattle by foot. My only minor quibbles are that the charge for internet access seemed excessive and that on this visit our room a/c unit was quite noisy. This wasn't a problem on our previous visit, however, and I'm looking forward to using Hotel Max on future visits to Seattle.

Had a great experience at the Inn at the Market. Very, very clean. Extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Great location; was able to walk to public transportation. Superb restaurants within walking distance. Used the free business center every night for email. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Loved all of the lights and outlets in the room.

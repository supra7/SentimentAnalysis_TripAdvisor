My husband and I visited the Seattle area the last weekend in November primarily to attend Seahawks - Redskins game. The weekend plans were in celebration of my husband's birthday. Allie, the front office manager, was wonderful. She personally helped with our reservations and answering questions specific to game day commute. Our room was very comfortable. The service was the best we have experienced. We enjoyed breakfast in the Hunt club. The food was wonderful; but we also enjoyed the quiet, intimate environment. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming. We plan on visiting Seattle again and when we do will stay at the Sorrento.

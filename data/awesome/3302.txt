I went to Seattle for the first time for business and stayed at this hotel that was directly across from the airport. I was pleasantly surprised that I never once heard any noise from the airport. There customer service was first class. The hotel was extremely clean, updated, bright and airy. There accomodations were perfect. They had a great workout room, a wonderful full free service breakfast each morning, the restaurant food was very tasteful and the openness to the lobby with gift shop, bar/food and pool was very inviting.Best of all the bedding was the most comfortable bed/pillows that I have every had at a hotel. I recommend this hotel to anyone. I will have to say that I was surprised that you had to pay to park their. I am from St Louis and nowhere do we have to pay to park at a hotel. My business partner, however, did say that I should get use to paying to park b/c it is very common.

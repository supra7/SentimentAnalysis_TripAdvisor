This resort, quite simply is amazing! The photos don't do it justice. The rooms are lovely and the staff cannot do enough for you. When you arrive you are greeted with a 'Welcome Home' from the Bellboys and then served a glass of champagne and given a ice cold face towel.. Just what you need when you have been travelling for nearly 15hrs.. Lovely! All of the A la carte restaurants are fantastic.. Our favourite was El Patio the Mexican restaurant, where Eduardo will show you his passion for Tequila! It really is the best all inclusive holiday I have been on and the beach, sea, service, food and staff are faultless! On a personal note: Eric (General Manager) Thank you for a wonderful time.. We will be back!

We really enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn at the airport. Their Shuttle driver gave us some great locations for dinning and when we were ready to return he was there at the desinated time waiting on us. The breakfast was hot and very good! I would highly recommend this place if you are staying near the airport!!

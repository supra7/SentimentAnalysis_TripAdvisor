We stayed here before & after a cruise to Alaska. We had a TON of luggage and the front lobby guys were great about helping us - even when the cab left us off in the wrong place and he had to push a cart full of bags half way UP the hill/block. The concierge helped with a map and some additional recommendations, we were able to use the free Acura ride service to get to the cruise port and hung out in the "living room" with friends. The location was very convenient - but quiet at night - always felt safe though. Restaurant was good for breakfast and waiter was nice enough to steer us away towards the better items on the menu. Nice to get a real answer from him and not just "oh everything is great here". Room service breakfast was a little hit and miss - one was great - one was OK. For the price - I want great. Room needs a 2nd chair for in room dining

We chose to stay at Hotel Andra for our 12th anniversary. When I called to inquire of making a reservation, they were very helpful and informed me of a great special that saved me money. The valet parking attendants were pleasant and willing to help in anyway. The check-in and check-out process was very inviting and friendly. The room was fantastic, and we enjoyed our city view. The location was favorable with Nordstrom's and Pikes Place Market nearby. What we really enjoyed was the adjoined restaurant, Lola's! My husband and I can't recommend enough the freshly made doughnuts. YUMMY! The service there was also top notch. We can't wait for another opportunity to return.

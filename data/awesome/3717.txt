We stayed at the resort from 18 - 28.1.12. It was our first Mexico visit,but surely not the last. After driving around the Yucotan for one week, we finally arrived to paradise. The first words we heard was : welcome home :-) and home it became. The resort is absolutely 1.class everywhere. We had all inclusive and the food was eccelent. I can easaly write gourmet.The rooms were amazing. Large and all with our own jacuzzi. 1.class stay. A holiday to remember with big smiles...in cold -15 wintercoverred Denmark. Thanks to all the staff at the resort for their big smiles and services :-)

We used Hotel Andra for our wedding party and stayed there the night of the wedding. We had a fabulous experience from the moment we reserved the rooms until the morning we left as a married couple. The staff is friendly and took wonderful care of all of our out of town guests (including getting them to our wedding at a private residence that was hard to find). We had a fabulous bottle of champagne waiting for us in our lovely room and spent the night with all our friends celebrating in the bar. The front desk even ordered our entire party late night pizza! We are so glad we picked Andra

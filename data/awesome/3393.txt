Great hotel immediately outside the airport entrance - you can walk right across the street unless you want to grab the shuttle for your bags. I requested a higher floor away from main street and it was very quiet. Nice to have a Sleep Number bed and plush towels. Nice fireplace with relaxing ambience for drinks and socializing in the lounge while waiting for friends or just to chill out for the night.

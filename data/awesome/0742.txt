Enough good things cannot be said about this property. From the time I called the Inn to book until my departure, the entire staff at this hotel was above and beyond excellence. I stayed one night pre-cruise on May 2 and was upgrade to a suite which overlooked the city/market area. The rooms were huge and the bed with the temp. mattress was to die for. Ordered room service which was very prompt and delicious. The greatest thing about my stay was the staff on duty that day. Everyone was extremely helpful in all manners and most pleasant. If every hotel had this particular staff, rooms would be over booked. If you have time, definitely use the fifth floor terrace for a cocktail. It overlooks the market and has great sunsets.......all this while watching the ships come and go. Such a peaceful late afternoon cannot be beat! I was sad to go the next morning at check-out.....when in Seattle I will always stay at this property.

I spent four nights at the Marqueen Hotel in Seattle, and found it very delightful. For the price, the room was very spacious and felt a bit more like a well-decorated studio apartment than a stuffy hotel room. The kitchen was a lovely bonus (Seattle cuisine is so good! I needed to store leftovers in the fridge), and overall the room and hotel in general had a ton of charm, nothing like standard cookie-cutter hotels that tend to be so prominent. Great location, too--half hour walk from major shopping, Pike Place Market, etc. About 15 minutes from the Science Center and Space Needle. Lots of good food and grocery stores near Queen Ann ave as well. Hmm. What else did I like? Housekeeping was great, service was great--coffee at Cafe Ladro was bold and delicious. My complaints are minimal, but here they are: Transparent curtains let in quite a bit of morning light (not good if you like to sleep in), and the shower had terrible pressure (but hey, I still got clean!). On my third night, water began dripping from the ceiling, too. There are notices in the bathrooms that say an overflowing tub will cause drippage in the room below, so I think the people above might have taken a splashey bath or something. It wasn't a big deal, they offered to put us in another room but the water soon stopped dripping. Not a big deal. Overall, very delightful stay at the Marqueen. I will never stay anywhere else when I'm in Seattle.

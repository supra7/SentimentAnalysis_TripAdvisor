no problems staying with children in this hotel. Service was exemplary. (clogged drain?, in need of towels? no problem, they were at the door in less than 5 minutes!) great location with easy walk to shopping, Pike's Market, space needle. Only issues were that rooms were a bit small and parking was quite pricey at $30/day (+ tax)

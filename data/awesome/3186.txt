We stayed at the Doubletree Hotel at the Seattle airport before and after a trip to NYC - the price was hefty compared to other options, but the Doubletree booking included 10 nights parking, which was exactly what we needed. I searched for other, cheaper hotels, but finally decided to keep my reservation. I am so glad I did. Their rooms are far nicer than other options in the area, and our car was taken away and brought back within minutes of our phone call to the front desk. Other than having to make a call to the front desk for extra cups and towels, we didn't need anything more. This is a great value when you are looking to stash your car and need to fly out early. At $240, it is actually cheaper than most of the other nicer options, if you add in all of the extra charges some hotels add on. I will try to remember not to price shop next time!

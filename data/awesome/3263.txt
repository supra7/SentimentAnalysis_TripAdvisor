My husband and I stayed at the Embassy Suites on our wedding night, as we flew out for our honeymoon at 5am. Our experience was wonderful! When we arrived at the hotel, the staff had upgraded us to a nicer room. When we got to our room we found a bottle of champagne, popcorn, a free movie certificate and a card (signed by the front desk staff) in our room. We were thrilled that they thought of us and made out wedding night that much more special. We went down to the lobby for happy hour, where we enjoyed a complementary glass of wine and beer and then had dinner at the hotel restaurant, Rings. The steak and lobster were great and the waitress was very friendly. Even our free shuttle to the airport was great, because of the friendly driver who made us feel comfortable even at the early hour. I can't say enough good things about our stay at the Embassy Suites!

My husband and I are leaving to go back to Missouri tomorrow :(. We have zero complaints for Secrets Maroma Beach. Everyone on staff is absolutely amazing!!! Roberto is the BEST concierge in Mexico!! Make sure you stay in building 26!!! Also the entertainment staff is a lot of fun!!!! We have not met one unfriendly person!!! The beach is beautiful and there is always something to do. As far as the food..... AMAZING.. be prepared to gain some weight..haha jkjk..but really all of the restaurants were so good!!! We can't wait to come back again!!! Thank You secrets!!!

I recently visited the Moore Hotel with my family for the purpose of doing some sightseeing and to take in a couple Mariner baseball games. I booked a couple rooms for a long weekend, having stayed at the Moore previously on recommendations from friends. My family completely enjoyed their stay. There are three things about the Moore Hotel that make it a hotel I highly recommend - the character, the location and the value. The Moore is one of Seattle's more historic hotels with the charm of a bed and breakfast. Though an older building, it does not lack in comfort or amenities. Rooms are extremely generous in size. They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere. The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games. And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all. The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

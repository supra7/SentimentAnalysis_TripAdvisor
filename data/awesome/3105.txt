I struggle to find a problem with this awesome hotel in downtown Seattle we stayed in for a night in July 06. From the moment we walked through the doors the friendly staff, fantastic decor and brilliant location blew us away. Recently opened the hotel has a fun and funky vibe, which might not be to everyones liking, and an amazing collection of artwork! The room was huge, and our every need was catered for, flat screen TV, selection of different pillows, fully stocked mini-bar and a clean bathroom. My only small complaint was that the room was a little noisy due to a nearby air conditioning unit at night. The hotel is located downtown and has its own restaurant which serves excellent and acclaimed Japanese-fusion food. We had breakfast in the restaurant and it was fantastic. Staff could not have been more helpful, advising us on places to shop and eat, and always with a smile on their face. If you have an opportunity stay in this hotel.

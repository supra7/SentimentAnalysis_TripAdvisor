This was by far the BEST resort I have ever stayed at! My husband and I traveled here for our honeymoon in June 2010. Every day they called for rain, but it was 95 and sunny every day. The beach was unbelievable! Perfect white sand and blue/clear water! The pool was amazing! We spent most mornings at the beach, then ventured up to the pool in the early afternoon where are chairs over looked the pool and ocean. The food was incredible!! I really cant say we had one bad meal. The entire staff was just fantasic! Very sociable and very well manored! If you are looking for a place with a great SPA, this is the place! It was GORGEOUS! I went twice while I was there, and if I could I would have gone everyday! The rooms were very roomy, and elegant! We loved the special things they did for us at the turndown service! Oh, and did I mention 24 hour room service?! That was great!! Overall, you will not be disappointed with this resort! We are already planning a trip back for our 1 year anniversary! June 2011 cant come soon enough!!!!

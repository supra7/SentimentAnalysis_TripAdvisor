We stayed at Secrets Maroma from 5/22 through 5/29. It was the most romantic vacation we ever had. We had a swim up room which we both loved. Although you do share the pool with a few other rooms, no one really seems to be in it at the same time. We have stayed at many all inclusives throughout the years and Secrets Maroma is the best by far. The service is definitely first class and the staff cannot do enough for you. What we also liked is that there were plenty of activities going on throughout the day, but no one annoyed you to get involved if you chose not to. The food was good with plenty of variety. There is waiter service at both the beach and the pool area. There are plenty of palapas for shade on the beach. The grounds are spotless and the landscaping is beautiful. Both the beach and pool areas are gorgeous. 24 hour room service was efficient and fast. The only negative is the way the buildings are made if anyone is talking by the doors it echos. Therefore, at night it may wake you up. I think the hotel would benefit by putting another set of sound proof doors in the room. We both had the best message ever at the spa. We look forward to our return to Secrets Maroma.

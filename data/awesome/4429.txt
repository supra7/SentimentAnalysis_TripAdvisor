Just want to add our voices to the many who love Secrets Maroma. Got through Mexican customs quickly and easily. AMEX Travel was there to greet us and 25 minutes later we were checking in. Very please with RM 2243, 4th floor presented perfect ocean vieu, and we like proximity to Main Building, where most restaurants were. Staff is incredibly helpful. We stick to standard drinks, but they make some amazing, colorful concoctions. Food is constantly availble, from sushi to paella poolside, as well as a great grill where they are constantly serving up fresh grilled fish, burgers, etc. You can go hog wild with thye food and booze or eat as healthy a diet as you wish. It's all here. We thought the restaurants were a significant cut above most all-inclusivs. The two poolside buffets we attended were also terrific. For SPA people: Before booking, always check for "specials" of the day. By booking a couples massage between 11-3 one day, we got a 2 for 1 package. Spa is beautiful. If you want to snorkel in the swimming area of the hotel, bring your own mask and fins. On snorkel excursions, everything is supplied. Also bring headphones, etc to hear audio in the fitness room. Again, great place, wonderful people. Highly recommended.

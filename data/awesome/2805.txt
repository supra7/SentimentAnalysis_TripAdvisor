I could stay only two nights here as the hotel was fullty booked because of a big conference. Old building downtown Seattle on walking distance of the Conference Centre and anything else you want to do. Nice place, not like the standard hotel chains, but with its own unique characteristics. Nice large and comfortable room, wireless internet connection for free but the desk was quite small to work on. Breakfast is not included but unless you like a big breakfast, go to the cosy lounge in the morning for a good cup of coffee and some cookies and all morning papers for free. Last but not least every late afternoon (from 5 to 6 pm) there is a wine tasting, again for free. I liked my stay very much and it was a pity that I had to move to another hotel after two days (which was my own fault as I booked too late).

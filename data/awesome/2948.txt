Can't say enough good things about this hotel. Super clean, comfy bed, staff very professional and helpful, centrally located (can walk to so many things), modern decor. I know some people have complained about the tiny rooms and bathrooms. That didn't really bother me and my partner, but then again, we don't have kids and we're used to living in small spaces. Will definitely stay again when we go back to Seattle.

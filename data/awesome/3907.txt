Having read many of the review's on tripadvisor we knew we had found a class resort. seeing it it the flesh simply blows you away.The quality of the place is simply outstanding. Check in was smooth,no problems.The rooms were fantastic,the beds were the best we have slept in whist on holiday. The food was fimply fantastic,our favourite restraunt Portofino,it was that good we ate there 3 times. Anyone who isnt pleased with the selection of food must be the most picky eater ever. The bars were also fantastic,we spent most of our time down by the beautiful beach. The staff were all so very friendly.A special mention must go to Kevin,Ethel,Sergio (scuba diving) and our cheeky chappy friend Joel at the lobby bar. you just have to go to Secrets Maroma.

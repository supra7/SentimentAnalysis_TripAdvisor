We traveled to the Hotel Max for a 2-day mini-vacation in early April, 2010. The property has amazing art, and a very glamorous feel. The most friendly and helpful staff! The front desk agent even know the very best place to get post-partying nibbles at 2:00am. Aveda toiletries, super soft bedding, great views, very quiet rooms. We valet parked, and walked EVERYWHERE, very good location to downtown shopping, bars, restaurants, and Pike's Market. We will totally stay again.

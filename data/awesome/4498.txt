Our Conciere Mauriceo Mendez was the best he went above and beyond great service. This was our first all- inclusive stay best vacation ever so many activities.All u need to bring is swimwear . If u want to go to the fancy restuarants men can wear bermuda shorts and casual botton down shirts or slacks.Women skirts or dresses. But we enjoyed poolside menu that we just ate there or ordered roomservice most of the time. If u look at the pictures everything is exactly like u see it. This place felt like paradise. The rooms are great very romantic everything is so private no kids all adult I love this place my husband and I are already planning our next trip here. Nothing but smiling faces and great service.the food and drinks were unlimited and delicous.This place was picture perfect! The Smiths From Greenville SC

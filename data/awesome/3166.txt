Nice well appointed hotel. Just across street from airport. very nice rooms and some restaraunts in the areas, enough to satisfy most people. Transportation every 20 min to irport. Rooms are quiet and nice beds. Pool is excellent although the workout room is at the back of the hotel, I guess it's okay since you have to walk to get there. restaraunt in hotel is okay but has hotel prices. Cookies are GREAT! If you want to go into downtown Seattle you can go across street to get on a bus and get right downtown, it's really easy. Overall has a very good rating but it is Hilton prices.

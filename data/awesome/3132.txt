Overall a great stay. We stayed here for three nights over Memorial Day Weekend. I would not change anything. Very clean, big rooms. We booked through their website that included valet parking in the price, otherwise if you have a car, its an additional 26 bucks a night. The beds are very comfy and the rooms have a great view. Our room was on the 10th floor and never waited more than 30 seconds for the elevator, very quick. There are tons of restaurants located within walking distance along with the Public Market on the Water Front. Only about a 10 Min walk. Don't miss the restaurant located next to the lobby, Vons. It has a great dinner and drinks.

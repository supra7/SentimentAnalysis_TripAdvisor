As Seattle isn't overly big, the city is quite easy to get around. This hotel is the perfect choice for a staying downtown. Four blocks from the public market, 1-2 blocks from all shopping fans, and easy access to the Space Needle, and local restaurants, (as well as two starbucks nearby). The hotel itself is as hip as they come. Great decor, very comfortable bedding, and considerable attentive staff who will help you out at every opportunity. The sushi from the Red Fin restaurant (part of the hotel) is delicious too. I would definitely stay at Hotel Max again.

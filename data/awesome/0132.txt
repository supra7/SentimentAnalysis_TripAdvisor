I got a very reasonable discount rate for this hotel, then showed up several hours early, thinking that an early check in was unlikely, but figuring I'd give it a shot. Not only did they let me check in early, because I had signed up for their "Klimpton In Touch" program to get free internet, they also upgraded my room to a suite! And they gave me a $10 coupon to raid the mini bar. The room was giant, with two flat screen tvs, and really two separate rooms - the bedroom, and another room with a desk and couch(!) separated by a curtain. When I called the desk to ask if it was possible to print out a boarding pass for my return flight, they just asked for my confirmation #, printed the pass out for me, and slid it under my door (so no one was even expecting a tip or anything). The room was great, the staff was friendly and competent as can be, the price was unbeatable, the location (just blocks from Pike Place Market) was perfect, and they even gave me a free newspaper of my choice every night (except Sunday, where only the local paper appears to have been an option -- the one flaw! :-) Just a great overall experience.

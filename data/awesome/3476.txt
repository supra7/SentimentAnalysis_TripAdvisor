I spent a girls weekend there and we stayed in a Deluxe Room. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's in the heart of downtown Montreal within walking distance to restaurants, shops, clubs... etc. It's very beautifully decorated and very secure as you can't use the elevator without a programmed key card. The rooms are very big and the beds are very comfortable. There is an espresso maker, a kettle, a microwave and utensils in the room. The staff was courteous and friendly and check-in was a breeze. They also offer complimentary coffee or tea in the lobby should you arrive early and have to wait for your room. The spa has amazing services and a very relaxing atmosphere. There's also a rooftop hot tub with an amazing view of the city. Although the hotel is pricey, you definately get what you pay for. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

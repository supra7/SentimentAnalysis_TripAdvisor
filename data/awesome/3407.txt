This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and would highly recommend it prior to flying out of SeaTac Airport. It is a great location, right at entrance to the airport. The hotel has free WiFi and the staff was very friendly and professional. If you are looking for a good hotel, at a reasonable price, this is the one.

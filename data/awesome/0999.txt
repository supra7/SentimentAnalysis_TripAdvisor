Clean, elegant, classic and comfortable are the words that come to mind when I think about my stay at Mayflower Park Hotel. The staff were exceptional! I was greeted first by a most gracious valet, and then by 'John', one of the front desk guest service agents; very professional and attentive. I would certainly stay there again and recommend Mayflower Park Hotel to anyone looking for accomodation in Seattle.

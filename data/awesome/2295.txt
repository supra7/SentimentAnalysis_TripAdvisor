Just completed a stay at the Sorrento Hotel with my wife and her parents. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite, which was great because it gave us plenty of room for our three night stay. The room was wonderful, with plenty of light, very nice furnishings, comfortable beds, and amazing storage space. The number of drawers in the room was amazing, and the storage space in the bathroom was the largest I've ever seen in a hotel. I cannot say for sure that all rooms would be furnished like ours was, but we were in room 501 and it was great. The service was fantastic. As soon as we were taken up to our room, the concierge let us know about a few local tricks to avoid walking up and down so many hills. As some previous reviewers have noted, this hotel is located up a hill from several of the downtown Seattle sights. There are some routes that can be taken to minimize the elevation changes between the hotel and other points of interest. Of course the best way to avoid walking the elevation changes is to use the hotel's car service. They have a wonderful Mercedes small SUV. You need to talk to the concierge to arrange rides, but we had very good luck in getting rides to our destinations downtown and even were able to get rides back on nearly every occasion. I want to particularly point out how helpful Brian, one of the folks on the concierge staff was in helping us with our stay. He was so helpful and kind to us. We loved Seattle and loved the Sorrento Hotel.

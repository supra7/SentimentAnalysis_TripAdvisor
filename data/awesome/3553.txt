This is the most magnificent property, the BEST location and the service is extraordinaire. Walk to St. Catherine and Crescent St, the Bell Center or arrange for the Bellman to take you to "Old Montreal." It just doesn't get any more convenient. The nightlife, no taxi needed. The fabulous restaurants, no taxi needed. Sporting events, across the street. Concerts, I'm sure this is were the "stars'" stay. The accommodations are superb, Internet access is FREE. A beautiful spa, excellent fitness equipment (with a view) and salt water pool and hot tub. The outdoor deck has a view of Mont Royal and the setting sun, BYOB. You can't go wrong at the Crystal, I wish they'd franchise so I could stay at them worldwide.

Just got back with my husband and we had the most amazing time ever...we have been to Secrets Capri a couple of years ago and we also had an amazing time. I actually liked Maroma Beach a little better because they have a night club but both resorts spectacular. The food, the pool, the workers were all fantastic but most of all the beach took my breath away. You will never regret if you come here. Secrets resorts will always stay with us forever.

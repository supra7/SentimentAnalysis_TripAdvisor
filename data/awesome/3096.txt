I only have the most wonderful, glowing things to say about Hotel Max. The rooms are so stylish and comfortable- the bed was like a cloud!!! The staff are so friendly and helpful, the small exercise room is so convenient. I loved that the location was downtown and so close to the market, Belltown, Capitol Hill, etc. I would recommend a room on a higher floor with a good view. I was a solo and found the standard room to be absolutely perfect. I miss that bathrobe!!!

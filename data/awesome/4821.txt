This was a great resort for our honeymoon. Despite the website pictures, which are slightly outdated, there are two resorts to one side of Secrets, but after you pass them it's open beach and very private. We are beach lovers, and the ability to walk a beach for over a mile in both directions without hitting any other resorts was wonderful and quite unique for any resort now-a-days. The food and service were excellent and even with alcohol included no one was overly noisy or drunk as seen at other all inclusive resorts. The value at this resort is outstanding, additionally the local tours are favorably priced versus Caribbean resorts (i.e. Dolphin encounters were about half the price). This is a great resort for couples and the Secrets team goes above and beyond to ensure you have a romantic and memorable vacation.

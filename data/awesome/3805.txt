Well, this was my tenth time to the mayan area and hands down the best resort I have ever stayed at period....actually the best resort ever. I know people like to read the bad reviews because I do.....but I am convinced that those people go away looking for problems to complain about or are just impossible to please. We discussed this with other guests and they agreed....there is nothing to complain about. The food was great...the japanese was awesome, the drinks also great (just ask for premium if you want it....eg. Baileys), we had the swim up and loved it (heated), the pool was also heated (maybe alittle small), the room was great(cleaned everyday), the service was the best....you want it just ask....room service food was great and fast (they will even bring six packs of beer to the room)...this was great when using the swim up, the beach was beautiful, with a bar and waiters.....lots of pics already on this site so I won't bother adding more.....Not much else to say but go and have fun.....any questions email me.

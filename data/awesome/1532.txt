Stay two nights this past weekend. Front desk check in was very courteous and efficient. The concierge was very knowledgable and recommended two good restaurants. Taxi ride to/from airport is approx. $40-45. Great location to the Market, music museum, symphony hall, retail shops and restaurants plus easy access to sky link/rail. The concierge recommended 2 good restaurants: Bocca Cafe for breakfast next to the Market and Tap House Grill for late night (after 10pm) dinning. Bocca Cafe has lots of Dungeon Crab breakfast entres, and Tap House Grill has 160 beer on tap with good quality bar food (Zagat rated also). Get a well marked and colorful downtown area map from the concierge showing all the restaurants, stores, and places of interests.

Wow. The Sheraton was great! We got a great price and booked in the new tower, added a note on our online reservation, and our room was beautiful and spacious. From the moment we got there we had impecable service - all the staff were helpful and friendly. There were many clerks at the desk ready to check us in. We needed an early check in by about 4 hours and we were easily accomodated. we parked our rental car outside for a few minutes and was easily accomodated then as well. the room was clean and full of modern amenities and decor, including complimentary water bottles and comfy bedding. there were also photographs of dale chihuly glass pieces in our room which was a nice touch. I almost forgot to mention the flat screen TV too! There was free internet/computer/printing in the marble floored lobbby for surfing the web or online flight check-in. There was a restuarant, bar, and coffee shop in the hotel but we didnt use it. The location was prime down-town area easy walking distance to all the attractions - pike place, monorail, etc. We loved it and would definately recommend it! TIPS: Take the airport shuttle bus to and from this hotel instead of paying $40 for a cab one way!!! You'll pay something like $22 round trip per person with the airport shuttle. Call the hotel ahead of time for information. Also skip the over-priced cab and take the bus system around the city of seattle - its easy and $1.50 per trip, free if you stay in the downtown area. Look up the bus schedule/routes online from the hotel lobby computers!

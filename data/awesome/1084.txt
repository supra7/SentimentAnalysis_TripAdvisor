We chose the Mayflower Park because of excellent Trip Advisor reviews, and we were not disappointed. We had a corner suite, which was spacious and comfortable. It was nice to be able to relax in the living room before retiring to the comfortable bed-- and 2 bathrooms was a real treat, cutting down on our get-ready time in the morning. All this for the price that others charge for a plain small room! We enjoyed a cocktail at Oliver's and dinner and breakfast at the Andaluca restaurant-- both were beautiful rooms with good food and service, and coupons from the hotel. The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping, banks, dining, and freeway access. I wholeheartedly recommend the Mayflower Park.

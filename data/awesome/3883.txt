I work for an international entertainment company and travel 100% of the time for my job and was finishing up an assignment in Toronto, Canada. Having grown up in Australia I was desperate for some beach time and a little time to unwind after a particularly stressful couple of months. I was a little reserved about booking an all-inclusive resort as I had been advised by friends that sometimes the quality of food and alcohol at such places was less than satisfactory. But, in pursuit of a worry-free (and cash-free!) vacation, I decided to try Secrets Maroma Beach. I certainly did not regret it! From the first greeting at the front steps, immediately followed by a chilled champagne and fresh, fragrant towel, the check-in process was painless and my personal concierge brought me to my room. What a palace! The complex was huge, but not too over-bearing as there were no tall stories, and there were plenty of places to get away from the party crowds. There were enough activites to keep anyone entertained, at any time of the day, and if you are like me - and just want to relax by the beach or pool with a cocktail and generally absorb the beach atmosphere - it was definitely quiet enough to do so. The service was incredible, the food and beverages were of an incredibly high standard and the accomodation was amazing. I would defintely return to this location, and recommend it to friends and family.

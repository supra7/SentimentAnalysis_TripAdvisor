All of our expectations were exceeded on this trip. My wife and I have traveled extensively and agree that our experience with Secrets tops them all. The room was spacious, clean and beautiful. The resort was big enough but not too big. The food was amazing in each restaurant including the breakfast buffet (normally we wont go near a buffet), and the Service was the shining star of secrets. Also room service is 24/7 fast and as good as the restaurants. We can't say enough about the staff of this resort. From the very second on the property we felt welcome. Check in was a pleasure that only took a few minutes. Each building has it's own concierge and ours was wonderful. She was always around to help with anything from requests for the mini bar to arranging transportation back to the airport when our trip was over. This must be a good company to work for because you just can't fake the attitudes that all the staff have here. Each one was pleasant and accommodating. Always quick to smile and help out in any way they could. They have an entire group of staff who's sole purpose is to make sure you are having fun. Entertainment is there if you want it and not obtrusive if you don't. You can have any type of vacation you want it to be. Relaxed and secluded one day to party games at the pool the next. You really can make it any kind of trip you want and the staff is there to help in any way they can. We will definitely ber going back to Secrets Maroma and look forward to discovering other resorts owned by AM. I think Secrets in Punta Cana will be next!

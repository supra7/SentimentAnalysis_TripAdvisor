My now wife and I flew ourselves and 30 friends and family down to Mexico to get married at Secrets Maroma beach, under the terrific supervision of their wedding coordinator Cecilia Reyes. My wife, who has worked extensively with top clients in fashion public relations, and most of our guests would agree, that we had THE PERFECT WEDDING here. Our friends and family (as well as ourselves) still cannot get over it! The WEDDING - Cecilia Reyes did a SUPERB job with everything, from coordinating the minister, photographer, videographer, decor and staff. She gave us ample options for location, delicious food choices, and decorative accents. Cecilia was also very flexible and accommodating with any last minute changes, but above all else, friendly, smart, and an absolute pleasure to work with. The Food - Definitely worthy of five stars, with amazing steaks, seafood, a buffet on par with the best in Vegas, and top notch drinks. Good wine too! Between well executed French and Italian cuisine to delicious sushi and hibachi, we did not have enough time in one week to try all the delicious food. The Staff- Very courteous and friendly, Antonio at the Ocean grill is a typical example of the wonderful staff that work there. Smiling and eager to help from the minute you enter the lobby. The Location - As an avid kiteboarder, and lover of the ocean, the beach was absolutely beautiful with soft white sand, shallow azure water extending well off shore with no rocks to stub your feet on. The hotel also sits fairly isolated from others and there is a beautiful point to walk to heading south along the water. NOT crowded. We also had an amazing time sailing the hoby cats, and sea kayaks - readily available! And the wind was good too... The Rooms - Beautiful decor, elegant tile work, and rich dark espresso wood work. Our Wedding and Stay - Amazing.

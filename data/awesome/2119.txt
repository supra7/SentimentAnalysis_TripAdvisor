We booked this hotel through Expedia because it was a great deal and looked very nice. We have booked hotels online before but never know what to expect. This one exceeded our expectations--Upon check-in, the staff upgraded us to a king bed with a balcony at no extra charge. The rooms were very nice and the bathroom was spectacular. The bed was super comfy and the fireplace was a great addition to a romantic getaway in the city! The hotel location was perfect--a couple blocks from Pike Place, about 5 blocks from downtown shopping and right on the water! The staff was friendly and polite and the dining room is amazing. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great location, cozy guest rooms and great views!

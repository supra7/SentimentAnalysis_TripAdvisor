This is the second time here, i found this place, by accident on the net, using the room saver coupon $37 out the door per night, for 2 people add $5 each additional.( i think). Last time was perfect last year, and this time is no exception, close to restuarants, clean, great water pressure, sink is ouside the shower and toilet, so it is perfect for getting everyone ready , now it is small room and small bathroom but it works and is clean, no smells. Note dry off inside shower stall as it is a large shower stal but a small bathroom. Staff is very helpful, the breakfast is lovely, simple but great, good coffee. Ac works perfect. Flat screen tv toaster oven and fridge in room, king size bed, and table and chairs, coffee maker, and closet drawers, window. Bed is super comfortable. Slept best (3 week vaca) and best bed yet. Boutique style, and cozy, and comfortable, no body bothers you. Towels and linen are great and it has a pool and one computer but they print stuff for cruises, airport etc. It is a hidden treasure. One can enjoy relazing without knowing your spending a fortune. We have done this for the past 3 years, wish we had known about this place the first year. Remember everyone says you dont spend much time in the room but by goodness, the room has to be decent at the very least, so this hotel is like a fancy smancy one, laid out better, and affordable. I must say i dont think they have shuttle, but we had a rental, and they say there are other shuttles around. And shopping is not close. approx. 16km to ross store etc. but wall mart is only 7 kms away.

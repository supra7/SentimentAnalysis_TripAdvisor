Due to unforeseen circumstances, I found myself looking for a hotel in my area. I remembered the few hotels in the White Marsh area and immediately called the Hilton. They quoted me a single king bed at $199. I then asked for military discount and the room came down to $99. Wow! What a great surprise. Especially since $199 was very high. When I got there, I definitely saw why the hotel had higher prices. WHAT A GREAT HOTEL!!!! The room had a fridge, microwave, and nice coffee area. Great sitting area with a couch and desk. And the bed! The bed was great! It molds to your body and is amazing. After a rough day, it was very nice to have such a comfortable place. I loved that they also offered free internet. If need be, I would stay here again, and I would def recommend to out of town guests. BTW, the front desk girl was very friendly and she seemed to genuinely enjoy her hotel and her job.

Accomodations, staff and food was all excellent. Everyone up and down the line seemed genuinely interested that you were having a good time and getting what you wanted. There were a lot of nice 'extras' here. There was a Concierge located in each building (about 36 rooms per building). Isabella was our concierge, she was the best, always called us by name, always cheerful, always tended to anything we needed. In addition to beverage service, the waiters on the beach had a limited menu of lunch items that you could order. There were also waiters walking by the pool and beach with trays of snacks and deserts. A push cart of sushi made it's way thru the pool area each day ... a push cart of ice cream treats. This extra service was very much appreciated. 24 hour room service was prompt and excellent. The Buffet was excellent with a broad selection. Food in the ala Carte restaurants was very good. Food service in the ala Carte restaurants was slow. Immediate seating, but 2 to 2.5 hours for dinner. The waiters were still attentive, getting drink refills and more bread. But it was slow. This was very enjoyable vacation! The staff was the best i've had the pleasure to encounter.

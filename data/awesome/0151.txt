My wife and I stayed at Kimpton Seattle Monaco last week as part of 40th wedding anniversary visit to Seattle. On arrival we learned that we had been upgraded toa suite. We were presented with a $20 restaurant gift card. And when we returned from theater and dinner there was a bottle of iced champagne in our room. We are big fans of Kimpton. I have found their service extremely good anywhere I travel. But the Monaco staff really went the extra distance, even when I request a coffee/tea maker be snet to the room and specified they send up two large mugs with the Kimpton logo them. The location is great, the hotel quiet, the rooms large and as noted above the service is super.

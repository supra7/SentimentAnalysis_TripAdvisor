Not only does the old world charm permeate through it's entire staff, it is a magical place that produces the fondest of memories. From the top to the bottom, this establishment impressed me, which is not easy to do. Aside from the aesthetic beauty, the real beauty lies with the employees and staff... exceptional to say the least. So warming that I left with new friends and a strong urge to come back for a weekend getaway. Top notch everything. Don't take my word for it, experience it for your self! Injoy! :)

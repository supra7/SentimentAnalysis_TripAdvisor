Recently went to Seattle for a business trip. Co-workers suggested staying at Hotel Andra and I couldn't have been more happier with my stay. For business purposes, the hotel was conveniently located and the staff and rooms were wonderful. Hotel Andra offers free wi-fi for all guests so it was very convenient for me to check emails when necessary. During non-working hours, the hotel was walking distance from the waterfront, Pike's Place, and three Tom Douglas restaurants - one being Lola located in the lobby (if you are a foodie!). Next time you are in Seattle, I strongly suggest staying at this boutique hotel.

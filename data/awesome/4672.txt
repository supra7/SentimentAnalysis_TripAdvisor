If you're looking for a place that has it all, then check out Secrets Maroma Beach. I honestly can't say enough great things about it. My husband and I first went there for our honeymoon, and then have since been back two more times. I was reading some of the other reviews that were negative and the only response I have to them is: If you can't be happy/pleased with Secrets Maroma Beach, then maybe you're just an unhappy, difficult person. What could you possibly complain about when Secrets Maroma is so great? Our room this year was the swimout room which was worth every penny! Their honeymoon suites are enormous and the decor of all of the rooms is very cool. We had amazing food; you'll never eat so much! Make sure you check out the World Cafe breakfast buffet. They have everything you can think of! The staff is soooo wonderful. They are literally waiting to help you out with whatever you need and they do it with a smile. You feel like they're really sincere and genuinely happy to help. The scenery is perfect; there's a reason why they've been voted the best beach several times. They keep the grounds and beach so clean. The water is really that beautiful turquoise color in the photos! The resort (pool, restaurants, rooms) are clean and quiet. They offer activities to do, but if you're like we were and want to do nothing that's okay too! We give Secrets Maroma Beach an A+ all across the board. They really can not improve on anything! Can't wait til next year!

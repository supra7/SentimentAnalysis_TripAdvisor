Where do I start? I stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for 6 days and 6 nites. I chose the hotel based on the location and the good reviews it got from Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. The service I experienced was excellent, first class.Everybody at this hotel make you feel special. Everyone was so attentive and so helpful, from the front desk staff to the Concierge, ALL the staff. My room was a Deluxe Queen and very elegant. After a long day exploring the city it was a pleasure to come to my room to relax and get a good nites sleep. The bed was elegant and very comfy. I also liked the fact that the room had a coffee maker with complimentary coffee and an electronic safe. I was also told at the front desk that if I wanted to a small refrigerator could be brought to my room at no extra charge! The location of the hotel was also excellent. It is centrally located and within walking distance to many great attractions. There is a shopping center (Westlake Center) very close to the hotel where you can do a lot of shopping or grab a bite to eat at the food court. On the third floor you can buy your tickets to take the monorail that takes you to the Seattle Center area where the Space Needle and other attractions are located. A few block south of the hotel you find the famous Pike Market. I strongly recommend starting your day with breakfast at Lowells Restaurant at the Pike Market. Its very affordable and the three floor restaurant has excellent views of the waterfront. In sum, I had a great stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel and whenever I go back to Seattle I will stay there again. :-) PS. If you are traveling solo it is more affordable to take the Grey LIne Downtown Airporter that takes you from the airport to many hotels in downtown Seattle. I was dropped off at the Westin Hotel which is less than a block away from the Mayflower Park. I only paid $25 for the round ticket. A taxi would have cost me $35-40 one way.

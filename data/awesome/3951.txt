This resort is nothing short of spectacular. I find that the guests as well as the staff and surroundings all add to the experience and personality of a resort. Secrets was no different. There was an international mix of clientele with the majority of guests coming from the US. I found the guests that holidayed there not to be overindulgent of the free, substantial and continuous supply of alcohol that can sometimes be the bane of all inclusive resorts! Apart from honeymooners, the guests were generally celebrating a special marital milestone and therefore there was a good mix of ages. You could go mad if you wanted but eventually the serenity of the place got you and you relaxed into a pedestrian pace of enjoyment and relaxation. The food was fabulous and constantly available. The staff were friendly and unobtrusively at hand. The hotel was well presented and maintained. The facilities were always available and encouraged. The spa was an expensive extra but well worth a visit. For half a day there with a half body massage for two people it was $300, but we had some complimentary vouchers to the value of $200. It was a fabulous day of pampering. Well worth the extra money, time and effort of going. However, we did have some money taken from our room which we had neglected to put in the safe. The perpetrator was either a contractor employed to fix our whirlpool bath in the room, or the maid. Given the poor wages of the locals, it is prudent to lock up all valuables. A very slight blot on an otherwise fabulous holiday.

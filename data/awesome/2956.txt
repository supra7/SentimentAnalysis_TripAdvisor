The Hotel Max was a great place to stay. The room was clean and modern. The staff was available, friendly and courteous. I was there for 3 nights and enjoyed my stay completely. We were able to check in early and our room was good sized, but it may have been because our room was a wheelchair accessible room. Also, the elevators are small, but manageable.

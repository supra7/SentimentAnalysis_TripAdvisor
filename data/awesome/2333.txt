I must admit I was a little suprised by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at The Sorrento Hotel. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in making our stay the best it could be. The accomodations were really nice, as I had expected from other reviews, with plush bedding, robes, lovely furnishings, etc. Our room was a little small, but from what I could tell, one of the smallest they have (we went for the cheapest rate!) and was more than adequate. Also each room has a mini business center with free internet access, a fax, printer and office supplies! It really came in handy for printing out tourist information we found on the web once we got there. They had an excellent jazz singer performing Saturday night and afterwards we got a great recommendation from the valet for a new wine bar that was exactly what we were looking for. I generally like trying different places when I return to a city, but I think I'll be staying at The Sorrento then next time I'm in Seattle!

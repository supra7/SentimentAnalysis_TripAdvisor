The resort was one of a kind this was the first all inclusive adult only resort my wife and I have ever stayed at. It did the disapoint from start to finish the staff waited on us like we were royalty. Only thing I would change is to go alittle later in the yr got to cold to enjoy the water at night would recommend going from may on to enjoy the warmer weather. My wife and I will definately be back next yr if possible.

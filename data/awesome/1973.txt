My Wife and I just spent our 11th aniverisary at the Andra for the Weekend. I can't find a single negative thing to say about this fine hotel. Which for me is very unusual, I can usually always find something to ding an establishment on. But not the Andra. Our room was spectacular (when we told them it was our aniversary they gave us a free double upgrade). They made dinner reservations for us at a very nice restaurant. they sent us a complimentary bottle of Champagne and were at all times helpful and pleasant. Though I didn't bring my laptop with me, they do have internet in the rooms. Everything was clean and very well maintained. The decor was exceptionally well done. Their location is premium, they are just a few blocks from most everything you might want to do in downtown Seattle, Pike Street Market, Monorail to Space Needle, the shopping district, short cab ride to the ball fields. We rode the train up and I just couldn't have picked a nicer place for us to spend our aniversary.

I extended a business trip into the July 4th weekend and stayed at the Mayflower Park the entire time. My girlfriend flew out to stay with me and we both agreed that the hotel was one of the biggest 'wins' of the trip. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, the potato croquettes at Andaluca are not to miss. The only downside was that the air conditioning wasn't all that powerful in the room and made it difficult to sleep. However, the staff were happy to provide a fan and that took care of that.

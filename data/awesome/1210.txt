We had not been to Seattle in a few years and we wanted to find an nice hotel in downtown that was reasonably priced. The Mayflower Park met all these criteria. So we took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle (a great ride in both directions) and checked in at the Mayflower. When we checked in, the front desk got us a very quiet room that actually had two separate bathrooms (it was nice to be able to spread out). The service was excellent throughout and we got some good tips from the concierge on what to do and where to eat. The location was excellent, a few blocks away from the Pike Street Market and right at the termini of both the monorail and the new streetcar to Lake Union. In addition, downtown buses are free so we only needed a taxi once (after a tiring day and evening on the waterfront).

What a great hotel and the best position with views over the harbour. Each afternoon spent watching the sun go down over the water enjoying a drink on the roof top area. Very close to the makets and city shopping area. Staff were only too heapful to assist with directions.Some rooms dont have views so the higher the better facing the harbour

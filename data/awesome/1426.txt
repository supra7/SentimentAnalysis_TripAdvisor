My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance on our first trip to Seattle. The hotel finished the remodeling and looks great! The staff was very friendly and helpful! We got a city view room on the 14th floor and loved it! Very modern decor, plasma TV, in room fridge, large bathroom, comfy bed! Great location! Within walking distance to everything or a free downtown shuttle right outside of the hotel. We will stay here again the next time we visit Seattle! Plus, you can't beat the $69/night rate we got on hotwire!

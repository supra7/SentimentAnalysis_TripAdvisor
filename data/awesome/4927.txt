I am very impressed with this resort. We had a truly relaxing time and lots of fun. The place is run well. The "entertainment team" has really good events planned- my favorite was a live concert with an awesome American band and a Brazilian acoustic band on the beach at night under the stars.... Food is excellent, service could not possibly be better. People are very kind, helpful, but not pushy, they just make you feel welcomed and relaxed. Their answer to any special request is "of course"- they really try very hard to have you to have a blast. The beach is spectacular, water is beautiful, pools are perfect, great drinks, very nice rooms, personal concierges in each building. I think it is really hard to imagine what else could they improve or add to this place. They even offer daily tennis lessons and they have catamarans you can take out to sail with. You will not be disappointed regardless how high your expectations or needs are- obviously we were very impressed.

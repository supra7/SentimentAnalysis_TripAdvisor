Really enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton Seattle Downtown. Friendly staff, very helpful concierge, conference food catered by Sheraton was excellent. Great eco program when you don't use housekeeping services the next day they give you a $5 gift card to their snack bar/restaurants! Walked everywhere, 6 blocks from Pike's Place Market/waterfront and close to tons of shopping, restaurants, movie theatres. Gym was clean and up to date. Check out Ummelina spa near 4th and Pine! Would definitely stay here again.

Great hotel. We stayed one night - and not all hotels will accept a one night Saturday booking. The booking was straight forward, and cost very reasonable, and the hotel is very well situated for downtown Seattle. The valet parking is efficient and costs comparable with surrounding car parks. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at all times, and the overall style of the hotel is very cool and uber-stylish. Although not a "family" hotel, our teenage children loved it - but you might have to explain what the intimacy kit and battery driven device available for purchase in the room are for... The rooms were of reasonable size, and the furnishings, bedding and fittings are to a high standard. I would not hesitate to recommend Hotel Max if you want a high style, boutique hotel at reasonable cost in downtown Seattle.

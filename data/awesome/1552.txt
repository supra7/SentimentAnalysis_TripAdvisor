Lovely hotel. Divine beds, omg, like a nest. You just sink in and never want to get up again. I didn't think I cared so much about the comfort of beds, but these got my attention. Very quiet. Did not hear a peep out of our neighbors, if there even were any. Just very nice overall. Ideal location with an EASY walk to the market and the monorail and light rail station at Westlake, as well as good shopping. Charge for wifi in the room is annoying, but just be aware of it. I would not hesitate to stay here again!

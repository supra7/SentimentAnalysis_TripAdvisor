The hotel is beautiful. It has an impressive lobby. Stay in the pike tower if you have a chance. We had a peak view of the space needle. Conveniently located about 5 blocks up from Pike's place and 3 blocks over to the monorail to the space needle. If it's raining hard take the monorail to the space needle ($2 each way) versus walking (~1mile). We walked to it and were soaked. My husband said the gym was great...two floors of equipment with great city views. The city grill attached to the hotel was a nice place for late night appetizers. There is also lots of shopping just steps outside the hotel. The hotel was very close to the convention center. The grayline airporter drops off right in front of the hotel. It was really easy to get to and from the hotel with this service. Round trip cost was $18.

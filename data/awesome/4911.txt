I just got back from Secrets Maroma Beach with my husband. To sum up my vacation it was well needed,, and Secrets delivered. We booked the junior suite swimout room which was awesome. It did rain during our stay but momentarily, much to our need we retreated to our own oasis at our patio and private swim out room. I very much recommend anyone going to book this category. As for the preferred club I am a travel agent and dont recommend all the extra money. We didnt do preferred club, our concierge Roger Arroyo treated us beyond Preferred Club . He was attentive to all our needs even had provided my husband with an icepack for shoulder pain. Awesome service at the restaurant. All the workers are friendly and very attentive. The beach was gorgeous. Yes we went without lights the first day we arrived for about 5 hours not happy but the power was restored by dinner. Grounds are lush and beautiful. Beach .. Beach .. Beach.. just perfect... The Spa was to die for if you get the Resort Credit towards the Spa please use it , it is worth it. Great food and wine selection. Room for improvement: Maybe more back up generators/more salsa or latin music at Desires lounge. Extra sprays for mosquitos, more shows maybe a comedy night or Las Vegas nights. The theater was great and love the Oscar movies. More lounge chairs needed at the beach...please. Jules New Jersey

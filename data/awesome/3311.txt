I realize that staying at the airport is not ideal, but if you have to, the Marriott is great! Their customer service was superb. Rooms where beautiful and the beds were VERY comfortable. The indoor atrium beautiful and the pools is warm and fun to swim in. It's also a few blocks away from 13 Coins which has great food and open 24 hours.

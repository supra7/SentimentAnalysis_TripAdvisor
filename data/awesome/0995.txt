This is the second time we've stayed here, and we will definitely be back. The service is cheerful and prompt. The public areas and rooms are clean and in good repair. It is an old building, but it has been lovingly restored, and the care is obvious. We had a single queen room, which was spacious with a sitting area and views of the city. You could see the Olympic Mountains with the Sound, and part of Lake Union, both views through the buildings, but we were only on the 9th floor. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable. They've put a shelf in the bathroom so there is a place to put your toiletries. We at at the restaurant, Andaluca, for the first time, it was cozy and very good. It was an easy 10-minute walk to the Paramount Theater, and shopping is even closer. We love the central location.

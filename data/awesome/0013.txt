I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Hilton Garden Inn in Whitemarsh, MD in June 2006 and had a great experience with everyone at the hotel. The staff was very friendly, they referred a DJ to me whom was great, had a wedding planner who was attentive and kind and overall provided a very positive experience. The food was excellent as well; we had crab cakes and filet mignon w/ twiced baked potatoes and asparagus as the entree. Me and my maid of honors spent the night at the hotel the night before. Our DJ was Craig ? and our wedding planner was Stacey ? (I apologize for not remembering the last names, but they were great) Craig, our DJ had all of the songs that I requested at the wedding, eventhough I gave him the list 1 day before our wedding!!! And he was excellent with orchestrating the events throughout the wedding. My husband and I only had 5 weeks to plan our wedding and so the hotel helped us organize this all in the matter of no time. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a wedding reception site or just a stay for the night.

The service was second to none, Everyone on the staff was friendly, helpful, courteous and could not do enough for us. Our room was beautiful, clean, and the view was like a picture postcard. Top notch food at all restaurants, and the barefoot grill. Room service was fabulous, very timely and the food was hot, loved the delivery box system. Everything was perfect. The pools, beach, bathrooms were always clean. Loved the Mexican Fiesta, but the vendors are a little to aggressive(pushy). Would like to see a bit more entertainment by the pool area. There was a male singer by the pool with a guitar one day he was terrific. I would have liked to see more of him. The bars were great the the drinks fabulous. The beach and pool activities were fun and the staff got everyone motoviated to participate. The only problem we had was our room key, for some reason we just could not get two keys working at the same time. We were together 99% of the time so it did not matter but could be a problem for others. I can't wait to go back! I am telling my family and friends everyone deserves a vacation at Secrets Marmoma Beach. Wonderful time, thank you. "It was our pleasure"

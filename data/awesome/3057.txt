We loved this hotel! We stayed Ap 2 and 3, and then, returned on the 5th. Everyone was so nice, and it is so centrally located. FYI--eat a big lunch and take advantage of the Happy Hour specials for food. Cheap eats-and quite a bit for the money. We ate at Red Fin on the first night, and it was very good. We had breakfast on the 6th, and it was excellent. There are some unusual choices to eat-all great! We LOVE this hotel.

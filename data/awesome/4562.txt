My husband and I spent our 10th Anniversary at Secrets Maroma, October 9-16 and we had a fantastic time. Upon check in, our room was not ready, so we were given a pager. It never buzzed, so around 4p, we went up to the front and our room was ready. We stayed in a tropical view room in building 14, on the second floor. It was at the back of the resort, but it was close to most of the restaurants and evening entertainment, so it was just fine. The rooms were well equipped, and had a nice sized balcony. Our refrigerator was refreshed daily with juices, soda, water and beer. The restaurants were great. We went at 630 each night and had no problem getting in. The menus had a wide variety of choices with selections for those traditional diners and those who wanted to be a little more adventurous - aka Beef Tongue Tacos. All of the food was fantastic. The entertainment was great. We liked that we could be involved if we wanted to, as we were never bugged or forced to participate. The shows in the evening were good and the crowd was always very involved. Twice during the week, they had market vendors there, and a mariachi band. They were fantastic, as well as Armando, the magician. The beach was beautiful, wide as could be - we walked 2 miles each way. If you have any questions, I'd love to hear from you. We also visited Secrets Capri, NOW Sapphire, Zoetry Paraiso de la Bonita, Dreams Riviera Cancun, and Dreams Puerto Aventuras during our stay. I am a travel agent: no fees, just great service.

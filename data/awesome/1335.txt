Although I didn't arrive until nearly 2am, the front desk and bellhop staff were friendly, perky and generally awesome. The morning staff was also very pleasant. I particularly liked the bellhops, very very nice people. The room was pretty small (think European-sized bathroom), but for the price (compared to other hotels within a few blocks of this location) it has everything you need. If you just need overnight accommodation in downtown Seattle, this is a perfect place to be. Walking distance to Pike Place Market and Convention Center. If you are staying for a lengthy period, maybe pay more for a larger space, but this was exactly what I needed when I needed it.

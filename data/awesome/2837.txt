W is in the heart of downtown Seattle. From the time you pull up in your car staff are helpful and attentive to your every need for checking in and beyond. The original art grouping behind the front desk is an indicator of what to expect. Rooms have great views, sculpted, deep pile carpets, dark cherry furniture, small monochrome pictures in oversize frames,beveled glass mirrors, bathrobes for him and her, a superbly comfortable king size bed with delicious pillows, and intriguing attention to detail throughout. There is subtle lighting in the hallways and elevator carpets mysteriously change from "Good Afternoon" to "Good Evening" to "Good Morning" as the time of day dictates. However, you will need deep pockets to stay here. Enjoy bacon and eggs in your room for a mere $23, and don't forget to order coffee as there is none supplied in the room. Pick up a cup in the lobby. W snacks in the room include chips, pretzels, nuts, mints, an "intimacy kit" ( use your imagination here), first aid kit, a corkscrew for the $48 bottle of W wine, and drinks of all kinds from soda to Champagne to enjoy with the Symmetry cd. And don't forget to feed the dog (pets are welcome). Beef and rice dinner for Poochie is only $25. The Bliss bath products will leave you smelling fresh and lemony for a late night date with the DJ and his booming sound machine in the lobby. Outside the door, taxis are always available to take you to Safeco Field for the Mariners game. Or you can walk there in a short half hour. Superb restaurants and wine bars are close by to the W. The hotel seems to appeal to a youthful but serious business clientele. Can't wait to come back and stay here again.

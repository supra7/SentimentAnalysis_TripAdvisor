A friend of mine & I took a weekend trip to Seattle to do some sightseeing and shopping. We booked at the Travelodge for three nights. This was my first time out of the country and I had many questions & concerns. I e-mailed several hotels with a few basic questions and this hotel was the only one out of 6 that actually took the time reply. The manager Rayna was phenomenal! She was very prompt in answering all my questions and helped us get the right room for us. Great location within short walking distance to the Monorail, Space Needle & Experience Music Project. Will definitely stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.

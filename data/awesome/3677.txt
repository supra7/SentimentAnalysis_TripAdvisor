We spent Christmas at Secrets Maroma, we decided to stay here after walking by the February prior when we stayed at the iberostar Grand, down the other end of the beach. Pros: Beach is lovely, food is great, service was spot on, Maid service was good, A great effort was made to set up a lovely dinner and entertainment for Christmas Eve, which I thought was an added touch, all in all we had a great vacation. Cons: if I had to dig deep to find one I would say the only thing was no corona in bottles or cans at the bars whcih I found quite strange being in Mexico, they had them in the room but I wasn't desperate enough to carry them around with me.

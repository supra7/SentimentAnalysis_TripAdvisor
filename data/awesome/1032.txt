Absolutely wonderful hotel staffed by the friendliest people we met in Seattle. From the time the wonderful valet greeted us to the time we checked out, everything was just about perfect. John at the front desk made checking in simple and fun. The room was absolutely charming. Although the bathroom was a little small, the shower was hot with enough water pressure and delightful toiletries were provided. The bed and pillows were comfy and smelled fresh and clean. The location is wonderful. Everything is within walking distance. Macy's is across the street, Pike Place is 3 blocks away, Starbucks is... well, it's Seattle so Starbucks is EVERYWHERE. There's even a drugstore across the street in case you need to pick up sundries you may have forgotten.

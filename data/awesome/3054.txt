My girls Michelle & Coral told me to stay here, so I thought I would give the Hotel Max a try. After a terrible expierance with another Seattle Hotel, I was thrilled to have found a hotel that I really love and will go to whenever in Seattle. (I live in Vancouver, BC and am from the States, so I need to get my America fix often:) This hotel really exceeded my expectations. It is in the most perfect location. We were able to walk to all my favorite shops and even stumbled upon our new favorite bar a few blocks up. The rooms are small, but we were told this by our friends and it did not bother us. Not like we are just going to hang out in the room all day anyways. The room was decorated really well. The bathroom was so cool and had one of the best bathtuns ever! It was nice and deep. Not one of those lame shallow things most hotels have. There was a great flat panel tv and a long desk area that was handy. The closet was a good size and there were plenty of drawers. The BEST part of this trip was the bed. It was a King and it was divine. I slept so well, that I was up and ready to go at 6:30am. That never, ever happens! The sheets were really soft and cozy. I wanted to steal them...but I didn't :) They also had great robes in the room for us to use. OH! They have a PILLOW MENU! Awesome? Yea, I think so. The honor bar was, as per most hotels, way to expensive. A small bottle of wine was $16. And it was not that great of wine...but in the end, I never get things from the room bar. So NBD. I love Hotel Max and cant wait to go again!!!

We went to Secrets Maroma last year and returned because we loved it! What we like about the hotel: - rooms are excellent, the extras - lots of plugs, docking station for iPhone, Nespresso Coffee Maker (!!!) - are very well thought out - the friendliness of the staff, especially the waiters - gourmet style restaurants with very good service, high quality food - large swimming pool Things to improve: - internet connection is really bad, very slow speed - floats are old and worn out, not enough floats available - very bad air conditioning in the fitness center, if you run or work out in the gym, you will sweat like crazy

We stayed with friends including our young children with the intentions of watching Space Needle Fireworks on New Years. A year ago we had a poor experience at another local hotel but thought we would try it again. Our rooms were purchase on Groupon so didn't have alot of expectation. Let me tell you, this Hotel understands the importance of customer service! The Roosevelt staff were friendly on every level. Even during a busy time such as New Years, everything was very well organized and timely. I could write a bunch more but realy hit the jackpot on excellent service this time around. I usually do not repond to this sort of system response but considering the amount of travel I get to do, this is one of 2 hotels I want to rave about !

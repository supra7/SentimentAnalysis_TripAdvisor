My husband and I stayed at our 3rd Kimpton in Seattle Hotel Monaco and once again...we were not disappointed! Love the Kimpton family hotels, pet friendly, hosted evening wine hour and the most friendly staff! We visited the bar in Saerac during the afternoon and had the most delightful waitress and ate breakfast there the next morning and it was just delicious! Great location on 4th Ave...blocks from Pikes Place Market, Nordstroms, Space Needle and so much more!

Now, for $39 you don't have very high expectations,and I may be shooting myself in the foot by telling everyone how great our stay was small room like NYC but you're not there much probably.. Comfy bed, mini fridge, free wi-fi, toaster oven in room,microwave in breakfast area. Shower only comment not complaint. Room was clean and appeared to be recently updated. The place was quiet, flat screen worked well and all in all, we will no doubt stay again, and recommend to friends. Breakfast was the usual continental, we took my brothers advice and picked up a pack of the precooked bacon at Target, add that to your waffles/pancakes, toast and you have a breakfast that will carry you a little farther. While you are there be sure to stop by Houlihans up front. This bar/restaurant has happy hour all day, 2 for 1 draft, $2.50 well drinks, and a breakfast buffet for $6,99 which we quite enjoyed.

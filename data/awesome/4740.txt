We stayed at Secrets Maroma beach in July 2010, and had a great time. We can't fault the hotel in any way. The resort itself is gorgeous and the staff cannot do enough for you while you are there. We had a preferred junior suite with ocean view and it was spacious and really nice. The quality of the food is excellent and the service in all of the restaurants is also excellent. The beach is also gorgeous and quite private as it is part of the hotel. I would totally recommend this hotel. We will definitely we returning as some point.

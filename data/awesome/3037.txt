Wow! The Max lived up to the reviews I read. Cool and Hip; Funky. Truly a wonderful art hotel! How can you not love a hotel playing Niko Case on the background soundtrack??? Excellent front desk service too. We used public transit and the front desk was ever so helpful in pulling up schedules and printing itineraries for us, numerous times. The bar rocked on happy hour and late night beverages and service. Shout out to Craig! Waiter of the year! Downside... Small rooms.... two people cannot pass one another in a typical room; also dark showers after you step UP into the bath rooms. No light above the shower/bath. Could we at least get a candelabra in keeping with the atmosphere? I keed I keed! Overall, most enjoyable and I wouldn't think twice about staying here again.

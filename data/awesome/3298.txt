This hotel was recently updated, vert clean, updated tv, bathroom was very clean and well-lit. For all you germaphobes out there, you will like this hotel. Service was very good, the front desk was approachable and willing to help. We stayed here with points so I'm not sure about the value of it, but our experience was very enjoyable. If we needed to stay near the airport again, we would pick this hotel. It's about 20 minutes from downtown. Ambience is wonderful!

We just returned from Secrets Maroma and enjoyed a wonderful stay! We were a group of 3 couples all celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary this year. We have traveled to several all-inclusives both in Riviera Maya and the Dominican over the years, and would rate this resort as the best so far! We had a swim-out room, which was fun and romantic. Our room was beautiful, the beach and water were wonderful! We had a great time and enjoyed the food and drinks as well. All of the staff members were friendly and went out of the way to provide excellent service. I can honestly say we had no complaints and hope to return in the future!

We stayed here in February for a nice night of relaxation and refuge from the busy work week.. Room was very large, clean and more than what we needed for a night away. Breakfast in the morning was a great benefit altho it a bit scarse from previous Embassy Suites that we have stayed at.Options were a bit limited but still plenty to pick from compared to other non Embassy suite properties. We had previously stayed at the Embassy Suites in Anaheim on a Disney trip and the food choices were alot more varied and lots of food available too....the afternoon reception was a nice touch also, a good margarita and snacks to boot! Will definately stay here again.....C.

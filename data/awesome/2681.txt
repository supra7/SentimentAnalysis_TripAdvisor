Vintage Park is in a good location. The staff is friendly and knowledgable and always greeted us with a smile and hello upon returning to hotel. The 'king premier" room was large and the bed very comfortable plus clean and well-maintained. Enjoyed the wine hour in the cozy lobby and the great drinks/friendly service in Tulio's bar. Breakfast was also good. Loved the ambience as is usual for a Kimpton hotel. Definitely has more character and charm than the large and impersonal hotels. Would definitely recommend this hotel for singles or couples.

Recently spent 5 nights at the Mayflower while attending a conference in Seattle. The location is fantastic as noted by other reviewers. You are walking distance to everywhere. My stay was very nice. My room was quite comfortable. I was very impressed with the quality sheets, pillows, mattress, towels and bathrobes. The only caveats would be the fitness center. I travel alot and rely on hotel fitness centers. This one had only a few pieces of equipment. The other would be the wireless in the room, although complimentary, it was excrutiating slow. This would not stop me from staying here again but I mention in case these are important factors for you.

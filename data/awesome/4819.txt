My husband and I went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon this past week. We were so impressed with the level of service we received and how absolutely GORGEOUS the entire resort is. The beach is the best I've ever seen and I have been to many beaches! The staff was so nice - I cannot stress how courteous, respectful, and accommodating they were. They made our honeymoon so special - more than we could've hoped for - the entire resort exceeded our expectations. The photos online do not even begin to do it justice. We were so sad when we had to leave. We are already planning our next trip for sometime during the Winter and then again for our one year anniversary. You MUST see this luxurious paradise!!

and had booked the inn on TA reviews. We arrived very early and tired, the 4PM check in is always an irritant, however, Paul , at the front desk was very considerate concerning our request to check in early and got us right into a room,we will not forget this gesture. The hotel is located in prime tourist friendly territory, and staff were all excellent, helpful, courteous, professional...hotel is very clean, well decorated and very well kept and updated, looked as if it had been recently painted. The terrace on the 5th floor is wonderful, and that is a real plus at this property on warm days of course. Our only complaint ....and we are I am sure much more noise sensitvie than most folks...was the street noise. We had a city view room, the least expensive, and I wish we had been forewarned or I had asked, we might have upgraded. Windows are good sound proof windows but takes alot to drown out buses and motocycles, even from the 5th floor. We had to take sleeping pills in the end. But this was the only complaint...bath was super clean, supplies plentiful and coffee service always available..DOwntown hotels are always expensive, so it was a splurge for us.

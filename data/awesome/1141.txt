We have stayed here for two nigths during a short visit to Seattle on new years eve. Took the light rail from the airport which literally drops you off next door to the hotel in 40 minutes. Location of the hotel is great. We were in walking distance to all the attractions that we wanted to go in downtown. Staff is very helpfull. We arrived quite early around 8.30 in the morning. They checked us in to our room with no problems way before check in time. We stayed in a standard room with a queen bed. The room and the bathroom was quite small. It did not bother us but if you like a bigger room and bathroom then youmay want to book one of the larger rooms. Overall great hotel in a great location.

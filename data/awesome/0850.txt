Stayed at the Crowne Plaza at the start of our cruise to Alaska from Seattle. Because of the flight times we needed to stay at least 1 night in town, but as we had not been to Seattle before we decided to make it a mini city-break of 3 nights. On arrival (as Ambassador Members of Priority Club) we were upgraded to the Executive/Club Lounge which was a great bonus. Our room was the same, but in the Lounge we could obtain tea/coffee and soft drinks most of the day, with a complimentary continental breakfast, and enough food during "happy hour" 5-7, to make an evening meal almost unnecessary. No alcoholic drinks however unlike many other happy hours, but still a great deal which saved us quite a bit of cash. Tried the bar on a few occasions and this was great for food and drinks, although we had to move to find a warm spot as the air-con was cold. Shared the bar with many American College Football fans from Nebraska which created agreat atmosphere. One Resturaunt meal we had was very good. The hotel was in a great location but overall we were disappointed with Seattle and would not chose to stay there again. Vancouver was much better and sightseeing more enjoyable. Would start any future cruises from Vancouver provided flights were convenient and not too costly. Could not fault the hotel in any way!

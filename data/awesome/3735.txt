All I have to say about this resort is the best experience I have had without a doubt if your looking for a vacation with your man or woman this is the place its relaxing and a beauty the resort is breathtaking its super clean every ware u look garden well keeped have men working on them all day everyday your made cleans your room makes your bed and comes back later on to clean your room again and makes your bed for u to go to sleep stock your fridge everyday and snacks and also mini liquor (if u want a lil extra leave a tip in the fridge they will leave u more drinks liquor and snacks) the service is what made this experience everyone no matter who it was would help u till u have what u wanted or was happy they would not let u lift a finger at this resort you are royalty at this resort about 5 people on the beach getting what ever you want the best bar tender while I was there was pablo at the sugar reef bar knows how to make your drink amazing and is soo much fun to talk to one thing I really liked was that the resort staff will talk to you they like to know about you and will never ask or expect a tip the entertainment staff is super nice will go around and they talk to everyone and put on amazing shows the rock show was the best do not miss out you will regret it as for the beach wow clean and always have chairs for you and if not they will make a call to get you one you properly won't even have to ask they are soo on top of things one thing you will want to know if there are angle fish close to shore and a lot and they are huge all they want is to eat soo bring some bread and a camera ,video don't be scared I was at first as they are soo big but harmless you will not see them at first all you will see is eyes and black lines they are white and beautiful fish one thing I will say that I forgot was that they have someone outside your room to book anything u may want spa dinner on the beach etc.. Take a copy of what they offer you will forget its a lot and you will be there for a week use your time wisely and one more this if its in your budget get a swim up well worth the upgrade one thing I really like about secrets everyone is equal no bracelets no one telling you ohh your not a member you are not vip here everyone is VIP well hope you likes reading my review and enjoy

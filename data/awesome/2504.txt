Arriving at the Westin in early evening proved to be absolutely painless. No wait to check in. The desk personnel were friendly and helpful. My request for two beds was easily met. Our room on the 22nd floor was very spacious and extremely comfortable. The view was lovely. Anyone looking for a truly relaxing spot in this busy city would enjoy the Westin! Although the parking (which was very convenient) and food was expensive, that is not unusual for this very cosmopolitan city.

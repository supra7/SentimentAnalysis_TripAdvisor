Top hotel with everything you need. Fantastic service, exceptional food and a lovely beach. Restaurants are a very high standard with a true al a carte menu, it feels really strange to walk out from the restaurants without anything to pay but a tip. We upgraded to a beach front swim out room, these rooms are massive, and three times bigger than the normal rooms with a double fronted pool area and waitress service for food and drink about every 15mins. These rooms come at a cost but are worth every penny. We went on three trips, one being swimming with the whale sharks. These fish are huge and fantastic to see but if you dont have sea legs then be warned. You travel out 20 miles and even on a calm day there is still quite a swell. After the whale sharks they take you to a reef snorkelling but to be honest there nothing great to see. Then they drop you in the shallows at a lovely beach for lunch and drinks from the boat, this is heavenly. We also went on a trip to Chichen Itza, this is a long day but is very interesting and as one of the seven wonders of the world, should be seen. After you stop at a cenote for a swim and then on to a restaurant for something to eat, food and entertainment not the best but you are seeing a true Mexican village and their life style. The other trip was a snorkelling trip, with more fish and corals to be seen. There are quite a few others available, mainly adventure parks but we ran out of time. A trip to Playa Del Carmen by taxi is good for an afternoon/evening, with loads of shops, restaurants and bars. This town has a buzz and is very safe for the tourist, though expect to be hassled to buy. We have travelled to Dubai frequently thinking it was the best (Al Qasr Madinet Jumeriah) but this is equally as good.

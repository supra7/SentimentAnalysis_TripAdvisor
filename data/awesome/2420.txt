We loved the Westin. The service was superb. They took care of every request promptly and courteously. Our convention rate made it very reasonable to stay there. The view of the space needle and the city were breathtaking from our room on the 45th floor. The room was clean with nice bedding and bathrooms. My only complaint is that the Fifth Avenue Restaurant is the only place in the hotel that is open for breakfast, and I did not consider it adequate. It was noisy and too small for the number of customers. Customers have to stand in line to order their food, which was nothing special. The restaurant was not worthy of this fine hotel. Go to Lola's for a much nicer breakfast experience.

I seem to be joining the club when I say I thought this place was great. Good views, comfy bed, I like the toiletries, and the fitness center, and the pool area! The staff was helpful - they let me borrow a phone charger overnight on trust. I did not like the breakfast so much. There are great places to go outside the hotel. Check out The Icon restaurant for a memorable dining ambiance, and also try Adaggio's for the friendliest Northern Italian cuisine. All this and the rain did not get me down!

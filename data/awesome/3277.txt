The breakfast was much better than the typical "continental" at most chains. The breakfast room is set lower and away from the desk traffic and is pleasingly furnished with landscape views from the windows. There was a hotel employee continually cleaning and refilling the available items, and who also would discreetly handle obnoxious or unruly guests. They offered sausage, eggs, English muffins, biscuits, bagels, yogurt, cerealas, toaster waffles, fresh fruit, juices, and a choice of three coffee brews. Copies of USA Today are available for your morning read. The front desk was helpful, even though they were busy. They procured an inexpensive cab for us in under ten minutes and were prompt with their airport shuttle. The room was clean, well furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. I was concerned about the reviews regarding jet or traffic noise, but could not detect any such noise from my room. With the air conditioner running, I could not hear any outside noises. The price for all of this was less than you would pay for comparable chain hotels.

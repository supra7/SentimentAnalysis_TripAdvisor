Double 40th birthday visit with college friends. Could not have been better. Everything - the rooms, the facilities, the beach, the pool - top-notch. The entertainment staff "make" you have fun without being pushy. Miguel, Alejandro and their colleagues are just full of infectious enthusiasm. at the World Cafe sit at a table serviced by Eduardo and you won't regret it. And if your personal concierge is Pilar, you lucked out - great girl who will go out of her way to make sure everything is perfect. Our one complaint was the lack of beach cleaning over the weekend that led to a couple days of weed-choked surf, but that wasn't nearly enough to outweigh all of the positives. Great place.

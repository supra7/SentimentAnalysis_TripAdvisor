Good to great hotel, with a few problems. For its main market though-traveling to and from the airport-its a great option. If you have to park there it costs $18 a night and is somewhat cumbersome. It seemed silly to have a rental car there, so I turned it in at Advantage and walked the mile or so back. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel, I used the 194 to get to SAFECO stadium for a meeting. It cost less than the car by far, was probably faster, and I didn't have to deal with parking downtown. The daily fee for net access is high, and WiFi is only available in the public areas of the main hotel. The hotel can get really busy, and at times the wait to talk to someone on the phone or at the front desk can take a longish time. The gym and pool are really good,for relaxing long haul flights out of your system, and the hot tub is excellent. The rooms are more than adequate, the staff attentive and the 2 concierges especially are really wonderful.

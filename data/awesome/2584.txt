Our family reserved 4 rooms for 2 nights and were upgraded even at our AAA rate. Rooms were very comfortable. Perfect beds with silky smooth sheets and huge fluffy towels in the bath. The staff was always very pleasant and accommodating. Parking was included as well as a simple but adequate continental breakfast. We had a very comfortable stay.

This place is unbelievable!! My beautiful wife and I got there on a saturday at noon for our 2nd honeymoon(first week of October 2011). Our overall experience was fantastic. First they gave us an early check-in, welcomed us home and took us in a golf cart to our private preferred club for the check in. Upon entering our room we found a welcome letter a fruit basket and a bottle of champagne with flowers, nice touch! The jr suite exceeded our expectations and the swim-out was spectacular and very private. Roberto our Concierge was very helpful anytime. The beach was absolutely amazing!!! it was almost neon/turquoise color almost unreal, my wife and I fell in love with it. The pools were also very very nice. lots of food everywhere all plates were decorated mainly in the restaurants. Damian at the French restaurant gave us an outstanding service (Damian if you read this we're the guys with the big cameras lol) We can't wait to come back again!!!! we went to Secrets SilverSands last year but the beach at Maroma is far superior. Also Maroma's got more day beds hidden here and there and the overall feeling is more romantic plus it's a larger facility. The food in the restaurants at both resorts are leveled.

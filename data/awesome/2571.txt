My wife and I stayed there with 2 of our grandchildren. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. The location is very convenient to walking to the Space Needle, and is a doable walk down to the market area. The building was older, but the inside of the building and the rooms were fine. My first test is the cleaninless of the room, as well as pulling back the covers and checking the sheets; they passed on both. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.

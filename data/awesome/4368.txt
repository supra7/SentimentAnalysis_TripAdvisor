Just came back from this lovely resort that has outstanding service throughout the hotel. Staff is friendly, helpful, personal towards their guests. They take every opportunity to remind you that you are on vacation and that you should be enjoying yourself and that they are there to provide you with whatever you need. would highly recommend and would return. No issues or signs of any violence or safety issues or concerns.

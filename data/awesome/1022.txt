We have been staying at the Mayflower when in Seattle over the past several years. The quality of the experience has always been excellent. This hotel has it all. Good location in the heart of downtown, spotless rooms and facilities, but most importantly a courteous, gracious and professional staff -- many of whom have been here for years. That says something to me about how staff is treated by the management. That care is most assuredly passed on to the guests. In addition the hotel has one of the nicest bars (Oliver's) in town with friendly servers and superb bartenders who make a martini for the ages. The restaurant Andaluca is a lovely, romantic room featuring a wonderful Mediterranean menu. Do not overlook their breakfast -- also excellent. The Mayflower offers a singular, civilized experience and I highly recommend it.

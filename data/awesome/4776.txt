We loved our stay here. The staff was wonderful from the moment we walked in the door. Everyone from the waiters to the concierge to the maintenance was super helpful and gracious. Our room was a swim-out and we enjoyed the pool. Our room was always clean and comfortable. It was cleaned twice a day. The food and drink is amazing in all the different restaurants and bars, and we even really enjoyed the buffet in the World Cafe. The breakfast has everything you can imagine and even has made to order eggs and crepes. We also really enjoyed the fresh fruit. The beach was beautiful and relaxing. The staff on the beach is very efficient as well. We took the day trip to Chichen Itza and even though it was a long trip, we felt it was certainly worth it. We also went shopping in Playa del Carmen and really enjoyed it. We loved the stay here and plan on returning.

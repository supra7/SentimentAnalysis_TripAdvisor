The hotel was beautiful and the food was amazing! The bar tender in the preferred lounge was always excellent and attentive. We've stayed at all inclusive resorts in the past, including Dreams Tulum, where drinks were made using cheap liquor and mixes. Secrets however, used top shelf liquor and mixes which was awesome! Between food and drinks I would guess we saved over $1500usd. Another thing we liked was the fact the hotel never seemed crowded. Although, to get the ultimate spot poolside you had to get there pretty early. Overall the experience was excellent, my only complaint, which is more of a laugh than anything were the birds!! Wow!! They were very loud and were up very early. They were actually pretty entertaining through out the day.

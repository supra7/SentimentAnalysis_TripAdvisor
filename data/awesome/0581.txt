We've stayed at The Inn at the Market many times and they get better every time. The people from the front desk to room service are the nicest, most professional staff possible. The rooms are immaculate as is the entire facility. The location is the best in Seattle. You walk out the door and into the center of the fabulous Pike Place Market. The best market in the U.S. Highly recommended.

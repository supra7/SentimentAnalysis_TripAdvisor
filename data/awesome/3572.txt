Went there on a business trip and I loved it soo much, great staff, goergeous suites. Loved the espresso machine in the room and the separate living room! Can't believe all the rooms in the hotel are that great, and I had the cheapest on top of that! Anyways, I would recommend it to anyone coming to Montreal.

We stayed at the Hotel Max on two occasions prior to our cruise to Aaska, and after. The rooms were small due to the fact it was converted from an old building,staying for a week may be a bit challenging, but quite adequate for a few days. Ths staff was great, told us of all the sights to see and how to get around Seattle. The area was great, restaurant next door and room service. Walking distance to Pikes Market and all the shopping you would want. The monorail is only two blocks from the Hotel and takes you to the Space Needle, park, science center and music hall. Upon checking out and getting to the airport we realized we had left some things in the room. When we got back to California I called the hotel and they put me in touch with their houskeeping supervisor. She informed me the housekeepers had not finished the rooms but would get back to me, she called within 5 mins. and had found the items. They were mailed immediately and we received them within two days. Kudos to all the staff. I surely would stay again and recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.

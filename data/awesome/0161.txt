I picked the Monaco because of the favorable reviews from Trip Advisor and I must say they were right. We celebrated our 42nd anniversary in Seattle with a 4 night stay at the Monaco. From check in to check out our experience was like a home away from home. The Front Desk was very friendly - the concierage, Jesse Peterson went out of his way by sending us a bottle of champagne and giving us a 2 for 1 dinner coupon at one of the area's restaurants. We had already eaten at the Sazarac which was excellent and were looking for a new place to eat. He booked our excursions and gave us advice about the area. We loved the free wine from 5 to 6 and got to mingle with a lot of interesting people. The hotel is in a great location - able to walk to Pike Market and the Mono-rail. The Seattle Library is across the street and an architectural wonder - we did our own tour. We loved Seattle and have now found a good boutique hotel chain that gives great service. I am looking forward to staying at their other hotels. We have four in Chicago - all with great restaurants. Our next stay we will order a gold fish. I also liked the idea of pet friendly even though we don't travel with a pet - it's a good thing.

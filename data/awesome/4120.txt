My wife and I stayed here from June 15th thru the 20th. This is our 2nd time to this resort and once again it was amazing. We stayed in the preferred club, which is a great value for the $$. We had internet access, private bar with snacks and a great ocean view from our room. Upon check-in we were greeted by the general manager, the food and beverage manager and our concierge. My wife has a gluten allergy and they were all there to let us know how things would go regarding this allergy. We met with the concierge daily to let him know which of the 7 fantasic restaurants we would be dining in, so he could let them know about the food allergy. At each restaurant that we ate in, the staff were extremely helpful in either suggesting or making things special for my wife. We had a couples massage and got a great $80 discount using the coupons we received when we checked in. The food and drinks are out of this world. They offer top shelf liquor if you ask and the service is non-stop. The house wines are average, but we used more coupons to purchase some of the premium wines with our dinner. The pool is the party spot and lots of fun !!! The beach is one of the best in the world and the water is crystal clear with many fish swimming around. The beach area is much more laid back than the pool area. Make sure you say hi to the dog that wanders the beach in search of friends and food. There are iguanas and coati wandering around the pool area too. The nighttime entertainment is lots of fun, different shows every night. The disco is fun at night too with either a DJ or live band to entertain.

Just returned home from our anniversary train trip from Georgia to the beautiful Pacific Northwest & Vancouver. We stayed at the Max on April 1&2 and were not disappointed. As a matter of fact, we would stay here again. It's convenient to Westlake in the downtown area, so you can take the monorail down to Seattle Center. It's just blocks from Pike Market & the Waterfront. The place is artsy and hip...if that's too much for you, don't stay here, but if you have an open mind and want a truly cool and memorable stay, this is your place. The Front Desk has been ripped on a few posts here, but we found every single employee to be overly helpful, knowledgeable, and personable. I had built an expectation of something different, so this was a welcome surprise. The bellmen were tops as well. I have to admit that we pilferred the room key which has the same cool black and white artwork on it, as all of the guestroom doors. Thanks Max Staff for making this a really great 15th Anniversary. We'll be back!!!

Beaches: Amazing and Beautiful. Maramo beach is world renowned for a reason Staff: Treated us like royalty. Love the service at the beach and pool where they would bring you drinks and hour'derves. The entertainment crew made sure everyone had a great time. Sand and Pool volleyball were daily favorites of ours. Rooms: Not super quiet (you can hear hallway noise) but that didn't bother me since I can sleep through anything. Beds were very comfortable and the cleaning service was nice too. Just be aware the bathrooms are totally open to the room. You have a glass swinging door to the toilet but you don't get a lot of privacy if you know what I mean. Restaurants: GREAT FOOD! which was our biggest worry traveling to mexico. Even the 24 hour room service was great. I recommend the Frech restaurant, so delicious. Although, the breakfast buffet was the highlight of my mornings. 5 star quality and presentation were appreciated. Grounds: VERY clean. I was impressed the way they kept everything pristine. The resort has a simplistic, modern approach and it was nice and felt relaxing. The didn't stick to any Mexico resort sterotypes. Day trips: If considering Chichen Itza then I recommend renting a car from the Avis guy in the lobby. The tours are way too lengthy and eat up a whole day. Take the Tulum route to get down there, find a guide when you get there and head back. Makes for a 6 hour trip vs. a 12. Just leave as early in the morning as you can handle!

Ask for their corner rooms with 2 double beds which is their largest . The hotel windows open to allow fresh air which makes a difference . Comfy beds, welcoming staff. Located right by Nordstrum and downtown shopping. Great location. If you're from Vancouver or Oregon, ask for the Staycation rate which includes the parking and was good value. Recommended.

Review is a bit late but better late than never....We have stayed at various locations in the RM every year for the last 10, twice at Secrets Capri, which we loved. Maroma Beach was everything it was hyped to be and more....from the Five Star restaurants (truly 5*).....to the unbelievable white sand beach....it was paradise.....we upgraded for the seven days to the concerige beach service......it was well worth the extra $40 daily.....from 9am-5pm......they could not do enough for us.....one day it rained so they did not open it...but later in the afternoon, Kevin our beach concerige came to the pool to find us and said he would take care of us at the pool....property is spread out so be prepared to walk a bit......was not a big fan of the nightly entertainment at other places but Maroma Beach was outstanding.....check it out a few nights.....this will be our place for the next few years

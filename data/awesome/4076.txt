Service was very very good and the rooms are exactly as they appear on the website. Location was convenient to the airport. If you're looking for an all-inclusive with good on-site activities, I wouldn't recommend Secrets Maroma. This resort is more about lounging, dining, and the the spa. While food portions ran small, there was no limit to the amount you could order. Overall food quality was quite good. Our three couples have traveled to many places, and I would say that we're pretty particular. Secrets Maroma was the relaxing, stress free, high quality service vacation that we were looking for.

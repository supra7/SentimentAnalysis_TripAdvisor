The service and food were excellent. The pools, beach, restaraunts, room service, and bars were beautiful. We could not have asked for more. The room was beautiful with a really comfortable bed. We still talk about wishing we could have that bed in our house. Everyone is really nice, helpful, and easy to speak with. The Lobster dinner cruise was a great excursion. We miss it! Our only regret was that we could not stay longer. Can't wait to return!

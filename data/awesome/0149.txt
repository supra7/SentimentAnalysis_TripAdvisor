We had 4 rooms for a family celebration, all booked at a prepaid special rate which was a true bargain. Everyone was delighted with the accommodations, roomy and comfortable. Uniformly helpful staff who helped with a medical situation, restaurant pointers, and responded quickly to minor issues, like decaf coffee for the room. There is a big lobby for relaxing in, with afternoon wine and morning coffee. Easy to navigate Seattle from here.

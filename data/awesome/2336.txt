The previous postings do this hotel justice. Fantastic experience. Great customer service...Jerry Hume, Concierge, is top notch and everyone else provided nothing but top level customer service. Room was clean, bed was great, and loved the french press coffee service in the room. It is the little things that make a stay great. Sorrento does a great job.

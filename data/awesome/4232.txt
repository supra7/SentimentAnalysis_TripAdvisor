Went with my wife for our one-year anniversary. The grounds are immaculate, the food is excellent, the service was also excellent. The beach and water are just like the pictures, white sand with beautiful blue water. We had informed that it was our anniversary prior to the trip, so they put a banner on our door, gave us a bottle of champagne in our room, and gave us some "coupons" to the spa (the coupons we got on arrival that everyone gets were actually a better deal if you just get one massage each). Our favorite restaurant was Himitsu, the Asian restaurant. We met a couple that was there for the FIFTH time in 3 years because they loved it so much. We also met a lot of couples/families from Europe. Apparently Riviera Maya is a common destination for Europeans (despite the long flight) because the beaches are better than the Mediterranean beaches. We went to 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen one evening for shopping. It was very safe and busy and we were able to bargain. There were many busy cafes there, too. Tips: 1) If you want a couple of seats by the pool that is adjacent to the beach, you have to get there really early in the morning. If you get there after 9am, you may be out of luck. While all the seats and pools are nice with excellent service, but the seats next to the front pool (adjacent to beach) have the best view. 2) Another tip is to avoid the timeshare presentation that they try to get people to go to when you check-in and at other points during your stay. We heard these are not worth the promotions they offer such as free massages, etc. 3) There is no free wi-fi (even in the lobby) so don't plan on having it.

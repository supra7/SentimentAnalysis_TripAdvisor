We first traveled to this Secrets Maroma Beach resort last May on our Honeymoon. From the get go, the staff was so friendly and helpful. We stayed in a junior oceanview suite that was super nice, clean, and comfortable. There was a king size bed, in-room jacuzzi, mini fridge and awesome views. Not to mention the cute sign on the door that shared with everyone that we were honeymooners, towel art, rose petals, champagne, and chocolate! The resort itself sits on a beautiful beach, with clear blue water, and soft sand. There are plenty of pools just off of the beach with great loungers for those seeking sun or shade, and availability to make reservations for cabana beds on the beach as well. The food is incredible, with several restaurants to choose from. There is pool service during the day for not only drinks, but lunch, and snacks as well. And of course, 24 hour room service! Like I said, the staff is great. They are a fun group of people who orchestrate everything from spanish lessons by the pool, to yoga, beach volleyball, and archery. The great thing too is that they are not a pushy bunch. They're respectful of those who do want to rest by the pool and really just want everyone to have a good time. There are also several nighttime shows for entertainment. These tend to be your typical somewhat hokey type of things, but I will say they are definitely entertaining. We ended up going to most of the shows just for a good laugh! We have already been lucky enough to go back to this resort since our first trip last May, and it was even better than we remembered. It is such an elegant and relaxing place run by wonderful people who really take it upon themselves to make sure you enjoy every minute of your stay. We would definitely recommend this resort!!

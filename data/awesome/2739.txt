Stayed twice, bookends on a Cruise to Alaska. Our family of five reserved a suite with king bedroom/bathroom and adjoining double queen room/bathroom, can't remember what floor, but I think it was the 7th. Wonderful accommodations in every way. Kimpton's are my absolute favorite hotels, and I do love my boutique hotels! This property was family friendly, we arrived early with a TON of luggage, the hotel stored our bags and did their best to have our rooms ready prior to check-in time. Love the pajamas and robes in the room, bellman and Concierge were outstanding! Thanks VINTAGE Seattle, we loved our stay with you!

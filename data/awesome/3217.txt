I guess the deep down reason I liked this hotel was that I got a real deal for it on priceline. Aside from that, my room was excellent, clean, I enjoyed being able to work out before I left for my train the next morning. It's about a 3-minute shuttle ride from the airport (you could walk). The warm cookie they gift you at check-in is really nice and the bottled water waiting is a good touch too.

For the past 5 years with my company, I've been on the road nearly 45 weeks a year. I've stayed at all brands, but prefer the W, JW Marriott, or Sheraton brands. After working a lot in Seattle over the past couple of years, I've been staying at the W Hotel in downtown. I have routinely found it to be one of the finest hotels, if not the best hotel in the entire Pacific Northwest. The rooms are excellent, very nicely appointed, and the attention to detail with cleanliness is second to none. They've got great food, the proper adult beverages, and the place is always lively and very entertaining. This is a place where you can enjoy yourself both during and after business. The reason for this posting is that my interactions with the desk staff and hotel management, while they resolved a problem that I created, was absolute confirmation to the professionalism and "can-do" spirit I've come to expect and appreciate from The W in Seattle. I was so impressed by the positive attitude and the follow up help by the hotel's manager, that I would recommend this property to any business traveler. You can find nice rooms at a lot of fine hotels, but attitude and positive demeanor towards your guests is what sets apart the four/five star hotels above the rest. The W's management has found the right formula, and it shows to your guests. Every business and social/vacation traveler should take advantage of every opportunity to book at the W Hotel in Seattle. I was so impressed with my outstanding experience I told the desk staff and manager I would follow up with a written note of appreciation. The W Hotel, what a great find! Please contact me if you have any questions. Thanks. RTL

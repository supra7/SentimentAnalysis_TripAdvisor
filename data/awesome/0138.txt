This hotel is beautiful and interesting at the same time. The decor is very different -- almost French, but lovely. It's right across from the Seattle Public Library and close to Pike Place Market and everything you'd want to see. The staff was amazing. I asked for an early check in because I needed to work, and they were super accommodating - upgrading me to a suite and getting me into a room immediately. The room was kept meticulously clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Can't say enough about this gorgeous hotel and great staff. Highly recommended.

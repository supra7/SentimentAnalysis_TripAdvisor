We bid on a downtown Seattle hotel on Priceline and got the Hotel Monaco. The hotel was beautiful, the staff was friendly and helpful (they even let us have a late check-out), the room was quiet and bed was comfortable. And they didn't treat us like "one of those discount hotel people" for booking through Priceline. The only negative was the expensive valet parking--$40/night--but it's easy to find a nearby lot or parking on the street. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back!

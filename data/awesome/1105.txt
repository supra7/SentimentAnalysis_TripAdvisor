It was recommended that I stay here by a business associate, and now I know why. The Mayflower Park Hotel is not highly publicized, but just what you want when staying in an urban setting. Central downtown location within a few blocks of the market, at the end of The Link, Seattle's light rail that you can take directly to/from the airport, cozy hotel bar (Oliver's) where you can watch passersby wrestle with their umbrellas and fight off the weather, and a good restaurant where you can grab some breakfast. The rooms are traditional, and a bit on the smaller side because it is an older hotel. Service has always been great, and the rates are reasonable.

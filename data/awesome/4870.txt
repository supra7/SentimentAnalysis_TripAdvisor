Where do you start this resort is amazing in every sense of the word. The Service is second to none all the staff will go out of their way for you from your concierge (Luca is great) to the waiters in the restaurants and at the pool you can be as active or unactive as you wish the entertainments team always have something going on at the pools or on the beach you dont even have to leave your lounger for food as the chefs go around the pool with snacks ie shrimp cocktail, chicken tacos, fish, sushi (yummy) cakes, ice lollies and of course the drinks service at the pool is brilliant you will never be out of drink they are so attentive. All the restaurants are great especially the italian and the asian we ate in these twice we also did the Romantic Candlelight dinner on the beach and really was the highlight of our honeymoon was so romantic and even at $150 was worth it as you get bottle of champagne and main course is steak and lobster the food was amazing and it will be a memory we will cherish for the rest of our lives! Yes we were also there when the air conditioning broke down but we didn't let it ruin our holiday as it was just one of those things and if you have been disturbed by things like ash cloud (we missed 3 days of our honeymoon because we couldnt fly) it put things into perspective I would still recommend this resort to everyone and we will hopefully be back soon maybe for our first year anniversary if am lucky lol also just to mention the entertainments team they are great there was something on every night we were there from Mexican Fiestas to Grease show (a lot of fun) and the fire show (amazing) another important thing take bug spray or get the bracelets you can wear on your arms and legs as the mozzies are really bad here due to the jungle and high swamps I was eaten alive while we were there. Another good thing to do is the hibacthi the asian restaurant where you all sit around the grill and the chef cooks your main course and does a few tricks and that it is well worth booking and doesnt cost you anything its was the first time me and my husband ever tried sushi and we loved it I had sushi 3 times more before we went home yummy so all in all this resort is amazing and well worth the money we got so many lovely things for our honeymoon like lovely banner on our door bubble bath with rose petals, rose petals on the bed with swans, 2 bottles of champagne which made our honeymoon so much more romantic. The beach was also great but we aren't beach people we prefer the pool which is really impressive and there is always a lounger for everyone but if you want an umbrella you really need to be at the pool for 10am at the latest as there isn't one for every couple we met some lovely couples while we were there and the people are so friendly I miss it already oh and try the mango tango and the dirty monkeys (yummy cocktails even virgin)

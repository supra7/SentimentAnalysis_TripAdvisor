My husband and I did a lot of reseach before selecting our Honeymoon destination. We had a budget we needed to stick to and wanted to get the best bang for our buck! Our travel agent selected 5 resorts that met our criteria and I read a lot of reviews, and checked out all of the websites and Secrets Maroma Beach was the one we both agreed suited our style. We decided to upgrade to "Preferred Club" because we really wanted our trip to be special. We were not let down. Everything was wonderful. We loved our room, it was comfortable and relaxing. We had breakfast every morning at the International Cafe, and lunch by the pool....most days we hung out by the pool or the beach. We did do an excursion through Apple Vacations and even though it rained half the day we were not let down! Everything about our trip was exceptional! My husband played pool volleyball everyday, but other than that we didn't really get into the "entertainment" that the resort offered. We enjoyed playing ping pong and having cocktails in the evening. There were a lot of honeymooners there, a few "rowdy" groups there for weddings, and couples on anniversary trips. Our only let down was that our travel agent arranged for us to have a "Romantic Dinner on the Beach" our concierge called us at 4p.m. called us to tell us it was going to be cancelled because of weather but we would have it in the French restraunt. We didn't get to sit at a special table, we weren't told if we could order off the regular menu and we weren't very satisfied with our dinner. BUT I know that is just a minor gripe, I was just disappointed! We even took a day trip to Playa del Carmen to explore and shop. We felt safe the entire day. Also for anyone wondering about Preferred Club, we thought it was worth it. We loved going to the Preferred Club lounge to have a drink before dinner, and also were able to use the computers to check in with our families. And they always had yummy snacks available! And we had a great view!

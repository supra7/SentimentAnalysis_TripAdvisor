This is a wonderful hotel - very romantic (I was travelling alone!). Never-the-less the care and attention from all of the staff was professional and amazing. It felt completely safe being there alone, and fine even eating alone. The food is better than at any other all-inclusive hotel I have stayed at - they dont have the usual buffet except once of twice a week, they have a selection of very high quality restaurants which you are not limited in number of visits, and do not have to be pre-booked - if you want sushi all week you can!! Lunch time by the pool is a treat - you don't even have to move from your sun-bed as various chefs bring fresh sushi, and fruit for you to sample. Wonderful

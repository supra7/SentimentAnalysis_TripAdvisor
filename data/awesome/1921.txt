We needed a hotel pre and post Alaskan crusie . We investigated several hotels but our agent found a price at the Andra that we couldnt refuse. It was a perfect hotel for us. The Hotels 2-story lobbys design is influenced by elements of both the Northwest and Scandinavia. For those like me who are sleepless in Seattle the hotel provides Starbucks coffee to be brewed in one's room. There also was an enormous large screened TV in each of our rooms. That night Our daughter was exhausted and opted to eat at the hotel restaurant. Generally I try to avoid hotel restaurants but the ones we saw in downtown Seattle were independently owned and very good. The lobby restaurant, Lola, featured local produce mingled with the cooking styles of Greece. It, as well as several other restaurants in the area, is owned by Tom Douglas, a famous chef. After our cruise we returned to Andra. They agreed to hold our luggage till our rooms were ready. One of our rooms was ready after 30 minutes, so we brought all of the luggage there. I took a shower. The kid's room was ready and they watched the soccer game, US vs. Brazil. I went downstairs while My husband showered and was greeted by hugs and applause for the employees happy for out return. One of the servers said that he saw the boat come in and excitedly told the others we were back. Another said people kept asking when does that nice family return (I guess they do not know us). I awoke the next morning to find My husband downstairs already eating breakfast. I joined him. We hung out at the hotel, said goodbye to friends, and greeted our van driver who promptly arrived at noon to take us to the airport. I loved Seattle and hopefully will have an opportunity to return one day. If so, we will definetely stay at Hotel Andra

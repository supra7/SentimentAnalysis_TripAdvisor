Just returned from a short but extremely lovely stay at the Sorrento Hotel! Staff were very kind, friendly, and helpful in all aspects of the stay! Room was beautifully furnished with period decor, and the bed was absolutely heavenly! I loved the small touches, such as ice cold water with lemon at the front desk in the evening, and lemon drop candies in the morning! Hotel resturant was fabulous, very tasty food and well worth a visit. Hotel is rich with history and even has ghosts, what more can an adventurous but luxury-loving traveller ask for!

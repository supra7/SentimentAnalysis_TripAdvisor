I stayed at the CP on June 25-27, 2007 while on a business trip in Seattle. I called once I arrived at the airport to see if I could check in early and the front desk was very accommodating. They put me in non-smoking, king size room on the 7th floor per my request for a lower level floor. The room and bathroom were extremely clean and comfortable and I'm a germaphobe so I inspected the room pretty carefully (especially after some of the reviews below). The furniture had a few scratches but was no where near the descriptions in some of the reviews below. My room looked as though it had been updated within the last year or so b/c the carpet was in good condition, the bed was very comfortable, and the linens (including the bed spread) were very clean. The room had a tv, desk, coffee pot, sleep kit for relaxation, a lounge chair and king size bed with night stands on either side. It also had plenty of lighting which was good for business. The hotel restaurant had decent food . . . it was moderately priced. The bar had a cheaper menu with sandwhiches and soups if you preferred. They would also prepare your food so you could take it to your room. The hotel also had room service but I needed a temporary break from the room. The hotel also had a gift shop with lots of things that you may have forgotten. The business center was ridiculously expensive to use. The free fitness room looked good - decent amount of equipment. The hotel is only about 5 blocks from the Westlake Center shopping and the monorail to the Space Center. You can easily walk to it. Also, if you are in the touristy area of Seattle, you can take the buses for free between 6am-7pm. Grab a Seattle Map and look for the key to the free bus area. The walls are very thin but I feel that is to be expected and most of the guests respected the other guest's schedules. I would definitely return on business.

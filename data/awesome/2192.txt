We recently pricelined a 4 star hotel in Seattle for 120 dollars a night and ended up at the Edgewater. Similar to previous reviewers, we were also offered an upgrade to a king size room with a water view for 50 dollars more. We declined to pay the extra money, and ended up being put in a king-sized room with a water view anyway (for no additional charge)! The room was cute, with log cabin-esque furnishings, a gas fireplace and a balcony over looking the water. The bathroom was sparkling clean and quite fancy. The lobby and lounge had gorgeous seating with huge windows on the water...perfect for watching the sun set. Hotel is within walking distance of the wharf restaurants/bars and Pike's place market. It is also pretty close to the Space needle (walking distance for us). Staff was exceptionally friendly and we didn't have to pay for our valet parking (don't know if that was a glitch on their part or not). Highly recommended at the priceline price, however, many rooms face right on the parking lot/driveway...which would really be a bummer if you were paying full price.

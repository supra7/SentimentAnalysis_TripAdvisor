I stayed here during my former life, many years ago. I'm sure the hotel was terrific yet I always remembered the fabulous crab bisque I ordered from the room service menu. It was simply delectable and none I've tasted since can compare. But never one to mix my old life with my new one, I hadn't returned to this Marriott, and for these many years the memory of that crab bisque tortured me during our frequent overnight stops at SeaTac (especially with the bright red MARRIOTT sign atop the hotel beckoning from it's perch on the hill across from the airport.) Finally, I clued in my new life to this old life experience and after all this time we booked a stay here so that I could reunite with my old friend, Best Crab Bisque Ever. Woohoo! The reunion was all I had hoped it would be and more. Plus, we discovered a perfectly lovely hotel! Our beautiful room was exceptionally comfortable - and the indulgent bath amenities were the most fragrant and luxurious I've experienced in a product provided by a hotel. (Even the shuttle driver was well aware of the popularity of the product line and supplied me with ordering info as he delivered us to the light rail stop for a zip into Seattle.) The lobby decor here feels slightly rustic, with post and beam construction, but with an elegant, modern edge. The rooms are modern and good sized with large windows and lavish bedding. There is a nice pool in an atrium and the soaring ceilings and rock fireplace are reminiscent of a contemporary mountain lodge. Due in part to my happy reconnection to BCBE, the experience here was awesome and my new life and I look forward to our next stop at SeaTac and this delicious hotel.

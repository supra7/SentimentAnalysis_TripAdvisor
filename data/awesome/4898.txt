I started to plan our wedding 8 months ago ,we had alot of options i read the reviews and i hoped the pictures would help. When i invited my guests was looking for them to have the same experience i was dreaming to have. We arrived with 26 guests , from the time i saw the resort until the time we saw our room we were extatic it was everything the pictures showed. The staff was all wonderful ! i could go on and on for all the SPECIAL things they did for us for our wedding .Cecilia was so sweet . All of our gusts Loved this resort we are all planning to do the trip again next year. I have to say secrets far exceeds all expectations for a all inclusive resort. Thank you for a wonderful stay see you in 2011

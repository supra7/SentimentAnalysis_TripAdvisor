At the last minute (literally driving past it on way to another hotel) we decided to stay here. It was great! The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating, the room really comfortable and clean, and the location excellent. The atmosphere and location of this hotel made it a great choice (we had previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt which we were returning to). Our room was internal facing (last one left), and was a bit loud, but the tempur-pedic mattress was a huge bonus and fun to try! On our way to the 'hotel restaurant' (which is across the courtyard), the front desk staff suggested we try another one which turned out to be excellent. The view from the deck is great too. I'll stay here again!

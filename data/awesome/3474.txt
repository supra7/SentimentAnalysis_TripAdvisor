This was my second stay at Hotel Le Crystal, both occasions for a girls' office weekend Christmas party in Montreal. It really is a gorgeous hotel, from the huge globular crystal chandeliers in the lobby to the roof top hot tub with a view of the city. One small drawback for a girls' weekend is that none of the rooms (all are suites) have two beds if you would rather not share, but there is a sofa bed in the living room area and the bathrooms are spacious, with a regular shower head as well as a rain one. The kitchenette has a microwave, kettle, espresso machine (coffee capsule style) as well as cutlery, dishes and a mini fridge, along with an assortment of tea bags. The WiFi is free, and the front desk staff are very friendly - every time I walked by, at least one would make eye contact and smile. The location is excellent as well, two blocks from St. Catharine's St. (and Ogilvy's!), surrounded by countless cafes, restaurants and shops and a five minute walk to two metro stations, Peel and Lucien l'Allier. We booked with their "Autumn Package", in which they give you a 50% discount on the second night, as well as a welcome package with coupons and a bottle of Fruits and Passions moisturizer. A very comfortable, cozy but chic hotel, I really enjoyed my stay.

So happy we stayed at this hotel! It's tastefully decorated, clean, like a home away from home. Everything was perfect. In my opinion there isn't a hotel in downtown montreal that even comes close to Le Crystal. The only negative thing was the employees. The front desk was ok but the lifeguard was rude and clearly less than thrilled to be working at Le Crystal. After about 30 mins we simply left and never got to enjoy the pool area which put a real damper on our stay especially traveling with children,for them the pool is the highlight of the trip:( Regardless, Le Crystal is by far the best downtown montreal has to offer.

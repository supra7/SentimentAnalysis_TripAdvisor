Last week we had the occasion to stay in Seattle for two non-consecutive nights and chose to stay each night at the Inn at the Market. What a delight - everything about those stays. The staff is wonderful, from the moment you hand your car off to the bell staff for valet parking, until you get in the car to leave. The rooms are great. This time we stayed on the City side, but have stayed on the Market/Puget Sound side in the past. In either case, the rooms are great. If you do not want room service, there are dozens of places to eat in the Market, and some that are absolutely first class. A great stay.

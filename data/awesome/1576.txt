We ended up at the Sheraton through Priceline, and it turned out to be a great choice. Figuring out where to park was a bit tricky, so we ended using their valet service instead, which wasn't too much more than the self-park cost. The lobby area was gorgeous. Our room was on the 19th floor and had a decent view of the surrounding buildings and a little bit of the Sound. The windows were large, allowing plenty of sunlight in. The beds were very comfortable, and everything was clean, quiet, and well maintained. We would definitely stay here again.

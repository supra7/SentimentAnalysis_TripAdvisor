We stayed in the Monarch Suite, which they had donated as a charity auction purchase. Taking advantage of the size of the accommodations, we held a birthday party catered by Tom Douglas Catering. The hotel service was exceptional as was the catering. I found the staff more than willing to do what they could to make our stay an extremely enjoyable and memorable one. They succeed on both counts. It is well located, close to the center of town and some of the best shopping establishments in Seattle. Although this was a one time special event, if I were to stay again I would definitely stay in one of the Lux Suites, which are affordable yet give good value.

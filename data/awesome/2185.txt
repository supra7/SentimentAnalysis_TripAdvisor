My friend got us a great deal on Priceline at the Edgewater. We were there for 4 nights this past weekend. I was a little concerned when I saw all of the mixed reviews but I must report back that my experience was completely positive. We got a room on the 3rd floor and it was very quiet. We overlooked the parking lot AND the Space Needle (very cool). I thought the decor was lovely, both downstairs and in the room. The bathroom is very spa-like and everything was meticulously clean. We loved the flat screen tv and two comfy chairs in front of the fireplace. The fireplace doesn't have much warmth (maybe it is for show?) but our room was always very comfortable. The floor to ceiling glass windows in the bar and restaurant offer incredible views. Every single staff person was friendly and helpful to us. I can't speak about any other hotels in the area as this was my first time in Seattle, but I loved staying in a unique place rather than the typical cookie-cutter hotel room. The location is really fantastic too.

I've stayed at Kimpton hotel in the past but this experience was exceptional. From Lane at the front desk to Louis at the concierge desk the staff bent over backwards to help us. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The location is centrally located and the food and drinks were all top notch! I will stay here again without hesitation and recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle.

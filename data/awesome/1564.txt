We just stayed at this hotel for 4 days and really enjoyed it. It was clean, comfortable, good views, etc. A little pricey, but youre downtown. The location is across the street from the Convention Center, a 30 second walk. Theres a little convenience store on the sidewalk at the Convention Center. Pike's Market is 6 blocks west on Pike St (the hotel is 6th and Pike). The Seattle busses are good and cheap. Download the free iPhone app onebusaway. It shows all the routes, etc. You can get many busses 3 blocks away on 3rd Ave where they converge, or in the bus tunnel which can be accessed between 3rd and 4th Ave one block north of Pike, which I think is Pine. The only criticism is the top sheet on the beds feels like it is plasticized, so it crunches when you roll over. Oh, and free wi-fi is only in the lobby.

This is probably one of the best hotels I've ever been in, service wise. The rooms were modern, excellent concierge, and great location. Excellent modern decor, with a comfy bed and great pillows. Phenomenal room setting and snap your fingers service. I requested a bottle opener, and within 2 minutes someone was at my door. I had a problem with my phone, and instantly they fixed it. My fiance and I went out to dinner after the concierge reserved a table for us, and they sent an appetizer in complimentary from the hotel. Its these little things that really up a service rating in my book. I recommend it to anybody that's staying in Seattle. A few blocks away from Pike Market and excellent restaurants. The only downfall would be the modern showers. It was one of those showers that was just built into the floor, and the shower curtain didn't go all the way down, so some water would spill into the bathroom floor. Really not terrible though. Excellent

My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance using priceline's "name your own price" and were rewarded with a room for $109. Upon arrival, the front desk upgraded us free after we told him it was our anniversary (which it was). We had a corner suite with incredible views and the room was gorgeous. The staff could not have been friendlier, we really enjoyed the lounge and we will certainly stay here again. All of my expectations were exceeded and my wife was blown away by the suite.

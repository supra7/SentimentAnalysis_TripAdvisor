Awesome. It was more than just the stay. From the first contact with the hotel everything was perfect. I had constant emails from Kathleen who provided me with the reservation, car service and restaurant. As promised the car service was waiting at the airport and provided a safe trip to the hotel. Upon arrival the staff was there to open all doors and wouldn't let us lift a finger to help with the luggage, even the smallest of bags. The young ladies at the front desk were wonderful. After checking in they explained to us where everything was in the hotel and assisted us with all the questions we had. The rooms were wonderful, not for those who want a country type setting. This is a city hotel room. Very modern, very clean. A complimentary bottle of wine awaited our arrival in the room as well. Upon arriving at the restaurant that evening, we were told that when the hotel called to make our reservations, they also wanted us to have a complimentary appetizer. The next day at check-out they assisted with the storage of bags and for the town car transfer to the airport. When in Seattle, stay at the Hotel Max!

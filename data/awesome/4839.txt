Look no more my friends, this place is top shelf. The little extra you pay is well worth the $, and is evident as you spend your time at Secrets. The service and spa stand out as excellent and the live entertainment is a nice touch. We went with two other couples and really enjoyed our time. There were lots of honeymooners and everyone we talked to was having a similar experience. Good, good, and good. If your looking for a secluded hide away that is a notch or two above other 5 stars, this is where you want to go. All inclusive done right. Not to big and not to small, just right! gs

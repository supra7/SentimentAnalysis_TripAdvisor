We spent five days at Le Crystal in July and after reviewing the web site were expecting a comfortable suite with amenities. But we did not expect the sheer pleasure of the quality of this hotel. A beautiful spacious room with separate king bedroom, enormous bath with soaking tub and separate shower, twin sinks, storage well beyond what we have ever seen in a hotel, Nepresso machine which delighted us every morning, the wonderful pool and spa. A joy to return to each evening after exploring the delights of Montreal. But what made this hotel even better was the quality of the staff, cheerful, pleasant and helpful without being cloying. Everyone we met: the desk staff, valets, the waitress at breakfast, the pool staff and especially our concierge. The staff should be commended. On another note: we finished our visit with dinner at Europee, truly an experience with an endless series of desserts. But we also delighted in a little restaurant around the corner on Crescent, Bistro le The au Logis, with a wonderful choice of teas and fresh, beautifully prepared, Korean specialities well adapted to Western tastes. Charming service, an elegant chef and her son, intriguing art work. A delight!

we enjoyed a four-night stay at hotel max. got a corner room on the 10th floor ~ light and bright even on a cloudy, rainy day. the art is interesting and cool. the beds are AWESOME! we all enjoyed some really great sleep while we were there. super close to everything. our son loved the proximity to two mcdonald's, while my husband and i ate two of the best gyros we've ever had from a place down the street. the staff is extremely helpful and friendly - pretty much everyone we met in seattle was really cool and nice. we hit all the touristy sites and could reach them easily from the hotel. whole foods market close by - also the taphouse with over 160 beers on draft - yummy. watching it snow from our 10th floor windows was my son's favorite part of the trip! thanks, hotel max ~ we will be back!

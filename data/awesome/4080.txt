This is the most amazing place and I have no words to even express how incredible it was. It was beyond gorgeous and the people were unbelievably nice and accomodating! We went with family although it was geared more towards couples, still had a great time. 24 hour room service is great. All the staff always says "its my pleasure', they are all truly SO nice. Lots of great entertainment and so much to do all the time. I've never been to a resort with so much to offer and so many activities. The food was so-so for the most part. Favorite restaurants were french and hibachi. It says you have to dress up at most restaurants but they're not too strict as long as the guys wear sleeves. We wore jeans a few nights and no problem getting in. Never a wait at the restaurants but must make a reservation in advance with concierge for hibachi, do it as soon as you get there as it fills quickly. It is a long ride in from the main road, very bumpy dirt road but once you get it, its so worth it. Free internet room by the lobby was nice. Beds were very comfortable. A safe is available in your room and you choose the code and punch it in and out everytime you use it. BRING MOSQUITO REPELLENT! They ate me alive, the resort offers 2 little wipes in the room but not enough. Its really bad when you're eating at an outside restaurant for dinner. Lots of big lizards chilling by the pool on the rocks. Night club was fun, just not enough good things to say about this place. GO AND ENJOY, SO WORTH IT!

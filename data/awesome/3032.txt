My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in early September. First impressions were good, with a friendly welcome and a small but comfortable room. The first night however, was not good. Although the bed was awesomely comfortable, the artwork colourful, and a very relaxed ambience, we had the neighbours from hell! We compained about 3am about their incessant shouting and swearing to little effect, and when we brought this up again with Reception the following morning their immediate response was to upgrade us and move us to the top floor. A corner room with great views over some fairly ecclectic buildings, a bath and yet another amazingly comfortable bed. We were understandably pleased with their efforts to make our stay better. Being charged a fortune for water (normally free in most hotel rooms) was the only negative about the upgraded room. We did not have the opportunity to try the attached restaurant, Red Fin, but did sample their beer (which was god). The bar/sushi restaurant was an odd mix but fitted in well with the Seattle scene, and the food certainly looked very good. Being 'told' that we only had 1 hour when we arrived was a little disconcerting and perhaps verging on rude but not a big issue. Overall, we had an extremely comfortable stay, and the location was great so we walked everywhere. The staff very very helpful and able to guide us on lots of things. We would certainly recommend Hotel Max to friends (but bring earplugs just in case!). Note that parking is charged at around $30 p/d and there is a 'city tax' on top of this bringing it to about $35 p/d.

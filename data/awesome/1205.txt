This is a wonderfully restored hotel in a great location in downtown Seattle. The rooms are a little small but otherwise very nice. Its location to Westlake underground busses make it a great place to stay and venture out by bus, monorail or on foot to the market. The front desk personnel are top notch and meet every request with a smile. Highly recommend this hotel.

I stayed at the Westin the night of December 6th and had a great stay. I was in room 1732 and it had an amazing view of the harbor and the Seattle Needle. The bed was so comfortable and the shower was fantastic. My check-in was easy. Check out was easy. No problem getting a cab. It is in a great shopping area with Nordstrom's right around the corner. There's a Gap and Old Navy right there too. One really convenient thing is the Bartell's drug store right across the street, just in case you need something!! There's really no need to rent a car if you're in the city. The light rail is within about a block or so of the hotel and runs frequently to the airport. Light rail is $2.75 each way.

Firstly, place absolutely wonderful, fantastic service - all really brilliant. Room so wonderful, bed really really comfortable. Meals - briliant - especially Portofino. Only negative things to say are 1) Jewellery Shop within the hotel, - we were only looking through the window and we were urged to go in, only to be very much pressed for a hard sell and made to feel that you must buy something or else! 2) Pretty much same thing, spoken to very nicely one day by a member of staff, then next day really pressed to go into what was obviously a timeshare within the hotel. Told it would last 90 mins, but heard a few horror stories that it lasted 5 hours and staff would not take no for an answer. Once we realised what this was, we cancelled immediately. Given this is not a cheap holiday would not expect this to happen on what was otherwise a fabulous holiday. Staff all very friendly and helpful and the hotel setting was amazing. If the above 2 issues could be dealt with, it would have been totally perfect. A very big thank you to the Entertainment Staff who were brilliant, and worked very hard day and night.

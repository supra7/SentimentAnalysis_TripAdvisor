I have stayed here several times and have enjoyed every visit. This is a large spread out hotel that can have a confusing layout to first time visitors. Pay attention to directions to your room, if you are not in the tower, and retrace your steps exactly as some floors do not connect through. This hotel is used by several of the airlines for their flight crews on layovers Pros - Well appointed rooms Comfortable beds Very quiet (hotel is across from airport and you cant hear the planes) Friendly staff willing to meet your needs or requests Baggage storage if needed On site coffee shop On site Restaurant On site convenience store Airline departure display in lobby Vending and ice-machines close to all rooms Business centre Pool (seasonal) Fitness room Late check on request (no charge if your a hilton honors member) Free airport shuttle (no reservation needed runs every 20 min) Warm cookies on check in Cons- Pay parking Pay Wifi

The service was excellent from valet to front desk to wait staff. The hotel is well located for easy access to all modes of transportation. And it is a short walk to area jazz clubs like Jazz Alley and the Triple Door. Our meal at Andaluca was perfect and we enjoyed Oliver's as well. Best martini's in the city. We were walking distance to other wonderful restaurants in the area and felt safe late at night. Although our room was comfortable and quiet (facing Olive) we will request a larger room next year.

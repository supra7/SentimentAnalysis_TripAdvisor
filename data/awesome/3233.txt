I loved the Doubletree Seatac. The hotel is beautiful and our room was very large. After 2 weeks on a land/sea tour of Alaska the bed was like sleeping on a cloud with down pillows. They provide free HOT wonderful cookies and lemonade or punch in the lobby. The shuttle to airport was on time, but it was a little difficult to find our way into the airport from the dropoff point from the driver's directions or lack thereof. Also, we had to move a table to plug in our coffee pot and the light in the large room could have been better. It is also a long walk from the lobby to our room. Might be difficult for seniors, and they gave us a handicap room because we wanted 2 queen beds. Since I needed the walk to get rid of the calories from the cookie it was ok. They also had free internet in the bar. Would stay there again for sure.

I stayed for 1 night in a 2 bed room with another friend, and another couple traveled with us and had pretty much the same experience. Check in was quick and easy and the valets and front desk staff were efficient and friendly. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are nice and clean and fresh looking and the decor is artsy and crisp looking. The bathrooms are small too, I would have liked a bigger shower, but again, they are well designed for their size and very clean. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I don't think I moved a muscle alllll nightttt long. I found myself wishing I was staying another night so I could sleep in the bed again!!! I would definitely recommend this to my friends and if I need a room in Seattle again, I will be booking at the Hotel Max.

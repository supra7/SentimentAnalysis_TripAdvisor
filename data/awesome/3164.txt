We have used this hotel for our Seattle visits quite a bit and we keep returning because of how well they do everything. From upgrading us, to clean and comfy rooms, and to the excellent response time if we ever encounter any issues with our rooms. Let's be honest folks, issues can happen to anyone. No hotel is immune from it but it's how they handle those issues that bring the cream to the top. Doubletree Seatac always rises to the top. This place is perfect for everyone. OK, now the "not so good". Very, very minor stuff for us. Have Starbucks stay open later in the lobby. Checking in after a very long drive at 1pm, a nice cup of coffee and that warm cookie would be perfect while getting settled in our room. If that's not possible, then it's time to replace those wolfgang coffee makers. Those are ancient and in need of a garbage can. Time to upgrade, like most hotels, to the K cup systems. Again, these are such minor things and would never keep us from coming back to our favorite Seattle hotel.

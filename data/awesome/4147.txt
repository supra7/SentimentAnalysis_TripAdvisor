The food & drinks were all fantastic. Didn't try Bordeaux, but every other restaurant was out of this world. Every staffer throughout the resort was fantastic. Always willing to accomodate with any request. We had a preferred club junior suite, oceanfront with hot tub on terrace. Amazing room! Very clean! Property was very clean as well. Spa was the best I've ever experienced! Only negative with the resort was the guests smoking. You couldn't be @ the swim up bar b/c of this. Outside at the restaurants/bars people were smoking as well. Would be good if they could control that a bit with designated areas. All in all, we highly recommend Secrets. Fantastic resort!

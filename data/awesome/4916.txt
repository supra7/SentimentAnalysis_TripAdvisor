I've been to different resorts in the last few years and thought I'd step it up a notch and booked at Secrets Maroma Beach in Mayan Riviera and booked a swim up pool room. Well, that was the best decision I ever made! When the concierge opened the patio door so we could look at the terrace and saw our own semi private pool, I had tears coming down I was so happy. Everthing was perfect from the room to the absolutly great service from the time we walked in the hotel we were sat down right away and no line ups for check in, a server gave us champagne which was a bonus point for me! The restaurants were all amazing and the food was very good, fine cuisine. "Especially the Italien restaurant" The pool was so nice and relaxing, the music wasn't too loud like your typical resort, the choice of music was well thought out. The beach was amazing as well, cleaned and manicured every morning. Waiters walking around the pool every afternoon with trays of sushi and shrimp and chicken brochettes which was soooo good. I would recommand this resort very highly and we will probably go back to a Secrets resort again.

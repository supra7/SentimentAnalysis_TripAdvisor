The Doubletree Seatac is my go-to SEA aiport hotel. I've probably stayed there 15 times. I've stayed at a handful of other hotels in the area and the Doubletree is probably the nicest and most consistent. I always book it via priceline. I bid $51 for seattle airport area, and 90% of the time I get the Doubletree. Location It is literally a 3-min shuttle ride from the airport. Shuttles leave every 15 mins. Rooms All rooms are fairly spacious and consistent in their offering. I love the Neutrogena face and body amenities they provide, particularly the spf 45 sunscreen/face cream. Although you're in an airport town, some rooms actually have a lovely view of a little lake beside the hotel. Service I've never once had a bad experience at this hotel. My rooms have always been clean, front desk staff always nice, concierge always helpful. Hints - the cookies you get a check-in are good - the coffee shop/lounge in the lobby has free wireless - if you are coming home from a flight, staying at the doubletree that night and need to get your car from an external lot, wait to get your car until the next morning because the doubletree charges for parking nightly - bring slippers, the tile floors in the bathrooms aren't heated and in winter they are COLD - you can print your boarding pass in the lobby (unless you originally booked your US flight from Canada) - the on-site restaurant is decent but in general I prefer to eat prior to arriving in the hotel area of seatac - many airlines put up their flight crews at the Doubletree

Everything about the Edgewater was warm and welcoming. We walked into our room and there was a fire in the fireplace. The linens were beautiful and the beds were first rate. The lobby is comfortable and there are tables with games and several groups were seated playing cards. This is a waterfront hotel and is not in the middle of the city. However, you can easily walk into town and it is very safe.

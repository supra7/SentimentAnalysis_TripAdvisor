My husband and I found your hotel while doing a search on the Internet. We chose your hotel because of the convenient location to almost every attraction in Seattle was in walking distance or by transit. We booked a superior queen room but was pleasantly surprised to get upgraded to a king. The room was small but it was cozy and it suited us just fine. The staff at Executive Pacific was AWESOME!! Everyone from the concierge, front desk to even the maid service were all so friendly, helpful and very personable!! The only thing that I would change would be that the robes in the room were geared for a petite individual but then I didn't think to ask if they had larger sizes. All in all it was a wonderful experience!

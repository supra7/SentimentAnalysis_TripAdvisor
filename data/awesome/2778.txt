When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly front desk and she said an upgrade was available. We had a room with a 04 number, very, very nice. We came back a week later after travelling to Victoria and Vancouver and the staff remembered us like we had lived in the hotel all week. The hotel was full and so an upgrade was not available. The Concierge hosts a wine tasting every day in the lobby for guests. We had not made reservations at the dining room but were recommended a very nice restaurant (Palomino). A very caring hotel.

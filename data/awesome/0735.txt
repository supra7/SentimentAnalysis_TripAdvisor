Stayed one night at this exceptional hotel. We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the market and water. There is also a rooftop area with chairs and tables that all guests can use that overlooks both market and water. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were nice and clean. All areas of hotel were well taken care of. It was close to the market and waterfront and a block away from the tour bus that you can get on and off at different stops. Would stay there again.

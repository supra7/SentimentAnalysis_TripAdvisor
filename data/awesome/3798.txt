My wife and I went for our honeymoon to this hotel and we absolutely loved it! The hotel is beautiful, and the beach is amazing, but the best thing was the service. We were treated as royalty, and we loved every minute of our stay. The hotel has several restaurants, our favorites were the Japanese restaurant and the buffet restaurant. The French restaurant, although very nicely decorated, did not met our expectations in terms of food. The Maroma beach is beautiful! The second most beautiful beach I have ever been (the first is West Bay beach, in Roatan, Honduras). 1st Tip: do not forget to go to the coffee shop near the lobby, they make the most incredible moccha, lattes, and cappuccinos I have ever tasted! 2nd Tip: If you are into scuba diving, the reefs just in front of the hotel are amazingly beautiful, are are in pristine condition. We went to Cozumel for scuba diving, but we found these reefs to be in much better condition than the Cozumel's reefs. 3rd Tip: Stay away from the Unlimited Vacation program (a pseudo time-share that they will try to sell you). Congratulations to the hotel and its staff for an excelent service.

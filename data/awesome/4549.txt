Overall, you can't find a better resort for the price. Food is fantastic, everything from the breakfast buffet to steak and lobster for dinner. Top shelf liquor is generously served, and your glass never seems to go empty. Rooms are serviced twice a day and the turndown service in the evening is really great. 24 room service via the "secrets" box was used on multiple occasions and really is a nice touch. Last, but not least...the beach. If you could picture the perfect beach in your mind, this would exceed your expectations...from the flour-like sand, to being able to see fish swimming all around you in the turquoise waters...it truly is the best. Also, don't forget to try a couple of their nightly entertainment shows. We saw a ventriliquist who was actually pretty funny, and the American Idol show in which the winner got a free vacation to Secrets Maroma. Anyway, stay here and have the best vacation you can imagine with no worries...thousands of positive reviews can't be wrong

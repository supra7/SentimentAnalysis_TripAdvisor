Had a nice week at the Destiny. While we were there they completed adding WiFi access for all rooms. Rooms were very small, but clean. Few drawers and only an undersized armoire to hang clothes. Friendly staff. Complimentary breakfast was mainly cold pancakes, bread, waffles, and bagels that you had to heat up. They also had hard boiled eggs, cereal, and oatmeal. No fruit or meat. It was adequate for us and made for a quick and inexpensive start to our day. For the price I would definitely stay here again. A great place to eat nearby is the newly opened Miller's Orlando Ale House (great food, large quantities, and low prices).

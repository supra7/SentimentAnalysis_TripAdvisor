I will keep this short. This place is the BEST! If you go here and have a bad time, it was your fault. I thought they would have to drag me off the property when our trip ended. Good: Food - incredible selection, variety of venue options, great taste. Alcohol - easily accessible at ANY location, wide variety of top shelf products Room - marble, granite, 2 person jacuzzi in room and tub on balcony, enough said. Service - impeccable....especially Freddy in the World Cafe. If you go, you will meet Freddy. Pools - relaxing, entertaining, clean, beautiful Beach - Gorgeous!!!! Water Sports - Hobie Cat, windsurfers, and kayaks all included and always available Entertainment - cheeky but so much fun Spa - worth every penny! Bad - nothing worth mentioning This place is hands down the best resort I have ever been to. My wife and I spent our honeymoon here and are already planning our return for our first anniversary. Stop reading all the other comments on the other resorts and just book this place....you will never regret it.

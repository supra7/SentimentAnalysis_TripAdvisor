This is our first real vacation without children!! I was over the moon!! We had a swim in/out room which was wonderful. The resort staff was AWESOME!! The accomidations AWESOME!! I can not say enough about the resort and plan to visit the sister beaches resort soon!! If you are on the fence, go for it, you will not regret it!!

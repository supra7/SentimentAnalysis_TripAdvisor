The danger in writing a well-deserved, glowing review of the Prime Hotel Principe Torlonia is that too many people will discover it and it will not be available when we want to return! This hotel is a gem nestled among an up-scale neighborhood outside the Historic Center of Rome. While that may not appeal to some, the Bologna Metro B line is a few short blocks away and the distance from the tourist circuit gives the willing traveler a taste of daily Roman life. The restaurants in the area were all outstanding and the nearby supermarket made picking up picnic supplies easy. The staff were all warm and friendly and Ramona, in particular, went out of her way to arrange for tables at restaurants during the hit and miss Christmas holiday. We are particularly grateful for her assistance with our trip. If you want to be in the middle of the Historic Center of Rome near all the tourist spots and everything that goes along with them, this is not the place for you. If you are able to navigate yourself on the public transportation system (or have a rental car or pockets full of cab fare) and want a quiet place to start and end your day in Rome, give this hotel serious consideration. You will not be disappointed.

My husband and I got back from this resort two weeks ago and we had the best time there. The staff was very friendly all the time, the grounds were well kept and beautiful. The food was good but not 5 star, I would say 4 star. There was lots do to there if you wanted to have more of an adventure trip. We did 2 excurisons that we booked once we got to the resort. We did the Chichen Itza day trip and then we went snorkling. Both of the trips were wonderful. Chichen Itza was amazing and it's a definate must if you are going to be there for a week. The trip was a full day trip so you will miss one day on the beach. Snorkling down there is great-clear water and lots of fish! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay at an all inclusive for their honeymoon. Also, we stayed in a ocean front room and it was great-beautiful view everyday! We did upgrade to the Preferred club but if we went back I don't think we would need to do this. Overall, we had a great trip and everything was lovely! One more thing, the beach was great, clean and you could take a long walk! The sand was very fine and even better than the beaches on the Florida coast-which are my favorite! We felt very safe at this resort and in Mexico. The only thing is-don't eat at the Cancun airport-specifically the Jimmy Buffet resturant there-or else you will be sick for a week!

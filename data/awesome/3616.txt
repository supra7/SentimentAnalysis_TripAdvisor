I was very impressed with this Hotel and would recomment to everyone and the Price was awesome for what you get Fullk breakfast and kind service . The rooms were so handsomely decorated and just nice people working there is what made me review it Chuck and the other manager on day shift were soooo accomodating to us and friendly referring us to places around etc. Iam John Daniel Halicek and friend Annie Satre we stayed there Oct 17th to Oct 22nd and would always return there on our stays to Kissimmee, Orlando Florida.

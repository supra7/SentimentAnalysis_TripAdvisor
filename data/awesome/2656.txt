Spacious rooms right across from landmark Seattle Public Library (famous for architecture). Great views of the city and the SPL. Extremely clean rooms with different flavored chocolates on the pillows every night. Staff is WONDERFUL. They have pay exceptional attention to detail, and are super friendly with genuine smiles. Pet-friendly with a weight limit of 200 pounds (perfect for my German Shepherd). Rooms are romantic. Very impressed with the price, cleanliness, customer service, and amenities (wine tastings) of Vintage Park!

We went here on our honeymoon at the end of November, beginning of December 2010. We were so exhausted from wedding planning. It was the perfect place for us. We did not have to lift a finger the whole week. Everything really is included. The only thing we would have paid for was wine, but we live in Italy so we didn't need that. The service and staff was amazing. Our room was cleaned 2 times a day. There were 7 restaurants to choose from. We loved the Japanese restaurant. We ate there twice. We also liked the little restaurant by the pool. The beach was gorgeous. The hotel property is beautiful and well cared for. Everything really was amazing. If you want to have a relaxing vacation in a wonderful location with delicious food, this is your choice. It really is life-changing. It is wonderful!

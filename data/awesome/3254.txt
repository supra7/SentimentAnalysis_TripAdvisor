We arrived quite late so we missed the manager's reception. Staff at the front desk were very friendly and courteous, providing compliment WIFI as our daughter-in-law still had some work to complete. The suite was large and clean. We did not experience any problems at the breakfast service and enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. This hotel is an excellent value and we will stay here again.

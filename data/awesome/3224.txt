Never had stayed at a doubletree, and I was very impressed with the hotel. First, this is a HUGE hotel. I believe I read it has something like 900 rooms. Makes it one of the larger hotels in the Seattle area. The cookies were nice, and I got a room in wing 5 which has a little view of a lake. I enjoyed having that. The pool area was really nice, it was 95 degrees outside, so an outdoor pool was PERFECT. I am told the pool is open year round too. Overall I enjoyed it. Be aware it can be a very long walk to the lobby from your room if you get put in a wing, although I think the wings are nicer myself (they are a little newer).

I am fairly picky when identifying hotels to stay at, and I spent an inordinate amount of time critically investigating the options for the downtown Seattle area. Thus on this trip my wife and I decided to try the Warwick, even though there were some negative reviews on some of the travel web-sites, there were more positive reviews. During and after our stay, my wife and I fully agreed that we were extremely satisfied with our stay. There was absolutely nothing that could have justified any level of dissatisfaction. The room was immediately upgraded at check-in due to the scheduled room not being ready, the room itself was quite comfortable, immaculately kept, and had a very impressive view, the entire staff was extremely helpful and pleasant, the food in the restaurant was great, and the central location was perfect for our entertainment events, my meetings, and the close-in walk around option to all of downtown. I highly recommend the facility and we will be back.

This place does everything right! It was fun to step back in time in this beauiful old building. and the staff could not of been friendlier. We were celebrating a birthday and they made us feel so very special. The place is nice and clean and such a surprise when you find that you have a kitchen, and sitting room included with your room of two beds. The only draw back is there is no elevator. If you are on the upper floors be prepared to take the stairs. Oh but what beautiful stairs! Walking down the stairs make you feel like you are the bride!

This hotel was a great find! All rooms are suites, and packed full of amenities! A large bathroom with separate (and large) tub/shower, kitchen area with small dining room table, nice dishes and real silverware! Had an expresso maker in the room with nice selection of coffees, full size hot water pitcher for making tea (again, very nice selection). Multiple TVs including one at the foot of the bed. The hotel restaurant was a great choice for breakfast...highly recommend the french toast or banana crepes! Hotel staff was very pleasant, fluent in english, helpful with directions and suggestions for nearby attractions! Bell Centre is one block away if you would like to see the Montreal Canadiens...a block in the other direction you will find Ste. Catherine's street...where all the people and action is late at night, and it's very safe to walk around. It's a great hotel for business or couples! We were there to celebrate a special wedding anniversary and were very surprised to find a bottle of champaign on ice waiting in our hotel room after the hockey game, compliments of the hotel staff! The hotel made for a very memorable trip and I don't think you'll be disappointed if you chose this location!

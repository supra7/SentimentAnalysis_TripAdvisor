Love the Warwick! Two old friends joined me in Seattle to celebrate the New Year and we chose the Warwick. We were absolutely delighted! The staff is exemplary...Brian, Robert and, yes, even Bill, were so helpful and so very, very patient with a very tired and picky Alaskan guest.This hotel is located three blocks from Macy's; five blocks from Nordstroms...what more could we want? Oh yeah, and right across the street is Ralph's so if you need a latte in the morning or a bottle of wine in the evening you've got it! Perfect. I want to thank the whole Warwick staff for making the start of 2012 so good! I hope to see you again!

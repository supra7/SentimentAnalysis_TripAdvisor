We stayed at the Sheraton before we went to a Mariners game. We booked through Airmiles and we never received our certificate, Airmiles faxed a letter to the front desk and we had no problems checking in. There was a conference and they were oversold and they offered a room at another hotel if we wished and we declined and there was no pressure. The room was nice, very clean and the bed was SUPER comfy!!! There was construction but we were on the 26th floor and could not hear a single thing... Only thing that ----- was the charge for valet parking which isnt optional...26 plus tax...but you are allowed to stay parked even after check out so you can go and explore the city.... Would stay again...

After looking at various other hotels that were fairly pricey, I was very pleased with The Roosevelt. Yes, the bathrooms are small, but I don't go on trips to stay in the rooms. In fact, the beds are very comfortable and they supply you robes. Staff is very friendly and helpful, but best of all, it's the location! Great area and walking distance to Pike's Market. The lobby is beautifully decorated and I highly recommend to take advantage of their parking price included in hotel stay price. So worth it! I will definitely stay here again.

My fiance and I went to Secrets Maroma the end of March into the first week of April. We were there for 6 nights, and it was the first time for both of us that we were not ready to come home from a vacation (I'm 40 and she's 37 - we've been around). I am not a big fan of all-inclusives because the food is often merely mediocre. Not here. We all have different tastes, and I can't say that I loved every meal that I chose, but the presentation, quality, and service made every meal special. There is plenty of very high quality food available almost all day and through the dining hours, and there is a decent menu for room service. The beach, here, is second to none in the world - absolutely beautiful - and the elegantly designed pools are of ample size, but not huge. There is a strict policy that you cannot "reserve" a lounge chair, so if you are like me and are an early riser who likes to grab a couple of prime spots, you're out of luck. You have to be there to claim your real estate. No problem. The spa is a true oasis from the hot sun of the Riviera Maya, and the treatments are top quality. The staff are courteous and attentive, always. This is a somewhat quiet resort, though the entertainment crew kept anyone who was interested entertained throughout the day and night. The hotel offers FIRST CLASS outside entertainers, as well. No one could possibly complain about the evening entertainers. This is a resort of beautiful simplicity, or that is simply beautiful. It is not opulent, just remarkable. I would recommend this resort to anyone visiting this region, anytime.

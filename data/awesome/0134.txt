We had a most enjoyable stay at the Hotel Monaco, downtown Seattle. Our first, but not certainly last, stay at a Kimpton hotel. The staff (all of them) were friendly, laid back, and very eager to make our stay as relaxing as possible. It's the attitude of the staff that makes the difference, and we certainly noticed that it carried through to everyone working there. I stay in hotels over 100 nights a year throughout the US and can say this has been my best experience. If you want accommodating caring people to help you, this is the place. The hotel is excellent, the food was great with a lot of variety, the little touches (pet friendly, goldfish on every floor, the decor) added to the stay. The great location allows you to walk to many quality restaurants, Pike Place Market and waterfront. Go, stay, and enjoy.

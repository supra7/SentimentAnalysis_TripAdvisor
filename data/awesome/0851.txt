i've been to the crowne plaza seatle downtown many times in 2007 - 2009 on my business trips. i enjoyed the central location of the hotel, the nice rooms (got regular upgrades to a junior suite as a platinum member) and the lounge at the top floor. friendly personel, always helpful. this hotel is definitely my first choice whenever i'm in seattle

We are Seattle fans and have traveled often from Florida over the past 10 years. This hotel by far is our new home away from home. From Virginia at the front desk to John behind the bar at Lola, this is a true Seattle Home experience. The staff is well trained, and they respond to any issue with professionalism and a sincere demeanor that just makes you feel good about spending money to sleep. We started a two week trip at Hotel Andra and then changed the end of the trip to stay with them longer. Great location, great rooms, great service, and great food but most of all great smiles. STAY AT THIS HOTEL.

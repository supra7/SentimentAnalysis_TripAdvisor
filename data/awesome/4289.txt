We stayed at Secrets Maroma for 5 days/4 nights in April 2011 for our friends' wedding. The resort was beautiful! It was the perfect size - easy and quick access to the beach and pool and other amenities. Food was fantastic! Our favorite part was the lunchtime butler-passed hors d'uvres at the pool! The food was very good at all the restaurants we tried and at the pool bars. The service was great across the board - from the pool bars, to the restaurants, to the spa, to the beach! The staff was attentive, interactive and fun. The rooms were beautiful and spacious, with a Jacuzzi tub in the room and a lounge pool/tub on the balcony. Overall a very relaxing and wonderful vacation! We would definitely stay there again!

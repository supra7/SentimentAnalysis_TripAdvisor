definatly select the "preferred club package" the amenities are great! our concierge "carlos" was extremely helpful. the staff at the resort are wonderful and so friendly. the entertainment team - activities never a dull moment and if you just wanted quiet time for two....no problem that too!! you got a fly-er with all the daily activities & entertainment every morning delivered to your room so you wouldnt miss a thing! loved that! it was also very nice not having to make reservations at the restaurants. we ate at a different one everynight! the only buffet-style was breakfast. the beach was perfect just like they described "sugary white sand" everything was very very clean! we stayed for 7 nights and every night was great!

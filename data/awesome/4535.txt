A gorgeous, immaculately kept resort. Service, dining choices, THE BEACH! all fabulous. You will not be disappointed, We had a lovely swim-out suite, highly recommend. We were there end of September....high 80's during the day and 70's at night, ocean water and pools were perfect at this time of year. One short shower on one day, every day and evening of our trip was stunning weather!

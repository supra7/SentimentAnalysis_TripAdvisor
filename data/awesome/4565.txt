We travelled with another couple. Secrets Maroma had a great blend of peace, quiet and relaxation as well as fun. Our service was excellent everywhere at the resort. Most especially, the beach. We always had four seats waiting for us - tipping helps! In addition, the wait staff at the beach were extremely attentive. The food throughout the resort was wonderful. Rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff was very attentive.

I have been to my share of hotels and this one have surpassed my expectations. No dislikes at all. Hotel experience was amazing. Room was clean and comfortable. Great location at a reasonable rate. Customer service an A+. Look out for Ricky, cause he's the man! He'll get you more than what you need and is extremely friendly.

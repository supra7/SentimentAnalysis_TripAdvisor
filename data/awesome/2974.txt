Have stayed at the Max a few times now and really like it, the staff are great, the location is great, the decor is great. All I would say is that the standard rooms are quite tiny which makes it difficult if you have any kind of luggage, the last couple of times I was in a corner room or larger room, but this time I was put into a tiny room which just made everything cramped. Nonetheless I would return there.

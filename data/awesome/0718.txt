Needed to take a few days off and booked the Inn based on TripAdvisor reviews. What a great hotel! The staff is very professional and accomodating. Town car service available to and from the airport, immaculate rooms, spacious bathroom, great location. This is not a great hotel for the price, its a great hotel. Had a room facing the inner coutyard and there was no problem with noise. (Some rooms face onto First St. which is very noisy.) Location is excellent for anything in downtown Seattle. Went to attached restaurant Bacco for breakfast and Cafe Champagne for dinner. Both are excellent.

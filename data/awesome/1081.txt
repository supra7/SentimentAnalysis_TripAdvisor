The best hotel in Seattle, in my opinion. Beautiful and clean, great service and ammenities and best of all... within walking distance to EVERYTHING (shopping, monorail, restaurants, Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square... you name it!) I will definitely stay here again and I have been telling all my friends about it! As a local doing a downtown romantic weekend getaway... this hotel was PERFECT!

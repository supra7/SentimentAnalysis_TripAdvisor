I travel a lot and connect through Seattle airport. I have found that I am most comfortable when staying at the HIlton SEATAC. The service is exceptional. Rooms are always nice and beds are wonderful with great sheets! As a woman who travels alone on a regualar basis I feel the most safe when I stay here.

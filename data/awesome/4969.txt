I loved Secrets Maroma. Drinks were excellent - Corona, Modelo, Bud lite, and Branded Spirits, House wine was very good too we drank Rose mostly. Food was excellent - Every meal was delicious, had room service on the first night recommend the Brownie. Steaks were good too. Service from everyone there was excellent - Waiters, bar staff, entertainment team were all realy nice and friendly. Beach front was lovely too. No complaints what so ever, highly reccomend this hotel.

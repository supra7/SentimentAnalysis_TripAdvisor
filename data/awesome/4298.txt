I'm a little late writing this review. We stayed last year and really enjoyed it but never got around to doing a review. I've stayed at a number of AI I wanted to try a different destination for this year's trip and REGRET that decision. We stayed at a 5 star in Jamiaca and the whole time wished we went back to Secrets. My sister raved about that property in Jamaica. Don't listen to your sister! The little things really count, like the open seating for restauants, REALLY allows you to relax more. There is so much of the world to see, so will try another Secrets... but the service was great...the beach walks, etc... Only complaint I had then was the bar staff weren't that friendly but looks like they have fixed that based on recent reviews! Go if you can!

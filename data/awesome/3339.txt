We stayed at this place 2 nights before our AK cruise and one night after our cruise. Janelle at the front desk was a wonderfu help with tour information, shuttle service to the docks, and overall friendliness toward the out of town guests. Her spirit and attitude just brightens the lobby. In addition to Janelle, the morning breakfast was outstanding with eggs, bacon/sausage, selection of pastries-bagels and cereals, and a waffle iron to cook your own. Apple/Orange Juice, coffee, and milk rounded out a breakfast good enough for a resturant unto itself and all included in the price of the room. The rooms themselves were a bit older, but very comfortable with a small refrigerator/ microwave/ ironing board-iron, and hair dryer available in the room. My only complaint was that the pillows on the bed were only about the size of your head and not large enough to keep your head from rolling off for those who are "active" sleepers (try using 2 pillows and your head ended up stuck between the 2). Overall great bargin for the cost-conscious.

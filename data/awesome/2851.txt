I do not see how anyone could even think of leaving a negative review. Stayed here April 28 for two nights for my bachelorette weekend. The concierge was amazing and gave us the lowdown on all the hotspots for eating and partying. Love love love the modern feel. I would look no further if you want an amazing stay close to shopping and playing, for a super reasonable price!

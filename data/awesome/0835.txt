I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle and it was wonderful! The staff was extremely helpful. I arrived at 11:30 a.m. and I had a 1:00 meeting; they checked me in early. The room was clean and the view was gorgeous. I slept peacefully on the comfortable bed. I ordered cobbler from room service and it was delicious! The only downside was no pool! I guess the weather in Seattle limits swimming but an indoor pool would be a great addition to this wonderful hotel. The only negative is the slow elevators. Airport service would also be a great addition.

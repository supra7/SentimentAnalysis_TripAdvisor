I booked the Sorrento on the advice of a friend, which turned out to be priceless. The hotel pulls together a cozy atmosphere along with the quality of service and amenities of a luxury establishment. For example, when we were ready to party at 4am the concierge sent us to a couple of clubs that not even the locals knew about! Who knew Seattle had such a vibrant party scene :D The room itself was spacious, very clean, the bed incredibly comfy, the water perfect and the in room snacks delicious. Highly recommended.

We absolutely loved our stay here. The fireplace and teddy bears in the room make it very charming and a peaceful room to come back to after a long day of exploring. The bathrooms are well appointed with a nice sink, tilework, and a terrific rainfall showerhead. The location is very beautiful, right by the waterfront and the park with all the statues. Even Seattle Center and Pike Place Market are a short stroll away. We would definitely stay here again.

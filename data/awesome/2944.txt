I highly reccomend this hotel. It was comfortable, quaint, and convieiently located in town. They even have a pillow request form!! Get ready for artsy and small, but clean, and relaxing. Love the old building and the room doors! The sushi place next wasnt too shabby either, great happy hour prices, super service. Made our trip MOST enjoyable....go check it out... we'll be back for sure!

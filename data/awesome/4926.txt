We loved this resort. The staff was wonderful, the beach was a dream, the pool warm and relaxing, and the food yummy and endless! The only thing I would recommend that this hotel add to make the experience pure perfection is that they put full length mirrors somewhere in the room. Slightly frustrating to have to climb up on chairs to catch an ackward glimpse of possible outfit combos...had to leave the shoe choices up to husband's opinion. lol!

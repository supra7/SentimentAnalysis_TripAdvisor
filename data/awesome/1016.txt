My husband and I have been going to the Mayflower park every year (for the past 4 years) to celebrate his birthday. The staff has always treated us well and exceeded our expectations. Rooms are beautiful, clean and the location can't be beat. We have lived in Seattle all of our lives and each time we eat at Andaluca we say, "Why don't we come here more often?" The food is excellent! And you can't beat the cocktails at Olivers. Thanks again for a perfect weekend.

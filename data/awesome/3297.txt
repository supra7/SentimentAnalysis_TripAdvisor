I stayed at the Marriott Seattle Seatac after reading all of the outstanding reviews on TripAdvisor and now I can add my own gushing review. This is a gem of an airport hotel. Beautiful lobby, atrium and pool. Clean, updated rooms. Tasty food from the restaurant. It's also just a short downhill walk to the light rail that easily takes you to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes. The staff were super helpful and friendly. I had an atrium facing room which was lovely and since I was facing inside I did not hear any planes. I did hear kids in the pool some nights, but not too late. Never loud enough to keep me from sleeping. I ate at the restaurant a few times and if you have the opportunity try their chowder. It is delicious. I also used the light rail multiple times to head into the city and it was easy, clean and fast. Definitely a fun commute. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel was a perfect oasis conveniently next to the airport.

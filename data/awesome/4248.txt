What can I say about this hotel apart from that everything about it is fantastic. As everyone else has said the service is what makes this place so special. Poolside drinks service was regular and well timed, so that your glass was never empty. But to be honest all the staff showed the same attention to making your holiday as relaxed as possible, we felt completely spoiled. Room was fantastic, I was in the jacuzzi all the time. Drinks were plentiful and I can't believe I'm going to say this but in the evening I found the alcoholic drinks a bit too strong!! Food was stand out on every occasion. The a la carte evening meals made it feel very special every night, with my personal favourite being the French restaurant. Overall I would say that this is the best holiday I have ever had and have not stopped talking about it since.

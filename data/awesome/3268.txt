Stayed here coming and going, on our trip to Vancouver Island, BC. Great, friendly service including a free shuttle to airport and close by restaurants. Good Deluxe Breakfast was everything they said it would be. Rooms were clean and up to date. Bed was comfortable. Nice environment! Would recommend to friends and family!

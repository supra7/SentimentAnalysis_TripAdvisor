Hotel staff were wonderful! Hotel was clean--the room & most importantly, the bathroom, were very clean! The free wine reception hour was wonderful! The hotel is close to Pike Place Market, famous Post Alley, and wonderful shopping (Nordstrom, Tiffany & Co., Macy's, etc., etc.) and is in a very safe part of town--walking around, even later at night, wasn't an issue.

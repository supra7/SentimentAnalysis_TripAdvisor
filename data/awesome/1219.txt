I've stayed here MANY times. It is my first choice for downtown Seattle hotels 1 block from Westlake Center and roughly 4 blocks from Pike Place Market this hotel has a great location. But what puts this place above most is the private owners who are good to their staff. Ask an employee how long they have worked there and their answer is usually 15 years or more. That makes for people who care. With low rates for a downtown hotel ($170ish) this place is a winner!

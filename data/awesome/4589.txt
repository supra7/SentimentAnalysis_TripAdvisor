I was looking for a honeymoon and this caught my eye on thomsons website.. so we get married get to mexico and get our private transfer.. our face dropped as we went through a lagoon with a dirt track through the middle and my husband wondered where the hell id taken him.. we pulled up to the gates then went through them and it was like another world.. Everything was perfect the consierge, room service everything, we was welcomed with a ice cold flannel ,signed in and got shown to our room which had ''honeymooners'' all over the door.. we went in to find a a bottle of champagne on ice, rose petals on our bed made into a love heart it was amazing!!! There was nothing we had to do apart from probably wipe our own bum (sorry to put in so blunt!!) We went for 10 days in hurricane season and saw about 3 lots of 10minute rain!! even that was amazing to watch.. I could go on and on about this place but the list would be endless!! I would recommend this place to everyone i had no bad experience at all infact we loved it that much we've booked to go back for our annivesaire next year!!!

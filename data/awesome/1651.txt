My husband and I stayed here for a weekend trip to explore downtown Seattle and see the sights. We got a good deal for the location and could walk everywhere we wanted to go. Pike's Market is just a few blocks away, with so many vendors and things to see! If you want to see the Space Needle, just head to the monorail drop-off point two blocks away and save your feet. All of the staff we met at the Sheraton were helpful and friendly, from the lobby to the Club Floor. We walked into that lobby at eleven p.m and the desk clerk was smiling and ready to be of service. The hostess on the Club Floor always had a "Good Morning" ready no matter how early or late we wandered in for breakfast. They were very accomodating and knowledgeable. When my husband accidentally left behind his wedding ring (!) in our room on the day we checked out, they were able to find it and mail it to our home address. It just arrived, safe and sound. That's what I call customer service!

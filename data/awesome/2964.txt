We stayed at Hotel Max for three nights and loved every one of them! We were in room 807 which is a corner room with a view of the Needle and were able to watch the Blue Angel whiz past during Seafair weekend. The room was with a very comfy king bed and some of the best pillows we ever had in a hotel. Our bathroom was a perfect size and we did not encounter any space issues, there was plenty of room. The location is great and the staff was fantastic. We highly recommend Hotel Max and would stay there again, and again, and again.

Each December our teenage boys attend an annual concert in Seattle. We choose to stay downtown rather than drive back and forth to drop and pick them up. We find it's a great "date night" for us, while the kids are away. The boys join us back at the hotel at the end of their event and makes for a great holiday event in December. This year we lost our dog sitter at the last minute. The hotel we typically stay was NOT "pet friendly", in distress I google search for a new hotel that would accomodate 2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 dogs. Low and behold, Edgewater is dog friendly! Who knew! Friends joined us in the lounge while we listen to a local band and sipped red wine. It was convenient, entertaining, romantic, the food was great, the wine was tasty and we had it all in one spot close to home. I can't say enough about our experience. We will return to the Edgewater next year instead of the "old hotel". Each room was under $200 and for such a trendy hotel, I thought it was very reasonable. 6 cheers from all of us for the Edgewater.

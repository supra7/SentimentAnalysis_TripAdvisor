We were very pleasantly surprised with the University Inn. Parking is a breeze. This hotel rates my Three Cs: It is Clean, Cordial and Comfortable. Linens were newer, the bed very comfortable, and the staff attentive. We had a room with a microwave and a frig and two queens facing the street. There is some street noise, of course, so if that's a concern I suggest reserving an interior room. We were able to get a great rate at hotels.com. It was my first time to use them, and the reservation was correct and efficient, so we'll use them again. It's nice to save a few bucks on a website like that, but I'd certainly be happy to spend a little more and make a res. through the hotel itself. This is not posh. But if posh is what you want in Seattle, get ready to spend $300 or more!

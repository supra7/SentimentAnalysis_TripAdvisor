Do not listen to any of the bad reveiws, we stayed at SMB 22/10/11 for 11 nights and although the weather was disappointing the experience was amazing. The Staff couldnt have done any more, even during the hurricane and the alcohol ban they did everything they possibly could to make your stay a memorable experience. We met the most amazing people and i would return in a heart beat. Food, service and all round experience as i said amazing. Well done Secrets

Just returned from 5 night stay at resort. Cannot say enough positive about the experience, from friendliness of staff, to quality/selection of food, to accomodations. The staff, without exception, are unbegrudgingly friendly and attentive and make clear their objective is that guests have an extraordinary experience. We enthusiastically recommend this resort.

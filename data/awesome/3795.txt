We booked a week stay at this fabulous resort to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. It was 5 Star all the way! The staff is exceptional. They are friendly and cater to your every need. The room was spectacular. We upgraded to the Preferred Club and had a room overlooking the grounds and the Caribbean. Every restaurant there is superb. We did not have one bad meal the entire 7 days. We are definitely going back again.

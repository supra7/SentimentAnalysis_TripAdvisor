this hotel is definately worth the price, clean room, fridge and micro, awesome bed - very soft, and the pillows were comfy, nice staff, breakfeast buffet was ok but there is a place named houlihans right next door and they have awesome food, bar, and atmosphere for a good price. Definately stay here.

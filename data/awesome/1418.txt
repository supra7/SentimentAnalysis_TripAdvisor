This hotel was very comfortable and appealing. Everything was well kept and service was excellent and friendly. I found a great price on my room shopping the travel sites and was very happy with the value. Only negative was the walk to downtown, or rather back to hotel from downtown. BIG STEEP HILL to get back to the hotel but transports worked out great in place of walking.

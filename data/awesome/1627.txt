We stayed at this hotel one night before we took a 7 day cruise to Alaska. We arrived about 8:30pm after flying across country. We were delighted to see the hotel is in the heart of the city that never sleeps! The hotel was clean and very attractive. The lobby was very busy with people from all walks, which the hotel handled the large crowds extremely well. There were more front desk clerks than we had ever seen. Our wait to get checked in was only about a minute! All the staff were very proffessional and very helpful! The hotel has a wonderful restaurant, the name for which I cannot remember but the food was very memorable! The Angus burger was utterly the best I have ever had and was worthy of sharing! It was huge, we were very hungry and left very satisfied! The hotel is located in a good walking distance for shopping and cabs were easy to come by. The parking garage is pricey but not much more than the area parking garages. Over all, I would reccommend this hotel to everyone! It was wonderful!

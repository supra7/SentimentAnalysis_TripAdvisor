We went to Montreal for a birthday celebration with 4 other guys 36 - 50 years old. We wanted to be downtown and close to the Bell Centre for the hockey game and wanted to have space to relax in the room(s). Hotel Le Crystal is new, 3 years old. Walking in the door, the place even smells good! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The decor is very modern and nice. We had a larger deluxe suite which had a kings size bed, a large bathroom, a living room area with a pull out couch and other seating and there was lots of room for the extra bed they brought in for us. The other room was a smaller room that still had the nice big bathroom with double vanity, large soaker tub and lovely rain shower seperate from tub. The rooms were quiet, not even sure if we had neighbors and clean. There was a fridge, microwave and additional plates and utensils. Complimentary espresso with machine. Large closest for putting bags away. An umbrella even was found in the closet...which we used as it poured rain one night. We were a block of St. Catherines Street next to all the great outdoor life and one block from the Bell Centre, in fact, the visiting teams stay at this hotel. Fresh macintosh apples at every turn in this hotel, nice touch. Simple. The spa on the 12th floor was nice. The salt water pool was great and sitting outside in the large hottub over looking the city was nice and hot. All in all, I won't stay anywhere else in Montreal. Highly recommend this. The price may have been more but it was deservingly so. Worth the penny.

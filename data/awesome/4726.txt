I have to admit...I am afraid if I write this review everyone will want to go there and they will jack up the prices. Please don't! I will be short and to the point. The resort was stunning, My room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. The food was better then when you would expect in an all inclusive. The service...well I felt like a queen, (My water bottle was getting warm the staff noticed and replaced it with a cold bottle without me asking) ... They saw I ate the M & M's in the fridge in the room and my husband drank the coronas... next day lots of M & M's and Coronas in our fridge. Its all in the small details. We were upgraded to ocean front upon our arrival and given champagne and a damp cloth. We had breakfast laid out for us every morning on our ocean front balcony. The jacuzzi for two in the room was awesome. So was the chocolate cover strawberries left in our secret box after a night of dancing. The resort was just very romantic and relaxing. There were activities planned all day long if you like to be busy. I could go on and on.... So therefore, I am warning my baby sitters now.... Get ready, my kids are coming to you, because we are going back!!!

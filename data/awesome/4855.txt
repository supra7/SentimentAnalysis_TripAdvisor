Secrets Maroma Beach was our location of choice for our honeymoon! What a wonderful all-inclusive resort that caters to couples. EVERYTHING was great! Room was clean, staff goes out of their way to make sure that you have everything you need, (mini fridge re-stocked with beer/drinks daily) food was delicious, room service prompt, beach was spectacular...white sand, turquoise water. Plenty of chairs/palapas available throughout the day. Weather was great...about 90 each day..no rain. We stayed in a swim out suite which we LOVED. We felt privledged to have our very own little private pool area. I would advise taking some bug spray though, as the mosquitoes can be a bit vicious in the evening. There isn't anything I would have changed about this resort.

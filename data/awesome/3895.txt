Fantastic holiday!! As soon as you reach the hotel the excellent service begins. Champagne whilst checking in. Our room was gorgeous, with a Happy anniversary sash across the door (20 years!!) & a chilled bottle of champagne. Breakfast in the World Cafe, so much choice. Lunch in the Seaside Griil or burgers at the Barefoot grill. Hardest decision all week was where to eat in the evening. Managed to eat in them all at least twice each. Mexican was my favourite for food, Italian for atmosphere, French for style, Japanese for entertanment. Beach absolutely stunning. Got up early everyday to watch the sunrise. The pools are great, the infinity pool was our favourite with views out over the ocean. Pool concierge, Paulo & Kevin always on hand to make sure you are happy. All in all our best holiday EVER!!

This hotel is my favorite in Seattle. Wonderfully located on a pier (the only hotel in Seattle built on a pier) - amazing views, cozy rooms and friendly, helpful staff - who could ask for anything more? Meals in the Six Seven restaurant were delicious accompanied by amazing waterfront views. Staff members were friendly and eager to please. Well-located for a brisk walk (if you choose) to Pike Place Market and surrounding local restaurants and shopping. Lots of fun to watch boating from your room's window. Surprisingly quiet allowing a great night's sleep. Highly recommend.

The room was immaculately clean and well-appointed. The views of the market and Puget Sound from the room and view deck were well worth the price. The room-service meal (chamberdin (sp?), steak frites, and creme broulee) from Cafe Campagne was the second best I have ever enjoyed (the best was the same meal in Paris 10 years ago.) I definitely hope to make Inn at the Market a birthday tradition for my wife.

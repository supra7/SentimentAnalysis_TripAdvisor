Believe the good reviews as this is one of the top all inclusive resorts I have visited. The service is superior...make sure to tip for good service. The only small complaint...and I had to look hard to fine one....too hard of a sell for up grading wine at dinner..very expensive. Food was great, plenty of it....any types of drinks you needed. Beach was amazing and no problem in getting a chair.

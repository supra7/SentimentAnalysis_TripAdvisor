I've stayed at the Warwick a lot and am a big fan. The staff are always welcoming (every time I've walked in at 6am with no reservation they've immediately booked me in for the following night, no problem), the narrow balconies all have interesting views and they put me in the same room every time I visit which is really nice. Pros: The location is unbeatable for tourists wishing to shop and check out Seattle's main attractions. The onsite restaurant is truly delicious, albeit expensive (during happy hour at the bar there are some decent deals) and directly across the street from the hotel there is a small grocery with excellent ready to eat dishes (it's open until 2am and a bit pricier than most). Cons: The basement amenities leave something to be desired. The pool is not nearly as sparkling and long as it appears in the photo on the brochure, the fitness center is a bit small and the hot tub is rarely functional. The best thing about the Warwick is the staff, they have a certain cool worldly attitude that you don't tend to see in Seattle. They are neither nosy or disinterested, and respond quickly and appropriately to issues. Our toilet flooded during our stay and they immediately moved us to a nicer room on the 17th floor. Extending your trip here is amazingly easy, they will usually even keep you in the same room.

Great room (white double) in a fab location with stunning views of the canal. Bright and airy with a small, functional wetroom (some may find it cramped). The lack of soft furnishings in the spacious room made it more difficult to enjoy the view but we managed ! The bed was very comfortable and you could enjoy the views without getting out of it ! The location was fabulous, near to everything, great part of town. Access to a communal area with fridge and expresso machine (fab coffee available for guest use) was great. Apple computer in the room with WIFI and movies, music, etc. Booking the room was a bit of a chore but that may have been due to the fact that the owners were abroad.

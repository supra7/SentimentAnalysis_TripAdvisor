We got a room on the non water side that had a spectacular view of the space needle. Although a couple of trains did roll by during our one night stay, none after 10 pm. How can you complain about a room in the city on the water for just over $100. Great place for dogs; lots of places to walk, other dogs to meet and the room did not stink, was well appointed although small. Best and funnest pet friendly place I've seen since Doris Day's place in Carmel, CA. If you are taking ferry to Victoria, BC Canada, perfect place to stay; the ferry leaves right next door. We all; my husband and I and our westie and scotty had a great time here.

We arrived early and the staff was pleasant and helpful. When we checked in our room wasn't ready so we were instructed to have some lunch at one of the restaurants while we waited. They took care of our luggage for us while we walked around the resort. This is a very well kept resort, clean and beautiful. The lunch at the Seaside grill was good and the service was impeccable. We waited three hours for the room and had to ask about it but they upgraded us to the preferred club closer to the ocean. The room was extremely nice and clean. Very spacious and inviting. We took in the shows in the evenings, the mexican fiesta was entertaining and the Buffet was exceptional. We rarely ate at any restaurants as there was something going on outside every evening. The World cafe serves a breakfast buffet every morning with a good variety of hot and cold foods. The 24 hour room service was slow but the you must try the ice cream, doesn't matter which flavor, they are all to die for. The room was made up every day and the bed turned down every evening. They restocked the mini bar daily with beer, juice, and soft drinks. The pool was like bath water, a little warm for me but still refreshing. The beach is beautifil white sugar sand. If you want a lounger you have to get up early as they are all reserved by 9am even though there are signs saying you can't reserve them. If you get there late you can ask the staff and they will find one for you. The staff treats you like royalty, and our concierge, Sabastian, was exceptional! If you are looking for an adults only resort, (beware, some of the guests don't act like adults), that takes pride in pampering their customers, this is it. We can't wait to go back next year!

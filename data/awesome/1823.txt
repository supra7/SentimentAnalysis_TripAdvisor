Can only add to all of the other positive reviews. From the moment you enter the front door it is a pleasure. All staff members I interacted with were great and the hotel has that high end boutique feel - certainly has the character that so many of the chain hotels lack. The location is good with easy access to shops / restaurants / waterfront. And the crowning glory had to be Lola, their attached restaurant. It isn't often that I eat in-house, but I did often and loved each meal.

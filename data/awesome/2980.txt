My only complaint is the rooms are a little tight BUT everything else is fabulous! The atmosphere is a little rock n roll...super plush and sexy 60's style I'm thinking...beds are luxiourious and the staff is incredibly friendly and accomodating! Have also stayed in the sister hotel in Portland Hotel Deluxe ~ just as fab with a different flavor. BTW - my breakfast (scrambled eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/english muffin) was delicious! Cheers!

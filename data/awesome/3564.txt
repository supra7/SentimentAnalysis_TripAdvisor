My wife and I just spent three nights at this wonderful hotel. We had a spacious suite (non-fireplace, non-balcony suite). We really enjoyed having 2 TVs so I could stay up late and unwind out in the living area while my wife slept in the bedroom area. The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the rain-head shower and the soaking tub. The expresso machine was a nice touch and the mini-bar fridge had enough room to put leftovers in it for a later heat-up in the in-room microwave. Everything still had the new-feel about it in the hotel. The pool and hot tub seemed to always be busy during our stay. It would have been nicer for them to stay open a little later into the evening. The only negative at all was the temperature in the room. The air conditioning claimed it would go down to 18 degrees celsius which would be about 64 degrees fahrenheit. It never got that cool, especially in the bedroom. At night we opened the two large windows in the living room but because of the bed being behind a wall, the breeze never really hit us and made sleeping a little too warm for us. We're the type that wouldn't mike seeing our breath when we sleep so it was a little tough on us. Only other thing that caused me to leave one point off on cleanliness was a bottlecap that stayed in the same spot in the hallway for our entire stay which made us think they weren't cleaning the carpets in the halls.

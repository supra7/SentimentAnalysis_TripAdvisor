Stayed for 2 nights prior to a cruise. All staff were really friendly and helpful.Room on the 10th floor was comfortable.Location on 5th Avenue was only 10 minutes from downtown and Pike Market.Hotel even arranged to keep our bags after the cruise . Definitely recommend this hotel to Brits who visit Seattle for the first time

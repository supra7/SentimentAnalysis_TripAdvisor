Had an excellent stay here! The rooms were clean and cozy. The bed was super comfy (I am a huge critic on hotel room beds, I hate when they aren't comfy). Free wifi was a super plus! The front desk was helpful and kind. When we asked for a late checkout they were quick to accept our request. The location of the hotel is phenomenal, super close to all shopping, Pike Place market, good restaurants and many more great attractions! There is a coffee shop in the hotel as well! I highly recommend this hotel!

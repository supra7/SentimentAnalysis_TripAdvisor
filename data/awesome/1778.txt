Hotel Andra is a beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Seattle, short walking district to the Pikes market, shopping, and restaurants. The lobby is warm with a enticing NorthWest feel, and the lobby bar and restaurant has outstanding wine and dinner selections. The staff is extremely attentive and helpful, and make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. The rooms are very comfortable and roomy. They have been updated, with comfortable beds, lost of task and mood lighting, an ample work area on the desk, a wet bar and mini-bar, and a sizable closet. The bathroom, while small, is thoughtfully designed, with a walk-in shower, a large vanity, with a back heated mirror (so it doesn't fog) with lighting built in...it's amazing. Downsides: Bathroom slightly smaller than ideal Downtown noise can be heard in some lower floors No frequent flier or hotel points Upsides Really plush and cool Outstanding service Fabulous location

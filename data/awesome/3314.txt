We booked this hotel through Priceline (for a great rate!) since we needed somewhere to stay before a flight to Hawaii. The hotel a bit dated from the outside, but as soon as you walk into the lobby you'll quickly realize that it has been updated - very modern interior. Check-in was very fast and the front desk person friendly. The room was nicely renovated and had Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom. The atrium pool area was really nicely maintained - a large pool and two hot tubs. The restaurant / lounge had fantastic food. All in all, we were really impressed with this hotel and would suggest it to anyone who is staying in the Sea-Tac area before a flight.

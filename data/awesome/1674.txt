My husband and I stayed here for two nights at the back end of a business trip. The staff was friendly and courteous, the room was beautiful and very clean, and the view was amazing. The hotel is right downtown within walking distance of the Pike Street Market and even the Space Needle. There are a ton of restaurants in the area and lots of shopping as well. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone who's taking a trip to Seattle!

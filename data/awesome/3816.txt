I'm not real sure how I can explain the most wonderful experience in my life other than TRULY AMAZING!!! We had the best time I have ever had in my life outside of my wedding day and the birth of my son. Secrets Maroma Resort grounds, staff and entertainment staff are all so very wonderful. ALL of the entertainment staff made us feel like family.They even exited the swimming pool in the middle of a volleyball game to hug us all bye, and being from the South it doesn't get any better than that:). We will defintely be back as soon as we can get there. Thank you so much!!!

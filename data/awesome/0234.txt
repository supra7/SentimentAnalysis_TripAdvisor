I just wanted to write and thank the lovely staff. The first time I stayed there I was getting married, so I chose to stay in the city the night before and I chose the Hotel Monaco. They upgraded us to a suite on the top floor for free and the wine hour in the lounge was a nice break for us. The wine was nice and they had bottles of it for sale. I'm sorry I can't remember anyone's name, it was such a busy time for me but we just went back and stayed the night and everything was the same. The only bad part was the overnight valet, it costs $40, yikes! I used sidestep to book a room and the deciding factor was the Aveda products they stock there. The room was $190 for the night which is spendy, but actually pretty fair for a 4 star hotel.

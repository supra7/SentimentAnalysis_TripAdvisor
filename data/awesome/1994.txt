We really loved this hotel. The main building is beautiful although we were staying in one of suites in the garden. Another review here mentions the smell of mould in one of these, but this problem had gone by the time we came here in autumn 2011. The suite itself was beautiful, huge bedroom, flatscreen TV, small private patio area screened by shrubbery, beautiful and large bathroom with spa bath. And so quiet and peaceful, with a walk through the garden in the morning for breakfast in the conservatory. It was also spotlessly clean. It didnt serve evening meals but had a bar. 10 mins walk from Bologna station but so what? Nothing much around the area to speak of but we found a nice local restaurant (can't recall the name!). It was only a few minutes on the underground into the centre of Rome. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

I used to frequent this hotel when I travelled to Seattle for business over 10 years ago. We stayed here for one night last weekend during a quick family getaway to the Northwest and I had to stay at the Vintage Park Hotel. Everything was smooth and comfy! Parking was easy (though of course it's not cheap overnight in the city), check in was fast, our room was clean and oh so cozy. Though small, the fitness center equipment is top notch and everything was clean. The coffee service in the lobby in the morning is nice and unfortunately we missed the evening wine tasting in the lobby. Love this hotel!

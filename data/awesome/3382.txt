Had a one night stopover here in January. Always feel lucky when this one comes up on Priceline. This is my 3rd stay at this hotel and everytime it exceeds my expectations for a Hilton. Rooms are clean and extremely comfortable. There are plenty of rooms that are away from the noise of the airport and International Boulevard. Noise can be an issue at some Sea-Tac hotels. Only odd note was no wine glasses, cork screw or bottle opener in the room. Called the front desk and this was all rushed right to our room. Public areas are spacious, elegant and claen. Staff are always friendly. The bell staff have always been exceptional here and will provide un-biased advice on nearby shopping and dining. Everytime we have also been offered a ride in the shuttle bus to a local restaurant or store and then picked up again when we were ready. Really nice service on a rainy Seattle night. There are several restaurants within walking distance, I like 13 Coins and Sharp's, and also there is a 7-11 just up the hill behind the property. Stasy here if you get the chance

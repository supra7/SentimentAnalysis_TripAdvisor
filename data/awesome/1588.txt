A great hotel right by the convention center where PAX was held this year. The room was clean and very modern. Shower worked great with the right pressure and temperature. They bring fresh towels and bathroom stuff daily. The view was ok if you don't mind looking at the city and the convention center, but that didn't matter too much for me. The beds were fluffy and comfortable. The room came with a nice big LCD TV with basic cable. Wifi costs extra, which was a down side since cheaper hotels offer free WiFi. The room was a little pricey, but it was during PAX. If you have friends to split the costs, then it was manageable. The best thing is the location since you are right smack in the center of Seattle with all the food and entertainment.

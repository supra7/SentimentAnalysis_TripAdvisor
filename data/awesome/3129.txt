This convention was on my own bucks. Couldn't afford the Hyatt, Sheraton, etc. and am not an status member. Booked the Roosevelt on Priceline and got a great rate for the convention. When I checked in Caleb and Patrick at the fron desk get me a great room and made me feel like I was a VIP traveler. Simple things helping me with the business center and just the overall "can do" attitude blew my expectations away. If you are going to the convention center and need a great value, this is the place. Great restaurant with good food and good value, too.

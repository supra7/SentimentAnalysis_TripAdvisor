This hotel is in a great location, but that is minor compared to the treatment you get here. No detail was too small to ensure our comfort. The nightly wine tastings were a treat, and we came away from them with many helpful suggestions from staff and other guests of places to visit in the surrounding area. We are very impressed with the Kimpton brand. As other reviewers have noted, make sure you join the InTouch program as it definitely gives you benefits during your stay.I highly recommend this hotel!

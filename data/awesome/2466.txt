We were given this hotel as part of mystery hotel that is we didn't know what the hotel was until we paid for it. This place was fantastic! It was close to all the major sites in Seattle and very close to the light transit which took you to SeaTac Airport for only $2.50 one way. Awesome value! The room was spacious and on the 20th floor. We had the view of the seattle tower from our room. The room was just heavenly as the information pack suggested. Every thing you could ask for was in this room. They did not have free internet access in the room, however there is complimentary internet in the lobby, which was great because you can watch the guest come in and our and you can also shop and buy a drink. Since we did book this hotel as a secret hotel the price was extremely reasonable. The bed was very comfortable and we had a king bed which was very roomy. The bathroom had twin showers which were awesome. The hotel does recommend that you only use one head for water conservation however, it was lovely to indulge once in a while. There are wonderful restaurants all around and the market were wonderful for food and little souvenirs to take home. The restaurant food in the hotel is quite expensive while outside you can get some delicious food and experience the Seattle nightlife. The staff were superfriendly and provided us with information and exchange the coffee machine promptly. Despite such a huge hotel it had the comfort of being the only one that matter and the only one there.

My husband & I wanted to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary and indulging in some much needed R & R. Our travel agent actually recommended Secrets Maroma and I was skeptical at first. We were sooo BEYOND, pleasantly surprised! It was a short, direct flight from Charlotte, NC. The transfers went smoothly and were included in our package. The main lobby is really breathtaking and they welcomed us with cool towels and a flute of champagne! The beaches were gorgeous and the rooms were identical to the website photos. The staff were all so wonderful; I don't think the word "no" is in their vocabulary. We traveled during easter/spring break week but never had to listen to crying children (why we left ours with grandma) OR loud, wild spring-breakers. This was NOT a 'cookie cutter' resort. There is a full schedule of events made available but we skipped most of them in favor of laying on the beach or by the pool. Really, its the best of both worlds...you can be as active or relaxed as you'd like. The food was VERY good. I've eaten in NYC and all over Europe and Secrets was on par with my experiences there. None of the restaurants are 'formal.' Most are considered casual. The breakfast buffet at the world cafe is like nothing I've ever seen. We'd eat brunch around 9 or 10, have a cocktail and shrimp cocktail by the pool around 2 or 3 and dinner at 8ish. I think we made reservations twice the whole time we were there. Our package included a $200 spa credit so we had a couples' massage and it was sublime. We toasted our travel agent more than once and agreed the trip was better than our honeymoon. We'll be back for sure!

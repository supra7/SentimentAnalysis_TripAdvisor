We have stayed at the Monaco several times. The hotel is a perfect location. We park our car (Valet) and don't need it until we leave. Everything is so close. We visited the Seattle Gift show this recent visit and walked from the hotel to the convention centre, to shopping, to dinner.........everywhere. And of course after a day like that we come back to complimentary wine and beer in the lobby, available to all of their guests.. Perfect. The rooms have always been spotless, with all amenities that one would need including lovely, plush robes. Staff are so friendly and help you with whatever you may need. Directions, locations, suggestions . The hotel also has a great work out room which is never too busy to use. The Carmichaels B.C,, Canada

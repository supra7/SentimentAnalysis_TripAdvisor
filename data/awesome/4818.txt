I would definitely say this is one of the best vacations ever. We had a great time and couldn't have asked for a better hotel or better service. Our room was beautiful and having the swim out suite was so nice. The staff at Secrets Maroma was amazing. From Gerardo at the front desk to Javier & Jessica at the pool, we couldn't have had better service. We loved everyone on the Entertainment Crew (Marcella, Alex, Karla & Giovana) and had so much fun watching the shows put on each night. This was seriously an amazing trip. We were there with some friends for their 10th anniversary and we are already planning a trip for our 10th anniversary in a couple of years.

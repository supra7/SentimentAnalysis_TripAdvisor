Don't go there expecting a super large room. Then again, why would you want a large room when there is so much to see in Seattle??This is the place to stay if you are looking for a great central location (easy to get to everywhere downtown), very clean rooms (bathrooms and showers included), incredibly comfortable beds with down comforters and very soft sheets, great service, great price/value, contemporary decor (wonderful art) and an overall wonderful experience. Stay here; we loved it!

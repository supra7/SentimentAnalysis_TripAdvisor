My wife secured this hotel for a Disney/Universal tour with her 1st grade class from Ft. Worth Tx including 57 people. The management worked with us on details before the trip and fulfilled all they promised. The manager on duty was more than helpful with everything we needed including getting us a great start on our bus every morning. Rooms were clean. Continental breakfast was enough to hold us till lunch everyday. Location is close to everything. Price is unbeatable. Thanks for everything.

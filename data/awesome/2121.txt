My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights while in Seattle. I got the room at an extremely reduced rate through Priceline but the hotel clerk still gave us a fabulous room upgrade upon check in. Every staff member we encountered was respectful and friendly. The shower was the best I've EVER had- to include in my own home. The location is ideal- walking distance to the waterfront, Pike market and downtown. What a wonderful experience- I truly have nothing but good things to say about the Edgewater!

This is my second time to Mexico and if I ever get the chance to go back I'll be staying here. My personal opinion is, everything is 5 star. Some of the gripes people have just baffle me. The hotel cannot control the fact that there may be some rubbish that washes up on the beach. The hotel grounds are the cleanest I have ever seen. The food is great and varied. There are good activities on offer but you can relax to your heart's content if you wish. If you fancy a little bit of paradise, I would highly recommend this hotel.

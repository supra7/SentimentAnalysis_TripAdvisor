We absolutely loved our time at the resort. My wife is more of a relax and read by the pool girl, while I love to be more active. The resort had a great mix of everything, from volleyball and activities for me, to very attentive wait staff for her. All of our dinners were delicious. We especially liked the Hibachi restaurant. Great atmosphere and great food! Our room was perfect for a honeymooning couple as well. The jacuzzi tub on the balcony was a nice touch. It added a nice place to hang out after being at the pool and beach all day. The staff were also all very accommodating and made every attempt to make sure our time was enjoyable. We had such a great time that my wife went back on the website when we got back to the States to try to relive some of the memories. We are definitely looking into doing it again next year.

We had a fabulous time here for our honeymoon. The food was outstanding, the service was always excellent. It would have been very easy to over-indulge but luckily we managed to restrain ourselves! I am a vegetarian so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be well catered for, but there was a special (and delicious) vegetarian menu in each of the 7 restaurants, so I never felt restricted. We really enjoyed getting involved with the activities put on by the entertainment team and felt that we had a great balance of being active and just relaxing. We went when the hotel was quite quiet, as it was just coming to the end of their peak season, but that didn't affect our stay. The weather in the second week was quite wet, but we still really enjoyed ourselves. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a romantic holiday for two. It was absolutely perfect as everything was geared up for romance.

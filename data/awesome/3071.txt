I stayed at the Max in April 08 even after hearing some reviews about it being too small. In my opinion, size did not matter because the second you touched that bed you were out cold due to the comfort. There is even a pillow menu! The decor was awesome, and the restaurant downstairs was beyond expectations, including the room service. Plus, my room was reasonably priced and the hotel is within walking distance of the market and lots more.

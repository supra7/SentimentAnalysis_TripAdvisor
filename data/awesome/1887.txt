We stayed at the Andra six nights in June; First the rooms are large with great bathrooms ours faced 4th Street but was very quiet. Nice touches; ice in bags at the elevator ready to take to your room as you exist the elevator. Many great restaurants within 5 min. walking. Also the new airport transit $1.25 per senior adult, takes 30 minutes, no traffic problems; this service at the Monorail station, take elevator to the LL below street level, very helpful people in using this service, is only 3 blocks from the Hotel. Stay here if can get a room. Staff is superb. We will return.

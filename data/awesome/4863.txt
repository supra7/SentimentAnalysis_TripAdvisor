From the time we arrived at the resort, we were treated like family. There was no request to big or small that was not taken care of promptly. The quality of the whole resort goes beyond description. There was one employee in particular that went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed and that was Vianney. The food, service and entertainment were great. The only downside was the first representative from apple vacation named Jimmy. Who recommended a snorkeling tour that was horrible and should have been canceled due to the weather conditions that day. Other than that the trip, staff and resort were perfect. We will for sure be back..................

The hotel is a 3 star hotel, but the rooms seemed taken from a 4-5 star hotel. The hotel has several style rooms. We stayed in a Lyfestyle room and we were impressed by the cleanliness, and the space. The room had huge windows which gave wiew to the Potsdamer Strasse, but we didn't hear a noise from the outside. The bathroom was extremely new and clean (the whole hotel seemed overall very new and clean). The staff was young and very helpful. The last day they offered us the possibility of buying underground tickets in the hotel, if necessary, and gave us 2 free drinks ticket for the hotel bar. The breakfast was expensive (11 euro per person and day), so we didn't have breakfast in the hotel. You have to take into account the price of the room changes a lot depending on the day (maybe depending on how many people is staying at the hotel, or the events there are in Berlin those days), so it ranges (for exemple, for whay I am seeing righ now) from 49 euro to 89 euro the Basic room, or from 59 to 89 euro the Lyfestyle room, or from 69 to 109 euro the Lyfestile plus room. There are also offers you can take, such as 15% discount if you book 4 or more days (but you lose your cancelation rights) or a 30% summer discount in some selected days. Overall, the hotel costed us 65 euros per night. The location is quite nice. Despite it has no monuments close (although you may walk the 170 house numbers through Potsdamer strasse until Postdamer platz, but it can take up to 30 minutes), it is close to 3 underground stations, specially the U2 line, which takes you to most of the important places of Berlin (or to a line which takes you to that places, making only 1 change of line). Overal, I liked MUCH this hotel, and I strongly reccomend it, specially if you can fing a good offer such as we did.

we really liked the location of this hotwire.com room. And the price($80.00US) for this 4 star hotel. And, yes, we paid a lot for parking but we've found this to be true anywhere downtown and we prefer to pay for secure parking and walk, so location means more to us. The view was beautiful as were the furnishings, flat screen TV and beautiful bathroom. But the swimming pool and spa were under going renovations and we couldn't get any sports channel with the Western Conference NHL playoffs. However, we had a good dinner out(at Moma's Mexican Resturant, Bell Town, an old favorite)within a short walk and a great walk to Pike Street Market the next morning, Mother's Day, so lots of beautiful flower vendors out. It didn't bother us too much but there were a lot of guests going on a cruise the next morning and the elevators were tied up for almost two hours with people trying to get on them and get checked out and to their cruise ship on time. We were on the 15th floor and after waiting 15 minutes, took an 'up' elevator, so we could go 'down'. The car was full by it's second stop down but then stopped at every floor!! all the way down, 35 of them. Maybe all cruise ship passengers need to be checked in, on lower floors instead of the highest. They all seem to need to be at the ship at the same time. But our stay was great!!

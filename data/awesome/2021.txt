Had a wonderful view of the sound and the port, ocean-going ships, sea lions--plus a cozy fireplace. Our room was delightful, happy hour in the 67 Pier bar was lots of fun with Brianna as our server. Breakfast was a very good--I particularly liked the oatmeal. Our server every morning was Ali and she was great. We did not have a car so walked or took the hotel shuttle to lots of different attractions downtown. We would highly recommend the Edgewater to others.

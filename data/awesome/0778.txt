This is a beautiful little hotel in an absolutely fantastic location. The hotel is right in the thick of Pike's Place Market and is also central to other interesting spots and sights across the city. Service was top notch--everyone on the staff was friendly and went out of their way to provide assistance. It can get noisy at night, so I recommend requesting a higher floor room. We did not have a water view room, but there is a deck available to all customers that provides stunning views of the bay and the surrounding areas. All things considered, I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle. The Fairmont might be more luxurious, but the location and atmosphere of the Inn at the Market (which is plenty luxurious) more than compensates.

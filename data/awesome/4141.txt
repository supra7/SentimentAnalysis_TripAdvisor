We went here in June 2010 for our honeymoon and loved it so much that we came back for our first anniversary. Some of the staff actually remembered us by name! I find that very impressive. The service is top notch, the beach was voted #2 in the world by the Travel Channel and the resort is absolutely beautiful. What more could you want? We will back next year! :)

My husband and I splurged on this Maroma Beach trip, we are usually those who hunt down deals but after all the amazing reviews we picked this resort. Nothing short of amazing! We did upgrade to the preferred club and had a room on the top full or ocean view- it was totally worth it. We just came back from the Four seasons in Punta Mita- though the food and service were better (but you paid dearly for it) overall this resort is worth every cent. Likes: cleanliness, comfortable beds Dislikes: wish we could have stayed longer! *neither of us got "sick" here too which happens to us while traveling quite often. I now see why it's in the top ten of all inclusives in the world :)

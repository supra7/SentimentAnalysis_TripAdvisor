We loved our too short stay at the Hotel Max! From the bright pink lights illuminating the building on the outside, to the funky & eclectic, but very chic decor inside, to the door-sized photo of Kurt Cobain welcoming us into our room, Hotel Max impressed us at every turn. The beds are super comfy, the bathroom products are Aveda, the doormen are cute & engaging, and everything seemed to run like a well-oiled black & pink Vespa. Plus the location made it so easy for us to walk everywhere. We stayed at the Deca for several nights before we moved to the Max, and the Max WAY outshone the Deca. In every way!

Our waterside room was spacious and comfortable and included a bathroom that opened up to the bedroom and the view. The bed was comfortable and the views were fantastic. The 6/7 restaurant is epic: among the best lunch, dinner, and room service meals we've ever had. The waiter at dinner was kind enough to waive the corkage fee for a nice bottle of wine our guests brought. The location was perfect for walking to the Space Needle/Seattle Center area and to the Pike Market area. We enjoyed a bike ride along the shore through Elliott Park and walked next door to catch our clipper to the San Juan Islands.

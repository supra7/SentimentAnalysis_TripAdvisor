Stayed in the W as my usual choice, the Westin, was full. Enjoyed the experience - rooms are stylish, though a lot smaller than the Westin, staff friendly and helpful, toiletries provided in bathroom were by Bliss, which I love, and both the room service and restaurant/breakfast food was excellent. On the downside, this is a really "cool"hotel so if you're put off by that, avoid. The lobby is dark with loud, atmospheric music so forget about having any business meetings or working there! Quality and variety of food was better than the Westin, and the location is good, in a nice part of town, walkable to shopping and amenities. Not as high rise as the Westin, so views not as good, but I can live with that. Great place. I'd go back on a pleasure trip, rather than business, but it's equally good as a business hotel.

This is an amazing resort for couples. The staff was immediately welcoming; especially the Rooms Division Manager, Rafael. Upgrading to the preferred club is worth the extra money for the view alone. The room had all the amenities we were looking for, soaking tub on the balcony, large jetted tub in the bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the pool area is very nice as well. Top shelf drinks are the norm in every area of this hotel. The restaurants are all very good but Himitsu and Portofino were the best in our opinion. Our server at Portofio, Domingo, remembered us and our preferences. Don't miss out on the entertainment if you are up for it at night; very entertaining. A cigar and nightcap outside the main bar is also a nice way to end your evening. At the end of our trip it was clear that Secrets Maroma Beach was the right choice.

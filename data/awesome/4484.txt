just got back from the resort, devastated did not want to leave. Thomas Alex Hector etc great team, can they get a raise? The service was terrific friendly very helpful, servers just the same. Very Clean!!! They are constantly cleaning and touching up, it is beautiful and the food was muy bueno. This resort is a mini paradise. The Night Shows were entertaining, too bad the crowd wasn't as enthusiastic haha.. DEFINATELY MUST GO BACK.. but beware of their sister hotel "Secrets Capri" that was a living hell, it wouldn't have been so bad if the service was at least like Maroma but frankly the hotel is crappy and the staff is proud of it. Oh and the beach was large and clean as well. Also the hotel is fashioned in a- Barcelona modern Euro - way .. very nice

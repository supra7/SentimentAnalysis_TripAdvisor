My wife and I stayed at the Inn mid-Spring and were delighted with the hotel and services. We wanted to be near downtown but not in the city center and the Inn fit the bill to a T. The 80 room hotel sits atop First Hill, in a quiet neighborhood of historic mansions, cathedrals, medical centers and tree-lined streets. Just a few blocks walk to the city core. It looks like a boutique European hotel, brick building with a colorful awning, flower-boxes and polished brass everywhere, a cozy lobby, a great cafe for all three meals (we ate dinner there) and courtyard. The staff is more than terrific - from the desk staff to the cafe servers, its evident they enjoy working there and are great concierges for the city. The rooms are nice and are very fairly priced. The housekeeping is immaculate. The suites (we didn't stay in one but toured several) are very nice and two are on the top floor where there is an open terrace for a terrific view of the city. We'll stay in the "fireplace" suite on our next visit to Seattle. A real neat spot. Highly recommended.

We stayed for a long weekend at Lindemanns, and I have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. Most of the reviews are true. Good points: lovely, friendly staff, very spacious penthouse studio (well worth the upgrade!), comfy big bed, huge walk in shower and modern, funky interiors. Downsides: the immediate area is a little scruffy but hopefully on the up. Water pressure at peak times in the top floor penthouses is almost non-existent... almost a drip! (you'd think that would be easy to design out!). Never experienced that before, even at budget UK hotels. Being on the 6th floor the penthouses are well sound proofed from the main road, so we slept well. Only one slight unpleasantness.... being followed into the hotel on the friday by a drunk punk who was vandalising the bus shelter outside the hotel having been at a big party in the building opposite. He was very rude and agressive to our party of four, and the duty receptionist didn;t do much to stop him. Quite unnerving!! Not quite the hotels fault, but they may want to consider night time security.

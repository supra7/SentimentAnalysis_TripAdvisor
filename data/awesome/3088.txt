I planned a weekend get away for my Husband as an anniversary/birthday present. I had read the reviews for Hotel Max and while some were mixed it sounded like a fun experience. We loved staying here. We were already prepared for the room size as that was mentioned in many reviews that we had read. The staff was extremely friendly and allowed us to check in early (with no additional fee). The gentlemen at the door could not have been more helpful. They were very sincere in helping us with our luggage as well as calling for a taxi. While the room size was small the rooms were fun and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Paying for the internet was a surprise but not a huge deal. The Red Fin was outstanding! We had sushi and drinks and soaked up the atmosphere. The location of Hotel Max made getting around Seattle easy. It is a comfortable walking distance to Pike Place Market and most dinning establishments. We enjoyed the total Seattle experience staying at the Hotel Max. Individuals who like Super 8 Hotels would probably not enjoy the Hotel Max experience. We will stay here again!

If you are staying near the airport, it is a great hotel. Easy to reach, very clean and well-appointed rooms. I was surprised at how nice the rooms were! The bed was amazingly comfortable. It is an easy drive into downtown Seattle from here and worked great for my late-arriving flight before meetings in Seattle the following morning. The coffee bar in the lobby was handy, too!

I have been meaning to write this review and am just now getting around to it. I stayed here with my husband and cousin at the end of October for 2 nights so we could tour the city and see the sights. I bokked on Priceline and named my own price and got an exceptionally great room rate so even with parking being pretty pricey it still was not as uch as staying in a lower class motel in the area. Last time we used Priceline we were at the Sheraton and it too had an excellent location but I thought the service and room quality of the crowne plaza were of better quality and value. I was surrised how nice the check in lady was being that i booked on priceline, she actually made me feel like a valued guest. We were given a higher floor and although it looked over the freeway the view was still not bad of the mountains in the distance. my only complaints would be of the parking fee, valet only was around 30.00 but in seattle that is pretty standard downtown and then the fee for internet which we did not use. We didn't eat on site so I have no comment about that. Also one small thing is there is not a pool ar a hot tub but I kjnew this before bookuing so it was not a big deal. Beds were comfy and our room was quiet.

I was put into this property by an airline due to a maintenance issue, although I checked in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, I saw enough that I want to return! The pool area, lobby and view from the balcony were very nice, not what I normally find when traveling and especially not this close to the airport! From reading others reviews I was not in the main towers, and only complaint was only being on the second floor someone was above me and from the sound they made walking must have weighed 400 pounds as it was very loud. Other than that, I was greeted very nicely and professionally at the desk by a staff member that had a very irate customer on the phone, in spite of him trying his best from the portion of the conversation I heard, he continued to handle himself in a professional manner, then when he place the caller on hold to assist me, was very courteous and professional. As others have mentioned as well, who's night is not made better when checking in and receiving a warm cookie? The room was nice, comfortable beds, good selection of pillows, nice TV channel selections (was no guide so I had to search for channels). The two sinks were nice (one in the bath portion and one by the closet) that would be a nice feature if traveling with your spouse or children. Also nice view of some trees out the balcony. While the wing I was in appeared to be older, you could tell they try to take care of it and it was very clean. Overall, a very nice surprise, I have read on here it is best to request a room in the main towers, if not I would definatly ask to be on the top floor. I have also found that requesting rooms at the end of the hall are quieter. I look forward to returning to this property with my wife and being able to spend more time in the city as well as what the doubletree has to offer!

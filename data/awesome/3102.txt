I stayed at the Hotel Max in Seattle for 4 nights at the beginning of November, and I loved it! I had a room with 2 double beds, and it was just the right size, and the bathroom was also a decent size. Note, this was the MOST COMFORTABLE hotel bed and linens I have ever slept in, all 4 nights I slept like a baby! The hotel is very funky, probably more so for 20 - 30-somethings. It is in a very convenient area, close to everything, and a short walk to Pikes Place Market and lots of other shopping, movies, and restaurants. My only gripe is the parking cost, which is $22 valet, just be careful that even though I only used valet for 2 nights, they charged me for all 4 nights automatically, so make sure to double-check your bill. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I am sure to be back!

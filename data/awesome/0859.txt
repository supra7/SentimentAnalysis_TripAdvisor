Close to everything but a world away. I stayed two nights on a Travelzoo rate and was upgraded to a corner room on the executive floor. Lobby is small but the room was sprawling, totally unexpected for a downtown tower. Travel was for leisure and I saw others there not on business though I felt a little underdressed. The hotel is three blocks and about 150 feet higher from the airport light rail. A combination of walking, bus, and rail will let you see alot of Seattle without a car. Rooms are quiet, clean and service is nearly flawless. Unknown to me the the hotel offered a turndown service. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is a decent deal but I would not plan to eat other meals there.

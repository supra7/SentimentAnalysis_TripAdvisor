Evening check-in was quick, efficient & pleasant. Roomed on 7th floor facing away from the airport. Double paned glass, so airplane noise didn't bother. Room was very neat and tidy. Sleep number bed was comfy as you're able to adjust the mattress firmness (via air bladder). Bathroom ceiling is a bit low, so it may feel slightly claustrophobic. Flat screen TV with a number of cable channels available. WiFi connection has a strong signal and fast connection speed. Black out curtains & down (?) comforter made it easy to sleep in. Hotel appears to be fully wheelchair accessible: automatic & push doors at entrance; lobby, reception, dining area & pool/fitness center all on one level; rest of building is accessed by 2 elevators at rear of main lobby. The hotel appears to be undergoing a several month-long renovation/remodel (refresh?) of the restaurant. Current menu seems much more limited than the in-room version. Breakfast looked like it was buffet style only or at least very limited. The Radisson is located across the street from the airport. As such you can walk to the baggage claim level and take escalators up to check-in, etc. The hotel is on the opposite end of the airport from the Link light rail station, so it's a bit of a hike to catch a train into Seattle. Walk-able if you're in good shape and travel light otherwise the hotel shuttle (runs on the hour & half hour) will drop you off nearby.

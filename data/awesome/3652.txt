The reviews seemed almost too good to be true for this out of the way place in Kissimmee, but they were true. This is a great, well run, inexpensive place to spend a few days while in this area, especially if going to WDW. The motel is located in a less hectic area of Kissimmee, a few miles west of I-4 off Route 192. It is about 1/2 mile west of FL 429 (a toll road) and is a little tricky to find--if going west you pass a Houlihan's on the left (purple neon around roof), then a McDonald's and 7-11, where you turn left and go about 75 yards to the motel on your left. Being off 192 seems to make it a quieter place to stay. It is just a few miles from Disney (you do not have to get on I-4)--go east on 192, then north on any one of a number of side roads that lead you up to Osceola Parkway or World Drive into any one of the Disney parks. The rooms were a pleasant surprise--we stayed on the first floor and the room had an excellent king sized bed with a pillow top mattress, refrigerator, toaster oven, coffee maker, iron and ironng board, hair dryer and a flat screen TV. There was no bath, only a very good shower. The continental breakfast was more than adequate with hard boiled eggs, a variety of cereals, bagels, pastry, juice, cofffee/tea and waffles and pancakes that you have to toast. The staff is pleasant, especially Alan, the general manager, who tries to make your stay very pleaant. Rates are very reasonable. The only glitch in our stay of 2 nights was the fact that the heater/AC controls did not work in the room. We discovered this late on the 2nd night and were not able to tell Alan until the next morning. The way this place seems to operate I am sure that it was fixed.

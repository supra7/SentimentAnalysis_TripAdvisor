I absolutely loved staying at the maroma, the staff are so friendly and facilities are great fun activities etc forget yourself and get involved. The bars stock all the brands just ask for them and the staff really do deserve their tips, we took a wedge of $1 bills with us for that reason. Rooms are lovely standard I wasn't happy with my view on arrival so they switched us without question and gave us several options. The food is good, not quite 5 star so not as good as you would find at home but nice and lots of variety we actually loved the poolside grill for simple but tasty lunch. I was actually taken seriously ill during our stay ( unrelated to mexico or hotel) and the hotel and staff were fabulous driving my boyfriend to and from the hospital daily, ensuring on arrival back at the hotel we had everything we needed with facilities/diet as well as flowers etc to cheer me up. Our second stay at a Secrets resort and would definately go again.

Very well laid out resort, spotlessly clean throughout, very peaceful probably because there were no kids! Room was excellent - top floor - given choice of king or two queens- not one problem. Bars and restaurants were very impressive as was the central lobby/ lounge - plenty of very comfortable seating. Never had to wait for a seat in any of the restaurants -eating around 7.30 - 8.00 - food first class. Everyone we spoke to was full of praise for the hotel . The pools were surrounded by rattan type beds - very comfortable, wonderful beach always plenty of sunbeds at pool and beach and of course to top it all there was always the wonderful attitude of all the staff. Free internet in the business centre.Been to many 5 star resorts in Mexico/Caribbean but this is the best ! What you see on the hotel web site is what you get !

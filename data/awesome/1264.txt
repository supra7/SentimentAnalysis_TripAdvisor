We stayed in one of the suites of The Moore hotel during last June, and I must say it's the best I've ever experienced in Seattle. The room was spacious, and so was the bathroom, there was also a living area that could have been more comfortable, but was good enough for us, with a kitchenette and a dining table. The decoration was simple, modern and very nice, combined with some old features, such as the radiators. And it's true that they fold the towels in animal shapes. We had a dog (although my husband believes it was a rabbit... whatever... it was puppy, believe me :P). The location is perfect to go out at night, to go shopping during the day, and its only a couple of blocks away from the seafront and the market, and a short walk to the EMP, International fountain, Space needle, etc. The parking is a block away, and it's 12$/night. You can request a card in the hotel to request in/out privileges. BUT! it closes at midnight and opens again at 7, so if you're going to be late at night, you better take a cab to avoid having to park on the street. Back to the hotel, the staff was very helpful and friendly at all times. The only rude person we met was the bartender of the bar next to the hotel, but we're unsure whether it belongs to The Moore or not.

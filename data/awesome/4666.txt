We had an AMAZING honeymoon and would reccommend this place to anyone and everyone. It is definitely worth the money, the service is wonderful no matter where you go on the resort. We were skeptical about a "Mexico" honeymoon at first since most people say to go for something more exotic, but this was the best decision we made! The rooms are beautiful, service amazing, all-inclusive is the way to go, and food was great! There are so many options for dining and there is something for everyone. I've seen people post criticism about the portion size, but it was perfect- and guess what? If it's not enough food, you're at an ALL INCLUSIVE so you can order more or go restaurant hopping all night long! Don't miss the World Cafe for lunch- so many people just stay poolside or on the beach for lunch, and we discovered this late in the vacation... it has the most amazing spread of everything you could imagine! DON'T MISS: The Spa is one of the most beautiful and relaxing places on the resort, definitely treat yourself to a massage, even if it is a short one, the spa experience itself should not be missed. SKIP- the dinner on the beach. I'm a pretty sappy girl and i was dead-set on doing the "romantic dinner on the beach thing". However, before we booked we talked to other people and most couples complained about it being so dark they couldn't see their food!While on a romantic evening walk, we saw what they meant. It's really dark and you only have a small tea-light candle at your table. There are about 8 tables so you're not by yourself anyway and it's pretty expensive... I say skip it- especially you ladies out there who are dying for the "dinner on the beach thing"! You will not be dissappointed with this vacation, we didn't want to leave!

We have recently returned from a truly marvellous holiday at Secrets Maroma and during our holiday we believe we have discovered the secret of Secret Maroma; It could be the tremendous beach location, the beautiful gardens and landscaping or the great accommodation, maybe it is the varied and delicious food offered in the themed restaurants or the never ending entertainments????? Whilst all of these are excellent to the highest standard it is none of them, the true secret of Secrets Maroma is the wonderful staff. Well trained (congratulations to the training team), professional and totally committed to ensuring that all of your guests have a holiday to remember. There were so many simple acts of sheer delight to us but we must mention one that summed up our holiday: We were returning from a busy day touring Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel, as we got out of taxi the security man welcomed us with these simple words welcome home and yes it felt as if we had come home. Through this review we wish to pass on our most sincere thanks for a holiday we consider to be one of our best ever our only regret is that we had to eventually return home

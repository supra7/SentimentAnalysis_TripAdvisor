We have stayed at the DoubleTree Seatac more than 15 times, love it. I suggest getting a room in the tower. Upgrade to King Corner Room or Penthouse to really treat yourself, balcony are amazing in these rooms. Service is outstanding, there nightclub is always fun and classy. Don't have to worry about drinking and driving, just a elevator ride to your room!

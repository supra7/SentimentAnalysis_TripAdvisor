This place rules!!! Food was excellent, rooms were clean, the entertainment rocked, the entertainment staff (Sebastian, Alex, and Jesus) were AWESOME, the grounds were beautifully manicured, the beach is gorgeous, the water...turquoise until the eye can see, the drinks were fantastic, etc, etc, etc. Can you tell I like this place? :o) BTW - While sitting here staring at my computer, every once in awhile, I go to their website and look at the "live" web cam views of the resort and that beautiful ocean. It's so relaxing and it brings back wonderful memories. Check it out! http://www.secretsresorts.com/maroma/webcam.asp

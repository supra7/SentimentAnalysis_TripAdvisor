I'll keep this pretty short. Well, shorter than other reviews I have written at least. SMB is a beautiful resort with wonderful staff. We went for 7 nights and I wish we could've stayed longer. The grounds are great, the staff is friendly & attentive and the entertainment crew is a lot of fun. Some resort's entertainment crews are pushy. They are not like this at all here. They ask for participation but if you decline, they move along. Check in was easy. Room wasn't ready so we hit the food & pool. Food. OMG. The food there is wonderful. So much of it at every turn and all day/night. I came home 12 lbs. heavier!!!! Activites & shows were fun. Outside buffet was delish! Love that they show movies in the theater. My only change to this place would be to have the bars/disco stay open a little longer. Drinks were great & bartenders too! Met lots of new friends. The coati (well, there was more than one) was just adorable. But, as they ask, don't feed them. You wouldn't want to take a chance of one biting you; even accidentally. Saw many people feeding the one we called "Pedro". I would swear he's tame. Gently stood up to take food from the people's hands and then would walk away & eat. The room is great. Oh, there is one more thing I would love to see them change and even more so than keeping the bar open later. PLEASE get stronger shower heads. It took me forever to wash the soap out of my hair. That's all. :)

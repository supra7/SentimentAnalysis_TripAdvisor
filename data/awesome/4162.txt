We stayed at Secrets Maroma from May 29th-June 5th for our honeymoon. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The staff goes above and beyond to give you an amazing vacation. Our room was great, the pictures online don't do them justice. The property itself is gorgeous, and very well maintained. And the beach is simply breathtaking. As for the food, it was delicious! There is a wide range of restaurants to please everyone. We ate at all the restaurants besides Bourdeaux, the French restaurant. We didn't have a bad meal the entire trip. I could go on,and on about how much we loved Secrets Maroma! But I won't. Bottom line I couldn't say anything negative about our experience. And I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to escape to paradise!

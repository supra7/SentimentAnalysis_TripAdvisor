Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and respectful. Definitely felt at home here. Enjoyed the beautiful beach, pools, night time entertainment. Definitely felt like I was in paradise! It was very warm and humid, but the ocean breeze was lovely. The wedding that I went to on the beach was awesome! The photographer did a great job. The bars were plentiful and the drinks delicious! I liked the food at the breakfast buffet, but not too impressed with the other buffets. The Italian restaurant was delicious. Did not have a chance to go to the French or Japanese restaurants. Did enjoy the Oceana for lunch. Overall it was a great place!

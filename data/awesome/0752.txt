A 2-night stay in early August 2007 was splendid. Only steps away from Pike Place Market, the Inn at the Market is a very fine boutique hotel at a fair price! The roof deck was a great place to have breakfast bought at the Market and to enjoy a cocktail as the sun set. The room was large and tastefully decorated and the bath was roomy and well equipped. The staff was helpful and offered suggestions for a late dinner when we checked in after 9:30 p.m. We are two NJ teachers who would rather spend money on what we see and eat than where we sleep, but do demand a clean and comfortable hotel. Though we spent a bit more than we normally would, we think it was worth it at the end of our 3-week trip to Alaska and the Pacific northwest. Within walking distance of many restaurants and tourist sites, we recommend this hotel for nicer-than-tourist class stay!

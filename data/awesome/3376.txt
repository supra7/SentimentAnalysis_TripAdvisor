I've stayed at this property at the end of a long week en route home when I have an early am flight on several occassions. The rooms are clean and comfortable and quiet. The restaurant (Spencers) makes a great Steak and the bartenders are long term employees. Shuttle service to airport runs every 30 minutes and their is starbucks coffee for sale downstairs if you are like me and dont like the hilton room brew. Apples are always at the front desk for a quick free bite. I like the place and its part of my routine when I have an early am flight.

I stayed at Hotel Monaco while on business. The property was located not to far from my office and close to the downtown shopping area , famous pike place market and restaurants. The staff was very kind and helpful. Room service was fast, the food was hot and good. Also, the restaurant in the hotel is amazing! The rooms are spacious, I had a monte carlo suite (way to big for 1 person) that had a king size bed, flat screen TV, as well as a sitting are with a couch, chair, desk and yet another flat screen! The plush jungle theme robe are an added plus! There was even turn down service in the evening complete with chocolate! Great place if you are visiting the Seattle area.

Convenient, if characterless, typical Hilton. We got it for $82/night via Hotwire. $25 just for a rollaway bed if you want one. $7 for two plain bagels. Free fruit in the fitness center. Denny's is nearby (and cheaper than the hotel restaurant!). You can walk to the airport (there's a shuttle too). Train and bus stations are right across the street. Pool was nice. Hottub wasn't - all foamy and the water wasn't clear. We told the front desk about it.

We chose secrets maroma for our honeymoon based upon the incredible reviews online, and from our travel agent. They did not disappoint! Some of the benefits over other all inclusives I've stayed at on MexicoouTou do not make dinner reservations for any of the restaurants, and we never had to wait to be seated. The food was exceptional- we really enjoyed the French and Japanese restaurants the best. Tasty food was butlered poolside, from sushi, tacos to ice cream. Room service was fast and really good ! Drinks- the severs were amazing and we never had to wait for a drink. At the pool they would have another waiting before you finished yours. Also top shelf liquor the pool was very relaxing- especially without kids being permitted. Beautiful beach and great swing bar. Evening shows were hit or miss rooms were very comfortable most of all , everywhere you go there are friendly employees looking to help you in any way they can. Our only setback was that we promised an early check in and were to be given a honeymoon special package. We didn't get either. We were sent to our room several hours later, and the next day saw a Banner on our door that said Honeymooners. We were told others had champagne and spa discounts, so that was disappointing. Overall it was a great experience and we may go back for our 1 yr anniversary.

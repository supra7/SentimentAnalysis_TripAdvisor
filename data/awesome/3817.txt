We cannot say enough great things about it here! We visited in mid October 2011. Our room was a junior swim out suite in buliding 17. I would highly recommend the room and the building. There are only 2 buildings on the beach, 17 being one of them. We used the pool for our room a ton. Our concierge was Sandra and she was wonderful. She takes very good care of you. The food was excellent and that's coming from a couple who consider ourselves food snobs. Bordeaux served us the best meal of our trip. Filet and lobster tail. Everything was perfect. Himatsu was a close second, however. The resort does a tremendous job of hiring highly qualifed servers and other staff. The room, the food and the exceptional service together make this all inclusive resort experience worth every penny!!

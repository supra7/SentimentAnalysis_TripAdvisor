The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, which was the icing on the cake of this northwest-modern themed hotel on the water (and I mean ON THE WATER). We saw otters and seals playing in the sea right outside our window each morning while the fire warmed us cozy-style inside. The drinks in the bar were not cheap (but what cocktails are?), but they were good. The restaurant has an awesome view and the breakfast of eggs benedict and brulee'd grapefruit was too die for. Within walking distance of the elevator that takes you to the market (although it was broken when we went and took the hike up the stairs--great view at the top). We took advantage of the hotel shuttle and saved moola on taxis. I would recommend this hotel to everyone, and so will my friends that went with me.

We had a great time at Secrets Maroma Beach Riviera Cancun! The grounds were beautiful. The staff was extremely nice and very attending to us. We originally booked a swim out junior suite, but was told it was not available for our first 2 nights. We were put in a regular suite until we could switch. The room was very large and had an outdoor tub and lounge area with a fantastic view of the resort. On the 3rd day we were moved to our swim out room which was a little smaller but we really like the swim out. It was just a neat idea! :) There were beds and lounge areas all over the resort. It was fun to find a new place to hang out each day. My favorite was the bed on the beach which you do have to pay, but it was very reasonable... 30 bucks for the day! Also, the restaurants had great food! We can't wait to go back!

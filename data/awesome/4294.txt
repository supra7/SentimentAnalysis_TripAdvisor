Have been to several AI's in the Cancun/Riviera Maya region, and Secrets Maroma is by far the best in every possible category. The rooms and resort as a whole are very beautiful. The service everywhere was very professional and attentive. Service at dinner in all the restaurants was a little slow, but you're on vacation so that shouldn't bother anyone. Don't order the house red wine, it's terrible! A big shout out to Freddie Blanco at the World Cafe who always made us feel very welcome (Eddie and Elisa from Boston say hello - we'll see you next year!). By far the most beautiful section, and the biggest seller of the resort ,is Maroma Beach! As beautiful as the beaches of Cancun are, they can't even begin to compare to Maroma, and Secrets has the best stretch of the beach. I won't explain the beauty - just look at the previous photos people have posted because they are true to form. Unlike Cancun where the water is too rough to swim (bad currents), in Maroma you can swim quite leisurley. You'll always seem to find friendly people to talk with and even hang out with on your vacation here, which makes it even more enjoyable. Another big shout out to Paul & Darcy (a.k.a Detroit!) it was so fun spending time with you guys again! Hello also to Doug and Glenda! If able, we'll certainly be back next year for the 3rd year in a row because Secrets really is that wonderful!

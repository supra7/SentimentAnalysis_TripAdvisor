I never take the time to write reviews, but I feel that this one is worth the time! I went there this year for my honeymoon and my husband and I were extremely pleased with everything at Secrets Maroma. The service was unbelieveable! Everyone is so polite! We chose to upgrade our room to a swimout which was definitely worth it. Not only did it give us the complimentary honeymoon package (massage, dinner on the beach, continental breakfast, champagne in room on arrival), but it allowed us to spend time alone and still have the luxury of being in the sun. Having room service included is nice on the days that you need a snack or the nights that you feel like staying in. My husband loves to eat so he appreciated being able to order 2 meals every night at dinner. The entertainment staff is awesome, but not pushy if you choose to simply sit at the pool and relax. I have to say my favorite part was the afternoon snacks that were brought around mid-day and were very tasty! It saved me from having to get out of the sun and go to lunch. My husband's favorite night (and mine too) was dinner on the beach which I definitely recommend. We had a gorgeous night and the food was delicious! All in all we would recommend and encourage anyone to go to Secrets Maroma (or any Secrets resort....we went to Secrets Capri a few years ago and loved it there too) and we hope to go back!

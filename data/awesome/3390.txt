I was recently stuck in Seattle during their recent snow/ice storm. I had been schedualed to stay there. However one night turned in to three. Alaska Air, booked and cancelled 7 flights for me.The last night I was suppossed to leave at 5:45 which was delayed until 8:20. then cancelled. Without a reservation. I went back to the Radisssion to see what I could do. Of course they as well as all the other surrounding hotels we sold out. The very clever girl at the fron dest found me a "out of service" room. The TV didn't work..They were most help from a late check out to finding a room. I can't say enought good things about the staff and management. This was a very stressful time for everyone. But they remained professsion and business during the storm. Five thumbs up!!!!!

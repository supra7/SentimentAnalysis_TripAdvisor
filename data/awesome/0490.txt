We stayed here over July 4 weekend and had an excellent time. Wonderful view of the water in even a partial-view room (the full ocean view rooms were booked). The observation deck is well worth the price of staying here and the location by the market is incomparable. Great room service options too. The rooms were quite nice and surprisingly quiet. The beds were supremely comfortable. My only complaint is the awful unsupportive pillows, be they foam or down, that I seem to find in so many upscale places including this one. I just want something that doesnt squish completely flat when I lie on my side. Other than that, I would definitely stay again. We were a little busy during our trip so didnt get to spend as much time at this place as we would have liked given the amenities and price. Taking the train from the airport is a great tip I picked up here. Walking a few blocks from the station to the hotel with my little rolly bag was easy. It would have been awful trying to drive around the market area.

We stayed in a Deluxe Queen Queen room on the 12th floor. We had a great view of the city, could also see mountains, beds were extremely comfortable, nice sitting area in room, excellent service, very friendly staff, great location. Easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum, REI for new hiking boots. We got a kick out of the seagull that came to our window - fed him bits of apple! Last year we stayed at the Inn at Market. Was twice the price (great view but smaller room) and I preferred the Mayflower! Will definitely stay at the Mayflower next trip to Seattle!

I took my mother away for herbirthday and wanted find a resort that offered to-notch service. I combed the internet and travel guides to identify the right hotel. Secrets Maroma Beach exceeded all my expectations. I'm a fussy, demanding New Yorker and Secrets left NOTHING to be desired. The room was stunning ... a dream retreat! The hotel staff was lovely and gracious. They attended to everything you need with a smile. Our personal concierge Fabiola decorated our room on my moms birthday and left us a cake. The attention to detail was amazing. Secretes is as good if not better then any Four Seasons or other luxury brand name resorts. Maroma Beach is paradise. The service on the beach was fantastic. Drinks were delivered in no time and the server kept coming back to see if you needed anything else. The food was delicious and you never felt like you were in a cheezy all-inclusive. We were so sad to leave such a special place.

The Hotel Andra is a terrific hotel in an excellent location, within walking distance to all downtown highlights as well as Seattle Centre. The Front Desk staff are beyond compare. Every time you depart or return to the hotel, there is a personal greeting/welcome. We did have a slight problem with our reservation, but this was resolved beyond our expectations immediately and graciously. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for any type of visit to Seattle.

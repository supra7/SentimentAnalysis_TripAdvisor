Our vacation was perfect! I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience at Secrets Maroma Beach. The service was impecable. Each and every individual who works there is polite, professional, and dedicated to providing outstanding service. The food was terrific for an all inclusive resort, with so many options it's almost overwhelming. I was in awe of the variety of options in the World Cafe especially and by the daily chef specials at the pool and on the beach. The beach is worthy of its stellar reviews. The water was crystal clear and the sand so soft. The grounds are gorgeous and the spa spectacular. The tips about bug spray proved very helpful as did those recommending reservations for the hibachi restaurant and to avoid the time share pitches. We were engaged on the this trip and we simply don't know how we'll top Secrets when searching for a honeymoon destination...we may just have to come back!

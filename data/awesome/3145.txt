We arrived in Seattle on a whim after staying at the Apendblume bed and breakfast in Leavenworth, Washington. We parked at the waterfront and worked the phone for about an hour on a Tuesday night to see what we could get. Well, the Roosevelt had a room and was the most accommodating! Loved the living room on the 15th floor and the view of the Space Needle out one set of windows and Pike Place Market out the other set. Macy's, Tiffany's Jewellers, Nordstrums and the monorail are all right there. And across the street are some culinary experience not to be missed. Service was great, room was clean, and the staff was very helpful. We found that getting back onto the I5 highway was a breeze on our way back to Vancouver. The hotel lobby area is beautiful, the Valet parking is so convenient (after trying to find a parking spot in Seattle on a busy tourist night), and everything went so smoothly we are likely to stay there again. It's a historic hotel from 1929 and I'm sure Roosevelt would expect nothing less than the great service we received when we were there (if he were still alive of course). Try the Roosevelt. It's fun. It's reasonably-priced and its in the heart of Seattle's shopping district.

We stayed at the Embassy suites with our field lacrosse team for a tournament at the Starfire sports complex. The location was excellent, a few blocks to the fields, shopping, restaurants and a Costco. The accomidations were great, perfect for families. Clean, spacious and well equiped.Despite the open atrium design the bedrooms were quiet. The hotel was fully booked with lacrosse teams and management was on top of keeping all the kids in line and ensuring a comfortable stay for all their guests. What impressed us all was what was included in our room rate. ( Team members recieved a tournament rate of $109 per night). This included a full "cooked to order" breakfast - omlettes, scrambled eggs,pancakes, french toast, bacon, sausage, muffins, cereal, oatmeal etc. and a nightly "managers reception" with complementary beverages - alcoholic and non, for TWO HOURS ! Afterwards we were welcome to remain in the atrium and mingle with the other guests and teams which was great, sure beat cramming into each others rooms to visit, as often happens at tournaments. The open concept allowed parents to monitor their children, while still able to socialize themselves. It was great ! We are hoping to return next year and will definately look for more Embassy suites when traveling anywhere else in the future.

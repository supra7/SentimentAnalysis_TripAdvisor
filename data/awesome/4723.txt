Secrets Maroma Beach was the best vacation my husband and I have had in a long time. They resort was beautiful, and the service was amazing! When we arrived, it was an hour before official check-in time, but we ended up waiting about an hour and a half. At that point, someone came to us and said since we were having to wait so long, they were upgrading us to an ocean view!! We had no expectations of this since we didn't really think we were having to wait that long! The room was fantastic. The little touches, like champagne and roses delivered to our room on the first night, made it feel that much more special. Nowhere have I had better service. There were times that I was brought something before I even asked for it; they could just anticipate my needs! The entertainment staff did a great job, and we very much enjoyed the shows in the evening. Before the trip was over, my husband and I were trying to figure out how we could make this an annual trip!

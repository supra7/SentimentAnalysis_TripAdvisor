Superb experience that will be very hard to beat. Rooms are clean and well appointed, the tv that swivels to face either the bed or the tub is a nice touch, as is the daily stocked minibar. Great menu selection for room service and the hatch by the door so there's no need for the staff to disturb you when delivering food/drinks is a great idea. The resort felt quiet even though I'm sure it was pretty full. Most evenings we'd take in a movie in the outdoor theatre with a cold drink and popcorn before heading off to dinner. Never waited anymore than about 15 minutes for a table which just gave us an excuse to go and have another drink in the bar whilst we waited. We found all staff friendly and helpful and the standard of the food never fell below very good. The beach was perfect as was the sea. The pools are lovely and we never had a problem getting a decent spot though if you want beds in fron tof the pool that faces the sea you have to get doen there very early doors. The waiter/waitress service is superb, pretty much as soonas you've finished your drink there's someone there to offer you another. If you're lucky enough to have Balbina as your waitress then you'll never want for anything, she's a star. Wish we could have stayed longer and will certainly be back

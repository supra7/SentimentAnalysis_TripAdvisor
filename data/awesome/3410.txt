Everything in both room and public areas was clean and maintained. Everyone from check-in clerk to security guards was extra friendly. My only disappointment was having to pay for breakfast. Note that the hotel is directly across the street. Unless it is pouring rain, probably best to skip the shuttle and just walk over. Exit terminal, turn right, follow sidewalk for a few minutes and you are there.

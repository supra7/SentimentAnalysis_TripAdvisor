As a qualifier, my wife and I have been to over 20 all inclusives in the Caribbean, 7 of which were in the Mayan and now 4 of which were Secrets. Been to Capri, Silversands, Wild Orchid and now the best of the bunch and the best all inclusive we've been to.......Secrets Maroma!! We're there a few Mosquitos...yup. Was the road coming in bumpy....yup (hardly!). Was there a small leak in our shower....yup! Does this matter when in a paradise like Maroma...nope, This place was awesome...premium alcohol, freezing cold cans of beer, food was incredible, put on 6 pounds, 'cause there's so much great food going around constantly. The Italian restaurant was our favorite. Service and the quality of food around the pool was second to none. We have only stayed at Preferred Club at all the places we've stayed, but would definitely not do it again here. There's no views from the swim outs, even Ocean Front (bldgs z17 and 27) is blocked. Also, the Preferred Club Lounge is not conveniently located at all. Although Wild Orchid Preferred Club is a must and well located. Service at this place is absolutely awesome. It's beyond me, who could ever complain about this incredible resort? (Probably the same people who can't understand why there towel and stuff is removed from their pool chairs after being unoccupied from 7-10 a.m.) We're not beach people, but this beach was like flour, a little bit of seaweed but.....it's the ocean.

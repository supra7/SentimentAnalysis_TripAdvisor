We loved this hotel and especially the location. It was SO easy to take the Link Light Rail from the airport to the Westlake Center, and then walk around the corner to the hotel. For a price of $2.75 each, we had a comfortable 35 minute ride and a chance to see some of the surrounding parts of the Seattle area. At the hotel, we were greeted warmly and shortly after making our way to our room, the front desk called up to make sure everything was okay. What a special touch! Our room was excellent - lots of space, great shower, very comfortable bed, and we heard absolutely no noise from the hallway, from above, or from the street below (we were on the 10th floor, overlooking Macy's). There was lots of shopping nearby. And in case you forgot something at home, just one street over is a Bartell Drugs, with a really good selection of essentials (including snack food). The famous Pike Place Market is just a few blocks down. And there are lots of eateries and coffee shops everywhere you turn. You really can't beat the excellent location, friendly service, and beautiful accommodation of the Mayflower Park Hotel.

We stayed at this hotel at the beginning of our trip and at the end of our trip. And it was a delight. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and from the time we arrived to the time we left we were greeted by and treated by the staff with great enthusiam. I felt that they could not do enough and went out of their way to make us feel at home away from the home. Very helpful and informative. They even sent us a nice red wine with a fruit and cheese tray with a lovely card congratulating us on our anniversary. Very special indeed. We will we will be back!

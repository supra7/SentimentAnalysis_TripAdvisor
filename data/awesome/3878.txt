My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and it was more than we could have ever dreamed of! The staff is so friendly and courteous and can't seem to do enough to make sure you are happy and enjoying yourself at all times. You really can't get much better than this property. The beach is incredible, crystal clear blue water and super soft sand! The pools were also beautifully maintained and VERY popular. We got out of our room early in the morning to make sure we secured a nice spot every morning. We met some awesome people and had an overally spectacular time. The food was awesome and we were suprised because people warned us that the food in mexico was not that great. We were seriously blown away by everything! Planning our next trip to the exact same spot next year! Wooooooooo hooooooooo :) you would be INSANE not to want to vacation here!

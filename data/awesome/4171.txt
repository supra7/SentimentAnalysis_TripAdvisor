We were very specific on the things we wanted in a resort for our honeymoon: 1. Adults Only 2. All Inclusive 3. Great food with no reservations Secrets Maroma Beach met all of our criteria and we were very happy with the resort. We actually chose it because it was listed as one of the top resorts on Trip Advisor. What we liked: -Our room was actually in the main building and close to the restaurants and had a great ocean view. We felt like we were the only ones in the building because we never saw anyone come in/out of the elevator. It felt exclusive. -The room was awesome- great size, up to date decor, large balcony, 2 tubs. It was portrayed in pictures on the site very accurately. -The staff was very nice and helpful. They were friendly. -The food was the best we have had at an all-inclusive. (This was our 3rd one.) They had great options and the room service was sooo amazing. You have to try the chilequiles. the best thing on the menu. -The spa was really nice and relaxing. -The pool was amazing, had a great view and always felt very spacious even though it was busy quite frequently. Most spots had umbrellas which was awesome and the chairs were sooo comfy. -The beach was incredible. The water and the sand were just so serene. They have servers, umbrellas and the chairs are just as comfy. Plus there was a beach bar that had swings. -The landscaping was beautiful and the layout of the resort was great. -Best balcony EVER! It had a lounging sun bed, huge soaking tub, chairs and table and the most gorgeous view. Could have been better... -The AC could have been better. We had it all the way down to 65 and it felt a little muggy. -The bed could have been a little softer -They forgot turndown service twice which was a little disappointing but wasn't that big of a deal. -The spa was expensive. They are way overpriced. Overall it was was an awesome place!

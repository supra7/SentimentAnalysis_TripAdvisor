We ended up at this hotel because our original room at another hotel was double booked. The staff was nice and the rooms were clean. The only thing I didn't enjoy here was the sleep number beds. We woke up to a nice view of Mt. Ranier and had a very tasty breakfast in the lobby. I did not notice any airplane noise at all.

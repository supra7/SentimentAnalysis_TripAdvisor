This is by far one of the most accomodating places I have ever stayed. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. It has everything from refridgerators, microwaves, safes and ironing boards in the rooms. Breakfast was great and so much more than your basic cereal etc.. like make your own waffles! The 1:00 extended checkout was great, too. Highly recommend!

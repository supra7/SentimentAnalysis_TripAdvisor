These guys get it right. My wife and I usually go to the Carribbean twice a year. Of all the resorts that we have gone to this is #1. If you want luxery, service and quality in every area this is your spot. I made a mistake this year and went to Barbados. Its a beautiful country but read my review below then make your reservations for Secrets Maroma. Almond Beach Village Barbados Skip It If you are expeciting even a 3 star resort you may as well stay at home. This was awful. Now I'm not a real pickey man but I have compared these room to a Motel 6. The food was average at best. For entertainment one night they had a fashion show that was nothing more that some of the employs putting on some fresh clothes and parading around. The adult pool was nice when you chased the kids off. The resort was beautiful but the rest of it kind of sucked. I have traveled to resorts all over the Carribbean and wanted try something different. Well I just figured something out. Mexico has it right. I said the same thing after a trip to Panama. If the resort owner want to do it right, go to somewhere like Secrets at Maroma Beach and see how they do it. I see more Mexico in my future.

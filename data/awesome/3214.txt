We stayed here on a lay over home from Cancun. It was great to have a comfortable bed and room on our final night of holidays. The kids loved the pool which was warmer than the ones at the resort in Cancun which we could not believe as we were in Seattle! The staff was friendly and we appreciated the cookies after a long flight when we were waiting to check inn. Just a nice touch! Shuttle was convenient and would definitely stay here again.

This was the first time I stayed at the Westin - Seattle. I stayed here several nights on business. The service was great and the room was great. Since I was on government travel, I thought I'd get the usual run of the mill room facing a parking garage. Instead, I got a room with a view of Puget Sound ! The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was very quiet. I love to walk and the hotel's location was unbeatable; all the major tourist sites seemed very close. I could walk to Pike's Place and the waterfront easily. You can access the monorail just across the street, which takes you quickly to the Seattle Center and the Space Needle. I'd recommend this hotel in a heart beat.

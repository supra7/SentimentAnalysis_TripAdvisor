I highly recommend this hotel. Very polite and helpful employees willing to assist every need. Concierge very knowledgeable. I felt comfortable from the day arrived till I departed 6 days later. Room and lobby very clean. Never waited for an elevator. Will search for a Westin to stay in on my next trip.

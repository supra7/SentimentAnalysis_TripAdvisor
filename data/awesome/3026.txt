Used to stay here when it was the Vance. After a couple unpleasant experiences, I have stayed elsewhere for a few years. I am thrilled that I "discovered" the Hotel Max. Decor is astounding, staff very helpful and delicious food in the restaurant. Rooms, though a bit small, are more than adequate because of well proportioned furniture, spectacular bedding and great attention to detail - the bed lamps provide perfect light for reading. Free room coffee is easy to prepare and plentiful.

We just got back from our trip and it was such a wonderful & relaxing experience. I can't say enough about the wonderful staff which went out of their way to provide us with every possible ammenity/luxury. Our room was very clean, and spacious. The bed was comfortable which is a huge plus for me because I typically don't sleep well in hotel beds. The view from the balcony was breath taking. The food at the restaurants was amazing. Some of the best since we were in Europe last summer. The pool area was spacious & the staff did a great job taking care of our every need whether it be food, beverage, clearing away empty plates/glasses, & even moving the umbrella stand so that we could enjoy the sun more. The beach was gorgeous and very well taken care of. When you think of white sand & blue water, this is exactly that! We have nothing but good things to say about our stay there & we will definitely be going back in the future!

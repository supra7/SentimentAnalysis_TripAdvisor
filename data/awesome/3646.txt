This is a real refreshing hotel to stay in. I felt very much at home and GM, Alan was very accomodating. Beds are extremly comfortable and have pillow top mattresses. Air is ice cold. Had great nights sleep. Pool is clean and staff is always keeping the hotel up. Cleaning, painting shampooing carpets etc. Most hotels in Kissimmee are run down and staff don't really care about guests. This hotel is different with attentive, friendly, staff and is an incredible value! Restaurants are walkable; Houlihan's Mc Donalds and Bruno's Italian is great! Besides a fair price, they offer plasma tvs, free internet and free breakfast; hard boiled eggs, waffles, pancakes, bagels & cream cheese, cereal, oatmeal & grits. Stay here...you won't regret it.

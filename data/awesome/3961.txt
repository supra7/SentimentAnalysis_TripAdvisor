My husband and I went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon. It was both our first time in Mexico and to an AI. We loved it! It was very relaxing and the workers really cater to you! Not once did we pass an employee who did not say greet us. Definitely tip, they deserve it! We stayed in an ocean view room, the building closest to the main lobby. Although, it wasn't very close, it was still beautiful! Going on a budget, it was not bad at all. We also did a romantic dinner on the beach, definitely would recommend if you're on a honeymoon. It's quiet, very romantic, and calming. They have the dinners right on the beach...go around 7:00 p.m. to watch the sunrise (in September at at least). The food is good, breakfast I found the best at the WorldCafe. The Barefoot Grille (for lunch) gets old after two days...same things. The buffets at night, are okay, nothing special. They have fresh squeezed orange juice and the water is filtered everywhere! I did not hear of one person getting sick off the food or water. Drinks are nice and they keep them coming...if you didn't have a drink in your hand or near you, an employee was asking if you'd like one. Overall, we had a great time. I think it says something that on our first day I was looking to plan our trip for next year!!!

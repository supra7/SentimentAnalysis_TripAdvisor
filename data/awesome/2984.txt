I am a regular visitor to the hotel Max. I stay here about twice a year in this boutique New York style hotel. The hotels location is perfect and is well equipped with a gym, business center and sushi resturant. If you are looking for an outstaning experience (staff, location and rooms) then book yourself into the MAX. There are plenty of Paul Allen resturants in the area, malls, Pike Place Market and SAM are 10 min walk, Jazz Alley is a great venue for a night out and these are all in walking distance. I also suggest a jog down to Alaskan Way and over to Olympic Sculpture Park. ENJOY!!!

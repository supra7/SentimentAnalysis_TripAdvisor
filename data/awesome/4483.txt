This was my third trip to SMB. I won't get into a lot of detail, just update those of you who have been before, but not recently. This place is still my favorite one in this area and I have been to the Iberostar Grand, and several others. The main reason this hotel is the best in my opinion is the beach and the food are head and shoulders over the other resorts. The food really is wonderful for an AI in Mexico, with plenty of options. I really enjoyed the Chilean Sea Bass at the Italian restaurant (Portifino). Menu's have changed slightly. My husband had his heart set on the suckling pig in the Mexican restaurant, only to find out it was no longer offered. I did find out that many of the wedding receptions were served this entree. We did room service and for what it is was we were very pleased. The Beach is still fabulous. It was a little bit chilly because the wind had picked up and brought in some cooler water, but still enjoyable. They have swings down at the beach bar now and a wooden walk way that runs part way along the beach. As always, we met great people from near and far away. We met some new employee's at the hotel who were spectacular! The only thing I would recommend that the hotel do is to not get involved in any time share offerings. The hotel is fine the way it is, don't go and wreck it with time share. The other suggestion is to lower the prices in the spa. I think more people would go if they were more affordable. Other than that, everything was spectacular. Thank you SMB!

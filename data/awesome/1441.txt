Great stay for two nights. Upgraded to executive floor because of Hilton Honors. Room /bathroom as others state is small -but met all my needs. It was updated and absolutely comfortable. Perfect. Breakfast for Hilton gold is free- it was really nice - fruit fresh, smoked salmon cheeses cereal omlets etc. I ate dinner in lobby lounge and has a great salmon / shrimp salad on very fresh lettuce. Delicious. Worth $18.00 to relax with salad and wine. The hotel is very close to shopping and Pike market. Close to my meetings which was near Seattle Art museum.

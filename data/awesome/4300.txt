My wife and I just returned from our 4th trip to Secrets Maroma. Our stay was a total of 5 nights on this trip and as always we had a super time. There have been a few upgrades since our previous visit in August of 2010. A few of the menus have been tweeked and in general we thought the food was just outstanding. Service continues to be top notch in almost every area. While we were there the resort was at or near 100% occupancy and in spite of this, never seemed crowded. We tend to eat a bit earlier in the evening than some, around 7:30pm and never once waited to be seated. The beach continues to be one of the most beautiful we have visited and we have been to most of the best beaches around the Caribbean over the past 30 years. I realize this review probably sounds as if it was written by one of the employees but try as we might, we just can't find a thing to complain about Maroma. We've been to Silversands and have been to Secrets Capri on several occassions and while those are very nice, they just don't carry quite the quality of Maroma in our opinion.

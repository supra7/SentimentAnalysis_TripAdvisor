My husband and I stayed at Hotel Max for a weekend get-a-way to Seattle and to be honest I was a little skeptical about this place because there were so many mixed reviews about it. The week we were leaving San Francisco I called to set up for car service to pick us up at the airport since we were arriving pretty late at night. The person who I spoke with was very sweet and very accomodating, I wish I could remember her name but that's beside the point since everyone we encountered at the hotel were all very accomodating. I definitely will stay at this hotel again. Just be prepared that this is a boutique hotel and the rooms aren't spacious like other name brand hotels but it's clean, the staff are all friendly, very affordable and most of all it's in the BEST location.

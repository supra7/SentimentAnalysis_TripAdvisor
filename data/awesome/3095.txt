I was attending a conference in Seattle and needed a hotel that was smoker-friendly. I chose the Hotel Max for its location just one block from my conference hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel, its decor, and its service. It is very artsy...not for the person looking for a traditional hotel. You will notice this as soon as you walk into the lobby. Security is excellent, requiring a room key to use the elevator. Each floor has a theme, with full size black and white photos on every room door, to highlight the theme of the floor. And there is original art in each room. My first room was very small, but innovatively designed. I would have kept it, but felt like I needed a little more space for a 5-night stay. The front desk accomodated my request for a larger room immediately. My new room was great! The windows opened. The bed was extremely comfortable, a newpaper was delivered to my door every morning, and I had lots of fun checking out the room amenities (I won't say more...you will have to stay there to discover more about what I am talking about). The restaurant was one of the best sushi restaurants in Seattle. And they have room service. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and eager to help. A gourmet grocery store right around the corner was a great source for snacks, wine, or other things to stash in the in-room refigerator. Above all, the room rates were very reasonable. I would not hesitate to stay there again.

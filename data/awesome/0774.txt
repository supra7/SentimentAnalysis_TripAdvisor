The Inn at the Market lived up to the positive reviews. As tourists without a car, the location couldn't have been better. There are countless excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. Although it was very rainy, we were able to explore the area and race back to the hotel to warm up when we got too wet or cold (we're from SoCal and have little tolerance for weather). The staff was always friendly, and the view from the deck was glorious even on a dark day. The room was spacious, and the beds extremely comfortable. The hotel made our stay in Seattle great fun even with uncooperative weather.

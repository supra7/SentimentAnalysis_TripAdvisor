This was my second in a few weeks using this hotel. I must say, the service is greatly improved. From the bellman "Tom" who took care of my needs, to Cecelia, who checked up on me, to the new manager( wow, he is a tall man) who dropped everything to take by bags to my room when I checked in. The manager was even pouring coffee, asking about our stay the next morning during breakfast. This hotel is going through a transition as the hotel is upgrading the hotel by installing a new elevator, as well I saw the new king beds that the hotel was installing at their hotel.I was on the 3rd floor. My room had a pillow-top mattress, and it was so comfortable - nice improvement! The manager mentioned me that the hotel is dedicated to " new level of service". I look forward to his new improvements. Thank you to Tom, Cecelia, and to the new manager, you made my stay pleasant. I will be back.Keep up the good work.

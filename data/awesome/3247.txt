I stayed here for one night in May, 2005 -- my flight arrived at midnight and I was renting a car the following morning to drive north and just wanted a comfortable bed near the airport. I reserved and purchased the room on Priceline (3 stars, $45). The aiport shuttle circulates frequently and drives you the very short distance to the hotel (practically across the street from the airport). The lobby had a "classy" feel -- just what you would expect from an upscale property. I was assigned a room in one of the wings (not in the tower which is touted as being better elsewhere on this page). It was 1:00 a.m. when I reached my room and I could not make the key card work in my door. I went down the hall to a house phone and phoned the hotel operator who sent someone to assist me immediately. He got the door open on the first try with no problem and three minutes later, my phone rang and it was the hotel operator "Just checking to make sure you were able to get in, dear". The room was clean. The bed was very, very comfortable. The curtains really darkened the room. A lobby cafe has inexpensive breakfasts (fruit, yogurt, and granola "parfait" for $3). I didn't explore the swimming pool or health club. All in all, a perfect place to stay if you are arriving at SEA-TAC airport late at night or are leaving on an early flight. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

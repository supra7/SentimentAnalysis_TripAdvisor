I travel frequently for business and leisure. I have stayed at the Seattle Monaco several times but hadn't been there for a few years before my stay in October, 2010. It has been updated and the rooms are more comfortable than ever. The staff were attentive and friendly. I find the location convenient to everything from the Pike Place Market to the Qwest and to Safeco ball parks. And this final note: I left an expensive piece of photo equipment in a closet there. After a phone call, the equipment was located, properly packed and shipped to me. I offered to pay and tip, but the hotel did all this at no expense to me. Simply excellent.

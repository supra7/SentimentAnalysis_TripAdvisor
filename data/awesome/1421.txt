We stayed here with a group of friends on the night before our cruise to Alaska. This hotel had a very reasonable rate ($129 per night!) and a great location. The rooms were very nice, clean and updated. I don't have a SINGLE complaint about this hotel! We were given the choice of free breakfast or free parking. FYI cab fare from the airport was $50 including tip (luckily we split it between 4 people) and the fare to the Norwegian Cruise terminal was $13.

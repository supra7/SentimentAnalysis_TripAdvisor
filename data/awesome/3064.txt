I loved this hotel. The rooms were small, but being a New Yorker that didn't bother me at all. I couldn't stop talking about the plush towels and cozy bathrobe. The bed was so comfortable, I slept like the living dead (and i didn't even take advantage of the pillow menu). They also have a radio, which I always appreciate and don't understand why all hotels don't. I would definitely stay here again.

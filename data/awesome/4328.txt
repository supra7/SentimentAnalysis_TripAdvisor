Secrets Maroma is a fantastic resort. The grounds are beautiful, the employees were great and the food was wonderful. The only complaint I have is the same as others who have stayed: it is difficult to find a chair at the pool. There is a 30-minute time limit if you are not at your chair and they were enforcing that time limit while we were there, which was good. We did notice that couples would leave their towels, books, etc. and not come back for hours, which I think is rude. Our favorite employees were Fabiola, who was our concierge, and Antonio, a waiter at the Seaside Grill!

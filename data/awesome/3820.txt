On arrival we were greeted with 'welcome home' by the reception staff who then offered us a glass of sparkling wine and a brief overview of the hotel. We were also given a free upgrade to a spectacular junior suite with an in room jacuzzi, a small 'swim-out' pool area (only available to a very small number of guests who were staying in this particular section of the hotel, most of the time we had it to ourselves) and a dedicated 24-7 conceirge service. Don't be put off by the size of the hotel, yes its a large complex, but this isn't noticeable once you are there. It is certainly different from the all-inclusive hotels I have experienced - it's fine dining at its best. You will be astounded by the choice and selection and quality of food - it's on a level with any high end restaurant in the UK or USA. The restaurants include; Japanese, French, Mediterranean and Mexican. The breakfast buffet (in the World restaurant) offers everything you could imagine (and more), fully complete with a 'made to order' egg station and a vast selection of hot and cold food. You can even have vodka or sparkling wine to accompany your choice! The lunch and dinner buffet is equally as spectacular with gourmet food such as crab claws and scallop carpaccio. Holiday highlights: Free room upgrade to the junior suite complete with 'swim out' pool Watching the coatis (similar to racoons) pass by our room each morning On the last night of our stay we returned to the room after dinner to find a freshly run hot bubble bath (complete with rose petals) - first class house keeping!! Private dining in the Japanese restaurant with a chef cooking our food to order a couple of feet from our table The service The decor The outdoor jacuzzi in the grounds The indoor jacuzzi in our room It was simply a heavenly holiday, perfect in every way - idyllic surroundings, outstanding service, astonising food - pure paradise. Be warned - you will ache to go back!!!

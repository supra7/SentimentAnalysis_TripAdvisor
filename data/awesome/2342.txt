Stayed for the Memorial day weekend at the Sorrento. The hotel is beautiful on both the outside and the inside. I was courteously greeted by all the staff and the concierge staff bent over backwards to help me with any request. The complementary town car took us to the market and shopping at Nordstrom's. This service was indespensible as the hotel is a long walk from the main downtown. I was worried about noise since it is in the hospital district but I had no problems. I stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was wonderful. All the furniture was comfortable and the assortment of pillows on the bed was awesome. Complementary internet was very much appreciated and I felt the room was a true sanctuary. The bathroom shows that the hotel is an older building as it is small, but this small problem was overshadowed by the wonderful comfort and attention in the rooms and provided by the staff. I ate at the restaurant and it was a great meal! I would definately want to stay at the Sorrento again!

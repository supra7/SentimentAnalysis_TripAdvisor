Vintage Park is located in downtown just down the street from the interesting Koolhaas-designed public library. It is very quaint and quiet comfortable, very different from your ubiquitous huge conference-centered hotels. It is part of the Kimpton chain, and of the two that we stayed in (the other being the Pacific Palisades in Vancouver) this is definitely the better one. We had a room with two queen beds. The linens, comforter and pillows made us want to stay in bed forever. The bathroom was a little small but clean, and well-appointed with Aveda bath products. The staff was helpful and courteous. Pros: just a very short although sometimes hilly walk (we are in our late 20s-early 30s) to Pioneer Square, Pike's Market, the Waterfront, the Westlake mall, and many other downtown areas. There is a coffee shop in.every.corner. Cons: expensive daily parking around $30

Like the city of Seattle, where it resides, The Sorrento Hotel is a magical place that provides all the comfort, amenities and service a well traveled patron would expect, while still maintaining it's uniquely classic elegance and special charm, forged over a century ago. The beds are exceptionally comfortable, the location is central to many of my favorite Seattle spots, The Hunt Club serves amazing food and libations, the Fireside Room is the perfect place for a relaxing fireside chat and if you're lucky enough to be in town for "Night School," you will not be disappointed!

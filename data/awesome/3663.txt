I went to Secrets Maroma last March with my husband, and to this day, whenever we travel elsewhere, always compare it to their. It was an absolutely wonderful vacation, with beautiful rooms, gorgeous beaches, and decent food. The ambiance was world class, with a touch of European nuances which was spectacular. The staff was super friendly, and of course we tipped extra and they were so appreciative. The restaurants are all pretty decent for an all inclusive, my only knock would be bad wine selection. But overall, it was romantic, beautiful, and we will definitley be back!

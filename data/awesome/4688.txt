This trip was for our honeymoon and I can tell you that I've been a lot of places in the world so far in my life, and this was by far the most peaceful, restful, but fun vacation I've ever been on. We met couples from all over the country and had a blast getting to know them, so much so, we have already visited one of them and will see another in November. The staff is so helpful there and the service is so good it's amazing. I'm going back and not just once too! This place is incredible and anyone who has the opportunity to go there will have the most relaxing time of their lives!

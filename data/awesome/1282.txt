This was my 2nd stay at the Moore. Be sure to ask for a room on the water side on one of the upper floors, this was the advice I found on tripadvisor.com last year, and the advice I followed. Great view and could just see part of the Public Market neon sign. Everything downtown in easy walking distance, or the free bus zone. The nicest desk clerks who speak well of management and are more than willing to pass on their considerable knowledge about taxis, restaurants, shopping. I was even offered an umbrella for predicted rain. Sizable room and closet, hot water, quiet, clean. This year's surprise, the hand towel/washcloth folded swan has been joined by a bathmat/washcloth elephant. This could be an old European hotel. I couldn't be more pleased with the value for the price, the location, and the personable staff. Some elevator issues during my stay, but hey, may I have half this character and style when I'm 101!

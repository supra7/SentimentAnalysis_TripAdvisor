The staff was very gracious and helpful, from getting my suit pressed and returned to me within a couple of hours (a complimentary service), to reserving cabs for me, to making recommendations around the neighborhood. The service at the adjoining restaurant, Lola, was also fantastic. The room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is located very close to a lot of great shopping, restaurants, and tourist attractions. My only complaint was that my room faced the street, and the street lights in downtown Seattle beep when they turn green to tell pedestrians that it is safe to walk--at night, this beeping, while faint, was still audible, and that was kind of annoying since I'm a very light sleeper. Maybe ask for a room that doesn't face the street when you make a reservation, or one that is on a higher floor (I was on the 3rd floor).

\The service is exceptional. After staying at a half a dozen all inclusives this one outranks the rest by alot. The beach is the best-no rocks, no shells to bother the feet and no dropoffs out in the water. Just soft white sand everywhere. The water is very clear up by the beach and a beautiful blue/green farther out. What we found as a nice surprise was how quite it is around the pool. No loud music or crazy games. It's a great place to lay out and read. Every employee is friendly and always greets you with a hello as you pass them. The night entertainment is simple but I liked that they don't entertain by dragging people up on stage to embarrass them.The only weird thing was how the room was laid out. There is very little bathroom privacy since the bathroom is open to the bedroom. Bring a bedsheet to cover the opening. The group(about 70) of people we go with have never gone to the same resort twice but everyone agreed that we are going back here.

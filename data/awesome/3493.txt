Convenient location: From the airport, take the 747 express bus for $8.00 (bus only takes cash or purchase a ticket from the vending machine at the airport); bus stop is at Drummond which is a stone's throw from the hotel. Plus, the $8.00 fare allows you to ride the local transit for 24 hrs at no extra cost. The hotel is close to the main shopping district, within walking distance, and close proximity to the tour buses to Quebec City etc. Service: excellent service, very friendly staff, bilingual, eager to help, appreciated my feeble attemps at French. Room was properly cleaned. If I were to nitpick, small things would have made the facilities perfect (shower cap, extra bars of soap would have been welcome). I recommend this hotel highly. Best I have stayed in to date.

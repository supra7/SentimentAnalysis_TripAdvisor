My hubby and I spent 6 wonderful nights at Secrets Maroma Beach. Last year, we stayed at Secrets Capri and fell in love with that resort, so we knew we could do no wrong booking our trip here. Everything was wonderful, except........the view from our room. We booked an "ocean view" , but clearly it wasn't. It would not even be considered a "partial ocean view" at other resorts. All we could see were the tops of the palm trees, absolutely NO view of the beautiful ocean at all. We have never had to request another room upon check-in, but we clearly should have in this case. Oh, well.....we have learned. It just hurts when you feel like you were jipped!! (BTW, our room number was 1438, in case management wants to confirm our complaint.) Otherwise, we had a great time and met great people. I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would definitely warn them about the room category.

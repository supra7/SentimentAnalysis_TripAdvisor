We checked into Hotel Vintage Park on 6 November and couldn't have enjoyed a more fantastic stay. From check-in to check-out, Hotel Vintage Park was a totally pleasant experience. The hotel is in a good location and within walking distance to most downtown Seattle attractions and the waterfront. Everybody on staff was friendly and helpful, and we felt like valued, welcome guests. The hotel is very attractive, and our King Premier Room was well appointed, comfortable, and quiet. Hotel Vintage Park also hosts a complimentary wine-tasting each evening, featuring wines from around Washington State. Delicious hors d' oeuvres were also served to accompany the wines. We felt our room was very well priced, considering the quality of the hotel, its staff, and our room, and we will look forward to staying in Hotel Vintage Park during our next visit to Seattle.

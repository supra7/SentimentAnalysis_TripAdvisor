After reading some of the earlier reviews of this hotel, we were a bit concerned about whether or not we would like it. We recently spent five nights there and were extremely pleased. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable, the housekeeping is impeccable, the rooms are well appointed and the location is superb. We have stayed at several other Seattle hotels but this will become our hotel of choice in the future.

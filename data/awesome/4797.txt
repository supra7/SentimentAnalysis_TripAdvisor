Before we went to this hotel, I read the reviews on trip advisor and now am wondering how can anyone have a bad thing to say about this place, they must be used to the absolute best money can buy!! This hotel however:- amazing room, amazing staff, amazing food, amazing beach, everything was great. The entertainment staff were really good, you can be as active or relaxed as you want with no pressure, just a good time feeling all day every day. There is 8 resteraunts, all great all different, and the food at the pool or on the beach during the day was excellent too. I used the gym and that was perfectly adequate, and the spa although we never used it looked great. We would definitely return here. The staff could not do enough for us. One thing though it is really hot in June and gets hotter apparently, (we had to buy factor 75!! I didnt even know that existed!!) but a great great holiday.

My wife and I stayed at Hotel Max in August 2008, for 2 nights. We enjoyed the very modern fittings in the bathroom , the art work on the walls and room doors, the excellent service, the carded gym facility, and the clean hallways.The service at the reception desk was helpful and friendly. The location ,a short walk to downtown and Pike Place market , made the hotel a good choice.

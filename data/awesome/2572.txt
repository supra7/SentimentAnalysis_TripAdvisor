I stayed from Monday March 15-to Wednesday March 17 2010. The motel was very good. The staff was veery polite. I loved the clean breakfast room and the eggs and bagel were a delight. After reading people's bad reviews. I worried about this place on the flight. When I got there and saw my room I was very relieved. They recently remodeled and the place shined. I stayed in room 411. I work at a luxury hotel in Beaumont, Texas and know that this motel is great for a traveler's motel. When I was there I used the computer in the lobby and chatted with the night desk guy. I don't recall a name but he was very warm intellligent and friendly. The day desk ladies were most friendly. If I had to complain it would be that the water pressure was low but the shower was hot like I like it. Oh and there was a housekeeper guy that I chatted with and gave a radio to because i went shopping while in Seattle and bought a new cd/radio player. So to all the bad reviewers you need to be aware this place really has changed. Though being in downtown I saw absolutely no drug dealers or hookers like i read once before by sommeone. This Travel Lodge will definitely get another visit by me when i revisit the emerald city. Greg Sticker http://gregsticker1.webs.com/

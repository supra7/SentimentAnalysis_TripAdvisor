I spent a week at Hotel Andra and found it to be flawless in every regard, from the front reception to housekeeping and Room Service. I looked forward to coming back to the hotel at the end of the day to be greeting warmly by staff, find my bed turned down and some light jazz playing in the background. The gourmet food selection was excellent as part of the mini-bar selection and coffee making facilities were available. Every whim was catered for...hair-dryer, in-room safe, luggage racks and newspaper delivered daily. My husband called from Australia several times over the week and found the staff to be friendly and helpful. I shared a meal with a colleague at Lola, which again was really enjoyable. She stated that my lovely spacious room was much nicer than her accommodation on the Waterfront! Within close proximity to all major attractions and most importantly, the shopping district. As you can see, I can highly recommend Hotel Andra and hope to have the pleasure of staying there again.

The nicest all- inclusive I have been to. The food was awesome, service was slow at times, but nothing to complain about. The air in the room was not very cool, could not get below 74. The bed was very comfortable. Beach was perfect. We did need to reserve chairs early as they went fast. Pool was great too but we could never get chairs. It is nice to have all adults and no screaming children, much more relaxing. The spa is also worth a visit.

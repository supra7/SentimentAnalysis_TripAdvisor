My wife and I visited the sorrento for the weekend recently. We arrived a couple hours before check in time but were checked in immediately and offered a very reasonable upgrade to a spacious corner suite on the 6th floor. The room itself was clean and comfortable with a complete entertainment system, 2 couches and a wet bar. They have managed to provide a modern vibe to a historic hotel. The hunt club restaurant was great, there were special events happening in the penthouse and inline music in the fireside room . Def Recomend this to anyone visiting Seattle

This was our second visit to this resort and we had a fantastic vacation each time! Last year we had a swimout room that really spoiled us as it was nice to take a private swim at the end of a day in the sun. This year we were on the second floor with a room that had a tub on the balcony and we were just as pleased. The beds are extremely comfortable. We opted for room service for breakfast for our first two mornings.....it was a bit of a wait but the food was delicious and we enjoyed the privacy that a tip to the room service provided. Lunches eaten poolside were also freshly prepared and delicious. Our first year we had eaten at the Japanese restaurant and French restaurant onsite and were very pleased. This year we ate at the Italian restaurant and the Filet Mignon special was fantastic! Our last evening we decided to try the restaurant near the pool as they serve steaks in the evening. We didn't see Filet Mignon on the menu and when we asked if it was available, there was no hesitation by the waitstaff to prepare it for us and it was equally delicious. The resort also has a fine wine selection for dinner. And don't forget the pomegranate tequila! :). The most impressive part was that we had the same concierge both visits.. Roberto..and he remembered us by name! Kudos to Carlos, the "entertainment ladies" and who can forget Miguel...Mexican Chocolate! See you next year!

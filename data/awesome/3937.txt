My husband and I stayed here for our Anniverssary from August 15-19,2011 and had a wonderful time. I read the feviews about this hotel for months prior to our trip and I don't regret the choice that we made because From the moment we arrived to the time we had to leave this paradise we felt like VIP members. Our conceirge Carlos went above and beyond to assist our needs and he definitely exceeded our request.We love you Carlos! The entertainment staff(Gerardo,Miguel,Jesus,Hector and Goivanna) made the trip very enjoyable, memorable and fun, they even remembered our names.Our favorite bartender was Julio,we tracked him down at every bar he was servicing. I had great conversations with our preferred club bartender Eric. The beach at Secrets certainly stood out from the rest for it's cleanliness. I don't know how anyone could complain about this place as we found it to be above and beyond our expectations. This was our first trip to Mexico and this hotel sure made it a wonderful experience that I can't wait to return someday in the future. Don't have any doubts just go to Secrest and you won't regret it!!

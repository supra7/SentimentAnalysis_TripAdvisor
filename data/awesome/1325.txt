Miauw Suites was a highlight of my stay. I love design hotels and this one fit the bill, but was even more intimate, because it's almost like staying in your hip, stylish friend's spare room versus a veritable hotel. The room was a modern design lover's dream: charcoal walls, crisp white bedding that's just as comfortable as a Westin bed, an Apple computer in the room, fresh flowers and a view that is postcard-perfect. I would love to stay there again.

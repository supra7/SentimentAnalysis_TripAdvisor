We stayed for the first time in Seattle for our Anniversary. As soon as we checked in the staff knew exactly who we were, wished us both a Happy Anniversary and checked us in to our room early without issue. When we arrived to our room (with an excellent view), we were treated to a free bottle of Wine, Chocolates, and a Handwritten Congratulatory Note for our special occasion! The rest of our stay continued to be very pleasant and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle. The only drawbacks is the overall accommodations are on the small side (elevators are tiny) and the lack of free wireless. You can pay for wireless by the day or use the complimentary Internet in the business center behind the lobby though.

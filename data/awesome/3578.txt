From the moment we pulled up to the door, I knew we would not be disappointed by le Crystal. It is a beautiful, modern hotel - elegant yet comfortable and affordable. It is well located within Downtown Montreal: a five minute walk to the Metro, a ten minute walk to Old Montreal, and a two minute walk to fabulous restaurants and shopping. But what I think sets le Crystal apart from the other "boutique" hotels in Downtown Montreal is the staff. Every employee with which we interacted was friendly and always ready to be of help. The housekeeping staff kept the room immaculate, stopping by early in the evening to provide fresh towels if needed. Worthy of special mention is the head concierge, Luc. He made us feel like VIPs by planning our sightseeing, booking a reservation at a very popular/busy restaurant, and locating a special souvenir I had my heart set on. Luc really made our stay that much more enjoyable. My wife and I look forward to once again being guests of le Crystal.

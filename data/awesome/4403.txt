Secrets Moroma Beach was impressive! After going on a couple of all inclusive trips, Secrets set the bar for me. The food, drinks, entertainment, and especially THE STAFF stood out as exceptional. There were lots of food options (seafood, steaks, French, Italian, Mexican, Japanese) although we never checked out the Japanese restaurant. Also, the beach and pool areas were well tended to and offered a relaxing and fun atmosphere. I would definitely go again! ***We did a swim up room, but the water was a little cold in February. I would only spend the money to reserve that room when it's in the 80's (and above) more consistently!

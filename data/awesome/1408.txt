I loved my stay at the Renaissance Hotel! From reading the reviews, it sounds like a renovation took place recently. The gym is awesome- 5 or 6 treadmills overlooking the city, ellipticals, weights, and other machines made it really nice!! The saltwater pool and hot tub also looked over the city. These were spectacular views from the 28th floor! The hotel staff was very friendly. We asked for a room with two beds, but they didn't have one, so they gave us a suite! They brought up a rollaway bed. Great view.. I recommend getting a room on a high floor. I had no noise issues! The bathroom was nice- they even have Aveda shampoo and conditioner. The location is great for shopping (about 5 blocks away) and going to Pike's Market (down some steep hills you'll have to eventually come up again, but closeby). The food is expensive if you get ro service, but everything was pretty good! The water pressure is low, but I figure that's because they are trying to conserve water.

We recently stayed 6 nights with 3 adult children (2 rooms) for vacation. I can not think of anything I did not like about this place. Conveniently located to practically everything, we were able to walk everywhere, including the Amtrak station to catch our train. All the employees were friendly and helpful, especially the turn down service woman. Routinely coming to the room after our east coast time zone bodies were past ready for bed, she eagerly gave us plenty of chocolates and left us alone! Get a goldfish delivered to your room, even if you think it's silly. You'll be amazed how attached you can get to a goldfish! The rooms are spacious (we had a king suite and a queen) with plenty of places to sit besides just the bed. The beds are comfortable, clean, and the water pressure in the shower is amazing! I love the full size shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel pump bottles in the shower. Not having to fumble with tiny bottles and caps is nice. We never seemed to be around for the wine reception (so much to do!), but did have breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. The value of the rooms, especially with the AAA rate, was excellent. I've stayed in many hotels not nearly as nice for more money. I will not hesitate to stay here again if I am in Seattle.

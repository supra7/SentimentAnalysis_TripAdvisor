Hotel located close to everything, room large and comfortable. Leopard print robes a fun addition. Food and classic cocktails were great in the Sazarac restaurant/lounge. Staff was friendly and effecient - they went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!

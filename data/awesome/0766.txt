I stayed here overnight for business and will come here again everytime I come to seattle. The lobby is very nice and modern. Service was prompt and courteous. The room was well decorated and clean. I liked the bathrobes and the chocolates waiting for me when I checked in. The best thing about this hotel though is the location. You are one block way from the market and great shopping. Even on a Wednesday morning it was bustling and teaming with life.

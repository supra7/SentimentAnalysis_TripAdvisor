I highly recommend the Hotel Monaco. The location is beyond amazing being so close to everything you would want to get to in Seattle. The staff was great but by far the best part was the food and restaurant service. My wife and I highly recommend the hotel if you want a nice place to stay. It is expensive but every dollar is worth it.

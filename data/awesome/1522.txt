This hotel is centrally located to all of the great shopping in downtown Seattle and just a few blocks away from the Famous Pike Place market. You can easily take advantage of of the waterfront ferry services, restaurants and aquarium with a short walk or taxi ride. The rooms are very spacious and well furnished. Linens and towels are very clean. The bed is very comfortable and guarantees a good nights rest. There is a great fitness room and pool for those wanting to get in a workout. Room service is quite pricey (a $15 burger actually cost me $36) but there are plenty of great places to catch a bite to eat wihtin walking distance. I highly recommend staying here and will return next time I am in Seattle.

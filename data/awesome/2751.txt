We actually stayed here for part of our honeymoon and absolutely loved the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating! The housekeepers did an awesome job and we haven't ever received such excellent service. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The location was ideal and allowed us to experience downtown Seattle without having to pay money for a rental car. Everything was within walking distance. The rooms were amazing and we had an amazing view of the Columbia Center and Mt. Rainier! It was beautiful! The rooms were very cozy and comfortable and they couldn't have been more perfect! They also had wine testing every evening down in the lobby which we greatly enjoyed! We will definitely stay at the Vintage again if we are back in Seattle! We recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in downtown Seattle!

I have driven by the Edgewater my entire life and had never stayed there..... Boy was I missing out! My wife and I stayed there for our anniversary and were treated to a wonderful experience. The staff was not only professional but they treated you like famile.. like they knew you. Six Seven was a great dining experience. Our server was not only on point but seemed to genuinely care about our dining experience. I will not only stay here again but will recommend to all who will listen. Thank You to the Edgewater staff for a wonderful stay.

I just stayed at this magnificent hotel for a long weekend and i was just captivated for every single detail the staff does to make memorable your stay. This * * * * * Property is located in a very special location in the corner of Boul. Rene Leveque and De la Montagne street, the in door pool on the 12th floor is just Perfect with a nice view to the south side of the city, the out door Jacuzzi is located on the same floor with an awesome view of the whole city and the terrace is really big for the nature of the hotel. Talking with other guess i could realize that this resort is very popular for new yorkers and some others guess around the world. The most of the rooms has no balconies, so i made sure i could get one on my reservation process and i just have to say that the view is really stunning compare to others hotels of the competition. The rooms conditions are excellent and very up to date, you can find from a rain shower to a pillow top mattress...its just a plus to stay at this hotel when you are visiting the Gothic City of Montreal. Its just an unbeatable World class quality hotel.

I've stayed here twice now... once in October 09 and again in Dec 09. Both rooms booked thru Hotwire for under $30/night. The first time I visited, the room was kind of musty smelling but it wasnt terrible. This recent trip the room was perfect, no problems. Front desk staff were pleasant, check-in was fine. Cons: The wi-fi they have only works in the lobby/breakfast area. Kind of an inconvenience, but it is what it is. The signal is a bit weak, but i never lost connection. Proximity to Disney... someone mentioned it as well... yeah it's a bit further out, closer to US 27... Hotwire classified this as 'Disney Maingate/Celebration Area', when this is probably better labeled as 'Kissimmee'. Overall, I do like this place, would recommend it.

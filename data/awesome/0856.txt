I was most impressed by the professional appearance, sincere concern for making my stay as trouble/stress free as possible and the caring, "can do" attitude of all the staff. Every member of the staff, starting with the desk personnel, housekeeping, room service to concierge was genuinely dedicated to customer care. I will definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others. Also, views of the city skyline were beautiful. Thank you for a job well done!!

I had a free weekend following business meeetings in Seattle, and was planning to meet friends for dinner. The Vintage Park suited me because I spend a great deal of time in the large chain hoels, and wanted a more boutique experience out of the bustle of downotwn, at a reasonable rate. Friendly staff, view of the architectural gem of the Seattle Library from the tall windows in my room (a small suite with sitting area), and easy access to the 5th Avenue theatre as well as high-end shopping made this a perfect "stay-cation". The wine and cheese evening in the small but attractive lobby as well as a lovely dinner in Tulio (their Italian restaurant on-site) made for an enjoyable and relaxing weekend.

The place was recommended to us, but we were concerned after being met by pushy porters at Cancun airport taking our bags 5metres and demanding tips for their assistance, then on the drive from the airport, especially when our ride turned off for 'secrets maroma beach' & we went along a bumpy, worn out road.......HOWEVER, Once arriving at the hotel, our first thoughts were "why did we not book for longer?". The place was AMAZING! WE were greeted with cool scented facecloths to freshen up, then given a glass of champagne whilst waiting to check-in. The only advice I would give, is not to sign up with the VIP service desk - it is a time share ploy that wastes a few hours of your time at the resort. We signed up (as did every other person we spoke to as it really is not given as an option on arrival). After settling in & realising what it was, we decided not to attend but were phoned four times asking where we were and when we would re-schedule! Everyone we spoke to who had attended said it was a waste of time & they were 'pushed' to purchase a time share. That was the only negative of our honeymoon. From that day, we could not fault the resort, the beach, the facilities, the pools, the bars, the sunbeds, the staff, the room, the cleanliness, the choices, the entertainment, the food....absolutely everything was fantasic & we can't wait to go back there. Would recommend it to absolutely anyone. All the staff would go out of their way to assist you in any way they could & to ensure you got the best from your time there. It was obvious from the start that their very focus was the customer & ensuring you had nothing left to be desired. They also knew their boundaries and would never 'push' or disturb you. WHatever I say, words are not enough to praise the resort as it deserves. All I can say is go see for yourselves.....& please take me with you:-)

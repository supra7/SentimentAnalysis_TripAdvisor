My husband and I traveled to Secrets with 18 other people. All of had various things we were celebrating such as anniversaries and/or birthdays. We were extremely happy with our trip and the quality of the resort. Over the course of ten years, we have traveled to many all-inclusive resorts; however this was our first trip to an adults only resort. This was by far the most elegant and pristine of the ones we have visited. The rooms are very nice with marble bathrooms, jacuzzi in the room and on the balcony. Everything was very clean with nice personal touches. We found that the food was very good and it was not difficult to be seated for dinner. There is only one restaurant that takes reservations (Japanese) and it is worth going to, but be certain to make reservation upon arrival because they are hard to come by. Several of our party went deep sea fishing and brought back fish which they happily included to our dinner menu. The service at this resort was beyond what we had expected. The staff bent over backwards to help you in any way you needed. They discovered out it was our anniversary and without any additional charge arranged for us to have a champagne breakfast in our room. As we normally travel with our teenagers, we definitely noticed how quiet it was there. This is probably not the place to go if you are looking for a lot of night life or a wild time. Since there were 20 of us, we did have our own pool "party barge" but we were definitely not the norm. This is a great place to go for honeymooners or if you are celebrating an event. If you want a nice view of the ocean, be sure and ask for a room above the second floor. I'm sure that years ago they all had a nice view, but as the foliage and trees have grown, the view of the ocean from floor 2 has diminished. We would definitely recommend this resort and would love to go back again!

Stayed here and evaluated on June 16, 2011. Back in Seattle and this time I reserved two suites for myself and a business associate. Beyond my June 16th comments I can add the following. Didn't arrive until 9PM at Airport. Called for shuttle. Because of projected delay was instructed to rent cab and keep receipt. Upon arrival was reimbursed, in cash, for the cab fare. Truly more than expected. Personnel were excellent- friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Made both myself and my business associate feel like we were home. Although the property is starting to show age a little and could use some cosmetic attention, overall the hotel is well maintained. Shuttle to airport was efficient and on time. No complaints at all and hope to stay there again soon. Breakfast was efficient with great selection for any appetite. Bed was very comfortable.If there is a train I didn't notice it.

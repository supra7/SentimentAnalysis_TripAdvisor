I can't recommend the Mayflower park hotel highly enough! We just returned from celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary out there, and this hotel played a prominant role in our very positive experience of Seattle. In recognition of our anniversary, they upgraded our hotel room for all 3 night's stay, and sent champagne to our table at dinner. From the front desk to the hotel restaurant, everyone was warm and hospitable. The hotel itself is also top quality. Our room was spacious, with quality details throughout, and a charming feel. Their restaurant is highly rated, and in a collection of excellent meals-their's standsout. The location is extremely convenient-just a couple blocks off the water, and a few more blocks walk to the ferrys. And last but not least, very reasonable for such a central location. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seattle, and we will always stay there in the future. Of course, we first heard about the Mayflower Park from other travelers on the forum, so we're just adding to the chorus of compliments for this gem of a hotel!

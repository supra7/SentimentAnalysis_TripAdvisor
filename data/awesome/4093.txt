The resort staff were very helpful, friendly, and always available to serve you. The accomodations were breathtaking so luxurious! We loved the food there, the entertainment was great, and the beach and sea were absolutely beautiful! We were so spoiled here we did not want to leave our honeymoon and come back to no longer being waited on. The only downfall is the horrible road to get to the resort. Get ready for a Mayan full body massage when you travel to and from the resort! Potholes everywhere!

My daughter and I stayed at Hotel Max for a 2-night getaway. We loved this hotel. It was unique, comfortable, clean, accommodating, and fun. Every staff person we encountered put forth huge effort to make sure we were provided excellent service. I would definitely stay here again, no doubt about it!

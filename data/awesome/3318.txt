We stayed one night at the Seattle Marriott Sea-Tac Hotel as part of a cruise package deal. After a long day of flying from Tennessee, we checked into our room with no problem. went downstairs to the lobby and had a delicious dinner at the Atrium Lounge & Bar. Then we went back to our room to rest a little and immediately fell into a deep sleep. When we awoke in the morning, I had to find out what company made the pillows. After removing the pillowcase and zippered covering, I discovered it was the Pacific Coast Co. When we got home from our trip, I contacted the company and ordered two pillows. Then we got packed and went down to the Aqua Terra restaurant and had their "Good Start" breakfast buffet. You got coffee or tea, juice, fresh fruit, danish & pastries, eggs done anyway you requested, sausage, bacon, hash browned potatoes and pancakes. Everything was fresh & hot and our waiter would refill our coffee and juice. The cost was $13.95 plus TX and gratuity. We were really glad we did the buffet, because our trip from the hotel to the airport to catch our bus ride from Seattle to Vancouver was long (approximately 4 hours from hotel to the cruise ship) with no stops to eat. Hotel had lovely decor, a pool (which we didn't have time to use) large, quiet, comfortable rooms and a computer room. If we ever get back to Seattle, we would definitely stay here, because it was perfect!

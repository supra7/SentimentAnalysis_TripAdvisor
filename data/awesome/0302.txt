The hotel is located not far from the Space Needle. From our room we had a view of the Space Needle and the water. Sure was nice to sit by the balcony while having a cup of coffee in the morning and enjoying the view. The room was a nice size and very clean. The service from this staff is outstanding. I would definitely stay at the Warwick again if I ever go back to visit Seattle.

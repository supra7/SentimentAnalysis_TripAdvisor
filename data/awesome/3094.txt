I booked this hotel for my birthday. I informed the property and I was greeted at check in with a warm "Happy Birthday". Upon arriving in the room I was suprised to find a a few treats along with a card. The room although small was very modern and the bed was very comfortable. The room was outfited with a few romantic extras. The only downside to this property is the bathroom it very tiny. I kept bumping my elbows in the shower. All in all great customer service and I felt extremely valued.

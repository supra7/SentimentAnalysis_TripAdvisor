My husband and I went for our 5 year anniversary. It was super relaxing. We stayed/upgraded to an ocean front room. It was worth it. Service was great and food much better than expected. The Himitsu was worth the reservation and outside dining at PortoFinos was wonderful. absolutely no complaints. The beach is clean and water clear.

This is the 3rd time I've stayed at Destiny. This time we were there during Spring Break with our Marching Band and we had a wonderful time. The staff is efficient and friendly, the rooms were clean and the beds very very comfortable. It is close to stores and Disney but it is also in a quiet location. The manager Chuck is the best. He treats us like family. We feel at home.

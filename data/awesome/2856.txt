I have stayed here twice. Once for work and once with my Wife for leisure. It's a great hotel and like all W hotels pretty stylish and comfy. The first time we stayed we did have to move rooms however due to some very noisy youngsters having a party in the room next door. Location is OK, but nothing in the immediate area. Everything is within walking distance though. Nice bar with some great tunes (live DJ). I got a great deal on price using my corporate code...about $160, so definitely worth every penny.

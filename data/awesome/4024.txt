From the moment we stepped onto the property, my husband and I were blown away. The service, the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the beach... everything was top notch. Our only complaint was the entertainment. But all in all, the entertainment is not why we booked the resort. As a bride, I was very nervous about booking my honeymoon, we all have heard the many nightmares of terrible resorts and wasted money but my fears were put to rest. We stayed in a swim-out suite that was gorgeous, had a candlelit dinner of the beach, couples massage, the whole-nine-yards. In addition, we also ventured off the property. Again, I was hesitant but it was a lot of fun to rent a Jeep and drive to the ruins, Playa Del Carmen and Cancun. We will certainly be returning for our one-year anniversary and have recommended the resort to our friends and family.

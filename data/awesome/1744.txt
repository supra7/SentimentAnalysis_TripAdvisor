I stayed at the Sixth Avenue in for one night before a cruise. All the staff were so friendly--the registration desk, cleaning staff, and restaurant. The hotel was much quieter then I expected, given the age of the building and the fact that there were a couple large groups that night. And the bed was so comfortable!

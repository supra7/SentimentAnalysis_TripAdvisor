I couldn't be happier with my recent stay at the Marqueen. This hotel had everything I was looking for: a fantastic location, a comfortable room with a private bathroom and kitchenette, friendly and helpful staff, and a great price! I cannot say enough good things about this place. It's located in Queen Anne, a lovely Seattle neighborhood, and near the hotel you'll find lots of great restaurants/cafes, a grocery store, several bus routes, and right next door, Easy Street Records - very important for a music-lover like me. :) The hotel is close to downtown Seattle in a very safe area, and the price is much better than you'll find for any of the downtown hotels. My room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable, a great home base for my travels. The Marqueen staff is wonderful too - they really made me feel at home. Can't wait for my next trip to Seattle, when I'll be staying here again for sure!

I always stay at a Hampton Inn when I travel for work, they are clean, the breakfast is a great convenience, and I love the free internet. I was wary of this hotel due to some of the reviews I have read, and was pleasantly surprised that this is one of the best that I have stayed at. The renovations seemed complete, my room was completely redone, a little small but nicely furnished and the bathroom was great. Staff great as usual and it was very quiet. The location is great for the airport, but food choices are few and far between. Would definitely stay here again if I need to be close to the airport.

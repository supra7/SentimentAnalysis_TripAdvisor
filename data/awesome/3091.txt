I have to say, this is one of the friendliest hotels I have ever stayed in. I was super impressed by the front desk staff, the guy called "Rock Star" was more than greeting, he was fun and made me feel like I was a special guest in his hotel. I don't think I have ever had service of that quality anywhere. Even the valet who parked my car and carried my bags where totally sweet and attentive. If that is the working class of Seattle, I'm impressed. My husband was tired and not in a very fun mood, but "Rock Star" was so very positive that he had us laughing before we had even got the keys to our room. He totally took care of us while we were there, making us reservations at this wonderful italian restaraunt, helping us get tickets to a baseball game, and getting us on a guest list to see the a concert at the Showbox. The rooms are small but very well designed. The beds have to be the best beds I have ever slept in in a hotel. I took a 30 minute shower which made me feel like I was in a spa (sorry for wasting the water so much, but I needed it.) It seems to me that the Hotel Max is a gem in the rough. They seemed small time, but they deffinatly pulled it off right. It was cozy, and I recommend this hotel for anyone that wants to have a wonderful weekend away from the kids or has a speacial moment to celebrate. The service was sort of like one of those movies where some normal person wins a million dollars and all of a sudden has butlers and maids to take care of them. I'll stay there everytime I'm back in Seattle. A lot of little things were out of whack, like no robes in the room,

Another great stay at this hotel - nice staff, yummy restaurant for breakfast, cozy lobby with fireplace. . . had a spectacular room this time on the 11th floor with a direct view of the Seattle Space Needle. . . comfy bed, large space with sofa, huge bathtub, we love this place and always manage to find a good rate on-line :) We arrived and showered before dinner, so we asked to have some fresh towels in our bathroom for the morning - while we were at dinner they replenished and cleaned our bathroom so it was pristine for the morning - very nice indeed! We'll be back!

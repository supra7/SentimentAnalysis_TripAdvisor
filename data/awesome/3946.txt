We found a great deal for this hotel so we decided to spend 3 days, 2 nights the last Sept 19th. The hotel is such a dream, the facilities, the lobby, the gardens, the pools, the restaurants, the rooms. The service exceeds expectations. In other words it is very like to the information provided at the hotel site. *Two only observations I could make: 1st - the red/yellow flag on the beach. Its our third time at this beach, its the first at this hotel, and when we say red flag we were surprised, because the nearby hotels had green flags. During noon, flags were switched to Yellow, we really did not understand why, but you feel weird entering to the beach with a red flag. 2nd the extremely oriented service to US customers. Aprox, less than 30% are non US people (Europeans, Latins, Asians, etc), so when we went to the shows some unfortunate comments were shown by animation staff celebrated by US customers. Nothing to severe but be prepared. The restaurants serve such an excellent quality of food a la carte, only at noon there is a buffet and it is very nice, there is a nice variety of restaurants, Italian is great; there is also live music (violin style) in some of them which gives an extra romantic touch; we would definitively recommend this hotel for honeymooners or anniversaries. The rooms are very elegant, well equipped, for plenty romantic moments.

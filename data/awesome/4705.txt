Pure Luxury. The hotel catered for your every need as soon as you walked through the door! Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Rooms great. The pool and beach were superb. A single fault would be the driveway to the resort.... but who cares about that! Enjoy your stay at Secrets Maroma Beach!

This resort was great! It's the best all inclusive we've been to and we would definitely go back. Pros: Beach and Pools were amazing Beach Cabana was great and worth the $30 The entertainment staff were good and there were plenty of activities during the day Very nice, clean, and new Food was pretty good and they had top shelf alcohol Never felt crowded and never had to wait for food or drinks Great service at the pool and beach Cons: Ordered room service which never came If you don't specifically ask for top shelf alcohol they use the cheap stuff The champagne breakfast was really lame. No champagne just bread, pastries, fruit, and orange juice.

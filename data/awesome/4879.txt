My husband and I travelled with family and friends to Secrets Maroma for my daughter's wedding. The wedding as well as everything else went very well. The customer service at this Secrets is off the charts. Anytime there was any issue, the staff responded very well. As you have read in other reviews, the food, drinks, pool, beach and rooms are awesome. Probably the best beach in Mexico Riviera Maya. Cecilia orchestrated the wedding plans perfectly. We did have 2 glitches during our one week stay. First was the overbooking and the closing of several restaurants Saturday night for weddings or business groups leaving regular retail customers to entail long waits to get into the 3 remaining restaurants. After voicing our complaint, they did find us a table right away. Second was the failure of most of the a/c throughout the resort for several days. It became very uncomfortable and we felt that at the very least they could have raised the dress code requiring men to have long slacks in the restaurants. I feel that some compensation would have been appreciated. This is a very high end resort and guests should not have to endure these problems. Even with these 2 issues, we had a wonderful and memorable stay. We have travelled to several caribbean locations and stayed at quite a few high end resorts, and this one topped them all. One comment regarding the "preferred club": Unless its really important to be near the ocean, I do not feel the higher rate is worth it. Rooms are the same except for the soaking tub on the deck. We did have a preferred club room in building 26, 4th floor, and our view was again awesome! I believe our entire group was upgraded to preferred status, so thanks to Secrets and Cecilia for that!!! We'll be back.

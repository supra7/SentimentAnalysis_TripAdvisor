My friends and I stayed at Secrets Maroma in December 2009 and had an AMAZING time. I can't even think of my favorite thing. The beach was such a great surprise. I have been to quite a few all-inclusives and the beach is normally nice, but small. Their beach is HUGE and beautiful. You could get even get served lunch and beverages there which was fabulous. The pool was fun and entertaining if you wanted, or you could go to other spots that were more low key. During lunch they would come around with some type of specialty food every day. Sushi, grilled kabobs, fresh fruit, it was awesome. Sometimes we wouldnt even go to lunch. We would eat whatever they brought, then when we got back to the room to get ready for dinner we would order something from room service. They would deliver it to the "secret box" which is especially nice for first thing in the morning or while you are getting ready since you may not be completely presentable. Dinners were fun and we had a large group and they couldnt have been more accommodating. One night at the italian restaurant they seated all 12 of us outside on the terrace. They brought us our food under silver domes and in unison unveiled our dishes. Talk about service!! I have been to more expensive places which were supposed to be the best of the best but I have yet to find a better place then Secrets Maroma. Oh and the crepes at breakfast every morning...yummy. The service, room, beach, pools, and people were outstanding. I couldnt recommend it more!

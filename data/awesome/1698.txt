I have stayed at the Sheraton before the renovation and it was OK, dated, but not horrible. However, now the hotel is just great. Lobby looks amazing, fresh and luxurious. The rooms are great, updated in all possible ways. I cannot tell if the walls are very well insulated, or if the hotel was half-empty, but it was very quiet in the room. Location of the hotel is obviously excellent, right in the middle of downtown. On the negatives, the ice machine in our floor had not been turned on. Parking is very expensive and valet is slow at peak times. Hotel needs a bar with extended hours, we wanted one more rounds of drinks just after midnight on a Saturday night and nothing in the hotel was open. The staff could not tell where a closest bar would be.

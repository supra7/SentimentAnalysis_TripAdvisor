Went here with 4 friends for a girlfriends getaway though the reviews say this is not the place for such an affair. I've been to many all inclusives over the yrs and Secrets Maroma had great food, great rooms, great service and great drinks. We are planning a trip back but this time we're going to bring our husbands.

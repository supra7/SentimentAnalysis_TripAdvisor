We stayed at the Mayflower prior to an Alaskan Cruise. Every aspect of our stay there was wonderful. We took advantage of their great pre-cruise package which included a wonderful full breakfast and transportation to the pier. Our room was lovely, clean, comfortable and well appointed. The concierge and front desk staff were cheerful and helped with everything from dinner reservations to replacing a lost certificate for a discounted dinner in their (not to be missed) dining room. I would love to return for a longer stay at this lovely hotel, and more in-depth visit to this charming city .

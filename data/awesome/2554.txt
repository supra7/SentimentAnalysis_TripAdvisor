Hi All, Went to Seattle from 7/31/05 till 8/5/05 then cruised on the Celebrity Mercury for a week. We had the best weather in months for the whole two weeks.We had the 3 day Go Seattle card ,it normally cost about 95 dollars but got it online for 75.The first thing we did was walk to Pikes market for dinner and then around downtown to get a general layout of the area. The next morning we took the 3 hour Seattle city tour and we were glad we did because all the other tours we took fed off this one and they all made sense.We rode the monorail,took the underground tour,the Argosy lakes boat tour,the Argosy sound boat tour,The Mount Rainier tour and the Washington Dinner train upper panarama ride.Hey we were on vacation and wanted to see it all.In between all these tours we ATE,ATE ATE. Haha we were in training for the boat ride.cruiser's will understand that.Dont miss the Pikes brewery great food and beer.Everywhere we ate was reasonable and friendly,they know how to treat tourists out there.The food at the Westin was excellent. Well I hope if you go your vacation is fun,but as you know 10 people can go at the same time and have 10 different stories.Ours are usually good.

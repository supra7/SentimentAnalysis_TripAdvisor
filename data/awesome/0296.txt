When we plan a stay in Seattle we always pick the Warwick. The rooms are nice, the price is great and the employees are very friendly and make you feel special. The hotel has a quaint boutique feel to it (reminds me of some hotels I have stayed at in Paris). Location is great. Would recommend to anyone.

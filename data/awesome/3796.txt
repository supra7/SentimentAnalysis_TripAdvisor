We took a group of 50 and despite other excellent reviews were somewhat nervous of the ultra all inclusive idea. From the moment we drove up to the hotel doubts started to disappear. Ultra friendly welcome and all checked in a flash. Looked down across the pools from the balacony bar to the Caribbean and journey stress evaporated. Suites are excellent, concierge was very helpful and the restaurants were of top quality and generally excellent service (French one a bit surly but maybe that was to add authenticity?!). Around the pools friendly staff pitch up and offer you drinks. Places we enjoyed most - Steakhouse near the pools - best out of all for service and excellent steaks, Rendezvous bar, Japanese Teppanyaki (only think you can and must book - get a group of 6 and private room). Only minus was few of us getting mild stomach bugs but heat and unlimited delicious fresh fruit and salad probably made that a risk. Lots of our group really enjoyed the activities and entertainment too so if you get bored of being pampered that's not a problem!

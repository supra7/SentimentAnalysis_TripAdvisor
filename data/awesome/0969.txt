I live in Tacoma and stayed at the MarQueen Hotel last Saturday. I was in town to see some Rock-N-Roll in Ballard. We arrived to the hotel and had our vehicle parked by the Valet. It was so easy and fuss-less. There are so many options for dining out in the immediate area, we had dinner a couple of blocks away at Bamboo Gardens (vegetarian Chinese, delicious). The MarQueen is by far my new favorite place to stay in Seattle! The room we had was completely sound proof from the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood below. The best part of our stay, besides the very friendly service, was the bed. I wish I could have that good of a night's sleep every night. I got home and wanted to burn my bed and permanently move into the room I had at the MarQueen.

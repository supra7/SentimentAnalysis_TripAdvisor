I stayed in this hotel as part of a conference at the nearby convention center. It is quite convenient to the convention facilities as well as lots of restaurants, and shopping. The room was pretty standard, the price was not too bad for a big downtown hotel, and the lobby was nice. I was told that I would have free internet access because of my Sheraton rewards status, but the one time I tried to check it out the web page seemed to suggest a rather substantial fee so I dropped the idea. For tourists, it is only a few blocks away from the Pike Place market, a block or two from the light rail station (that can take you to the airport or near the stadiums), and a block from the monorail station that takes you to the space needle.

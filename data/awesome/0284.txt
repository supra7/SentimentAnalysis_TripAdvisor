We spent three nights at the Warwick last week. Check in was friendly and smooth. Our room was not quite ready, but the lobby was comfy and we were upgraded to an eighteenth floor corner room with a gorgeous view by a very sweet and professional front desk gal. Breakfast was included, quite tasty and dinner was very nice with good choices of beverages and suggested wine pairings. The hotel is located near Seattle Center and the monorail. We walked to both and to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, downtown and even the International district, but we are fit and not averse to getting slightly rained on. The pool and spa area is small, but both were clean and other guests were all polite and pleasant. Everyone seemed to be having a good stay as smiles were shared in common areas. We will be back. Thanks for a wonderful getaway!

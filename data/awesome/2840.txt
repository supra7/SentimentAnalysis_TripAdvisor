Stayed at this hotel while on business and it was excellent. Great beds, great bathroom, nice service. Terrific Bliss products!! Lots of positives. and definitely much better than many other hotels especially the standard Mariotts, etc. The "cool vibe" and low lighting is kind of overdone, but who cares? It's kind of fun! Only two items to be aware of -- no free wifi and expensive parking (which is to be expected in a downtown hotel). Also, compared to other hotel affinity groups, Starwood Preferred Guests (SPG) really offers nothing -- not even a free bottle of water. So while I'd definitely stay here again and certainly would stay at other "W" hotels, SPG really needs to do more to attract the business traveler.

We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel in late April 2007. We used to live in the area, so knew the location was prime. The hotel has a great reputation, so we decided to book our stay here and see for ourselves. We were not disappointed! We had a room on the 3rd floor. Our room was quite large, and very comfortable. As we walked in the door, there was a large wet bar with a small refrigerator. Upon entering the main part of the room, there was a sofa and several chairs with ottomans as well as a large coffee table. A very useable seating area, which is not always the case in hotels. We had a king bed, and near the bed area was the large walk in closet (with bathrobes for our use) and the bathroom. The bathroom was a tad small, but not cramped. Everything was nicely appointed and extremely well maintained. Our room looked out to the street towards the old Bon store (now Macy's), so at the holidays it would be a very nice view. Our room was very quiet. We never heard noise from other rooms or from the street. We did not have any meals at the hotel restaurant, but we did have drinks in the bar, Oliver's, several times. This place gets busy, so the wait for drinks can be a bit, but it was never very long. We used the valet several times and they were always very quick. Our visit was so enjoyable that while we were checking out, I booked another stay there for this fall for a girls week in the area. The room was beautiful and the location cannot be beat.

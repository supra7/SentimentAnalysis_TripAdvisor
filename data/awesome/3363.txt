My husband and I stayed at the Seattle Hilton (Airport) in June, using it as a launch for the beginning of our 25th anniversary cruise. We were pleasantly surprised at the beauty of the gardens, and the spaciousness of the rooms. We expected little from a airport hotel, and were delighted with our stay there. One of the little touchs that I particularly liked, was a huge glass modern art decanter filled with water, ice and lemons adjacent to the registration desk. It looked so refreshing and welcomed us in the most beautiful way.

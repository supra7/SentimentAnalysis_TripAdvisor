Just spent three days in Seattle and we picked the Hotel Monaco based on location to our meetings and experience from other Komptons Hotels on east coast. This was a great stay and the best part ended up being the Hotel employees. Not just front desk or the door man, but everytime a housekeeping or maintanence person saw us we were greeted with a smile, a hello and even would walk over a press the button to summons the elevator to our floor. I am always impressed when all parts of a hotel are interesting, fun, clean and the people are happy to have you stay with them. The hotel lobby and the unique display of one of a kind chandelers is worth seeing. Restaurant was a very nice find with great happy hour and very friendly atmosphere.. I will go back and next time to enjoy and relax.

The Warwick Hotel in Seattle is well located, near all city attractions and transportation. The rooms are clean, comfortable, great mattresses, a good restaurant on the premises and two fabulous restaurants a block away (Lola's and Assaggio). The view of the Space Needle lit up at night from my room was spectacular. Staff are helpful, parking available. But the best part is the price. A deluxe king room ranges from $109 to $139 depending on the season. I stay there because it is near the business client I see in Seattle, but I would stay here for pleasure and with a family as well.

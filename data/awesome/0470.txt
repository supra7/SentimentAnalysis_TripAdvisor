Rarely am I ever at a hotel where I could be content staying on the premises and/or only explore the immediate area. This is one of those hotels. The room was large and very comfortable, SO clean and beautifully decorated. Even though we had a city view room, there was a window seat where we could open the curtains and see the Public Market sign with the water behind it. At lunchtime, we grabbed some clam chowder from Pike Place Chowder across the street in Post Alley (which was delicious!) and a bottle of wine and went up to the deck where there was a table and chairs for us to relax and enjoy the view as well as check on the action down at the market. The Inn at the Market was the perfect location for us to be able to pop back into our room if we felt like taking a short break, dropping off some stuff, skipping the public bathrooms, etc. Being so close to the market, there were lots of choices for places to grab breakfast, so I didn't miss not having that option included with the room. It was a really nice touch to get a hand-written note upon arrival wishing us a happy anniversary along with some cute, delicious cupcakes. The staff...what can I say? Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful and quick with any request we had. When the housekeeper forgot to stock us with an extra roll of tp and we called down for one, I felt like we'd just hung up the phone and someone was knocking on our door with it! I LOVE this place and would go back in a heartbeat, even though it was a stretch for us to afford it. P.S. I gave them a 4 for sleep quality because I personally don't like feather pillows and spend a lot of time trying to get it "just so". Also, even though the curtains were shut, light from the street seeped in, keeping the room a bit lighter than I would have liked. We put the long decorative pillows on the window seat where the curtains ended and that helped. The bed and comforter was so cozy though!

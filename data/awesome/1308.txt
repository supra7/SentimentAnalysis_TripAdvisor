This was the first trip for two students outside Canadian borders where I was in charge of planning flight details, lodging and daily activities. The main focus of our trip was to take in a football game, so we wanted a place in the downtown core, central to all the attractions this wonderful city had to offer. Many of the hotels in the core were pricey, but the Moore had a cheaper nightly rate, as well as a 10% off coupon i had found online. Considering the price, discount, location and numerous recommendations, we had no option than to give the Moore a shot, and we were certainly not disappointed! We took full advantage of the shuttle bus (route 194) almost directly to the Moore, and can't imagine how much money we saved between two trips! We booked a 2 Queen bedroom with a view of the sound (as was recommended, and is pictured below) on the top floor. The hotel itself is very basic in regards to provided amenities. Make sure to bring your own shampoo and pack your own mints! The wireless internet was a great perk for minors unable to fully enjoy the nightlife Seattle has to offer. The location of the hotel, while very convienent, manages to make you feel very safe in a somewhat shadier area of downtown. The staff on hand were incredibly helpful in aiding us with transportation tips, sights and attractions, and dining options! In fact, everyone in the city is VERY courteous, pleasant and accomodating! GO SEAHAWKS!

My husband, our 20 month old daughter and I stayed here for three nights and had a wonderful time! All of the staff was wonderful and accomodated all of our requests immediately! Our daughter loved the fish 'Lucia' that we had in our room. It was a fun touch! We also ate at the restaurant in the lobby twice and the food was excellent! The room service was a little over priced, but we only ordered dessert. The location was great as we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle. The valet parking was a little pricey, but they were very accomodating and even ran to our car to grab our sunglasses for us. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Great military/government rates for those that qualify!

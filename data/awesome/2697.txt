We had the fortune of bringing our dog with us to Seattle and elected to spend 3 ngihts at the Kimpton Vintage Park, which is a pet friendly hotel. We were very pleased this property. The comfortable bed, nicely appointed room and evening cocktails were very welcome. There were a number of dogs but you would never know it - as we couldn't hear, smell or sense other dogs were there. We were glad we tried the Kimpton and would highly recommend their hotels.

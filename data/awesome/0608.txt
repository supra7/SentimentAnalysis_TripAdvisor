This is perhaps my fourth stay at this lovely place. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Seattle. In fact, we delayed our vacation by one week, just to stay at Inn at the Market. I am very particular, and appreciate most the quality staff, who go out of there way to make you feel comfortable. Also, the Temperpedic beds and high thread count sheets, sleep well, in ideal locale.

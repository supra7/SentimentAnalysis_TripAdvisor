We selected this hotel based upon location and views on Tripadvisor. This is a great hotel with a terrific location within walking distance to many of the downtown highlights and great restaurants. We had a superior room which was like a small suite with a separate room with a tv and couch. We especially liked the kitchenette with a frig, microwave, plates and silverware-very nice touch along with the Nespresso-type coffee maker. The design of the room is very contemporary with a clean look. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a European type shower with the rain shower head. Great shower with terrific pressure. Had 4 terrific nights slip in the bed which is unusual for me. I'd recommend this property to anyone staying in Montreal. The staff provided excellent customer service. Excellent attention to detail at this hotel. The parking fee was $18.00 a day so figure that into the cost if you are staying there with a car.

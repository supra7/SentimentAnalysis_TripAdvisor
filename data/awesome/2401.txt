Just returning from a quick road trip that took our family through Seattle. We spent one night at the Seattle downtown Westin. This hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The room was clean and the beds are really comfortable. Downside is the cost to park at the hotel, but that's pretty much unavoidable in any big city and Internet is not free.

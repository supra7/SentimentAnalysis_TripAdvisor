More Then Expected. After reading the other reviews for this property, I was a bit cautious. Reading some of the problems previous guests have had, had me a bit concerned.I was amazed by the turn around in service. The front desk staff was very attentive to all of my requests. The front dsesk agent micheal was very pleasent to deal with. He made my wife and myself feel as if we were at home. The new showerheads were a great blessing, as were the comfortable beds.Thank you for a great stay.

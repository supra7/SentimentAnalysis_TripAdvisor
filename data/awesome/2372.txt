This is a higher end hotel with excellent service and accommodations. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. My room was clean and in excellent condition. The work out facility is top notch with the latest models of fitness equipment. The location is walkable to almost any well-known Seattle attraction. I would absolutely bring my family back here for a weekend get a way vacation.

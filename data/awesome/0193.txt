I've stayed with Kimpton before and we thought that we'd try something new and stay at Monaco. I go down with my friend and we go for a girls weekend of shopping. This time we wanted to shop, photograph and enjoy the city. The staff at Kimpton are very friendly and informative. The staff are great, the room was comfy and the bed was really comfortable. The room was clean and at night there were chocolates on our beds. The restaurant was also very good value and we enjoyed the south western flare. When we missed morning coffee, a coffee maker was sent up very quickly. The staff were very responsive to needs. We enjoyed great, warm hospitality and friendly customer service. The location is great for starbucks and restaurants, shopping and Pike Market. My congratulations to the staff and Management at Kimpton...it's a good standard and good value for $. Also enjoyed the glass of wine at 5pm in the lobby...nice touch!!!

I have stayed here on a few occasions the right before I fly out of SeaTac. They have great packages where you can park your car for a period of time while you are traveling. I have had good experiences with that package and feel my car is safe while I am gone. The rooms are very nice, quiet and comfortable. The staff is friendly. The shuttle to and from the airport is nice and runs every 20 minutes or so. I will stay here again and again.

This is a very good hotel, for the price. The rooms are very clean, and have TV, Iron with ironing board, internet access, coffee maker, hair dryer and bathroom. The rooms are a little small, but ample enough for the purpose (and the price!). There is a 27" TV that has some cable channels. The service was excellent, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Every morning there was even a complimentary Seattle Times newspaper on the door. It is a great hotel, very well located, at a really good price for downtown Seattle. The only bad detail, is that the walls are a little bit thin, as a result sometimes it is possible to hear your neighbors. For the price, this place is very hard to beat. Great location, friendly and helpful staff and clean, comfortable rooms. I highly recommend it, for the budget oriented traveler. Do not expect the Ritz, but this hotel is an excellent choice for the price.

Wonderful is the word for Secrets Maroma Beach, the staff,rooms, food, beach, can't see how anyone could complain about this place. All the staff were so good just a special thanks to David our concierge (block 14) and to Darwin who looked after us so well at Oceana and World Cafe. Yes the mosquitos were a bit of a nuisance (the repellant we brought from the UK did'nt seem to work so good) and Hurricane Rina decided to make an appearance in our last few days. This is nature and there is not a lot we humans can do about it however the staff were excellent and we were looked after so well. Hope to return in the near future.

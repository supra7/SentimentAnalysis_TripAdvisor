This hotel is in a great location. Everything you need is within walking distance - shopping, Pike Market, even the "duck" tour. During my visit to Seattle I had a list of specialty stores I needed to visit and the hotel concierge was excellent in giving me directions and even showing me what mode of transporation were available to that location (buslines etc). They never made you feel rushed and answered every question with interest and care. They even arranged FREE transportation to a wonderful restaurant for dinner for all of my party. All in all the Westin experience was wonderful.

We spent one night at the Roosevelt Hotel in early August. The Roosevelt is a historic hotel in downtown Seattle close to just about everything. We were in town for a baseball game and walked to Safeco Field from the Hotel. Room was large and very clean, nice bathroom. Sevice at the hotel was very good, staff very friendly and helpful. Next year when we travel to Seattle we will spend more time at this hotel. If you are looking for a nice hotel dowtown seattle with a good rate try the Roosevelt.

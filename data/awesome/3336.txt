This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel (the last time was in 2009). Again for the money it was excellent. On this occasion I stayed for 3 nights. my only hiccup was the shuttle bus took 2 phonecalls and a 40 minute wait to pick me up when I arrived. However the recptionist apologised as soon as I arrived at the hotel. The buffet breakfast seems to have been expanded and included - pastries, cereal, yogurt, eggs and sausages. They still provide a picnic breakfast if you check out early. The airport shuttle bus is now made avaialble to guests to ferry you to the light rail link that connects the airport to the city. This is a great improvement on the hotel bus I used last time and makes travelling into the city very cheap. The train station is only a 15minute walk if you inclined to excercise. The room was clean and I found the hotel very quiet. That may be becuase I always travel with and use earplugs. This time I also used a couple of the local restuarants for evening meals and was very pleased with them. (One an American Diner and one a Thai). As a single female traveller I would definetly recommend this hotel and would happily stay there again.

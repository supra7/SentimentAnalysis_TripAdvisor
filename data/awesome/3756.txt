Stayed for 5 nights in November, if only we had stayed longer! Heaven on earth, do not hesitate just book it. We live in Australia and to travel so far we wanted something amazing, after many, many hours research we selected Secrets. Beyond our expectations - we have worked 15 years between us in 5 star hotels and know quality when we see it. Many dining options, beautiful rooms, incredible service. Stunning beach. Worth every cent and we can't wait to save up and go again.

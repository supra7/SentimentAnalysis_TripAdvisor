We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and found it to be ideal place to stay in. The location of the hotel is in the heart of city center close to Shopping Areas & Malls, Convention Center, host of restaurants, etc. The monorail station which is used to go over to space needle, Music Project, etc is just across the street. The waterfront area is about a mile from the hotel. The taxi stand too is just across the street and is available 24 Hrs a day as in our case we had to take a taxi to the airport at 4 AM and we did not have any problem in finding one. The room we stayed was of reasonable size with twin beds, and the view of the Space Needle from the room was really fantastic as the window was of full size of the wall. It had all basic amenities including coffee maker with Starbucks filter coffee. The bed and pillows (5 each) were very comfortable. The bathroom was also of reasonable size and had spa shower in it. Free Wi-Fi is available only in the hotel lobby. The hotel is bit over priced for Seattle. I would certainly stay at this hotel for its location if I visit Seattle again.

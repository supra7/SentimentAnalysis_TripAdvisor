It says Low Rates but very good and nice hotel. Very friendly staff, Yasmine Thanks for all your help and patience too. If you visit this hotel you'll enjoy Chuck's hyper activity, specially your kids, he'll encourage them to run races with him amohg other activities, so it's a very family environment. Two Thumbs Up!!!

This hotel is wonderful. The staff is incredibly, incredibly kind. It's quiet, got a funky-cool decor, and the location can't be beat. It's got great proximity to public transportation, but is a few blocks away from the huge convention center/hotels...a great bonus when you're travelling for a conference and don't want to spend every waking moment with other conference folks. I could not recommend this hotel enough.

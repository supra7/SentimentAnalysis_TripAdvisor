Stayed in Maroma as part of our honeymoon...when you arrive you are greeted with "Welcome Home, Welcome to Paradise".This is so true.Room wise, we stayed in a ocean view room for the first few nights...lovely. we then decided to upgrade to the preferred club and had a swim out room. This means we had a private pool just on the ocean. It was well worth the money for the upgrade. Food and drink wise, amazing. Every single thing we ate and drank was wonderful. All restaurants were fab, the italian and esp the asian was unreal. Room service always good too. You will have an amazing time if you choose to come here. Adult only resort so no noise around on beach or at night. Make sure to put suncream on EVEN IN SHADE.. Thank you Maroma, will definitely be back in the future..

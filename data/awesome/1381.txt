4 of us went to Seattle for a girl's overnight and we could not have been more pleased with the Renaissance. Tonja was very helpful and friendly and got us in adjoining rooms on an upper level floor. Hotel is located in the business area, but the free bus took us just about everywhere we wanted. The restaurant on the 26th floor was a great place to sit and relax during happy hour, The view of the Space Needle and Christmas lights was gorgeous. We discovered a new wine, the food was good and the service very friendly. We could see the highway from our room, but heard nothing all night because of the white noise from a fan in the room. The pool and whirlpool were nice. Everyone in the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The beds were firm as others have said, but not overly so. The bedding was very comfortable; empty refrigerator in the room was appreciated; the showers were lovely; Aveda products were nice. We had a fabulous stay at the Renaissance and would definitely stay there again.

My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento the night before leaving on and after returning from a cruise. So we got to see the hotel on a Friday and Saturday night a week apart. The staff was wonderful. When we arrived, they got our name from the luggage tags and were already getting us checked in before we even came in the hotel. The concierge was helpful in arranging scheduling the complementary town car service to the pier and area restaurants for us, as well as the dock for our cruise departure. They also picked us up when we returned. The hotel restaurant was good, though not exceptional. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and room service the other. Service was friendly. We were subject to a Sweet 16 party our 1st night in the hotel. We complained about the noise and when we returned for our 2nd night the next weekend, we were upgraded. We appreciated the gesture, however that weekend, a Bat Mitzvah was taking place. Also a very noisy occasion. So 2 young ladies enjoyed their big nights, while we did not. The hotel is lovely. The staff exceptional. Street noise is not a problem. Parties on the 7th floor - big problem. Great location - close enough to everything without being too close. The complementry car service is a big plus.

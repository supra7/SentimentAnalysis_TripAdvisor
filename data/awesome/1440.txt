We booked this hotel for our two night pre-cruise stay. It was definately the right choice. Location was wonderful, really close to all the downtown attractions .... Pike Place Market, Great Resturaunts, Water Front Area & Shopping. We stayed on executive level (25th floor) which gave us breakfast vouchers for both mornings. The vouchers are good for complimentary buffet or a value of $14.95 to order off the menu. Buffet is on the top floor with a outstanding view of Seattle & Cruise terminals! Staff was excellent. We used the hotel concerierge to book a few tours & dining arrangements. All recommendations were spot on GREAT! We were even surprised with a complimentary appeitizer one night at dinner from the concerierge!!! Room was beautiful & beds were comfortable! Everyone states how small the bathrooms are (????) It was not that small. We found everything to be satisfactory. Turn down service every night with two free bottles of water and a free news paper in the morning! Staff was around every corner wanting to help you in any way possible! When we are back in Seattle I will make it a point to stay here again! AAA+

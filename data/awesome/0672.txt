We arrived at Seattle Airport and chose to be met by the hotels town car service and were pleased to see the driver waiting for us right outside the terminal building, no fuss, no waiting. He told us all about the buildings and areas we were driving past on the way to the Inn at the Market, this took around 20 minuets. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the bell boy who very kindly took our heavy bags from the boot of the car to reception as soon as we pulled up. At reception it was smiles all round as we were given room 606, water view. Well worth the small extra charge. Front desk, in particular Noelle, were fantastic. Excellent local knowledge and helpful tips on eats and drinks. Lots and lots to do and see within walking distance. On the doorstep of Pike Market. We researched this place fully before booking and can truly say it is excellent. We had a hold up booking at our end because of the British Airways threatened strike action and communication between us and the hotel via email was superb, they were understanding, helpful and eased the stress and worries of our travel plans by holding our beautiful room without further question. We loved our short stay at Inn at the Market, would recommend it and also be staying with them again. On a final note, thank you Noelle and Eric!

We have been to the other two secrets, capri- we didn't like and silversands- which was nice, and figured we'd try maroma. Maroma is the most expensive of the three but is the nicest. The resort is very clean, staff is super friendly, and the ocean is to die for. We have never seen a more beautiful ocean ever. No wonder it is rated second in the world. We upgraded to an ocean view, which was worth every penny for the view. We actually used their photographer to have a few photos taken because the beach so amazing. The pools are heated and you can see the ocean from the pool. awesome. The food here is top notch at all meals and even the room service. Of course it is nice to have great drinks too. The only thing is that sometimes to get alcohol for your room is a bit tricky. If you tip the right people it can be done. Overall, we'd go back in a second and highly recommend this resort. Overall

We have travelled to Seattle several times and have found that this is the only place to stay for us. It overlooks Pikes Market and the bay - wonderful views from the water front rooms and the outside deck which is available to all guests. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. The Inn is at the center of the waterfront activity, yet it is a quiet, relaxing place to stay. The Inn's restaurants are great and there are several fine restaurants within a very short walking distance. It is also an easy walk to the downtown shopping area and the el which take you to the Space needle.

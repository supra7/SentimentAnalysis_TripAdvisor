First off, it is not a 4 or 5 star hotel. So, people that stay here and feel disappointed should realize that it's a 3 star hotel. If you want perfection, stay at the Doubletree down the street and pay a lot more money!! I love the fact that it is so close to the airport and they have a excellent airport transportation that is free. My room was very clean with a nice bed, with four pillows. FREE wi-fi service and FREE breakfast. Clean bathroom with nice shower. And, in room coffee maker. Good cable TV too. It's nothing fancy, but a good value for the money. The front desk staff is very friendly and patient. Will stay here again.

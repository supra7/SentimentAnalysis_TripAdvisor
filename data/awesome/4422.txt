Everything about this place was absolutely perfect. I've never dont an all-inclusive before, and I highly recommend it. It's so nice to not have to worry about anything. The rooms were so clean and the beds were so soft. The staff always greeted you with a smile and made you feel really comfortable. The guests were all really nice too. The only negative thing would that when we first got there, we were put in a room right above the Desires club which is so loud and has really bad karaoke that you can hear quite clearly in your room (why did they build rooms above the only dance club in the resort?!?) They changed our rooms the next morning and it was a dream ride after that. The room service is so nice! Take advantage of the room service - the food is extremely good. Also, partake in the activities they have on the schedule - they are fun! The food, the service, the ocean, the drinks, the people - it was all amazing. I cannot wait to go back.

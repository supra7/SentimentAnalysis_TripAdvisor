We originally stayed at The Roosevelt in February as a package deal (hotel, theatre show, dinner). We, along with other couples, purchased this for Valentine's weekend. The hotel and dinner were great, however, the wrong tickets were printed for the show at the Paramount. At first it looked like it was going to be a disaster, but the Paramount remedied the problem; however, the seats we received were not comparable as the ones we should have had. Anyway, long story short, the Roosevelt Hotel and Broadway Across America went above and beyond what we ever imagined. They gave us complimentary tickets to another Broadway production at a later date and a complimentary room (upgrade) at The Roosevelt on the night of the show. We will definitely recommend the Roosevelt to our friends and family.

This hotel is amazing. The staff is so friendly. We were able to check into our hotel at 11am instead of 3pm which was amazing because we drove from 7 hours away and were faster than what we had expected. We were in our rooom for about an hour and the front desk called to advise there was a plumbing issue in our room and we had to be moved but that we were going to be upgraded to a larger suite with no extra charge. After they came and helped us move all of our luggage and we were in our new room for a couple of hours, they sent up a tray of fruit and cheeses. Absolutely amazing. The hotel rooms are beautiful. The rain shower and bath are amazing. The outside hot tub is breathtaking and the pool is beautiful too. The atmosphere is just unbelievable and I can't say enough about this hotel!!!

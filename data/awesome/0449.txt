This will be short as I watch the sunset into the water and mountains from the 5th floor deck, While sipping a glass of red wine. I believe this is our 3rd or 4th stay, and will always be our choice while visiting Seattle. Couldn't ask for a better location - to my right is the sunset, the neon PUBLIC MARKET sign just to my left. Smell a meal being prepared down below. Rooms are very tasteful, beds quite comfortable. Service from the staff has been consistently good during each visit. I appreciate that they are friendly, personable and helpful. Our partial water view is very partial, but I may be splitting hairs. Great place to stay. Now, back to that sunset...

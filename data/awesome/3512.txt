We went to this hotel 3 days for a business meeting, the hotel is super clean , the staff amazing good. This hotel is very well located, right downtown montreal, next to the bell center and few steps from crescent street. My suite was a very nice size, two lcd tv , a very nice view of montreal. The Bathroom is big enough with a very nice separate shower. I have to say that it is a little pricy but it worth every penny. I consider this place like one of the best of montreal. Will recommend.

The Mayflower Hotel exceeded our expectations and was first class service all the way! It was a nice touch and a great surprise to receive an anniversary card and chocolates sent by the staff. The room was great - very spacious and with 2 bathrooms. We loved it all - enjoyed dinner at the Andeluca - delicious food and wonderful service. We have bragged about the Mayflower to all of our friends and relatives! Wish we could have stayed longer - just a short walk to Pike's Market.

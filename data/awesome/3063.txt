We are locals and like to head out for a night on the town, in Seattle, on occasion. I have stayed at several of the downtown Seattle hotels, and decided to try Hotel Max for the first time, since it had a "Winter Special" going on. Free Parking and Wi-Fi, great deal! I had read reviews about it being small, but it was perfect for us! Upon arrival, the guy at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very "Seattle" with art galore! When we got to our room, it smelled and looked very clean. The view was not the greatest, but you could still see parts of the streets of Seattle. From our room, you could see directly through the windows of the adjacent rooms, but we just shut the blinds on that side of the room and were fine. Very comfortable bed, Aveda products, very nice! We will definitely be back when they are running specials. I also highly recommend the Redfin restaurant attached to the hotel. The best sushi I've had in awhile.

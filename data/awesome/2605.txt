We were in town for a football game over Labor Day weekend & lucked into getting a reservation. The staff behind the counter were all quite young but friendly & full of helpful information. That includes good places to eat, directions & just friendly conversation. We had the king room where, instead of going downstairs to eat the free breakfast, we ordered from the doorhang menu & it was delivered to our room at no extra charge. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, free fast internet & free parking. It's not a large parking lot by any means but everyone we met up with were able to find a spot. We would definitely stay there again.

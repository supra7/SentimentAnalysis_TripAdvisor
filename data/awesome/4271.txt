This was our first experience with an all-inclusive. They treated us like VIP's. The service was excellent. Anything you wanted, it was there within minutes. Our accomodations were beautiful and convenient to the bars and restaurants. The beach is beautiful, and the ocean is clear and warm. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The extra things they did to help us celebrate were wonderful. Cleanliness is very important to us and Secrets Maroma is spotless! Our stay was memorable and we will be back, soon I hope.

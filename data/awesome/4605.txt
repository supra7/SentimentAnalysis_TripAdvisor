This place was fabulous, the resort is only 2 years old so everything is still very nice and new. The service was great and the beach is beautiful. We didn't realize when we booked it that they have activities scheduled throughout the day you can participate in like water volleyball, beach volleyball, tequila tasting, archery etc. We loved the activities and they had a different variety show each night you could watch as well, which was very entertaining. The best part were the fish in the ocean, the water was so clear and we took some bread to the ocean to feed the fish and they would swim all around you it was great. I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for an upscale place to get away to.

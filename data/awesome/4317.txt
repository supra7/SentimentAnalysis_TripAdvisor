There is not to much to write because I agree with the rest of the reviews. I cannot imagine what anyone could find to complain about, The hotel was amazing. The people wait on all your needs. They are great, they actually look happy to be doing their job. Compared to other places, the DR and Jamaica. The staff here is the top of the line. There is no bad room. It is not a huge property where you have to walk miles to get to the beach. I personally stayed at the beach our entire trip because I felt that the pool was too crowed but, thats were alot of the action was. The beach was nothing like i have ever seen before. Clean and so soft. If you walk down opposite the other resorts it is sad to see the garbage everywhere. Don't be alarmed because the beach waiters are constantly cleaning up and picking all the garbage off the sand. It is also great that you do not have to make reservations at the restaurants. There could be a wait but, nothing to bad. This place is very clean as well as the staff. Actually on our last day I tipped Elayne who would make my daily breakfast crepes. My husband watched her put the money away and then wash her hands before preparing his. Now I work in the food service industry as well and know the most would not do that. Again best resort ever. Tip the staff they deserve it. Stay as long as possible. Enjoy your trip!!!

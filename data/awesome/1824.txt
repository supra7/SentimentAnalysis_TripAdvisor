Boutique hotels are the way to go in Seattle, and The Andra is great. I loved the location - easy walking to downtown attractions and shopping, and also an easy walk to the rail station for getting back to the airport. We checked in late and tired, and got surprised with an upgrade to a huge suite. Heavenly!

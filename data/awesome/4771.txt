We just returned this Am from a week of absolute paradise!! I love this resort...this is our 2nd time returning to SMB, and they did not disappointed. When we got there on Monday, it was raining but the Resort does an amazing job of indoor activities. (grease was great) I will say the service at this resort is by far the best in Rivera Maya! Big shout out to Paulo, Geraldo and Chef Rendon!! Chef Rendon personally invited us (group of 6) to El Patio where he had prepared special dinner for us!! It was amazing. Also room service is great...Club sandwich is great, it has fried egg on it and it is good!!! Our rooms were also clean and we had swim out room...wonderful. Even though it rained, it still was nice to get in swim out and hang out. I will say....if you are considering Preferred, save your money...the whole resort is preferred!!! Top-shelf liquor is available...you just have to ask. Club Desires (AKA DESIREES) is sooo fun! It is what you make it.....if you sit around acting all stuck up like you are better than everyone you will not have fun! Enjoy, you are on vacation!! We always made our own party...at Club Desire, the pool, playing pool volleyball (shout out to Group from Groesbeck) The Beach is amazing.....nothing more to say about that ...it is perfect They walk around the pool serving food all day, I am sure we have all gain 10 lbs, it it was sooooo worth it!! I would recommend this resort a 1000 times over!! Can't wait for next year!!

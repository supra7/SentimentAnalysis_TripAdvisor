This 1929 remodled hotel is a great stop in Seatlle. I enjoyed my stay and will be back. If you like smaller botique hotels in the heart of everthing you'll enjoy this one. It is close to the convention hall, theater great shopping and eateries. A short walk to the Pike Street market and ferries. I had a room with a comfortable king bed and separate sitting area. The lobby is small and comfortable place to enjoy a Starbuck from one of the many in the area. If you like big bathrooms this is not your place they have kept the 20's size and feel although updated tastefully. Von's Bar & Resturant is next door serving up great martinis, manhattans and 25 plus beers to locals and visitors. I did not eat at the resturant but it was the menu looked great and prices seamed a good value. An added feature was the airport shuttle drops off and picks up across the street for $11.00.

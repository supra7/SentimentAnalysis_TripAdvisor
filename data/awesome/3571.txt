My husband and I spent our first wedding anniversary at Hotel Le Crystal and it was amazing! Let me just tell you, this hotel is GORGEOUS! The rooms are fabulous, modern and spacious. The location of the hotel is steps away from fantastic shopping, excellent restaurants and the Bell Center. The staff are incredible, every single person working in that hotel provided top notch service! I even loved the line of bath & body products they had in the room (Molton Brown from London). The attention to detail in this hotel is evident everywhere you look. Bond & Alex Ottawa, ON

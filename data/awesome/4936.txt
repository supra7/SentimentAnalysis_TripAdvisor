My husband and I absolutely loved this resort! We were extremely impressed by all the resort had to offer. The staff were incredibily wonderful and ALWAYS greeted us with a smile. The food at the restaurants were very delicious. We would highly recommend this resort for couples that are looking for an amazing place to relax.

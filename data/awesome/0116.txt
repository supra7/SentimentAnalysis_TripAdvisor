We spent 4 days at the Monaco Seattle Hotel, and loved it. It was our 25th anniversary and we wanted to spend a few days in Seattle before our cruise left for Alaska. A trip we have dreamed about for 25 years. I booked the hotel through Priceline and got a really good rate. Once I saw that it was a Kimpton Hotel I went online and joined the Kimpton Frequent Traveler club. I let them know that it was a special occassion for us. They automatically upgraded our room and have Champagne and a fruit basket delivered upon our arrival. It was magical. I have traveled a lot for business, but have never experienced a hotel where every single staff person was so hospitable. I don't know how they do it. They are very welcoming. The bathroom was honestly the cleanest I have ever seen. And, the staff were flawless. We were within walking distance to everything in the city, including the Pkie Place Market. Lots of fun. Make sure to visit the Pier 55 and have a stroll along the waterfront. I would definately stay there again, and I will certainly look for a Kimpton Hotel for my next trip.

Just got back from my honeymoon and wanted to write one of these reviews to help others as they have been so helpful to me. The Pros - literally every last thing about this place. I love All-Inclusive yet I grew up on four star/diamond resorts traveling with family and have been everywhere......this place is absolutely amazing. Anyone who could have anything negative to say about it either a.) didn't research enough (ie the mosquito problem and how to avoid that) or b.) are way too stuck up and feel "lowered to choosing an all inclusive" and I've met and read about them all a lot. The beach is what made the decision for me as I watched the travel channel to see it rated top beaches of the world. The food is so good and there is always so much of it that maybe my one negative comment would be my need to hit the gym extra hard now. The Cons - I sat on the plane my entire 4 hour trip home trying to think if there was anything I could even consider a con......nope. Oh wait, I take that back....I really wish the hotel had a contract with the group that distributes Sol and Dos Equis rather than Corona and Modelo. I can't really comment about the pool because I never stepped foot in it. I could not even imagine going to this beautiful place on that amazing beach and actually go in a pool. I can do that here. I can't really comment on the nightlife either as the amount of food and drinks consumed all day I don't think I made it past 9:30 any night after dinner lol Advice - avoid the swim outs and you decrease mosquito risk by a hundred-fold. I didn't spray any bug spray whatsoever and I never got bitten once. and PLEASE tip the servers. It boggled the mind to see how many people don't even throw a dollar their way and I have never seen harder working, friendly, pleasant people at a resort in my life. That is all......carry on.......and book it!!!

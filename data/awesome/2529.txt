We stayed at the Westin for a night before and a night after our Alaska cruise with Princess. The hotel was in a good location very close to attractions. The space needle, and Pike Place Market were only several blocks away. We were on the 33rd floor and had a great view of the harbor. The beds were very comfortable and service very good. As a plus - if you don't want to spend a bundle on restraurants there is a McDonalds right across the street for a low cost meal.

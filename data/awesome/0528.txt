Our day was perfect, and due to an unexpected family friend at your hotel named Wade we arrived to a fabulous room with a huge deck overlooking the market with a full water view unlike another found in Seattle. We would recomend this hotel to everyone who is looking for the best! Great location, best Seattle view, excellent service and thoughtfulness. Also, the bed is so comfy, my husband wants me to find out where we can buy one!

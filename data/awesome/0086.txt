We spent three great nights at the Monaco. Location is very good, on 4th Avenue, which puts it a few blocks from Elliott Bay (but then just about everything is a few blocks off the bay, since the freeway viaduct runs along the bay. The best part was the staff. They were excellent in all respects - well trained, knowledgeable and helpful. Room 501 was large and comfortable, although it had a "view" of the building across the alley. Air conditioning was a bit weak, but that was fixed by having a fan sent up. (We found the return air filter needed to be changed.) Evening wine and hors d'oeuvres were good. Restaurant was very good. We'll be back.

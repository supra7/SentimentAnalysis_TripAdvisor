We had a great time at this hotel. We let them know it was our anniversary and they upgraded us to a suite. After an embarrassing check in all went well. I am used to booking hotels through other websites which usually just charges you for the trip upfront, and you go to the front desk owing nothing. I however, booked this trip on Montreal's tourism website, and only had a reservation. When I got to the front desk they wanted to charge my card 3x the amount of the hotel room. I was not prepared for that, and had to move some funds around to be able to stay here. Like I said, very embarrassing. But the girl was sweet and nice, and they took care of it. Oh and if you go in the winter time, do not pay for parking in the street or in a lot. There is tons of free parking!

Best hotel location in Seattle! If you're looking for a place just to sleep that's close proximity and has all amenities in the neighborhood, stay here. It's definitely close to Pike Place Market (5min walk), close to all bus stations, nearby bars and most importantly good eats. We basically walked everywhere we needed to go and took the bus if we were too tired. Their bus system is real easy to use. I'm an instant fan and have been raving about this place since.

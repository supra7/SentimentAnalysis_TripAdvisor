For us we thought the service of this resort is what sets it apart. From the time we arrived everything was done for us with a smile and always ended with "it's my pleasure" So much has already ready been said about this fantastic resort so I offer you a very recent photo album of it for your consideration (link below) We did think the swim out room was definitely worth the upgrade and the couples massage was wonderful. We will return! Photo Album http://www.surfnorthwest.com/secrets/index.htm

It was a very nice getaway for one evening. I loved the decor, the bed, and the colorful pillow accent. I also like the long window sitting area. Best use of SPG Starpoint in Seattle, especially when the Westin and Sheraton are both at 10,000 point level. Having stayed at all three, I would highly recommend W above the other two. I would also recommend using the parking structure on the same block, at the corner of 5th and Seneca (instead of valet), if you want to save some money. The building location doesn't seem to allow for any water view, but it was a fine high-rise view on 22nd floor corner room. The only minor complaint is the low-lighting in the elevator, common with all W. It's a bit uncomfortable to ride up with strangers.

Excellent value. A very warm place to stay. You can sit in the lobby and feel like you are in your own home reading the paper or you can join others in the lounge or restaurant in the hotel. It's quiet at night and the beds are very comfortable. We went to a fantastic Italian restaurant virtually next door where we were greeted and served like part of the family. We walked home from a movie at 12:45am and felt very safe in the area. This is will definitely be our first choice when staying in Downtown Seattle. If this hotel could be mimicked in every other major city in the world for value and comfort every other hotel chain would be out of business.

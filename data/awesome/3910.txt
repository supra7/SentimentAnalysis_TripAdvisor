After reading tons of reviews, I was afraid to make my decision. Upon arrival and after getting used to being in a foreign country for the first time, I realized that the magic feeling wasn't going away. Everything was done perfectly. The big buffet BBQ dinners, the beach, the coffee, top shelf liquor, all the food, the beds were extremely comfortable, showers hot most times, free ocean view upgrade, no timeshare junk whatsoever. It was more than I could ask. I couldn't spend a week in the nearest major center for the price I paid for this trip. The only problem we experienced was being two single guys, this resort was full of couples. Not that we were looking for a crazy party, or to find a hook up, but we were literally the only people here that weren't a couple, so it was a bit awkward at times. No big deal. I'd recommend this to anyone, In a heartbeat.

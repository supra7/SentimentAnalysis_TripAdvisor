I got my room for an incredibly low rate on Priceline so definitely check that out when it comes time to book. The hotel is smack in the city center, near the waterfront, restaurants and shops as well as the light rail and monorail to Seattle Center and about a million trolleys and buses. I spent $2.50 taking the light rail from the airport to Westlake, and then had about a three minute walk to the hotel. Can't get easier than that. The hotel is great - try to ask for a room on the floors that are higher up so you can have a view (my view was of the monorail, though a friend of mine had a gorgeous view of the water and mountains.). They were very accommodating and allowed me to check in early and check out late without any fees, which was awesome. Internet was a bit pricey (about $10/day) but they have this deal where if you deny housekeeping you get a $5 voucher for food and beverages...I spent mine at the cafe downstairs in the north tower, which was delish. The beds were super comfortable...almost TOO comfortable. Everything was very clean. Room service (I got breakfast) was expensive but very good. The pool and fitness center were both excellent. I can't think of anything to complain about...it was THAT good. :) I'd definitely stay again and will without a doubt recommend it to my friends.

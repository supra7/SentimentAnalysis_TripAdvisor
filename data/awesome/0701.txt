Inn at the Market has become our go to place when visiting in Seattle. Because of conference housing requirements we've had to stay at other hotels on other visits and have always missed being at the Inn. The major pluses are the 1) incredible courtesy and helpfulness of the staff 2) the location so close to the Public Market and 3) the general ambiance of relaxed elegance. Typically Pacific Northwest in its decor, the best feature is the rooftop deck that overlooks Elliot Bay. From there, you can sip wine, watch the sunset and the ferries coming in. We stayed at the Inn as "bookends" on our trip to the San Juan Islands and were lucky enough to be upgraded in room type on both ends of our journey. The free wireless worked well and the self-serve business center had a computer to use to print out boarding passes for our flight.

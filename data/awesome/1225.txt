This hotel is in a great location...The staff all did a great job with wonderful attitudges. However, Craig (the rsv mgr) resolved an issue we had with our booking and we left with a very pleasant experience. This is an old hotel, though impeccable, therefore the rooms are small. The most difficult is in the bathroom with very little shelving to put personal items.

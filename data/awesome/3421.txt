Excellent location close to the Grand Bazaar and mosques. Staff were happy to assist with things such as transport and directions. Hotel management was very friendly and also happy to help. Breakfast was beautiful and was very impressed that it was included in such a low price for a very classy hotel. Additionally, the room was very clean and decorated modern. It was a great experience.

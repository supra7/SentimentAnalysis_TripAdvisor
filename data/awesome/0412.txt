Our family stayed in three rooms over the Thanksgiving Weekend and everyone had a great experience! Our harbor-view suite was beautifully appointed and became the perfect meeting place before and after excursions. The activity at the market and in the harbor was as much fun to watch as the football games on TV. The central location made it the perfect spot for an activity packed weekend!

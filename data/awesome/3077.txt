This was my second stay at Hotel Max. I found out about it last year when a wedding party stayed there. This time, I brought my six-year-old son. Traveling alone with a child can be hard if they don't help with doors or if they're just not welcoming. Even though this hotel is hip and artsy, everyone there was friendly toward my son and it was easy to be there with him. There's no attitude. You have to hide the vibrator and candy when you first get in the room! It's very easy to walk from there to the market and aquarium. The monorail to the Space Needle is a couple blocks up. There are tons of places to eat and you can bring snacks back from the market to your room. I'm an artist so I like the feel of the place. It's probably best for someone with that mind set. There's a nude painting in the lobby so if you're very conservative, you won't like to bring kids there. Room is very comfortable. Feels small but luxurious.

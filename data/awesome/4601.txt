Words cannot explain what this hotel really is...We were there for our honeymoon and the experience was unforgettable. The hotel is beautiful, secluded which gives you the sense of even more privacy and truly makes you feel you are in paradise, the service and quality of staff that attended our EVERY SINGLE need, the variety of restaurants and quality of food was superb, the overall atmosphere of the hotel gives you a total sense of relaxation, the room was amazing, the entertainment for the guests, when you walk into the Spa you really feel you're out of this world. I have to mention the Beach: I grew up in an island and we live in Miami, so we've been in a lot of nice beaches and white sands; Maroma beach simply took our breath away, the white sand, the clear water with beautiful fishes swimming around you...you MUST visit this place; and be ready for a VERY romantic place! We will be back very soon!

Mayflower Park in downtown Seattle is a historic, elegant, charming place with all the comforts of a modern hotel. The service was exceptional; we were greeted by a friendly staff member every time we stepped foot inside. Our deluxe queen suite was large yet cozy with fantastic views of downtown Seattle including the Space Needle. The hotel also happens to be in walking distance to a plethora of fun things to do and see; Pike Place Market, shopping, restaurants; it could not have been more perfect! It was a treat to stay in such a bustling, lively exciting part of this city, especially for my first visit. I really got a feel for the place. P.S. The hotel bar, Olivers, is also fantastic!

My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma for one week 11-18 Nov 2011. This was our third time to Mexico having stayed at the Royal in Playa Del Carmen and Excellence Mayan Riviera. This resort has easily become our favourite resort and the main reason is the high level of service we received. The room was very nicely appointed with a comfortable bed, stocked fridge and a lovely ocean view. We were in building 24 which was fairly central to everything, an ocean view on the fourth floor with elevators. The food was excellent, we enjoyed all of the a la carte's as well as the breakfast buffet. At the buffet the staff were very attentive and kind, thank you Edgar for your attentiveness and Manuel for your excellent service, you made our mornings. The pools were nice and even though the resort was busy we could always find a chair. Service around the pool was excellent. Towels were plentiful, available all around the resort with bins to drop them in when you are done, no hassles. The beach is beautiful and the service there also excellent. Drinks were varied and tasted great. We had room service a few times, they brought all the extras you needed and were timely. Loved the coconut ice cream! We tip when we travel regularly but no-one ever seemed to expect it, they truly wanted to give you the best service possible. I had some spa treatments which are expensive but the spa is beautiful and professional. This resort is easy to navigate for people with disabilities. It was an amazing week and we would have liked to stay longer.....we definitely plan to be back to this amazing resort.

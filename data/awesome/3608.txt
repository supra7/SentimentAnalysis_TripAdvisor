What an AMAZING hotel! You can not beat this for price and quality. Fresh sheets and towels every day upon our return from the parks (along with hoovered floors and changed bins). My partner and I were looking forward to meeting Chuck the manager after hearing so many great things about him via here and we were not disappointed. A friendly guy who seemed to take a genuine interest in his customers. The night times were great, very quiet and their pillows actually cured the bad neck I had been suffering with for the past few months! The pool area was pleasant and always very quiet, we were the only people there on the three occasions we chose to swim and sunbathe. I was reluctant to share this because I'm sure with all these brilliant reviews, Destiny Palms may well consider hiking up their prices! If we ever visit Florida again, we will return. Highly recommended.

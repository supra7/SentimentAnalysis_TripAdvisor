My husband & I stayed @ Secrets Maroma Jan. 22nd-Jan.29th celebrating our 10yr anniversary. We stayed @ Moon Palace 10yrs ago and love the Riviera Maya. Secrets Maroma was PERFECT. The entertainment staff, beach, and restaurants exceeded our expectations. I can't say enough for the hard working staff that made our stay so special. We were upgraded for free to a swimout room which was a nice touch. (Although we didn't use it...looked very pretty @ night with the blue lights.) We will definitely be returning to this resort & have no intentions of looking @ anything else. You will love this place and the service is exceptional!!!

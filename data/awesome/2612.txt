The University Inn came very highly recommended, we were delighted with the comfortable room (including a stunning view of Mt. Ranier!), the friendly and courteous service, the convenient access to the University of Washington, the free shuttle service, the generous and beautifully prepared and served breakfasts and afternoon teas, the close proximity to many fun and funky restaurants, and the convenient and safe parking. Our son is applying to graduate school at UW, we anticipate many happy returns to this area and will always stay at the University Inn.

We went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon. We both had a lot of fun and met some great couples like us. The food and drink was outstanding and the service was impeccable. The concierges made a mistake on Sunday and we almost didn't get to eat at the restaurant we wanted, but the concierge for our building made it right and we were very grateful for that. I do have one complaint- I left three articles of clothing there. I JUST got them back on the 22nd, over a full month after we left, and I had to pay the exorbitant freight to get them back here. Other than that, the trip was perfect!

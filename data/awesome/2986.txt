This hotel was great from start to finish! We were greeted promptly at our vehicle and helped to unload our bags and the valet takes your car for overnight parking if you'd like ($30, seems standard for hotels in Seattle). We were allowed to check in early and were very impressed with how stylish the lobby and halls were. We stayed in the corner room on the 7th floor (707) which had an excellent view of the Space Needle. The bed was comfortable and the pillows are unmatched by any hotel I've ever stayed in. The rooms were stylish and functional, although the bathroom was a little small. We forgot a pair of shoes in the car that had been valet parked by the hotel and a member of the staff offered to retrieve them for us, we truly appreciated the service we received. There is a delicious sushi restaurant attached to the hotel which we highly recommend, I think it was called "Red Fin?" The location is amazing, only a few blocks from Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and what was #1 on our trip, QWEST Field. 2 thumbs up for Hotel Max!

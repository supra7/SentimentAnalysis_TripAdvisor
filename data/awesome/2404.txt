I was a little concerned soon after I booked this hotel through Hotwire as I read a number of negative reviews online afterwards. Those reviews could not be farther from the truth. We stayed at the Westin Seattle for four nights (7/12/11-7/15/11). From the moment we arrived, we experienced the hospitality and excellent service from the management all the way to the housekeeping personnel. This is a busy hotel yet, despite the hosted conventions and the sporadic crowds the room was quiet. We stayed on the north tower facing the Space Needle. The Westin is located within a walking distance from the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP museum, street festivals...) Pike Place Market, and two blocks from Westlake Center from where you can board the Light Rail for a very efficient and cheap 40 min ride to the Sea-Tac airport. The only negative thing about the Westin is the fact it does not have a main restaurant in the premises in case you are exhausted after a long day out and you do not want to go out for dinner. (The Coldwater Bar and Grill at the Westin is not suitable for a late dinner as they close by 9 PM during the week and 9:30 PM on Fridays and Saturdays!). Fortunately, The Icon restaurant is across the street and Tom Douglas' Lola and Dahlia a few blocks away.

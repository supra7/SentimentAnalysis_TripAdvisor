We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights prior to a cruise to Alaska. For one, wish we could have stayed longer in Seattle. Hotel was wonderful - welcoming, warm, clean (!!!), friendly professional staff. This is our first experience with a Kimpton - definitely will be on our list for our next travels if it is as good as the Vintage Park. Not that I really cared, but noticed that the ice machine was not working properly, a guest called the front desk and within 20 minutes someone was repairing the machine. If we return to Seattle, it will be the Vintage Park for us.

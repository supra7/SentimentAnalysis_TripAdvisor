The room was clean. Amenities sufficient. The staff was very friendly/ courteous. And the cost was inexpensive! The general manager Alan was always around, making sure all was ok, and taking time to have pleasant conversation. The ONLY fault I would say is the breakfast hours. I think it ended at 8 or 9 a.m- 10-11 a.m. would seem a little more vacationer - friendly.. :) Overall though- WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!! Would definitely go back and would also recommend to friends!

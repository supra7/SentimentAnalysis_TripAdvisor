I stayed at The Andra for a week in August, arriving on the weekend of the Seafair so the hotel was very busy. I arrived very tired after a 20hr journey from Egypt and was very quickly checked in and shown to my room. I was pleasantly surprised by the spacious room and its cool, retro furnishings. The bed was extremely comfortable and a weeks worth of good sleep was had. The bar at Lola is a great place to hang out and have a few drinks and meet locals, I did not eat there so can not comment on the food. The staff were extremely friendly and professional, and the only slight gripe I have is on one of the days housekeeping instead of changing one of the dirty towels left on the floor just folded it and hang it up again but this was resolved within 5 minutes of me calling housekeeping. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, and will recommend to anyone who visits Seattle.

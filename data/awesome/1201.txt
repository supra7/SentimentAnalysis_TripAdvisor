We booked a delux room for a long weekend getaway in April 2008 but arrived too early in the morning, so they smiled and gave us a corner suite instead! Well furnished, two small rooms, but certainly enough space. The hotel is a heritage building perfectly located between Macy's and Nordstrom's, right next to the monorail, a few blocks from the major theatres and a short walk to Pike Place Market. We only had breakfast in their restaurant, but it was very good. Highly recommended.

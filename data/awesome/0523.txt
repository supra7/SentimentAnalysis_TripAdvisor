DH and i went to Seattle a few weeks ago for a vacation. Since this was a top hotel listing here on Trip Advisor, and close to the market we wanted to stay here. I followed them on Twitter and asked for the Twitter rate, which was great. We booked with them online, and it was all very easy. They also sent us a reminder email with confirmation # a week before, which is always appreciated :) We were very impressed with the location, our room, the roof deck and the employees. The employees were beyond helpful with directions, recommendations and they saved us a lot of time by telling us which buses to take, and the best ways to get to places outside of downtown. when we return to Seattle we will be staying here again. also, the hotel was doing some work during our stay- testing fire alarms, and working on sewer system. they gave us plenty of notice the previous evenings and we were not inconvenienced at all. we really appreciated them letting us know.

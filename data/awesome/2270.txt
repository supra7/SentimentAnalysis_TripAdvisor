I spent a great weekend at the Serrento Hotel in Seattle. After traveling all day across from the east coast, I was met at the door with a smiling face and at the front desk with courtesy a smile and efficiency. The room was clean, comfortable and the bed and all those pillows was a joy. The flat screen television with many channels was a treat as well. It is not a large hotel and getting was easy and the food in the restaurant was fantastic. The staff were pleasant helpful and had a smile on their face that just made even the rainy weather bearable. I highly recommend staying at the Serrento Hotel if you are going to be in Seattle!

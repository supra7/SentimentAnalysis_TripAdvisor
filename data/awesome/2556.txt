We had the most fantastic view! We were in the north tower on the 35th floor. The very large window framed a view of the downtown area complete with Space Needle and the Puget Sound. Our room was newly renovated with an elegant, understated decor. We never had to wait for more than a minute for the elevator. There was a great gift shop in the lobby featuring the work of local artists. The desk staff was great and responded quickly to the two requests I made while there. The location was convenient to everything we wanted to see. I would not hesitate to stay there again and will endeavor to do so!

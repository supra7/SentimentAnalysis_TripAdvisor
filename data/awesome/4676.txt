I had the pleasure to stay one night at Secrets Maroma, and even in that short time period I fell in LOVE with this resort! The property itself is gorgeous, not to mention the most beautiful beach which is always voted one of the top 10 beaches in the world! The service is impecable. I had a touch of tummy problems and the wait staff went above and beyond asking me if they could prepare anything special for me. My traveling companion is allergic to seafood and they went out of there way again to point out the items to avoid and made suggestions for substitutions, etc. The food was excellent! The entertainment staff friendly, the coffee bar rivals Starbucks (only wish they opened around 9am instead of 11am) My friend had a spa treatment and said it was excellent!To me this resort is the best mix of luxury and entertainment. As a travel agent I will continue to recommend this property with good faith that my clients will fall in love with it as much as I did!

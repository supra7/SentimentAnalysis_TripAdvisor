This was my first trip to Seattle and I must say it was absolutely wonderful! The property was very well kept and the staff was exceptional. I arrived the hotel hours before check-in and the front desk was gracious enough to allow me to check-in earlier without asking. My room was better than expected. Beautiful room with a great view of the city and harbor. The bedding is comfortable with plenty of pillows. The bathroom large with many amenities. Very peaceful in the evenings, no loud noises or neighbors. The hotel is centrally located and is within blocks of Pikes Place Market. Close to all major shops and restaurants. The monorail (Sound Transit Link Light Rail) is easy to travel on. If your arriving by plane, save yourself the taxi fare and take the Light Rail from Sea-Tac Airport to downtown Seattle for only $2.50. I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely stay again. Seattle is a wonderful city with very friendly people

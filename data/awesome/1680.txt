We stayed here in August as part of a round the world trip. The hotel is in a great central location and our tour to the Boeing factory left from the lobby. The hotel also has a little shop with souveniers as well as necessities (food and toiletries). Our check in was fast and easy. Our room was very spacious with a mini bar (however it was locked unless you asked for the key) and it was very clean. There was also an iron and ironing board, hair dryer and Starbucks coffee available in the room. Housekeeping will make the beds every day but won't change the linen unless you place a card on the bed. There is free internet available in the lobby, or you can get it in your room for approx $10 for 24 hours. The only minor thing is that the rooms are close together and the doors are noisy when people come and go. However, we would definitely stay here again.

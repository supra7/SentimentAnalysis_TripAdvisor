Was my second stay - and just as nice as the first. Huge rooms, great location, tasteful decor, helpful staff, what more could you ask for? Had a favorite hotel in Boston that is similar, but they got "discovered" and now charge twice what I used to pay!!! So stay elsewhere so that does not happen to the Kimpton!!!!

Visited hotel for use of spa Isba. Staff at reception, massage, and pool area extremely courteous and helpful, especially valet service. Enjoyed a competent massage and facial. Overall very clean and and well kept, situated just steps from Molson center. Only negative is Ester who runs the spa that is rude and even accussed us of not paying for services (even though we had paid earlier in the day). Ester did not even offer an apology after finding the payment.

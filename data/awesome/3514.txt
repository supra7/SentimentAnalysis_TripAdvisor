Although I have stayed at many hotels around the globe, I am very impressed with this hotel. Indeed, we stayed during the November 20th weekend when the hotel was at 100% capacity (big professionnal football and hockey games) and the service and cleanliness of the room were excellent. We had requested a few items before our arrival (crib and bathrobes for the kids) and everything was delivered as requested. Also, for anyone going to a sporting (we went the the Montreal Canadiens game) or concert event at the Bell centre, this is the place to stay at. The walk back to the hotel was less than a minute away.

We had researched several different hotels before deciding on the Warwick- we chose it because of the affordable price and location in the city. Upon arriving, we were very pleased. It is in a prime location, a short walk from the market, and very close to shops and restaurants. Our room was spacious, very clean and it had an amazing view of the Space Needle. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. When we were checking out, we noticed we had been charged a fee for using the internet (we had never used it). We notified the people at the front desk and they immediately fixed it, no questions asked. They also offered to get us a cab even though we didnt need it. An overall, very satisfactory experience.

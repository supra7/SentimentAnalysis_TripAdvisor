We stopped in here because the downtown Marriott's where already full for the weekend. But we were pleasantly surprised. Super comfortable beds, and indoor swimming pool that's amazing. Great food at the restaurants--although pricey. I loved this hotel and would absolutely stay here again. More more than expected for an airport hotel.

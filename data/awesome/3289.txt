Our first view was not encouraging, but we came to realise very quickly that they had chosen to spend their renovation dollar inside, rather than on externals. That's fine by us, it was superb! The rainforest around the pool and the huge timber-beamed canopy over, gave us our first real taste of Pacific North West style; the food was great at both dinner and breakfast, and the room was luxury plus. When our rental car failed to arrive, they were far more helpful than Hertz in resolving the problem! I would always stay here again after a cross-Pacific flight.

We stayed there on our honeymoon and had a great time. I was very impressed with how great the service was and all the employees were so nice! We ate at the world cafe for breakfast every morning and had the pleasure of sitting in Freddy's section a few times! He was super nice and made our breakfast experience that much more enjoyable. We ordered room service and to our surprise we were able to order stuff that wasn't even on the room service menu which was awesome! We stayed for 7 nights and unfortunately it poured 5 out of 7 days. The hotel offered various indoor activities and the theater shows were great. All of the food was amazing, especially the japanese place. The pool was nice and the entertainment staff did a good job of arranging and participating in the activities. Jamie from the entertainment staff was fun to talk to and get information about where to shop since the tropical storm left the pools empty. The maid staff did an excellent job, it seemed like our room was constantly being cleaned and organized. We scheduled a snorkeling adventure and was refunded the money due to the storm. It took a few weeks for it to go back on my credit card but that was just because it was an international return. We met a lot of great couples from all over the world. If you are single with a group of friends you might feel a little left out because almost everyone here are couples on an anniversary or honeymoon. We took a taxi from the hotel and shopped at playa del carmen and felt completely safe. At no point did I feel unsafe during our entire trip. We felt as if we were still in the US, except for the fact that everyone was much nicer and service was much better here than in the US. Thank you secrets maroma for a wonderful honeymoon and the best vacation that we have ever had. Definitely looking forward to our 5 year anniversary at secrets maroma!!!!!!

The first sentence is usually all the folks that read reviews look at so, I'll start by saying this place was a bit overpriced and a tad far from most everything. The "partial" ocean view is a very schetchy description. If you are staying in a "partial" make sure it's on the 3rd floor or higher, otherwise you can't see didly!! The overprice comes in when you want to do things like upgrades of your room or spa services or things of that nature. The resturants at the resort are not the best but they'll do. I suggest making sure you dine out of the resort once or twice, like at a nice steak house like peutro madero or something like that. Now on to the good stuff.... The resort is so packed with things to do that you really don't need to leave for any reason. The staff is great and the beach is amazing. If you want to get away from Cancun and still want to be close enough so that you can run back in town if you need, then this is a nice hideaway. It was a bit far from things for my liking but to each his own.

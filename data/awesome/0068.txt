We just returned from a weekend stay at the Hotel Monaco. Over the years on our bi-annual trips to Seattle, we've stayed at a variety of hotels and this hotel is our favorite by far. Strongest points: a fun and pleasing decor with lots of verve and flair in the lobby and guest rooms, a pleasant and helpful staff and cosy, non-generic rooms that make you feel at home immediately. Also the room rate was very reasonable. The size of the hotel is perfect if you're seeking a more intimate feel than the quality chain hotels in Seattle provide. Both the hotel and its attached restaurant Sazerac have real character and zazz..more so than many of the high-end traditional style hotels in Seattle. We loved the nightly wine hour in the lobby and at Sazerac enjoyed a good breakfast and a couple of terrific happy hours (This bar is rated as offering one of the top 20 happy hours in Seattle and if you've never been to Seattle ---happy hours are big-time here for both drink and food.) We requested a higher floor room and were really appreciative when the hotel staff actually did follow through and give us a lovely, quiet room on the 9th floor. The hotel is well-situated. We came in on 'The Link' from the airport and the hotel is only 2 blocks away from the University stop. (note: If you're planning to take the Link into the city from SEATAC airport be prepared for an extremely long walk with your luggage from the Airport terminals to the train. And there's no transport at the airport to the Link.) The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, shops, movie theaters, and an easy walk to many sites including the Seattle Art Museum and Pike's Market. We're definitely planning to make this our destination hotel for future trips to Seattle.

Our room was clean and nicely decorated. We had a king bed, with a temperpedic mattress,which was wonderful.The bathroom was large and clean also nicely decorated. We had a court side room which was a bit quieter than the street side. The weather was beautiful and we wanted to open the window but when we did the exhaust from the restaurant was very unpleasant. That was our only negative issue with this wonderful place. The staff were knowledgeable, friendly and always helpful. The location is across the street from the Public Market, and an easy walk to shopping and bus stops.

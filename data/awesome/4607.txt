My husband and I have been able to experience some of the best all inclusives in Mexico and Jamaica and Secrets Maroma tops the list. The staff was very attentive and always greeted us with a smile. The food was excellent and the presentation was "Top Chef" quality. We were celebrating my husband's Birthday and our Wedding Anniversary and they made each occasion very special. If you are looking for beautiful resort,lovely beach and terrific food and service search no more.

My husband and I stayed from Jan 22-29, everything with our arrival went great. One nice touch was I expected a tranfer with guests from other resorts, but there were just 3 couples in a van, direct right to Secrets, which took about 30 minutes. The return transfers we were on a big bus with people from other resorts. We arrived around 11am so our room was not ready yet, it was around 2pm. The resort is gorgeous, the beach is the best and the staff are amazing! A few of my favorites things were: -the beds were very comfortable, better than any resort we've been to -the service by the pool and beach, the appetizers especially -top shelf liquor, but you have to ask for it One thing to note that people aren't aware of, you can't save chairs by the pool and leave before 10:30am. They have staff that if you are gone for more than half an hour, they will remove your things. This is a great rule as like everyone mentioned, people save them and leave for hours. This is also outlined in the resort book in the rooms. The food was good, we ate at most of the restaurants and we had a lot of fun at Himtsu. We also had room service on one night and it was very good too and quick! We had pictures taken by Adventure at the resort and they turned out great! We are glad we took the hour! We had a blast there and hope to return next year! I miss it already!

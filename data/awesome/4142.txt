I did extensive research on this property, so I knew what to expect. Travelled with my Wife for our 25th anniversary and my adult stepson and his wife. They left the choice up to me, so much of the review will be based on their comments. Our TA had advised the resort of our special occasion, and we were updated to preferred building #16 rooms 46 & 48. The views were spectacular. We did not pay an additional $80 per day to have access to the preferred club amentities. The rooms were as pictured. We requested a fan as we like the room cold at night, and the fan did the trick. My wife loved the pool area; we never had a problem getting loungers close to the swim up bar. The kids stayed on the beach for the most part and raved about the softness of the sand. I though the gym was nice, the drinks were stong, and I played about 15 games of beach volleyball over four days. We enjoyed the food around the pool, loved the omelette station for breakfast. We ate at the Italian restaurant which I thought was good. I had a salmon appetizer that was outstanding. The only negative in our exprerience was the hour and a half wait to clear customs and imigration. We will be back!

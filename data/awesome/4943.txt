This resort is first class all the way!!! They treat you like family and welcome you home when you arrive, as they greet you with a glass of champagne and a cool towel, and they spend the whole time you are there making you feel welcome and right at home. The food was excellent and the variety of restaurants perfect! We spent only 3 nights but were pampered the whole time. The rooms were really nice and the amenities in the room were great! We did not utilize the spa services but tried just about everything else they had to offer. The entertainment was great, the beach was beautiful and clean and the service (bar and food) at the beach and pool could not have been better. I have been to all inclusives were you can't find anyone to bring you a drink, you always have to get up from your lounge chair and get it your self. And the same with food, other places don't have food out by the pool or beach, you must go to the restaurant yourself but not at Secrets Maroma, there was food and service everywhere. I have absolutely no complaints and can not wait to go back!

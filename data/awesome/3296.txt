We spent our last night on the west coast at this Marriott before a morning flight. Really nice hotel & we will stay here again. Rooms were typical Marriott. It has a very large central area with a pool as well a comfortable stuffed chairs. A few things to note: They don't allow roll aways in the rooms with 2 beds. We didn't notice any restaurants within walking distance although you can walk downhill to the light rail & take a train to downtown- its not a long distance but you do need to walk uphill on the way back . The restaurant food was good but pricey for dinner. The airport is very close but we heard no airplane noise. We used the business center to print our boarding passes. Shuttle to the airport was on time and convenient.

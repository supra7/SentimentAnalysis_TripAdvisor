Secluded all inclusive hotel in the Rivera Maya that you won't want to leave! This hotel caters mostly to couples, but we took an incentive group there and everyone loved it. There are many restaurants on site and the food is excellent. Great pool, activities, beach, meeting space and a disco. You can easily get a cab into Playa del Carmen for some shopping or wandering, but honestly I didn't want to go anywhere. Workout facilities and great spa too. Optional tours (extra cost) will pick you up from the front lobby and there is always room service available if you want to stay in. Nice rooms with great amenities. Lots of staff with great service, you just have to adjust to "Mexican time"...meaning not everything is immediate, but it is done. This is in the middle of the "jungle", not walking distance to anything. There are lots of wild animals near by, and one day I had some ants in my room, and a gecko, but no serious issues.

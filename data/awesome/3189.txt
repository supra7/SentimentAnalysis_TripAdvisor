We came here after a cruise package. We were all tired. The staff was very quick about getting all of us checked in. The rooms were wonderful. A huge bed, coffee and tea in the room. There was also a very big desk with wi fi hook up. They have a shuttle that will take you to not only the airport or light rail but also the mall or select places to eat. We would stay here again.

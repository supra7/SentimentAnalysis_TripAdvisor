After booking my 2 night stay in November, I proceeded to read the reviews here, and I became a little nervous. After reading so many comments regarding poor upkeep and poor customer service, I thought, "What did I get myself into?" However, my trepidations were immediately quelled upon my arrival. The front desk staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The room was well appointed, and very clean. The bathroom was spotless, and the Bliss toiletries were wonderful! The hotel is very secure in that elevator access to floors can only be activated by an unexpired room key. My husband and I had a nice peaceful stay and 2 nights of quiet sleep. I am definitely staying there again!

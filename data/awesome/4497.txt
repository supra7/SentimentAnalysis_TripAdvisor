Stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach last week and it was terrific. The hotel, staff, beach, pool, food and atmosphere were all great. We were pleasantly surprised at how great this all inclusive resort was. Also enjoyed the whole area...visited the Mayan ruins at Tulum and Coba and also shopping at 5th Avenue. We visited Secrets Capri and there was no comparison.....Secrets Maroma was 100 times nicer in all areas. I would highly recommend this hotel.

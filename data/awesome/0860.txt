We stayed here one night for a girlfriend getaway. This was a very comfortable hotel with all the luxuries expected at this star level. The beds were very comfy and they had nice large bathrooms. The rooms were large as well. They had inroom coffeemaker, hairdryer. The location was up a huge hill. Dont even try to walk to the market. We found the bus system stops one block away that takes you to the market. It is free during the day\. Be sure to ask the driver which stop to get off for the market. We went too far and had to walk back several streets. The parking fee was $37 per day. Trying to park in Seattle is a nightmare. Better to park at the hotel and take the bus or taxi. We nabbed a great price on Hotwire. We were able to get 2 queen beds. We waited until 5 days before we left and got a better price.

My husband and I stayed at 'The Inn at the Market last week for a short get away. We were really impressed by everything at this hotel. The location was great. It was just up the hill from the Pike Market and many little shops and restaurants in the area. The service was impecable. Everyone at the Inn was so friendly and helpful. All you had to do was ask and they went out of their way to help you. We asked for a taxi a couple of times and the front desk made their town car available to us. The room itself was beautiful. We had a water front suite with a wonderful view.....and the beds were very comforable. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Would recommend this hotel very highly !!

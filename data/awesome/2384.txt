My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our first anniversary. We had a Grand View Room and a package that included room service breakfast and a 4pm checkout. It exceeded our expectations and was a perfect way to celebrate. The view from our room was spectacular, and it was amazingly comfortable. It was a lovely way to have a gorgeous view of our own city.

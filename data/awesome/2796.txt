My sister and I had a sisters trip in Seattle in late May and we booked the Vintage Hotel off of Hotwire for $119 per night. We we very excited it turned out to be the Vintage hotel as we love Kimpton hotels and have also stayed at the Alexis down the street. They are very wonderful boutique hotels with great service, furnishings and full of character. The location was ideal and seemed to be quiet for being in a city. The rooms are on the small side but they are well appointed and are surely relaxing. You get turn down service at request and Aveda spa products in the bathroom. No complaints here-well done!

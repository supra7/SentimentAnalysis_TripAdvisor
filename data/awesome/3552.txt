Traveling with my sister and her young kids, we were upgraded to a superior sweet because our room wasn't quite ready. It wasn't huge, but the bathroom was, with its glass shower, soaking tub, generous double vanity, and Molton Brown toiletries. The decor was modern, but comfortable and interesting. Little touches like an iPod dock, a kitchenette with fridge and microwave, and faux fur throws made us very cozy in the room. The saltwater pool is gorgeous, with a glass wall revealing a great view of Montreal, and the outdoor hot tub deck is heavenly. The pool always seemed to have visitors, and not surprisingly. The lobby is cool and funky, and we found the staff really helpful with dinner reservations, parking, etc., and there was always a basket of apples on the front desk, which definitely pleased the kids. The hotel property is in easy walking distance of a couple of different Metro lines, and there is a great breakfast place nearby called Eggspectation, just a couple of blocks north on Rue de la Montagne. They served a huge cafe au lait and some fabulous brioche francaise with bananas and cinnamon. Overall, we felt that the hotel was lovely, comfortable, and modern. A great value too, in a really good location, and the pool is a huge bonus.

I stayed there for 2 nights early April and the overall impression is really good, The rooms are spacious and clean and the average rate was $140/night. The internet is to bought thru credit card. staff are so helpful and knowledgeable. The location is superb, and is a walking distance from many nearby interests. highly recommended.

The Quality Inn near downtown Seattle is a well maintained, older property. I guess the building is 30+ years old. My room was very large, clean, quiet, and well maintained. Since the hotel is a non-smoking facility it is cleaner than average. The morning breakfast is noticeably superior to the standard fare. The hotel is located near the Space Needle and the monorail provides very good access to the heart of downtown. The hotel is located in a good neighborhood with several other hotels nearby. I should note that the I think that I received a complimentary room upgrades. I doubt if the standard rooms are huge including a Jacuzzi. However, if I were assigned a standard I still would have been a happy customer. Finally, I found the price to be reasonable.

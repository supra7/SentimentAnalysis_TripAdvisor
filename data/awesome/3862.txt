This resort is one of kind! When we arrived for our vacation, we were speechless! Everything from the food to the pools to the amazing rooms. We had such a great time. We did a swim-out suite in the preferred room. We can't wait to go back, however... the prices have gone up SO much. Great resort!!!!

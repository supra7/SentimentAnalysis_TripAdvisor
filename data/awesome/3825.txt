We arrived tired, stressed and suffering from colds, and left completely relaxed and refreshed. The room was incredible. With 24-hour room service, an amazing view and a jacuzzi tub, it was hard to leave. When we made our way to the pool, we enjoyed the covered lounging beds where waiters brought us tasty beverages. I was a big fan of the Dirty Monkey. For lunch we could order gourmet burgers and ceviche by just walking a few feet. The service was incredible -- smiling, helpful faces everywhere you turned. I was really impressed with the food -- several great restaurant options to choose from. The spa was a real highlight, especially the hydrotherapy. We received a couples massage in the most romantic setting. I cannot say enough great things about Secrets Maroma. We came for a friend's wedding, but it felt like a honeymoon for all the guests.

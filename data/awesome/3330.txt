We stayed at the hotel for one night and had an excellent stay. They put us in a room on the concierge floor for being a Marriott Rewards Silver member. All of our requests (room with a view of Mt. Rainer, toothpaste, rollaway) were accommodated. The renovated room looked great with comfortable beds and new bedding. We loved the look and feel of the swimming pool/hot tub area (as if we were outdoors in the tropics), and enjoyed the warm water. The food at lunch was very delicious. The hotel is 20 minutes away from downtown Seattle. Note that the lobby is currently being renovated and we needed to walk through a tent to get inside the building and that registration was in the business center.

I love this hotel because it is so close to PIke Street Market. They also have a wonderful rough top terrace that is a great place to relax with wine & cheese - watching the ferry traffic on the Sound. The only complaint that I used to have about this place was the bed - which was worse than a rock - but they have new beds so this place is perfect if you want to stay close to the Market and shopping.

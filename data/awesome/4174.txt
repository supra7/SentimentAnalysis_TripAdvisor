I stayed here for my girlfriends birthday, we had an amazing time! The highlights here are the special restaurants and of course the beach! The breakfast buffet is not the best, but is ok... The only bad comment is that our room had a lot of mosquitos inside! This is a lovely resort, i would return for sure!

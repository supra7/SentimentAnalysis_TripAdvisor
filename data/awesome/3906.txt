We stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach 9/25-10/2 2011. Everything was wonderful. The only things I "disliked" were things that the resort couldn't help, like the moquitos and birds. But other than that... everything was excellent! To any 20 something's going on your honeymoon- you will love this place. We tipped pretty well, so of course we got wonderful service and the bartenders remembered us by name. That was a nice touch. Eric & Alfredo were amazing bartenders. Freddy was also great, he works at the Itailan restraunt. He gave us the best service we've every had.. anywhere. This was our first stay at an AI resort, we were not dissapointed. I think the price was just right, we booked almost a year ahead of time. I would love to go back. I think anytime we go on vacation and there is a Secrets there, we will be staying there. To anyone thinking of staying here, please stay. You won't regret it. The beach is by far the best beach i've ever seen. The toilets may not be made out of gold, but if you can afford that, then obviously you just need to go buy your own resort. (by the way their toilets paper smells like baby powder... weird, but awesome!) haha. Anyways heres a shorter review: Room- Great (took the bath about 45mins to fill up though) Room service- Outstanding Pools- Great Beach- Breathtaking Drinks- YUMMY :) Food/restraunt- Tasty, a little fancy for my liking... but yummy non-the less. Spa- Great. WELL worth the money Entertainment- GREAT. Go to a show. Overall... great place to stay. P.s. The little racoon things walking around are harmless.

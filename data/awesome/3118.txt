Had a great stay at the Roosevelt a few days before Christmas. Went to see a Christmas Carol at the ACT Theatre which is about a 3 min walk from the hotel, great play! Rooms were clean and very spacious, bathrooms small but clean. Great place for a family! Von's has great happy hour food specials and their $3.50 martinis are fantastic.

we spent 3 nights at this motel and found it to be everything we could have wanted. It is a little further out of the city than we would have liked, but a short walk to the space needle where we caught the monorail into the city ($4pp return). Free parking, complimentary deluxe breakfast (superb!) and free wi-fi made this the choice for us. the decor is modern, clean and all rooms come standard with a fridge and microwave (something other places charge more for). there is a great market on the next block open 24 hrs. only downside is the lack of restaurants within walking distance. perfect otherwise!

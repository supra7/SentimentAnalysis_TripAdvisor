My husband and I stayed at Hotel Andra for a week in early July -- a return trip for him, first for me -- and we could not have been happier. The staff were cheerful, helpful, and really seemed to care about our experience. Room was small but very comfortable -- beautiful bathroom -- we slept very well in the deliciously appointed bed. The lobby and public areas are beautifully decorated and felt like our living room, a lovely extension of our room. Good location, funky interesting neighborhood, close (but not too) to Pike St. We ordered dinner from room service the night we arrived and were not terribly impressed, but breakfast the next morning in the restaurant was spectacular. We subsequently discovered the bakery across the street offers many of the same things (ah, the homemade English muffins!) for mornings when we wanted to grab and go. (We were also regulars at the bakery for the delicious desserts.) It was a blissful week. My husband had stayed here previously during a business trip and insisted I come back with him for a romantic vacation. Seattle is great, well worth visiting, but the Hotel Andra is a destination in itself.

I really can't say enough good things about this resort. I went for a relaxing trip with one of my girlfriends. From the moment we walked in and were offered cool scented towels, we were in love with this place. The food is excellent, the room was perfect, the resort is beautiful and the atmosphere is unlike other adults only places I've been to. Not cheesy at all. No ridiculous antics at the pool, and not a pickup joint. Our stay there was a complete dream.

The first experience of this place was great, it was the young guy on the front desk he was the most genuin nicest guy and just really wanted to help us, so we checked in we had a private room with own bathroom it was good size and clean and comfortable, the value is great for the price. It's only a couple of blocks away from main street of shop and wharf also a couple of block each way from the nicer restaurants. As I said earlier what really makes this place is the young guy on front desk he really made our stay we would ask him anything and he would be genuinly happy to answer and told us about some of the best restaurants I've ever been too.

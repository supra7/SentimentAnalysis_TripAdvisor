Our experience was great we stayed in one of the junior swim out sweets . The room was great but did not spend much time there except to sleep because there was always plenty to see and do. And the staff could not have been better we have never been on a vacation that the staff has been so happy and helpfull all the time. That only bad thing was I think I gained 10 pounds because everytime we looked someone was bringing food or drinks to us. We liked it so much we already cancelled a trip we had planned somewhere else next year so we can make plans to come back to your resort again instead. Thanks Again for a great vacation.:):):):)

The lobby was gorgeous and the staff were the most welcoming I have ever encountered. After telling them we were staying with them due to our anniversary they provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine. The elevator was small, but the whole building was clean and had great art throughout. The room was decorated well, and the bed was very comfortable. They even had a pillow to fit my picky needs. I loved the attatched Red Fin restaurant, in fact we had drinks there one night and breakfast there the next morning. Great food and drinks! I will definately stay at this hotel again! Its also located very near Pike Place and everything fun in Seattle.

Great location, few minutes away from the airport. A lot of restaurants around the area and nearby mall. Free drinks and finger foods during Manager's Special at night and great 'made to order' breakfast! Rooms are spacious and very clean... definitely coming back if I'm in the area. Highly recommended!

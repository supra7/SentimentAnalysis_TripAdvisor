We booked 4 rooms here using prepaid option. We were flying to Hawaii and used two rooms for flight out and 2 for return flight. Their shuttle picks you up at the airport and delivers you right to the door. There is a 7-Eleven just across the street and the Lite Rail Station is about 3 blocks downhill. The shuttle driver will stop at the corner for you to get to the lite rail only if you have no suitcases as it is a busy intersection. Lite rail can be accessed right from the airport so it is very easy to use and inexpensive to get to downtown to look around, $2.50 round trip. They have an excellent website that goes into more detail on Lite Rail. The only meal we was breakfast off the menu which was very good. Nice indoor pool area.

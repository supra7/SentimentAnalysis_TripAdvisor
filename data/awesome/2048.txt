We have stayed at this Hotel several times, breaking up the long journey from the UK to Hawaii and each stay was for 4 or 5 nights. We first found it on the internet but once we had stayed at this hotel we couldn't even look at any other hotel in Seattle as none can compete with the unusual, amazing location. (The views from the waterfront rooms, the dining room and the residents lounge are breath taking.) We loved sipping wine and gazing at the constant ferry crossings and admiring the beautiful Seattle sky line. The food is lovely and the staff friendly and obliging. The side views of the hotel may look a little strange but it is built on a pier. The furnishings are lovely and I just had to buy one of the large Grizzly bear footstools and have it shipped to the UK. He sits in our lounge and reminds us of the lovely times we have spent in Seattle.

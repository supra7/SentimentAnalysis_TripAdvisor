We went for our Honeymoon and this was the perfect place to have it, we wouldn't have changed a thing. We have never been so pampered. The rooms are amazing, the beach was amazing and the Spa was beautiful and relaxing. The service from the staff was the best we have ever had. We can't wait togo back.

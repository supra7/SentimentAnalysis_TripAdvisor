This hotel has two towers with rooms around the outside perimeter. It made for an interesting room configuration, but was none the less still comfortable. Plus, being on a higher floor, I had a great view of Capital Hill and water. It is in an awesome location, very central to the waterfront, and close to the shopping district - one block to Nordstrom and two dozen other great stores. It was also close to fabulous restaurants. If you happen to be there on a day when the weather is nice, you can definitely walk to the water front and public market area. The lobby was comfortable, even though it was full of people all of the time, as it was a great place to meet up with companions and grab a drink. I didn't use the conceirge service personally, but happened to be sitting by the desk one morning and the conceirge seemed very knowledgable and helpful. Even the bottle of water I got from the mini bar (which I usually try to avoid) was reasonably priced. My only complaint (echoed by my travel companions also) was the gym. Considering how large the hotel was, the gym was tiny. It also got very warm very quickly. For a hotel that large, I'd expect a better facility with more machines. If you stay, skip the gym and walk the hills instead.

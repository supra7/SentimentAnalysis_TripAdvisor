My sister and I chose to stay at because we can use her Starwood points, but we got more than just a good hotel deal. The hotel, is not as centrally located as some of the other hotels in Downtown Seattle, but it is still walking distance to just about everything: Westlake Center, Pike Place Market, even Pioneer Square (ok, that was a loong walk, but it's doable) The hotel is also only a block away from the University Street stop of the Central Link Light Rail and has bus stops right by it so its very accessible. My sister and I did a lot of walking all over the city to see the sights and it was such a nice treat to come back to the hotel after our long and tiring day and be able to have a great night's sleep because the beds were so incredibly comfortable, we slept like babies! We couldn't stop talking about it after our trip and she's actually considering buying the bed, she said its better than the Westin's Heavenly bed, and she's a big fan of the Heavenly bed. There is no free WiFi in the rooms, but if you go downstairs to the lobby area, you can have Internet access for free. They are also accommodating, I was able to check in early and got a late check out as well! I loved Seattle and when I do come back, i will definitely stay here again! Oh the Bliss Spa toiletries were a definite bonus!

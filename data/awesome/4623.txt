We can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our first trip to Mexico. Secrets is definitely everything you hope for and so much more. The staff is truly the friendiest we have ever met, the Resort is absolutely beautiful, very tastefully done and the grounds are just lovely. We had a swim out room and would get one again!! It was the perfect place to relax first thing in the morning with your coffee and then call room service so could eat out on the patio with our friends. Although you share the bldg pool, the other couples were all very friendly and we had a great time together. We took turns which ones ordered room service for the entire group. The swim out was also great for relaxing and cooling down when you came back from the beach. Could cool down for a while, plus get all the sand off before going back into your room. All the restaurants were great. My husband and son wore a pair of khakis, polo shirt and sandals, never got turned away. We did see a man get turned away for wearing a sleeveless or muscle t-shirt to breakfast. All the ladies need cover ups over their swimsuits during the day meals. We had such a wonderful time, our son decided to propose to his girlfriend as he wanted it to be at such a special place. the Resort photographer took beautful pictures of the event. Set up a photo session if you get the chance, it is well worth it!! We are already planning a 2nd trip for next year.

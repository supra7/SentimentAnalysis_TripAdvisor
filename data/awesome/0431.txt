After 10 days in Alaska we ended our trip in Seattle before flying home. We decided to spring for a water view room and boy were we glad we did. The Pike Street Market sign and Puget Sound were beautiful from our window. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was very nice, well appointed and surprisingly quiet considering the location. We loved watching the sunset from the roof terrace. We had breakfast in the cafe and it was delicious. Maybe the best quiche I have ever had anywhere, including home. The room rate is a little steep, but it's worth every penny. You are definitely paying for location and service. We loved the Steelhead Diner right across the street from the hotel. We sat at the bar which was a great place to people watch. The food was great and the atmosphere very pleasant. There are lots of places to shop and eat, but it's a pretty good walk to the water's edge, and once you get there you won't find too much to do - a couple of restaurants and great views. We can't imagine staying anyplace else if we ever go back. The hotel and surrounds were exceptional.

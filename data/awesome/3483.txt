My wife and I love visiting Montreal and usually stay at a hotel a few blocks up the street from this one, but we were intrigued by Le Crystal and decided to give it a try. Wow, were we ever glad we did! This place is wonderful. First of all, great location, steps from restaurants and shopping and galleries. Inexpensive parking right across the street from the hotel. Our room was like a mini-apartment, really well designed with all sorts of smart features and nice fixtures and finishes. Had a rain shower as well as normal shower. We had a living room and kitchenette (which we didn't use) and everything you might need was included right down to dishcloth and dishwashing liquid. Very chic and romantic (reminded me of a high-end Miami hotel), but also very practical and great for business travellers. And the best part was the rooftop hot tub, which we loved spending time in. This is our new favourite Montreal hotel, and we can't wait to return.

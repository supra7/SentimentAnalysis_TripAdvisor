The resort is excellent. Service is excellent. It is not a huge resort, with "only" about 400 rooms. So it doesn't have the feel of some mega-property. But it is big enough to be able to provide all of the amenities you need to enjoy your time there. It is pretty quiet and relaxed. The pool area is nice. The beach is nice. Beverage service on the beach is better than most. The food in all the restaurants is excellent. Only points that were negative are: we arrived at 12:00 but weren't able to check in until 2:00. That was a bit inconvenient. And, as with virtually any beach resort it seems, when you come down to the pool or beach area at 10:00 in the morning.....all the seats are "saved" by someone. Of course 80% of the chairs are empty, but people are actively trying to keep anyone else from using the chairs. I find that extremely annoying. But it's not really unique to this property. All in all, a fantastic place with particularly high marks regarding level of service and the quality of the food.

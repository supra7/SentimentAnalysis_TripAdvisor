I just returned from a short vacation at this resort. Amazing is an understatement! I do not believe I have ever been so spoiled. The beach was amazing. Always loungers available. The beach waiters were constantly serving us both drinks and lunch. The pool area was great. I loved that the chairs were also all around and in small wading pools. Our room was on the 4th floor of building 16 with a perfect view of the ocean and the pool. As this was a group some of our meals were for us alone. These were always good, but we also had a chance to try the restaurants. I had dinner at the Mexican...superb! This resort was only about 10 minutes from Playa del Carmen. This a a great place for shopping and just to see the sites. Make sure you go down the odd side street as the courtyards are just so pretty. Overall had a great time. The business centre is a great place to stay in touch with family at home as the internet was available most time and if not there were enough that it was a very short wait. I bought a phone card at the hotel to call home. From what I heard it is the cheapest and easiest way. Weather was sunny every day so that always helps.

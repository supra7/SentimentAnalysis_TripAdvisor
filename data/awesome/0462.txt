We stayed in the Inn at the start of a 3 week vacation and it was probably the best hotel we stayed in. The loaction in the heart of Pike Place market is fantastic for the first time visitor, and we've never had so much great fresh food on our doorstep before. The reception area was warm, peacefull and welcoming, and always had bowl of fresh cookies out every afternoon. The hotel isnt a moden statement of cutting edge design, but it fits in perfectly with its surrounding, and has a sophisticated, relaxing, and friendly ambiance. We did have a problem overly loud air conditioning in the room, but this was our only issue. Other than that the rooms were spacious, well designed, had great views, and were an unexpected highlight.

We stayed here in August 2011 for two nights at the end of our holiday. On arriving at the hotel we realised we had left all our passports and flight tickets at the previous holiday home in Mont Tremblant. The staff at the hotel were fantastic and sorted everything out with no fuss. They let us into our room early and we were able to have a late checkout too. Nothing seemed to much to ask! The room we had was superb - great little kitchenette and very clean, spacious bathroom. Great beds and linen. Cannot fault this hotel - brilliant location - just a few minutes away from main shopping street and lovely bars and restaurants. Highly recommended. Would return again.

We have been to Cancun and the Playa area many times and this is the best hotel we have been to. We went for our 10 year anniversary and can't wait to come back. The rooms are really nice and the food and drinks are amazing. Service in Mexico has always been great but this tops them all! Don't hesitate to book this hotel, you will not be dissapointed!

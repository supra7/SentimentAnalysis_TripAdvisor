We stayed here for one night before our cruise to Alaska. We have never been to Seattle before and was surprised to see how expensive it was for a hotel room here. We saw the Sixth Ave inn on a website and liked the price. We decided to take a chance since it was for only one night. We were so pleasantly surprised! The hotel was old but very clean and the staff were so friendly and helpful!!! It was a great location also! We could the Space Needle from in front of the hotel and it was walking distance to Pike Place and lots of shopping places. The restaraunt was wonderful for dinner!! Best pot roast and they have a chicken and dumpling soup that is WONDERFUL! We will be staying here again for sure!

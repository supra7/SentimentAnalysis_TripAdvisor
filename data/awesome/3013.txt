This hotel was really great. Service was excellent, my room was clean and plenty of room for one or two people. I appreciated the decor and original art in the public areas and in my room. It's a short walk to everything in downtown Seattle and I liked that it wasn't right at the waterfront, but very close to the shopping core. I'd definitely stay here again.

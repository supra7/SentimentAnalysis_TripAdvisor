The location was right downtown and close to everything. Front desk staff were very nice and helpful. The room was clean and in good shape. A couple of stains on the carpet but overall good shape. I wish hotels would stop charging steep prices for internet. It's an additional 9.95 here. I got a good deal via Orbitz so the price was comparable to others in the area.

I just recently went with my family and bf because my sister got married at the resort...on the beach. wonderful hotel and amazing staff! The hotel is very beautiful right off the beach in a perfect quiet location. The hotel does have activities by the pool and shows at night. Very classy romantic hotel- great for couples. They do have a strict dress code especially when going into the main hotel. Certain restaurants require men to wear pants. And during the day you can not just walk in wearing a bathing-suit. This hotel is about 30 mins away from playa del carmen.

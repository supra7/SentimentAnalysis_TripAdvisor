This is the second time I've stayed at Max and I'll stay there when I come back to Seattle again. It's fun, quirky (in a good way) and really convenient to all the places I wanted to see. It's less than 10 minutes walk to the famous Pike Place market, a bit further from the Needle and music exhibition, but still a straightforward walk. The rooms are always clean and I love that we get a choice of pillow softness/hardness according to their gauge. They have introduced a card you can put onto your door that means you don't have to have housekeeping coming into your room every day if you don't want them. I asked to be on a specific floor for my stay and they managed to fulfil my request. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, as a solo traveller I always felt secure and knew that I could ask for help at the front desk any time I needed. Treat yourself to a stay at Hotel Max and you'll love it as much as I do.

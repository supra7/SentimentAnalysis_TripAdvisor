This boutique hotel was our first introduction to the Pacific Northwest and we loved it. It's located just a block from Pikes Market, a wonderful place to people watch, eat, shop, etc. The hotel is through a pretty courtyard with some nice specialty shops opening on to it. The lobby is small and rather plain, but the rooms were lovely. We looked out on the courtyard and didn't miss having a water view at all. Upstairs was a rooftop terrace with nice lounge chairs and tables where we could spend time looking at Puget sound and visiting with other guests. We didn't use the restaurant affiliated with the hotel so can't comment on that but the menu looked great. The room itself had everything we needed - extremely comfortable beds, lovely bathroom, TWO floor-length mirrors (one inside the bath, one outside - that's a frequently lacking item even in top hotels), comfortable chairs. It was spotless - and I'm picky. Would go back in a heartbeat!

I chose this hotel based on other Tripadvisor's comments, and I was more than pleased with my stay. The hotel is absolutely charming, along with being clean and well-kept. Front desk staff and doormen were very polite and helpful, and on check-in, the receptionist took the time to show me a map of Seattle along with an explanation of the best places to go and how to get there. Location is unbeatable - walking distance to Pike's market, $2 monorail ride to Space Needle and amusement park, across the street from very large Macy's, and around the corner from Nordstrom's and a pleasant shopping plaza with everything you could want. This hotel is an excellent value, and I'd return here in a heartbeat.

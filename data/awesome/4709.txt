OMG---This place was fabulous. Yes we were there this time last year so the date "is not" an error. Just noticed that we had never published a review. We are visiting another Secrets property in Cap Cana DR at the end of this month and thought we should give the staff at the Moroma Beach location the recognition they deserve. My wife and I are from the Midwest and travel a lot, plus fortunate to stay in many great locations and top level properties. Many times to the Broadmoor, Vail, Cas de Campo DR, and numerous nice places in the states. IA's are definately in a different class so I am mindfull of that but SMB was easily the best yet in that class. After staying at Couples, Grand Lido and Palace IA properties we tried Secrets. It will be hard to try something new now. That is why we are staying at Secrets Cap Cana two weeks from now. We think we have experienced the best of the IA class and change will be difficult. Received no special treatment during our stay just the same great service/experience that I assume all patrons receive. Also note that this stay was on the tail end of the flu event and during the height of the economic collapse and the service was still exceptional. Thanks to all at SMB!

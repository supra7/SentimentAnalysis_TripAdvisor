Such a great hotel this one! Small, personal, on a perfect location, near the Market, the best shops, museums and restaurants. Great rooms: modern, confortable and unpretensious interiors. Nice views to the harbour, from most of the rooms and from the terrace garden, where you can watch the sunset over the water. Althought Seattle is a city where you already expect to be attended by nice and friendly people, the staff at The Inn really went a step beyond, making me feel like I was the only guest they had at the hotel. 6 Stars!

A reasonably-priced hotel with all of the amenities one would find at a more expensive establishment. Courteous employees, quiet room, comfortable bed with extra pillows, plenty of towels, Wi-Fi worked quickly, nice breakfast with delicious coffee! Convenient to many restaurants and a short drive to the theme parks. We would definately return

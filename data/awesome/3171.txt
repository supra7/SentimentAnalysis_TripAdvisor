My BFF plus two other friends and I were planning a trip to the west coast. The biggest decision was how to get from Seattle to Vancouver, BC. When looking at the various options, we wanted something different. We found a fantastic deal which included a hotel stay in Seattle and an overnight cruise to Vancouver. Our hotel was the Doubletree by Hilton Seattle Airport. After a rocky start finding the right shuttle, everything else was fantastic. We arrived at the hotel and were warmly greeted by the Front Desk Staff and given warm cookies. Wish they came without nuts. The room was very nice with lots of space. We even had a little balcony which we would have used if the weather had been nicer. That evening we enjoyed a cocktail in the bar and the bartender was fantastic. The next morning our server for breakfast was very attentive. The only downside was the gentleman manning the concierge desk. We were asking directions to the Public Market and a pub we were interested in trying. He kept trying to get us interested in a certain fish restaurant. We ended up asking a local person who gave us correct information and even helped us get on the right train. We would definitely stay there again.

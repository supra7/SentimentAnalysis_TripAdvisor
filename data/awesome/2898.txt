I had sinus surgery a few weeks before my trip to Seattle. The cross-country flight combined with drinking all day and crashing on a friend's floor with no pillow the night before all led to me having an INDESCRIBABLE headache the morning I was due to check in to the W. Check in is not until 3 pm, but the staff was more than happy to get me into my room at 9:30 am when I explained how badly my head hurt. And this was on a sold-out weekend. And both times I called downstairs for assistance they were friendly and helpful. Service = A+ The room itself was huge, stylishly decorated, and immensely comfortable. (That bed! Those pillows! Even the carpet was a treat for my feet.) My only complaint was the A/C..... some new eco-friendly deal I'd never seen before where there's a sensor and as soon as you leave the room it goes off. (We obviously do not have this in Florida!!!!) We were lucky to have GORGEOUS sunny weather so after trekking around town it was hot when we got back to the room. But it didn't take very long to cool back down. Room = A The location was pretty much perfect - I was able to walk to all the downtown attractions and there is a public bus stop right outside the front door. Yes, there are hills as the previous poster noted, but that's not their fault! The whole city is full of hills! The incline varies depending on which side street you take; if you go down to Pine or Pike it wasn't bad at all. Location = A+ Full disclosure - I didn't pay for my room. My godparents allowed me to use their SPG points (23,000 of them!) to stay here. However, I feel confident that if I had forked over the $275/night or whatever it is I would have felt completely satisfied all the same.

This place was amazing! We booked it solely because of its proximity to the airport (a 5 minute shuttle ride) and were dazzled when we checked in. The whole place is done up to look like a lodge. Beautiful wood beams everywhere. The pool was enormous. Our room was small, but beauiful, and a terrific bargain. I'd like to stay there again, for longer this time.

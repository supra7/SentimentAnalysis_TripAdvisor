Look no further at resorts. This is the ONE! Even though our 9 day vacation here started a bit rocky as we arrived at 11:30pm to find they were overbooked and had to travel to Silversands for the night, the experience we had once we got back made it all forgive-able!! This was our best vacation yet. Love love loved it! So here is my review. ** will indicate a useful tip!! :) Room: was very nice, and we slept very well on the beds. Not the biggest rooms we have been in, but we didn't spend much time there! ** Tip the maid daily instead of waiting until the end of week. We tipped at end of week and didn't get a single towel animal or flowers on bed. We spoke to people who tipped daily and recd daily fun towel art and romantic words in petals on bed!!** Pool: was fabulous and the lounge chairs with umbrella were wonderful. Yes you have to get there early if you want a primo location, but if you didn't care, chairs weren't too hard to come by. The staff works very hard to make sure chairs aren't being saved all day with towels and no peeps. Give them a break. If you need help, just ask!! ** Get to know the "pool guys" that walk around wearing tan. Really great guys! ** Shout out to Kevin. Enjoyed his stories!! :) Hot Tubs: they are there... you just have to find them!! We found on last day...duh!! Beach: was gorgeous. Beautiful sand and crystal water. ** Tip: Bring some tortilla chips into the water with you. The fish will swarm you and eat right out of your hand. Just be careful tho.. my husband bent over into the water and one of them bit his nipple! lol** Entertainment: Wow.. they work LONG days and give it all they've got!! Loved the staff: Ci Ci, Uzy, Antonio, Giovani, etc. Go see the nightly shows!! **Loved Elvis & Rock of Ages.** Do some planned activities around the pool. We did the guacamole making, tequilla tasting, and pool games. **Take advantage of using the kyaks and have a guide take you out to the reef on a hobie cat! It is all included!** Food: Best we have had at an all inclusive resort. Fabulous. Tasty. Well presented. If you went hungry...shame on you! Breakfast: World Cafe: Omlet! Crepes! Waffles! Fresh Fruit! So much more! Lunch: We snacked most days at the Barefoot Grill: Guacamole and chips. Fresh fish, burgers, chicken, ribs. Plus they walked snacks and food carts around the pool at lunchtime too. Get a shrimp taco!! You can also order from Oceana and they will bring it to you poolside. Dinner: Loved Italian: parmesan crusted shrimp. Steakhouse: Get the T-bone. Oceana: Fabulous Tuna Steak. Himitsu: Make sure to book a "cooking" table through your concierge. Don't do a private side room table, not as fun. ** Ask your waiters what is the best to eat, they will tell you!! ** Make sure you stop into CoCo Cafe coffee shop and get a Frappachino Mocha YUMMY!** Room Service: Used once; Great food, great service. Dress: I never left the resort, and I went from swimsuit to dinner clothes. I never wore one of the eight pair of shorts I packed! My husband played golf so he needed shorts. Also, you will need some nicer clothes for dinner. I wore capri's most dinner nights, a skirt a couple of nights (saw alot of sun dresses). My husband wore long pants 5/9 nights, but was able to wear nice shorts to all outdoor dinners. (That would include Oceana, the steakhouse, and Italian if you sit outside, and the outdoor dinner buffets. Drinks: I think this is where I gained my 7lbs. Ugh. Fabulous. They would make them how you want them as well. If you want stronger or weaker, just ask! Listen to what others order, or ask a waiter what things are when you see them. Waiters carry a menu, but they do not have all the drinks on them! ** I loved frozen drinks: Miami Vice, Mango Tango, Dirty Monkey, Pina Colada, And Maroma Bay Breeze.** Spa: The spa structure and facility is incredilbe. If you book a treatment, make sure to go early and use spa area!! Had a wonderful massage and pedicure!! Fitness Center: adequate, nice equipment, perhaps they just need to turn up the air! Whew! **Make sure to pack plenty of sunscreen. Pricey at resort. I wore 30 all week and got a beautiful tan.** We were upgraded to Preffered Club. Not sure I would pay for it, but it was a nice perk since we didn't pay for it. It does have 3 computers and a printer, a bar, a tv, a few games, and snacks. But you can get most of that everywhere else!! Shops: I bought a sterling silver ring at jewelry store there and found it at the airport for $100 less. Bummer! We tipped everyone. You sure don't have to, but they work so darn hard! We spent probably $150 in tip $$. We brought $75 in ones with us and had to get more. It's amazing how appreciative they are for a buck or two!! You will not regret coming to this resort. We can't say enough about it. Well I guess I just did! :) Can't wait to go back!!

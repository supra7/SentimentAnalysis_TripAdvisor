The resort is absolutely gorgeous, with breathtaking views and beaches. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Each bungalow had its own concierge, there were waitstaff at both the beach and the pool, and the grounds were impeccable. As soon as we arrived we were offered a cool towel and a glass of champagne. There was no wait for the check-in. This was definitely the best all-inclusive resort we have ever stayed at, and we would certainly go back again.

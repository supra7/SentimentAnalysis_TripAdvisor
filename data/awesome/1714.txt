We were fortunate to stay in the new tower that had only been open for 3 months. The room was gorgeous, the bathroom immaculate. The bed was very comfortable. A great time. It is close to everything. We had room service, a little pricy (of course) but quickly delivered and very good. We did think it odd that the Daily Grill quit serving the main breakfast menu at 10:30am; other than that, we had a great time. We will be sure to stay there our next visit to Seattle.

We loved our stay at Hotel Vintage Park! I really love the little things they do that I totally appreciate. The animal print robes, the champagne glasses, the huge array of toiletries and the fact that you could call downstairs for a ton of other little things if you had forgotten something! Valet parking is expensive as always (i think $32ish). The decor was nice with a boutique feel, the room was clean & the bed was comfy. I will try to stay here next time I'm in Seattle!

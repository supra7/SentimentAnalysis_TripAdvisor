First off, the location of this hotel is wonderful. It's right next to the Westin, and you can stay here for a fraction of the price. Within a block or two, you're in the heart of the Seattle shopping district. The atmosphere is wonderful with stark color contrasts and nice furniture in the lobby. This is anything but a traditional hotel, and that's the reason we loved it. All the doors feature artwork, and local artists are featured predominantly throughout the hotel. I loved the eye chart at the end of the hallway. Nice touch! The bathrooms were nice, albeit the bath tub was small. The Red Fin restaurant next door also continued with the trendy atmosphere, and the late night happy hour was great upon returning to the hotel. The bad? Well, everything at the Hotel Max was on the small side. You can probably fit about 5-6 people in each elevator, and they are small. We had a room with a king size bed, and that pretty much took up most of the room. It doesn't matter, though, because we just wanted a comfortable place to stay, and the bed was ultra-comfortable with a choice of pillows. The bathroom was small, but really nice. Considering the small size, the did a great job laying things out. You could do a lot worse than Hotel Max, but given their pricing relative to other Seattle Hotels we looked at, this was really a great choice.

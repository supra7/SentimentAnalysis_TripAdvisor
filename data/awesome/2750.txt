The Hotel Vintage Park is the third Kimpton hotel we have stayed at. This is our new favorite hotel chain. The quality of rooms and service is consistently outstanding. Our room was quite spacious with two upholstered armchairs for sitting and an LG flat screen television. The bathroom was large and we enjoyed the use of the usual Kimpton bathrobes. We found the Vintage Park to be cozy and especially well-located for Seattle sightseeing. We enjoyed the nightly wine tasting, which is a feature of Kimpton hotels. This hotel had an attached garage for valet parking. We had our car parked here for our stay, taking it out for one day trip. Valet service was fast and courteous. A definitely recommended place to stay!

We stayed here overnight with our two kids (8 & 10). I was concerned about the price, but it was worth every penny. We had water view room and it was so nice to open the window and see the harbor and downtown. The kids fed the seagulls in the water below us. The beds were super comfortable and luxurious, and the other furnishings had a Northwest flair. My favorite part was the large bathroom with it's slate floor and powerful shower. They also have a shuttle that runs hourly to get you around. I will definitely stay at the Edgewater again.

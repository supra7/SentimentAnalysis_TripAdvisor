What can we say other than that this resort was FANTASTIC!!! The service was phenomenal with every employee saying hi as you walked by. Many of the staff we spoke with knew our names and room # and were so easy to talk to. They knew exactly what to do to make the stay wonderful. It was incredible to have a drink in my hand at every moment without even asking. I don't think I have ever had that kind of service EVER!! I know that tips were not required to give, but we just had to leave tips to everyone that treated us just because of all the added attention. We recommend this to anyone looking into Secrets Maroma. It also felt good to dress up at night and be treated like royalty by all the wait staff and then treated to nightly entertainment.

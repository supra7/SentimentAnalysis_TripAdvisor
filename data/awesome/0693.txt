For years we had wanted to travel to Alaska, We had a stopover in Seattle and wanted to stay somewhere special. After reading reviews of hotels we decided that Inn at the Market was the place to start "our trip of a lifetime" and we were not disapointed. The rooms were beautiful and staff extremely friendly. relaxing on the rooftop in the evening watching the sunset was really something special. We will stay there again and tell all our friends about this fabulous hotel.

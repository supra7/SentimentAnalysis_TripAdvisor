My husband and I just returned from 3 nights at this property. We booked an ocean view junior suite and were offered a reasonable price to upgrade to the honeymoon suite when we were checking-in. We took the offer and loved the honeymoon suite! The double balcony overlooking the beach and ocean alone was worth the additional price. We enjoyed every aspect of our trip. The service is outstanding and the food ranges from acceptable to exceptional. We noticed a few changes since our last trip here 2 years ago. The events staff is more involved with pool activities which created a higher noise level. The pool grill has been added and provides a great alternative for lunch and around-the-pool snacks. The kitchen is doing a great job bringing out trays of food that are carried around the pool until the trays are empty. The options are nearly limit-less! The buffet served a great dinner - which was not the case on our last visit (the buffet was closed for dinner at that time). I think 4 days here was great. I would come back for a trip of that length quarterly rather than spend a full week. We left Orlando on an 8am flight and were lounging by the pool in our swimsuits by 11:30am. We were decompressed by 8pm. We are home today and ready to tackle our jobs again! The trip was just what we needed! I would definitely book an ocean-front room again - but doubt I would pay full going-rate for the honeymoon suite that we thoroughly enjoyed. I can't wait to go back again!

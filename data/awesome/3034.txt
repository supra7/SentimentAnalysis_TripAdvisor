We stayed at the Hotel Max for 2 nights in August 2009. Although we had arrived early, a room was allocated to us straightaway by a very helpful member of staff which was great! The room itself (also as noted by other tripadvisor members) was small, but very cozy, clean and confortable. We loved the artwork (each room has a differerent themed door). The gym is great- one of the best hotel gyms I've used- has all the mod cons and as we used to get there early, we pretty much had exclusive use of it!! The hotel is in a great location, close to shopping, sightseeing, great restuarants. The airport shuttle stops at the Westin which is a couple of minutes away from the Hotel Max. Would definately stay here again if I return to Seattle.

My wife and I have been coming to the Mayan Riviera for about 10 years ( 3 times per year) and have stayed at many different resorts ( mostly 5 or 6 star rated). WOW is the only way I can describe this resort. From the superior staff , to the service, to the amenities, to the glorious beach and absolutely great restaurants. Thank you Maroma Beach, you will surely see us again in the near future.

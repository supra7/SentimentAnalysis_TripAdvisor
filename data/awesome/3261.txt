We found this hotel through the Jet Blue website and were very glad we did. We arrived at SeaTac late in the evening and wanted to just get a good night's sleep before driving to Bellingham the next morning. We found the shuttle easiliy. The driver was very friendly and careful (the shuttle itself was sure squeaky though). Having already made a reservation, check in was easy in the elegant lobby. The room (two queen beds in a bed room and a pull out sofa in the living room) easiliy accomodated our family of five. There was one standard bath and a microwave, coffeemaker and refrigerator. The linens were clean. The best part was the made to order breakfast. It was wonderful and my kids wanted to go back there the rest of the trip! Omelettes were made to order along with bacon, sausage, hashbrowns. On the "side" were juices, yogurt, hot beverages, cereal, fruit and breads. We would definitely stay there again.

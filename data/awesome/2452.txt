I got the Westin room for $85 bid on price line. It was an excellent value. The beds were comfy. No free internet in the room or in business center but they do in the lobby with your own laptop. Staff was nice and check in was fast and easy. It was a quick and easy monarail trip to the Space Needle we did not need to stay closer to it because you could be there in 5 minutes. It was also a 7 minute walk to Pike's Market.

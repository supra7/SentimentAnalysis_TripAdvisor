Honeymoon October 2011. Very relaxing resort with great service on all ends. Pools are great, beach is perfect, and rooms are also wonderful. Food and drinks were good (can't expect much better from an all-inclusive). A lot of activities if you want to stay busy, or plenty of places to relax. Barefoot grill by pools was the best lunch food we thought. Did not like Japanese restaurant much. Enjoyed mexican and italian restaurants. World buffet is great for breakfast (french toast, crepes were our favorites).

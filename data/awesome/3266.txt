We have recently decided to stay at Hampton Inns because we like their linens, the room layouts and the breakfast selections and flexibility. We had a very early flight and this hotel was convenient and affordable. We were a little concerned about previous reviews that mentioned airport noise, but we didn't hear any. I was expecting low-flying planes all night and it was very quiet. The front desk staff was great for our late checkin and breakfast had plenty of options for my breakfast-loving husband and for my lighter preferences. I highly recommend this Hampton if you need to stay near the airport. I would stay again.

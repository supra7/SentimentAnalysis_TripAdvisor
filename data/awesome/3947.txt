Wow. Where do I begin. This resorts is so beautiful. The service is outstanding. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Everyone who works at the resort will do anything to make your stay perfect. The beach and pool area always had chairs available. Waiters serve you on the beach and in the pool. Room service is very good!! Cannot wait to return. Make sure you bring pants guys, not aloud to wear shorts in the restaurants. We loved the Italian restaurant!! The world cafe has great breakfast buffet. So many choices! We signed up for preferred with Liberty Travel and it was worth it. You have a private lounge with a bar and appetizers all day. Also we got the private transfer from the airport, WORTH it! Got to our resort in 20 minutes. We had the van to ourselves and did not have to stop at other resorts.

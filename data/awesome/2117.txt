As it was our honeymoon, we backed our bed up against the window, flopped down on our stomachs like little kids and watched the Seattle waterfront and sunset slowly fade into evening...Nothing beats opening the windows and hearing the water lap at the pilings under the hotel and the cool breeze gently whistling by while your feet are warmed by the in-room fireplace. This is a definite anniversary return for additional lifelong-memories.

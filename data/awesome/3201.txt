We live in the Seattle area, but it's a 45 minute drive to the airport, so we often stay at the Doubletree near the airport on the night before an early morning flight. They have a 24-hour shuttle bus to the airport that leaves every 20 minutes and they will let you leave your car in their lot (for a fee -- look for deals for Park 'n' Fly on their web site) while you are gone. It worked out to about half the parking rate of the major airport lots, plus you get a good night sleep and some extra time in the morning. Rooms are big and clean. Not much view even from the "view" rooms, but that's not the point at the airport. We always see lots of flight crew staying at the hotel, so I take that as a good sign. Little or no airport noise, but we sleep better soundly. Staff have always been friendly. And they have warm cookies on check-in. Last time we were there, our teenager asked on the way to the airport, "Are we going to the cookie hotel again?" That pretty much says it all!

This place was fantastic!!! We read many reviews of this hotel before we booked it and they all had great things to say about the property and staff and every word of it is TRUE!! The property is beautiful, clean and luxurious. I really didn't want to leave and even as we were sitting by the pool we were planning out return trip next year. I truely believe the staff puts this hotel a cut above the rest. They really do go out of their way to make you feel welcome and relaxed and it seems that their primary goal there is to make sure you have a great time. Everyone we encountered was so friendly and helpful.....from the entertainment staff to the restaraunt staff to the housekeeping staff. They are always working so hard and it seems to me like they never sleep:) I would book this hotel again in a heartbeat and I am hoping to do that next year:)

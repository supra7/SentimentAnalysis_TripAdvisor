This hotel is stunning!! It has a pristine beach, and amazing pool that we found hard to leave! We stayed a week and there are plenty of food options especially for dinner, and not only is it delicious but I was pleasantly surprised to find you really feel like with each restaurant that you are in a lovely restaurant with great ambiance and so many options and great service! I cannot say enough good things about the service but the service at the pool in particular, especially Imelda, I swear when your drink was half full they were already coming by to see if you needed anything, but not in an intrusive way, also a small tip will go a long way with the staff they are very appreciative! The resort was so calm and relaxing, very quiet but in a good way, lots of couples no large rowdy groups, I would recommend to anyone and hope we are fortunate to return someday!!!

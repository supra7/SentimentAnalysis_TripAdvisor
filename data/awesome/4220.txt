We have been to Mexico 4 times and this was the best yet!!. The hotel was fantastic. We could not find any faults with this hotel. The staff could not do enough for you. The food was out of this world. The entertainment was so well done, and very enjoyable. The beach WOW!!! The rooms were spotless. Every member of staff was outstanding in our opinion. I miss it so much and would go back in a heart beat. Hope to go back soon.

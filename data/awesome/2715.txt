This hotel is located right in the middle of downtown Seattle and is only a few blocks away from all the great eateries/bars/restaurants/pubs, etc. The staff are extremely friendly and very accommodating in fulfilling the guests' needs. The highlight of the stay simply has to be the free wine-tasting offered in the lobby each evening to guests. There are fabulous Washington wines that you can sample for an hour which is also the perfect time to talk to fellow-guests and socialize in a cozy setting by the fireplace. Overall, this hotel is a gem and I wouldn't miss an opportunity to stay here.

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Andra for six nights to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and enjoy the sites in downtown Seattle. We absolutely loved the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. There was so much to do, so many great places to eat and so much within walking distance. We walked to a Mariners baseball game, to Pike's Place, to the waterfront to catch a ferry to Bainbridge Island and even stopped by the funky public library. Our Queen suite was huge and clean. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. The bathroom was huge and had great shelving space and an oustanding two headed shower. The extra space in the room allowed us to enjoy breakfast in our room most mornings. The walk in closet was outstanding and provided great storage. We never heard any other guests and were always treated kindly by the helpful staff. There was construction going on in the building next door that started early in the morning. But, we are from a big city and are used to outside noise - so that wasn't too much of a problem. Overall - what an amazingly convenient, luxurious, and comfortable hotel!

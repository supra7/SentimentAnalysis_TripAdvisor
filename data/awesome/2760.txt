Booked this hotel for my Easter trip to Seattle through expedia.com. For the price offered, all other options were two star, so I was surprised to find Vintage Park. Read a little about it here on trip advisor before booking, and the response seemed overwhelmingly positive - which was not without reason. I came from across the pond, and arrived in late and shattered. In the lobby I was met with a big smile and really pleasant, easy going young staff. Stayed five nights in a King Premier room, which was big enough for me to put up a circus tent. The bed was huge and comfortable, everything was neat and clean, and there was no street noise of any significance, so I slept like a baby every night. Signed up for the free Kimpton InTouch program before arriving, which meant access to really fast internet, and a few other goodies. Every afternoon there is a complimentary wine tasting session in the lobby, which became a pleasant daily pit stop for me, where I got the chance to chitchat a little with the ever friendly staff, and enjoy some fine Washington produce. The hotel as an excellent location (right across the street from the Seattle Public Library) and is in walking distance of everything worth to see in downtown Seattle, from Qwest Field to the Space Needle. I can't recommend Hotel Vintage Park enough. Not a single thing annoyed or inconvenienced me here, and that is a first for me. On the contrary it is terrific value for money, and has the most genuinely pleasant staff.

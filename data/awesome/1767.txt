Sixth Avenue Inn is a needle in a hay stack in the hotel world. Not only are their employees helpful and welcoming, the hotel itself is clean and comfortable. I have stayed at many hotels across Canada and the United States and Sixth Avenue Inn takes the cake for the best staff and overall best experience.

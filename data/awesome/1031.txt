This is my hotel of choice for a couples weekend in Seattle. Excellent rooms and service. (try and get a corner room on a high floor) They have plush robes. This hotel has the romance of an older generation, done right. (elegant not stuffy!) We walk everywhere downtown and to the Pike Place Market. Don't miss it if you're staying in Seattle!

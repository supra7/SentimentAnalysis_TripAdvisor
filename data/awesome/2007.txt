My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Edgewater Hotel. We had a great time. The room was great and the bathroom was terrific. Huge shower, big enough for 2. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the water. The view was amazing. We had the best time at happy hour. The waitresses are terrific and fun, and the view is spectacular. The food was really great especially Armondine's salumi platter, the cod fish and chips, and the blackberry wings. At lunch or dinner, try the clam chowder. We had it for lunch, and it was Yummy! There is a free shuttle that leaves every hour on the hour to take you to places close by. That was great. The hotel is within walking distance for Pikes Place Market and other things, if you like to walk. Overall, we had a great time and would love to go back.

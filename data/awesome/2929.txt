The hotel is in a very convenient part of town, just behind the Fairmont Olympic. It's a few blocks to Pike Place market and to the downtown core. I was upgraded when I checked in (I'm a Starwood Gold) which was great because I stayed here only due to some free promo nights I received that were about to expire. The rooms are not large but they have their version of the "Heavenly Bed". All the room furnishings look great and even their stationary was impressive. The bathroom accessories are Bliss, which is supposed to be a boutique brand. The hallways are downright dark but I realize that's the nature of the hotel so I accept it. One thing that got on my nerves is the elevator "ding". It's very loud & I could hear it although I was in a corner room about as far away from the elevator as you could get. The W is a new hotel & that's why I chose it. The surrounding hotels are very old. I didn't eat here but the lounge and restaurant looked "cool". One BIG issue that I had was the valet parking. When you park, you're not allowed to self-park. Upon receiving my car when I was checking out, there was a large scratch. Ok, I filled out the claim form but I was visibly upset. The valet people kept telling me it would be ok, they'll take responsibility, and for me to "go home" and wait for their call. Well, I think it was just to get me out of their hair because I received a call a few days later from them disowning all responsibility. To make a long story short, I e-mailed the GM and Starwood HQ of the problem and they fixed it immediately. Not many hotels go that extra mile but the W certainly did!

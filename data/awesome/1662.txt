The Sheraton Hotel was everything we expected it to be. The room was large, decorated beautifully, great view out the window, sparkling clean bathroom with fluffy white towels. The King size bed had loads of soft cuddly pillows with the softest sheets and comforter to nestle under at night. We wanted to take the bed home when we left the hotel. What a great location...we were within a short walking distances to all the tourist attractions....many wonderful restaurants were close by. If you needed transportation....it was pretty much everywhere you looked. Plenty of buses, cabs, tour buses in every which way. We enjoyed our stay at Sheraton and would recommend this Hotel to anyone who was planning to stay a few days in Seattle. It lived up to our expectations.

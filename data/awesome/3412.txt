This hotel is right across the street from the airport, but is very quiet. Room was immaculate, bathroom adequate, bed was very comfortable and bedding was white and cozy. Very nice room set up in the king room, with very large work desk. Internet was free but very weak when far from the router. If you need to do a lot of work via internet, ask for a room with good bandwidth.

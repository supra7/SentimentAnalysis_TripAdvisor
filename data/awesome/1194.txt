If you want to stay in downtown Seatlle, I recommend the Mayflower Park in every way. Great staff, excellent room, central location. The hotel is "getting on in years" so if you want a 5 year old Sheraton this is not for you. I enjoyed every moment of y stay in the Mayflower Park from the great check-in staff to the Queen suite to the breakfast and bar staff.

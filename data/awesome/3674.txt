I usually don't write reviews but my experience at the hotel was so exceptional that i just had to share. This hotel was perfect in every way. The service was top notch, and everyone was so friendly. The food was excellent, the room was beautiful (we had a swim out room) and the beach was gorgeous. Celebrated my birthday with a dinner on the beach in our own private white linen draped cabana, so romantic. I highly recommend this place for couples looking for a very romantic, high end resort. Can't wait to go back!

We arrived earlier than expected (11 am) and were going to leave the car and check in at the regular time (3 pm), but the staff checked and our room was ready ahead of schedule - perfect! The room was large, with a sofa, and desk, and plenty of walking space (we got the king room). The pillows were comfortable, as was the bed, and fellow travelers - major tip: join stash rewards, and you get free wifi (for the complaints about this from other reviewers - all you had to do was go to their website, they advertise it openly). finally, walking distance to pike place, great restaurants (sitka and spruce blew our minds), etc.

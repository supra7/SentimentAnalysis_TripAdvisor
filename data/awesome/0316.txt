We have been staying at the Warwick on and off for a number of years. It has always been a consistant experience and always a good value. Most of the time we stayed it would be for an overnight and would stay at other hotels if we were in town longer. My past two visits have been impressive. The recent renovations are fabulous and I highly recommend spending a little more for the new executive rooms. The staff has always been outstanding and now I am happy the accomadations are catching up to the services. Book thru the hotel for the best rates.

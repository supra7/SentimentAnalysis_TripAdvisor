We stayed at Le Crystal for a long weekend in one of the two room suites (512). The room was excellent and spotless, included two flat screens, a comfortable living area and bedroom. Microwave, dishware, espresso maker were all in the room and the bathroom was huge, with double sinks, stand up shower and separate tub. Staff was very friendly and helped us find a great sushi spot (called Zen-Ya which we highly recommend. It's a little hard to find, but worth it once you get inside). Angelo's Italian) was also very good. We parked in the valet for $26/day, although there is outdoor parking across the street at $10/day if you don't mind the open lot. The gym and roof top were great as well. We thought the hotel is in the best location out of most of the other top choices, just around the corner from Crescent. We will definately stay here again when back in Montreal.

Excellent things can grow from excellent ideas. Though it doesn't always succeed or grow on a smooth path, it is awesome to watch a concept transform and breed new iterations of the original. That's how I would frame the Ace Hotel phenomena that's swept from west to east. I'm very familiar with the New York offspring of this Seattle original. Very cool, celeb chef in their restaurant, lounge for a lobby and some serious partners names partnered up: Stumptown Coffee in the front, Opening Ceremony in the back and more I'm sure to come. All that swagger grew out of an original hotel in Seattle. One which still offers excellent pricing for both European-style rooms (ahem, bathroom outside of the room) and Deluxe suites ($199 and worth every penny). The staff is friendly and accommodating; though please remember that the front door locks at midnight so grab that key before hitting the town! The modern design and simple but ultra cool decor feels opulent in comparison to your run of the mill big box hotels. WiFi is free to use and besides your room, you can choose to work in the front shared area with the terrarium or event downstairs in the dining area. Oh yea, in addition to WiFi and super sweet rooms, they offer a continental breakfast that includes a waffle maker and Stumptown Coffee. And a copy of the New York Times. Location-wise, it's just outside of the touristy area so Pike Place Market is only a 15 minute stroll away and the streets are very walkable. In my opinion, there's no better place to stay in Seattle for that price! Don't mess with an original.

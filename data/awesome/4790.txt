We have been to alot of all inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico and by far Secrets Maroma Beach is the best! Highly recommend a swim out suite - we were in building 15 which was ideally located for both the pools, beach, restaurants and entertainment. Food was excellent in all the restaurants. Best part you don't have to get up early to make reservations (like at Riu resorts). No reservations (except at Himitsu - for the Teppanyaki table). If you go dinner before 8 p.m. - probably will be seated immediately - if not given a beeper to let you know when your table is ready. Entertainment was the best we have had at an all inclusive. If flying from St. Louis, MO highly recommend flying USA 3000 - non stop - 3 hour flight. Only bad thing is flying home - have to leave resort at 7:25 a.m. for a 10:45 a.m. flight - this is due to the airport rules - not Secrets Maroma Beach.

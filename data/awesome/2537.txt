We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in July and it was perfect. We booked it on [--] for 279/night, which i believe was worth it. The room was comfortable, clean, and has all the Westin trademarks, heavenly beds, heavenly bath, etc. the view from our room was awesome, since the hotel is round shaped, everyone will always have a great view of the city (unless you are on the lower floors). THE DOWNSIDE to this hotel is the parking fee. 40 dollars a DAY. it hurt, but we did not want to park our car across the street because we were on a road trip and had too much stuff in it (plus seattle is known to be high on the list for stolen cars). other than the parking, the hotel was in a great location, you can walk to the harbor, the market, shopping, absolutely great location. with the superior quality rooms, nice lobby, fast elevators, great service, i enjoyed the Westin Seattle!

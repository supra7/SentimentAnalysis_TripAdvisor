Booked for my first couple of nights in Seattle - wonderful position easy to find having got the train into town after flying in. Comfortable rooms, very clean and very friendly staff. Free Wifi throughout with a strong signal. Two on site choices - Mediterranean restaurant or Olivers which has bar snacks and great selection of cocktails, liquor and wine. As its downtown then its minutes to any shopping or restaurants - and only a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market. Perfect start to my holiday.

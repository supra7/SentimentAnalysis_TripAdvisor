After a weeklong conference in Wenatchee, my husband met me in Seattle for a weekend getaway. We stayed at the Hotel Andra after reading reviews on TA. It was a fabulous hotel. The staff were very nice and helpful as we had never been to Seattle before. The hotel was in an amazing location -- we walked to Pike's Market, the space needle and all around downtown. The room was huge and had been recently renovated in a very modern style. The best part was the proximity to 3 of Chef Tom Douglas' restaurants. We tried all three -- The Dahlia Lounge, Serious pie and Lola, which is in the hotel. All were fabulous. Highly recommend the hotel and we will be back.

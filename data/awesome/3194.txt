I would have to say the DoubleTree Seatle Airport is one of the enicest DoubleTrees I have ever stayed at. There is free airport shuttle service from the airport which I think is every 20 minutes and about 5 minute ride. The front desk employees are so nice and helpful. They great each person with a smile which is nice. I would have to say they treat Diamond guest better than some HIlton and Conrads hotels. The room are very spacious and clean.

We booked this resort in late August 2010 after much research and reading the reviews posted here. I will try not to repeat everything that has been said other than to say our vacation was PERFECT! Thanks to all previous reviewers for tips and recommendations. We booked the Preferred Club and we were not disappointed. The Preferred Club lounge was fantastic and we enjoyed going there in the evening before dinner. We enjoyed all of the restaurants. I cannot pick a favourite as they were all very good. The food quality was very good and service was excellent. We took advantage of a behind the scenes kitchen tour and I was impressed with the cleanliness. Room was gorgeous. The beach was beautiful. The grounds were spectacular. I think I have exhausted all of the adjectives to describe this resort!!!!!!!! We hope to return someday soon.

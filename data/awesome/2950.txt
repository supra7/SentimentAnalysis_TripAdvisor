Stayed at this hotel in January of 2011 for a week during our honeymoon and we loved this place's atmosphere. Each room is so unique with they nice paintings and the hotel hallways are fantastic. He went by each floor's hallway just to see all the pictures on the doors. Location is great right in the heart of Seattle where you can walk to anyplace. Many good restaurants close by. I would definately recomend and If I go to Seattle again I will be sure to stay the the hotel Max.

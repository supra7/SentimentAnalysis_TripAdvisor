Firstly, I can easily recommend this property. It is an all suite property for a price that would get you a nice room at similar hotels in the city. The suite we stayed in reminded me of a nice executive corporate apartment, which I believe the developer was selling within the higher floors of this building. Several days prior to arrival, I called to request dinner reservations, including a late reservation for Au Pied de Cochon. They pulled through, which I really appreciated. An unfortunate event during our stay was out of the hotel's control. The city has a planned water shut off, which interfered with our ability to get ready in the morning. It seemed like it took hours for the rusty water to clear out of the system. But it did give me an additional appreciation of the very large bathroom with a large separate enclosed shower and top notch hardware. Toiletries were very high quality. I wish the management had been of greater assistance. All they offered were two small bottles of their house label water. Lunch downstairs was a good bargain, but was of just okay quality. Location is on de la Montagne, but seemed to be a little on the edge of the most desirable segment of this street.

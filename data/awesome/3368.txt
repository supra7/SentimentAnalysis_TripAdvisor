What a great place to stay for an overnight . I would have stayed longer if my flight wasn't the next day. The beds are the best...very comfortable. The bathroom is nice and large and the rooms are a great size. If you don't want to pay for wireless in your room just go to the very comfortable lobby and boot up your computer from there.

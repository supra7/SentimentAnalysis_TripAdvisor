We set the trip up for some R&R and that's exactly what we got. Our stay could not have been improved other than if it was longer. The room was clean and the bed was perfect. The staff was wonderfull. Everyone was extremely friendly and eager to assist. The food was to die for. The selection of restaurants was worldly. Just remeber to bring enough casual dress clothes (long pants for men) as most of the restaurants require them. Looking forward to going back!!

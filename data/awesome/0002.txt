My mother who is 90 and I stayed one night on our way to Virginia Beach, VA. While she can walk-she can't walk far and also needs a bathroom made for handicapped people. We stayed in one of those rooms on the first floor. It was very helpful for my mom. We also had the breakfast buffet. It was very reasonably priced and very delicious. My brother-in-law who lives in Baltimore recommended this hotel and I will too! Great Place!

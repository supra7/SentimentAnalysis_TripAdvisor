hecking in late at night, the front desk staff were still cheerful and welcoming! Our room was well equiped to meet our needs. I needed to check the internet and found the small business area delightful, tho staff had obviously found it to be very war and set up a fan - thank goodness! After foing around the dorner the next AM for breakfast, we wished we had ordered room service. nstead of getting into the tourist scene rght away. The Watson Kennedy Shop nearby is a treasure!

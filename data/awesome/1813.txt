Every year I meet a friend for a "Seattle Night", we've stayed numerous places throughout the years always looking for a holiday package that is both a good value and offers a luxurious stay. The beds were very comfortable, the linens deluxe, and the service outstanding. Valet service was prompt and parking costs were included. The connected restaurant (Lola) has superb food. The location is perfect for pretty much any Seattle activity. We'd stay there again!

My wife and I spent a long weekend at the W hotel in Seattle this last week. The hotel certainly lives up to it's reputation in the world of travels! The staff and the concierge, Andrew Franks, did an outstanding job of making sure our trip was one of the great ones of all our travels! The hotel ranks right up there with the best of the best, and that is saying a lot for a guy that has been all over North America as a pro pilot!! Everything we requested for on the trip was taken care of by the staff and Andrew Franks. Nothing is left to chance by the hotel and the management and staff and it shows in the complete package of a well managed and smooth operation. Once again, thanks for a fun long weekend and support for all our needs for the trip to and from the Seattle area!!!!

It's close to everything. About a block from Westlake shopping center (and the monorail to Seattle Center), about two or three blocks from the light rail and Westlake bus terminal, about three blocks from the shopping district, about 5 blocks from Pike's Place, and within a block or two of a lot of great restaurants (Lola, Dahlia Lounge, Serious Pie, etc.). If you only plan on doing stuff in downtown, there's no need to get a rental car if you book here. Typical Starwood rooms.

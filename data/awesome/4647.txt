Very nice resort. Our concierge, Sebastian, is GREAT! Very deserving of a raise when his review is due. Resort was very clean, employees treated us with respect and were very nice. The only downfall: they were filming for either a commercial, a movie, or whatever. It made us wait for a few hours to access the main pool one day and even worse: decided to film 7:30am one morning in the room right above us. Very noisy with hammering and preparation of filming. Overall: noisy mornings in our building. I would definitely recommend checking if there are any filming or other construction going on first before booking.

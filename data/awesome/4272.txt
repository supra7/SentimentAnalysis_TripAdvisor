Such has been the service by everyone concerned at Secrets, Maroma I felt compelled to convey our appreciation of what has been an outstanding holiday. Nothing, absolutely nothing has been left wanting. I am so impressed with every single hotel employee. Everyone was polite, courteous, offered a smile and a hola every time our paths crossed. All employees walked the talk as though it was their personal objective was to make our stay the best ever. Waiters remembered our names on return visits. All rooms were superbly appointed, spotlessly clean and well equipped. All restaurants were authentically themed and the waiters brilliant, sociable, humorous and attentive to every detail. The pool area was drop dead gorgeous, very clean and the waiters again always so willing to serve, no matter if in the well populated area or remotely on a four poster bed in the dunes. We felt we were treated like a king and queen. Several individuals were key to our wonderful experience, the concierges Elizabeth and Yessica, always so warm and friendly, Kevin the pool attendant from the moment he politely explained the rules of sunbed reserving to times of idle chatter, Adriana, Angie, Joe and the head concierge  Ivan. Will we go to Secrets, Maroma againABSOLUTELY. Were already booking for May 2012

We got a great deal online for this hotel, we've stayed at other 3 star ones in the area but this one was the best location by far. Just a block or two to almost anything (movies, malls, etc) and 5 blocks to Pike Market. Much cheaper than comparable 3 stars that are further away (5-8 blocks walk to centre), the only 'down' side is the smaller rooms and bathroom, wouldn't recommend it for families for that reason, but for one or two people per room it's great. Really nice bed, pillows, linens, robes, TV and Aveda products! Definitely a great deal for the heart of Seattle. Also nice that it has art and photography in rooms and hallways.

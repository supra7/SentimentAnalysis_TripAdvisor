we needed a place to stay one night before a cruise....we wanted near the airport as we were travelling with 3 young children (3.5 yrs and below).....their van got us at the airport and all our bags (11 of us travelling together)....rooms were huge....everything was very nice....quiet for by the airport....we can't speak for the neighborhood as we didn't leave the property (van-ned the next a.m. to cruise pier)....my only criticism was restaurant was way expensive....if your travelling with kids like we were or on a budget, the restaurant was mucho bucks...not family friendly at all (seemed like good food, but....)

The Inn at the Market has a perfect location for those who appreciate unique aspects of Seattle... Pike Market, water, views, cafes, shops, galleries, and a diverse population. The Inn offers excellent accommodations and service, handsome design, and a sweet entrance through a courtyard. We did not use their concierge services, because we are familiar with Seattle and have family there, but they are prepared to guide the first-timer. The Business Center is free for guests and well equipped. Rooms with water views are highly recommended, even though more expensive. And check out the roof deck on the 5th floor.... views to Puget Sound and the Olympic Mts.! To die for!

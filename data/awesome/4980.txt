Stayed here late Feb-early March for our 25th. We were booked for a preferred club jr suite ocean view. I had requested building 25 based on info I got on TA, but had also requested a honeymoon suite as a "reach". We were pleasantly surprised when the check in girl at the preferred club told us "building 17, honeymoon suite!". This whole resort is awesome. We only left for 1 day, and went to Puerto Morelos for some "cultural interaction". Other than that. we never had a need to leave.Some quick notes: Spa- you just NEED to get a massage here during the week. very relaxing. Very difficult to say no to Erin anyway... Restaurants- Not 5 star, but good for all inclusive- Himitsu was our favorite. Pool- Not the best I have ever been to, but more than adequate. tough to complain about floating around with a drink in your hand.. Beach- Best ever, and we have been to a majority of the Carribean and Hawaiian islands. Service- Top notch- I don't know if the management pays a little more here than other all inclusives, but you get the sense that the entire staff truly loves their jobs. Last but not least, a gold star to: Luca, our 17 concierge.. my only complaint is that we cant find anyone at home to take care of us like that.. Neydi- lobby bar- I f we had a cocktail waitress like you where I live, I would be there every day. Always keep that smile!! Diego- Pool- thanks for the constant supply of drinks, especially around closing.... Rafael Cordova--- Mr Cordova, I stopped in the preferred club a few times to thank you personally for considering my requests, but you were not there.. You made a great trip perfect! And a 5 pm "cheers" to Katie, John, Kyle, and Vanessa.. Good times! WE WILL BE BACK NEXT MARCH FOR OUR 26TH!!!

We decided to spend our 6th anniversary at Secrets after some pretty exhaustive research. I'm pleased to say the resort lived up to it's expectations. The grounds are immaculate and very well cared for. The spa is out of this world. The beach is the perfect. The food was very good. We liked the French and Italian restaurants the best. The entertainment was very good, American Idol was rather amusing. I can't say enough good things about the staff. Each and every staff member makes you feel welcome. Even the grounds crew would stop there work for each guest that past by to say hola. There was only one negative that I can think of and even that was no big deal. Upon check in I turned on a light heard a pop and the the entire room lost power. It took maybe 30 minutes for the staff to diagnose the problem and fix it. Also every room had a motion sensor that turns off the power if it senses that no one is in the room. Apparently ours was not programmed correctly and the fans and alarm clock would turn off at night. Again no big deal. Coming home from Maroma was very hard to do. Upon arriving back home it took us a couple of days to overcome what I can only describe as depression. We both wanted so badly to go back to Maroma. Maroma

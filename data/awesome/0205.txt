Selected by family members for the post-cruise overnight wind down before cross country travel the next day. The cruise was port intensive and no one was looking to tour Seattle with a lot of luggage. What we really needed when we got off the ship was a nap!. The front desk checked us in at 10 am and apologized that we were not on the same floor. They even had a goldfish and animal print robe ready and waiting for the grandchild. Room: tasteful and excellent bedding. (Monaco Suite). Bathroom: airy and spotless. Minibar: coupon with check in for $10 in goodies (minibar snacks are off limits after a disgraceful pigout resulting in a god-awful bill). 20% discount for riding AMTRAK + taxi voucher to train station. 2 blocks from light rail. 1.3 miles to cruise terminal. Excellent restaurant. Service oriented and professional staff.

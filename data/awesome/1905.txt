Great friendly service with first rate accommodations in downtown Seattle. Close to everything a person would want to see. Quiet and spacious rooms that served me and my whole family without the slightest inconvenience. The atmosphere is modern, classy with the finishing touches you come to expect from a great hotel. I am a frequent visitor to the Seattle area and will always stay at Hotel Andra.

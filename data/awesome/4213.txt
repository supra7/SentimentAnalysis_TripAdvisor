The overall trip was amazing. Couldn't have asked for a better resort. This was the most friendly staff and elegant surroundings that we've ever encountered in the Riviera Maya area and pretty much anywhere else for that matter. Loads of fun activities planned for you throughout the entire day, which of course are all optional, including a wide variety of activities such as sand volleyball, sand soccer, tennis, batting cages, archery, kayaking, snorkling, wine tasting, tequila tasting, poker tournaments, billiards/darts tournaments, pool aerobics, dancing lessons, spanish lessons, etc. The activities change daily and are all completely free. The best part of the resort in our opinion was the food. Multiple restaurants available for each meal, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Every meal we had was amazing, compairable to the best meals we've ever had in the states. And as good as the entrees were, the desserts were better. And room service 24-hours a day is included, and was well utilized by us. The grounds are beautiful, the beach is the best in the area with sand like powdered sugar and water that looks like a postcard. The spa was incredible and very affordable with the spa credits that they provide upon check-in. Overall, we would recommend that everybody visit this place at least once in their life, you won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.

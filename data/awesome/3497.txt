My fiance and I had our enaggement party recently at Hotel Le Crystal. When the general manager Gino Mourin assured me that he and his staff would create a wow factor...he wasn't kidding. Although I already knew how elegant a venue Le Crystal was and the details of the afternoon affair, I didn't expect my jaw to drop upon walking in to our engagement party at La Coupole restaurant on the mezzanine and terrace. The set up was spectacular from the beautifully decorated buffet, and the cocktails waiting for guests to arrive, to the gorgeous layout outside on the beautiful terrace. The already classy, elegant restaurant was transformed into an even more elegant venue thanks to the incredible general manager who assured a beautiful affair and to all the hard working staff. All the staff were tremendously professional, helpful, friendly and did not stop working tremendously hard throughout the event from the wait staff, to the bar staff and hostesses and hosts. They all did such an incredible job! Hats go off to the chef and his team who worked incredibly hard and created delicious food both in presentation and taste! I cannot thank the staff involved enough for this beautiful affair that we had, which we will remember forever. I highly recommend having any special occasion at this beautiful 5 star hotel!

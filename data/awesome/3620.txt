we just recently stayed at the destiny palms hotel in kissimmee fl and had one of the best experiences of staying at a hotel. My daughter's softball team competed at the USSSA world series, Chuck and his staff were amazing, it was probably one of the best times I have had. Thanks Chuck we won't stay any where else when we come back.

I would highly recommend Secrets Maroma Beach! We booked directly with the Hotel, as promised, transportation was waiting for us at the airport with our names on a sign and wisked us into a van right to the hotel.The staff worked tirelessly to ensure we were happy and content. Our room was on the 2nd floor and as others have said, mostly we had a view of the trees and some noise from those folks below us with the swim out rooms. However, that did not stop us from taking lovely pre-dinner naps on the balcony...mmm, paradise. The food was excellent with managable portions so you never left feeling stuffed. The beach was unbelievable as was the warm, clear, water. Others have complained about the mosquitos but we did not even need the gallons of bug spay that we brought with due to previous complaints. Room temp was also great but we found the breeze off the ocean was refreshing enough to sleep with just the screen open on the balcony. We were also well prepared to ward off the time share folks and found that a simple no got the job done. If you booked already, you are going to have a great time, and if you did not book, what are you waiting for!!

Like fine wine, SMB has gotten better with time. My wife and I travel a lot and this place is one of the few that get our repeat business. Our first trip here was right after they opened and we have been coming back ever since. This place is hard to beat. SMB just keeps getting better. They now paddle around the pool in a canoe handing out food at lunch. That is how over-the-top the service is. Other things have gotten better over time, as well. The landscaping is now exceptional with lots of mature, exotic plants attracting birds and wildlife. The beach chairs have thick padding. They also moved the gym and made it bigger and nicer. Oh, and they served plenty of FREE lobster on this trip. This was a big gripe for those loyal to Iberostar Grand (IG), since SMB used to have lobster for a surcharge while it was free at IG. Well done SMB, well done!!!

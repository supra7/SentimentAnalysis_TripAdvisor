I stayed here with a friend for 1 night before our cruise. The location is great, just a couple of blocks away from pike market and the space needle not far either. The room was clean and very morden. We booked a room without the bathroom as we were staying for just 1 night. The shared bathrooms where very nice and always clean. The lady at reception was very help. The only thing I would say is that there was no lift!!!! However, staff at the hotel do help with the bags.

Just returned from Secrets and we were totally impressed. The staff was superb, as we were waited on like we were royalty. The rooms were clean and the food was very good. Our favorite part of the day was when the staff would walk around with appetizers and desserts pool side. It was awesome to have drinks replenished constantly by very kind staff. Everyone serving you with a smile. The main pool was warm but they also had a cool pool. They ran 2 for one specials at the spa which was fantastic and affordable. Everyone loved their massages and talked about how relaxing the entire experience was. We definitely will return next year! This is our new favorite all adult inclusive resort.

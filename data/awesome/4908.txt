Lovely stay - very romantic and all we hoped for. We really enjoyed the attention to details, such as the room service option: private box delivery instead of having to answer the door when room service was delivered. We found the grounds beautiful, the "spicy aromas" sensual and the overall experience amazing. We thought the swim-out pool room was lovely to look at and spent some time on our patio - however, when we return, we expect to spend the extra money on a ocean view/ocean front room. We really didn't use the swim-out pool much. We hope to return soon.

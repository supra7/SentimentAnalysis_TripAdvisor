My husband took months to research and find us the perfect spot for our anniversary, our first trip without the kids. He used Trip Advisor and found us what looked like Heaven on Earth. Upon arrival we realized the photos and all the information online were accurate! Everything was incredibly clean, the servers were incredibly accommodating (they said "It's a pleasure" to our every request!), and the food was delicious (especially the amazing breakfast buffet). The infinity pool by the ocean was our favorite place to float around in the morning. The beach was clean and beautiful. There was enough to do without leaving the resort, which is what we were looking for. Highly recommend paying the little extra to be a Preferred Member, as that clubhouse was another favorite spot to sit and check email, play a game or read a book, all with a full bar and air conditioning when you need a break from the sun. Our room was gorgeous (and very clean!), and sitting on the balcony was almost like sitting on the beach. Can't say enough good things about it!

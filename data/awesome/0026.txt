We made last minute reservations (day before) for an overnight in Seattle. The benefits of being a Kimpton In-touch member certainly paid off, we had a decent rate, free parking and a $20 dinning credit. The room was beautiful we love how each room is a bit different and it's not like the "standard" whenever you stay at a Kimpton, unless the standard is "cool"! We had very friendly and helpful service from when we dropped the car off at valet all the way to check out the following morning. When we dropped off the car we mentioned that we'd need a taxi in about 30 mins, as soon as we came back out the valet mentioned that he hadn't been able to get a taxi yet, but that there was a town car available that would take us where we needed to go for the same price as a taxi. Bonus! A very nice gentleman then took us to Queen Anne and it was much more pleasant than a taxi. We just appreciated that on a busy Saturday night the valet actually remembered that we had requested a taxi.

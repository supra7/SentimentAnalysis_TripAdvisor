My husband and just returned from 10 days at Secrets Maroma, and we had the best time. The service was great the food was good, and really liked the passed hors-dourves at lunch time. We found the service level the best of any resort we have visited over the last 12 years. I would like commend Paulo (pool concierge) Lydia at the Lobby bar, Roger our personnal concierge, Alex, Barbara, and the entire entertainment staff. They really went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a good time and your needs were met. I especially liked the ariel arobics with Antonio. Management should be very pleased with the job the have done in recruiting the best people to enteract with your guest. We are looking forward to seeing everyone again next fall. Congrats on a job well done by the entire staff.

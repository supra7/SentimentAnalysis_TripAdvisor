What a fantastic weekend in Seattle and what a perfect hotel to spend it in! A classic case of old world charm meets new world panache, Sorrento hosted 100 great friends engaging in life, libations and language without a hitch. In fact, without a concern as well. I can't say enough about the staff, the rooms and the spirit. We believed in Sorrento and Sorrento believed in us. I now have my Seattle hotel.

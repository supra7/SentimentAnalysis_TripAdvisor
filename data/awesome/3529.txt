Celebrated our 10th anniversary at this great spot in Montreal. Located right across from Bell Center so it was perfect for the concert we attended. Staff and other guests at the hotel were very pleasant and atmosphere was tranquil yet funky. Fitness center and pool were very nice as well. Looking forward to returning.

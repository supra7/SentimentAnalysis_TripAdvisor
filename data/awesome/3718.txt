This is a wonderful hotel. Adults only. The service was great, the views were great...I truly have nothing bad to say about this hotel. Make sure you schedule to do some activities, they are fun and exciting! The beach area is very clean and at this time of year, not very busy. Watch out for any of the random vendors that show up. There are a couple that were there on a daily basis. Their prices were fine and you didn't have to haggle with them. The vendors that show up at night and set up are not worth going to. You'll find the same items for half the price when you go through the airport to leave. Don't waste your time. The rooms are large and they keep the fridges well stocked. If you are not a fan of expresso, then I would suggest getting your coffee with breakfast. We had trouble running that machine. Again, this place is amazing. Make sure you make time to visit here!

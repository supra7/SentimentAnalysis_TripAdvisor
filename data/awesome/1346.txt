The Executive Hotel Pacific was a gem and is located within blocks of all the sights of Seattles city center. Built in 1928, the Pacific Executive Hotel has been restored to a wonderful level of comfort and has a Seattle's Best Coffee bar on its ground floor level. We selected the hotel as our starting point for our visit to the Pacific Northwest prior to our Alaskan cruise. The Hotel's location, it's nightly stay price point and it's website photos of the hotel were major factors for our choice of this property. We reserved two rooms online and got superb rates by navigating to the Manager's special section of their website. Our nightly room rate was $110.00 + tax and was a very good find for the location in the downtown of Seattle. The rooms were smartly decorated and took advantage of some of the historical features of the property like the vintage inset tiles in the floors of the bathrooms. Guests will find ample hot water in the bathrooms and the guest ammenities (towels, shampoos, soaps, etc.) were top quality. From the time of our arrival until our departure the staff provided friendly and attentive service. In conclusion, the Executive Hotel Pacific in the downtown of Seattle is a great find for those seeking a pleasant stay, at a historic property, without breaking their vacation budget. The hotels website has lots of specials so check them out if your plans take you to Seattle.

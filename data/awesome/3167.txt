I stayed at this location for two nights whilst on a business trip. Everything was wonderful! I was given a room in the "towers" on the 7th floor and faced the back which was very quiet. The bathroom amenities are upgraded and plentiful. The washrooms had two sinks one in the bathroom area and the other outside, a nice tough. The food at the hotel was also excellent! The breakfast hashbrowns were greasy and to die for! The shuttle service to the airport leaves on the hour and half hour and were kind enough to drive me to a location a few miles away for a business meeting. I would recommend this location!

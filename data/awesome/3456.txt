My husband, me and a couple of our friends just returned from a 2 night stay at Lindemann's. The hotel had opened the day before our arrival, so its brand new, modern and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful at all times. We arrived very early for our check in after a long night travelling, and they had no troubles in giving us our rooms, we just waited half an hour for them to be cleaned and were able to rest and shower before heading to town. The hotel is very close to 2 U Bahn stations. (Bulowstr. and Kleistpark) that take you very quickly to anywhere in Berlin. Trains run often so you have no problem getting around. You can buy day, group and single passes at the hotel. Depending how much walking you'll be doing it might be enough with 2 single tickets per person per day. We used one ticket to get to our starting point and then walk from there. Then use another ticket on the way home. I would recommend you take cash with you, since most of the restaurants do not take credit cards, only cash. We had breakfast at the hotel, which was also very good and with lots of options (fresh bread, fruit, yogurth, lots of hams and cheeses, eff, bacon, cold and hot drinks etc...) It cost 11 Euros if its not included in your package. There is also parking at the hotel, which was included in our room, but I think it costs like 8 Euros for every 24 hour period. I can very highly recommend this hotel! Maria Holm

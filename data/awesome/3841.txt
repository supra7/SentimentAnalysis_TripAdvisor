My Husband and I were their to celebrate our 15 year anniversary. I can't even begin to tell you all the postives about this place. From the minute we walked thru the door we were treated like royality. We had the Swim out room and it was AMAZING. A little added touch was on the door of our room they had a banner that said Happy Anniversary...The food was cooked perfect everytime, The service was outstanding & the entertainment staff did everything possible to make sure you had a great time. The resort and the beaches were very clean. It was a nice couples get away...Can't wait to go back

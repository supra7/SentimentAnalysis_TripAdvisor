We stayed at the Mayflower Park for 2 nights during a recent house hunting trip in Washington. We wanted to stay downtown somewhere near Pikes Market and the Mayflower Park was perfect. The hotel was reasonably priced when compared to other downtown options. I had no complaints and would not hesitate to stay here again. Will be recommending to friends and family when they come out to visit.

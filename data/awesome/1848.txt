We stay at the Hotel Andra every December for a short city break. We've had a wonderful experience every time. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The one time we requested a room change, we were quickly accommodated. The rooms are modern, yet cosy, with nice linens on the bed and fluffy towels in the bath. The Andra is the perfect location for exploring downtown Seattle. Everything is within walking distance and anything further out is reachable by the monorail or light-rail. One year we took the monorail to the PNB Nutcracker and the next year we walked to Benaroya Hall for Handel's Messiah. A couple of tips: The Dahlia Bakery across the street has many of the same breakfast offerings as Lola, the hotel restaurant, at a fraction of the cost. My husband and I alternate who is going to run across the street to pick up breakfast and coffee and then we have a leisurely meal in our room while reading the complimentary paper. We park at the airport and take the light-rail into the city. No hassles with parking and certainly less expensive.

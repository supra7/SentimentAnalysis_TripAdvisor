The rooms are luxurious, the staff is wonderful, the food is above par for an all-inclusive, and the beach is little slice of paradise. Secrets Maroma Beach is located on Punta Maroma, a long stretch of white sand in a somewhat remote location amid just a few resorts. Walk a bit to the right of Secrets and it feels like you're on a private beach surrounded by turquoise waters and clear blue skies. There are plenty of chairs and shade on the beach, with attentive drink and food service. Several times a day they set up cooking stations right on the sand with items like burgers and tacos, and servers circulated with nibbles like sushi and bite-sized hors d'oeuvres. The beds and linens were top-notch and all of the rooms feature two-person jacuzzi bathtubs that in actuality could probably ft about 3-4 people. Another nice touch is the room-service box: if you'd like to order room service but don't want to be disturbed, they will leave it in a little cubby that you can access directly from your room. The chilaquiles on the breakfast menu are scrumptious ordered in, and if you can rouse yourself from bed the made-to-order crepes (Nutella and bananas- mmmmmm) and omelets are worth getting dressed for. We weren't especially wowed by any of the dinner restaurants, but the food was better than what we've experienced at other all-inclusives, and the service was attentive. We enjoyed the outdoor restaurants by the pool more than the lobby-side restaurants. We popped in briefly to take in some of the evening entertainment, but it seemed geared to a slightly older crowd (we're mid-30s but still think we're mid-20s when it comes to nightlife). I will absolutely book part of our stay here next time we return the area. So many details made our stay wonderful, and the beach alone is really worth a return visit.

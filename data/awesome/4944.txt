We had two weeks in March and had planned to go out on trips. We did nothing except enjoy the hotel, the beach was exceptional, lovely long walks, we spent most of our day on the beach. The pools were lovely but spoilt by the continuous piped music that is played (I know its very American to have it as its now eliminated in Europe but I wanted to shoot those little green pods that sent the music out), it really needs to consider a quiet area as we simply do not need this thrust upon us particuarly when they ask guests to be considerate and use ear pieces for their ipods and radios! Seriously that was our only complaint. The food at the restaurants was excellent, in good portions, not too big, and the service was exceptional this is where it really scored compared to the Caribbean. It never felt crowded and the numbers varied during our time, but we had a wonderfully relaxing time to shake off winter. Yes the evenings were cool, which discouraged one to go to outside buffets, not sure if this was unseasonal. We will return.

We spent two nights at the W recently en route to our Alaskan cruise. What a place and what people! Perfect. Very helpful. My wife is in a wheel chair. The people at the W helped her so much. Brian, the Guest Services Manager, is the best. More attentive, helpful and personable than any. The Acura program is very nice as well. Highly recommended.

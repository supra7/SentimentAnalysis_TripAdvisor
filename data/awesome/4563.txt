We use trip advisor when planning all our vacations and this trip was not any different for our honeymoon. We read many reviews which led us to Secrets Maroma Beach, all the great reviews were right on. This was our 5th All Inclusive trip to the Cancun/Riveria area and by far the best. By the time we arrived to the time we left the staff went out of there way to make sure we were happy. The staff members always repleyed with "its my pleasure. We got to know a few of them very well during our 7 night stay and they started to remember what food/drinks we wanted etc... The food was great at all the restaurents. We really enjoyed the Sushi and ate there two nights. We also had dinner on the beach at sunset and also had dinner at a private table next to the pool one night (that is highly recommended). You can make the trip as active or as laid back as you want. Many relaxed days by the pool or on the beach. We really enjoyed the Tequilla tasting activity poolside and there was never a shortage of drinks or food while laying poolside or on the beach. We cannot wait to go back and already have our trip booked for November this year for our anniversary in a few weeks. If I can give any advice, don't pass up this hotel.

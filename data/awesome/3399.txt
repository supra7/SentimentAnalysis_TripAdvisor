My husband, brother in law and sister in law and I stayed at this hotel in both May and June on our way to and from Alaska. The rooms, as expected, were extremely comfortable; the sleep number bed was a welcome amenity after several hours of flying to Seattle from the Northeast. The front desk was extremely helpful. The gentleman who drives the van to the airport is courteous and prompt. The food is very good. Service in the restaurant is a little slow, but will not deter me from the overall excellent service and experience. These were the third and fourth times we have stayed at this hotel.

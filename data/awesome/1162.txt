The Mayflower Park is a great hotel with an attentive and friendly staff, We booked this hotel as a recomendation from a friend and so glad we changed our reservations. I liked the small, personal feel of the property as well as it being a historical hotel - it has so much mnore character and history than many chain hotels. It is close to everything: we walked everywhere! Did take the monorail (1 block away) to Seattle Center - but walked back. Oliver's, the bar in the hotel, was very comfortable and makes great drinks. We stayed in a suite and it was just perfect for our family. The beds were super comfortable and although the rooms are small, having the extra living room and bathroom made our stay exceptional. The only cons I can think of is that the rooms are small (but cozy), no refrigerator in room and the fitness room is super small, however none of this effected our visit nor changed the positive review of the hotel, but others may like to know this. Can not wait to return !

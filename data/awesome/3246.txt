I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The room we stayed in was beautiful! Newer furniture, very comfortable bed with nice linens, two large sink areas and super clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the spa/pool area and they have a nice lounge with free internet access terminals. Free shuttle to the airport got us to the terminal in about 3 minutes! If you are looking for a place to stay near the airport - this is a great one!

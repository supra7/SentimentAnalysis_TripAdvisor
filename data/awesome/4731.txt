My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Secrets Maroma Beach for our 12 year wedding anniversary July 17-23. I had read many of the reviews (mostly all positvie) on Trip Advisor and my wife and I were still stunned with how nice the staff was and the sheer beauty of the property. We have stayed at numerous all-inclusives in Cabo, Cancun, Playa, and Cozumel; none of them can even come close to SMB. I'm telling you, this place is hard to put into words. We had booked a swim out, which I highly recommend, the main pool is great, but there's just something about the privacy of the swim out that we loved. Upon our arrival, they upgraded us to the Honeymoon Suite with swim out, WOW, 5-star all the way. The food was outstanding, we tried all the eating venues except the French and Mexican. Japanese place is a must, Pedro was excellent. Seaside Grill overlooks the beautiful ocean and is very romantic. 24-hour room service is awesome also, midnight ice cream sundae, what ever you want. Now to the beach, they tell you it's the #2 beach in the world, well #1 must be something, because I have never seen sand like this and the water is the most beautiful I have ever seen. There was always a umbrella to get some shade if you wanted, and someone bringing you a drink at all times. They even cook lunch on the beach!! Well, I could go on for ever about this week, but bottom line is, we didn't want to leave. A special thanks to Yessica, she is the best. NO doubt in my mind, we will return ASAP.

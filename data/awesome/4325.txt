This resort is amazing! The service was professional, friendly, and always willing to assist in any way needed! Rooms were unique and beautiful, we stayed in room with a swim up pool! However it was slightly cold (not a heated pool) so we didn't get much use out of it but it was still beautiful! As for the beaches, great, clean, service was also superb there... bringing cocktails as quickly as we needed them! I would also like to comment on room service, available anytime and the food is worth taking advantage of the service. There are numerous restaurants to choose from, one of which is actually a Japanese Hibachi grill. Lots to choose from and only a short ride to Cancun!

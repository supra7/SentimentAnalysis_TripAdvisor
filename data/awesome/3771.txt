We stayed here in Feb 2010. It was perfect in every way and the food was fabulous. This is a couples only resort so I am not sure why it is rated number one for Families? I wish we could return with our kids. I am looking for a place equally as nice that accepts kids for our return trip. If you are looking for a relaxing adult only hotel this is the perfect spot.

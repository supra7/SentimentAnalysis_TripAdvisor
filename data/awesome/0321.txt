We stayed here for two nights. Loved the location - a couple of blocks from the Space Needle monorail, a couple of blocks the other way to the Pike Street Market, a Ralph's grocery with lots of prepared foods just across the street, and plenty of other shopping nearby. Nice restaurant in the hotel. Comfortable room with nice view of the city lights and good service.

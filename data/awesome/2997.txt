Hotel Max IS the max! What a perfect experience for our weekend art get-away. The artsy decor tickled our fancy --- from the original wall canvas paintings to the illustrated room doors with the "nope and yups" to the chic colorful interiors of the room --- we loved it totally! (not to mention that you are just hop and skip away from Tula's and the Crocodile) Special thanks to the female desk clerk who was very helpful with a room change at checkin. And the door guy who was thoughtful enough to suggest and provide an umbrella! We WILL be back.

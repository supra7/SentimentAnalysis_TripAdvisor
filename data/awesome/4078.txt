My other half and I traveled to Mexico in May. We were celebrating our anniversary. We've been a fan of the Secrets Resorts from past vacations and decided to try out Maroma. Secrets Maroma was our favorite due to the beautiful beach, soft sand, excellent swimming, and coincidentally--the school of fish that hung around the swimming area the entire time we spent there! Excellent Service, Great Dining Selection for an All-Inclusive--even the sushi was pleasing! Top Shelf booze! Fresh fruite, seafood--can't go wrong! I would recommend the Secrets hotel chain--especially Secrets Maroma to anyone looking to relax and be catered to! Enjoy!

Hotel Le Crystal has to be the best hotel I have ever been - beautiful lobby and beautiful room! I emailed the hotel conceirge a few weeks in advance to let her know that the Montreal stay is to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and asked if we could have a room upgrade, she responded promptly and told me that everything will be taken cared of. When we arrived they already had the note in their computer, we were able to check in early and was sent to a room with a private balcony! They also surprised us with desserts + birthday wishes when we came back from dinner that night. Best of all, all the above were at no cost to us! Indoor pool & outdoor hot tub on the 12th floor is a must go! It feels absolutely amazing in the warm water looking at Mont Royal while it's 5 degree out! Outdoor hot tub is open everyday regardless of weather condition according to the lifeguard - so it'll be perfect even in the winter! Room is spacious and equipped with a beautiful bathroom, mini kitchen (microwave, espresso machine etc) and 2 flat screen TVs with 60+ channels. Free WiFi so bring your laptop! I thought the hotel was the best part of Montreal and really enjoyed our time there.

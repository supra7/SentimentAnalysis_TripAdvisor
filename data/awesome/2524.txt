I booked this reservation directly with the hotel website. It was a mixed reward rate - 4,000 spg points and $60 a night. It turned out to be a great deal for us. I contacted the hotel prior to our arrival after reading some mixed reviews. They advised me all of the rooms had been rennovated about 3 years ago, and this Westin was actually the very first Westin in the chain. We decided to go ahead with the reservation, and I was glad we did. Our room was on the 34th floor and the view was spectacular during the day but even more beautiful at night. Our room was clean and comfy and fit our family of four with no problems. The Concierges were very helpful and assisted us with making our plans. Since we wanted to go to the Space Needle, they recommended we eat lunch there and then we would not have to pay the entrance fee to go to the top. We agreed this would be a good option, and they made the lunch reservation for us. I'm glad they did because when we arrived, I overheard the hostess at the Space Needle advise someone they were full and could only accomodate those with lunch reservations. I was about to order Crab Cakes for lunch, when our waiter informed us that the Concierge from our hotel was treating us to Crab Cakes as an appetizer. What a nice surprise! The onsite parking was very expensive ($35 a day), but on check in I asked if there were alternative parking options. The front desk rep told me we could use the parking garage right next door even though they had no affiliation with the hotel for $18 per day. This parking garage was even connected to the Westin with a sky walkway. The location couldn't have been better. Within walking distance to just about everything. The Monorail picks up right near the hotel also.

This is the best resort that we have been to out of all the ones in the area! We have visited numerous other 5-star resorts but Secrets Maroma is still a notch above them all. The entire resort is like a piece of artwork. The architectural lines and resort layout have a lot of curves and soft lines, so the resort feels very relaxing and soul-soothing. There is a calming, beautiful energy that flow throughout. The rooms are exquisite, an the food extremely delicious. All restaurants are gorgeous and intimate, unlike other resorts that have tables row after row and feel more like a cafeteria (even other 5-star resorts). Definitely not here! The restaurants are absolutely beautiful and dimly lit, and you will feel private and special! They pay so much attention to detail and the employees here are the friendliest out of all the resorts we have been to. They ALL smile warmly and say "hola" warmly when they see you. Maroma Beach is the best beach ever! Absoutely stunning! The super soft white sands and glowing turquoise waters are incomparable anywhere else. And definitely visit the spa. The architecture and interior design at the Secrets spa are just out of this world, not to mention the impeccable service. Secrets Maroma is elegantly beautiful, heartwarming, and absolutely unforgettable. It is a piece of heaven on earth! I want to live there forever!

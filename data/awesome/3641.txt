When I arrived in Kissimmee, I checked into the "Red Carpet Inn" and three hours later I was checking out. After driving around Kissimmee and seeing the disgusting rooms many motels and Inns offered for 29.99 a night or a low weekly special, I was amazed when I arrived at the Destiny Palms Hotel. I was happy that the lobby looked clean and classy, and the employees looked professional, as opposed to all the other places where the employees were as dirty as mechanics and the lobby reeked of cigarettes. When I got to the room I was relieved and happy because it was spotless and cozy. In the morning I went down for the free continental breakfast expecting donuts, bagels and coffee, and was surprised to see pancakes, waffles, muffins, bagels, toast, eggs, 4 different kinds of cereal, O.J., apple juice and coffee. I've stayed in many places during my travels and no one has ever offered such a variety for breakfast. Another plus: the staff is super friendly and helpful. Classy clean hotel feel for motel prices. For a full week I paid $196 ($25 a day plus taxes). Definitely the best place I've found in all Kissimmee.

We have just got back from a week at secrets Maroma. It was my husbands 60th Birthday and they went out of their way to ensure we had a wonderful time. On irrival there was chanpane fruit and flowers in the room, then on his birthday we came back to our room after lunch to find banners and baloons on the bed and a birthday cake, we were also given a discount in the spa and a champane breakfast in bed. The food was very good, could not fault anything, always fresh and hot and a good selection. We had dinner in the Mexican, French, Italian and Japanese resturants all were excellent. The worls cafe for breakfast and lunch were also very good with a wide secltion od food, I think even the fussiest eater would find something to enjoy. Beach and pool service was also fantastic with drinks being brought to you throughout the day, and lunch time little snacks brought out as appitisers.The rooms are a good size and clean, the beds are really comfortable and there is a selection of pillows if you don't like the ones on the beds. There 24hr room service is good although only used it twice because we were always so full from all the other meals and snacks on offer.The beach is very clean and the sand like flour and even if the wind gets up a bit you don't seem to get covered in sand like we have done in other resorts, the water is several shades of blue, warm and inviting. The pool area is also very clean and there are plenty of very comfotable sunbeds. We could not fault this hotel or the service we recieved and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have relaxing holiday where they are pampered and made to feel special. All the staff are so friendly and wanting to please, they work very hard and long hours and are very greatful for any tips they get.

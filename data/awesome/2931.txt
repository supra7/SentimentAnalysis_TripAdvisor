I had my first W experience in Seattle and I'm converted. The W is all about creating a mood - you'll either love it, or you won't. The moment you step into the lobby you're enveloped by the aroma of vanilla candles and the sound of chilled-out beats. The lighting is very subdued to the point of being a little too dark - which may add to the club vibe in the lobby, but is a definite security concern on the guest floors. The rooms are very comfortable, decorated in an elegant 1940's style - bathed in browns, dark wood accents, window blinds, and a sofa in the window alcove. The bathroom amenities by Bliss are deluxe! The in-house restaurant, Earth & Ocean, is excellent. It focusses on regional dishes & wines - try the seasonal prixe fixe menu accompanied by a wine flight for a culinary education in the delights of the Pacific Northwest. My only criticism is that the front desk staff could be more service-oriented - the W style may be cool, but they should be warmer.

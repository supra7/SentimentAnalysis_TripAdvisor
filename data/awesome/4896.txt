We stayed at SMB for 8 days and it was a wonderful vacation. During our stay we did not want and/or need a thing. There was never an opportunity to want and/or need anything. The service is beyond anything I've experienced at any other all inclusive resort. This was one of the things I read on Trip Advisor but didn't really put much thought into it until we actually experienced it firsthand ourselves. SMB is everything you read about on Trip Advisor is pretty right on target. If you are looking for an all inclusive resort which includes relaxation, romance. good food and great service this is the place for you.

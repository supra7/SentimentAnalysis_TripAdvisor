My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time in Dec. 2006. We were celebrating our 1st anniversary - and we had an amazing time. The Edgewater was perfect!!! The staff was one of the best I've ever experienced. The hotel runs shuttles around town every hour during the day, so if you don't want to walk, you just head downstairs on the hour and off you go! All we did was tip the driver, which we loved doing because they were great and full of information - they even made us reservations at a local restaurant while taking us shopping, they just called someone at the hotel and gave them the info! We enjoyed walking to nearby restaurants, and even enjoyed the walk to Pike Market - although I wouldn't recommend walking to older folks as it is fairly good distance (we aren't in great shape ourselves but it was a pleasant walk). We had a waterfront room, on the 1st floor, which is interesting in the winter! We had waves crashing right on us basically - but we loved it! We probably could have moved higher up if we didn't enjoy the crashing waves, but we never asked. During our stay we had a problem with the TV. Within minutes the repair man was there fixing it and they even bought us a movie for the "inconvenience". The ambiance is wonderful for a winter stay. We loved the entrance with the huge fireplace, and really loved the rooms. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.

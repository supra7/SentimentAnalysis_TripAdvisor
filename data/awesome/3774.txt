My husband and I went for our honeymoon from Dec 3-11. I have to stay that the service was great. I took home a great impression on the mexico, the food, culture and the people. The whole team from the world cafe buffett were simply amazing. Manuel specially made me and my husband feel like we were welcome and at home. He always took the time to give us some history of the food and drinks that we were having.

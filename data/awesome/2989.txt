Location was awesome! Perfect for walking to wherever you want; shops, Pike Place Market. Love the valet parking and the valet staff was fun and quick. Liked the fact the floors are secure via your key. Our room was the smallest of our group but we had a great view of the Space Needle and mountains and it definitely served its purpose. The bed was very cozy. Loved the decor in room and hallways. The front desk staff were very helpful and proactive. Unfortunately didn't take advantage of the two happy hours next door at Red Fin but we did have a great breakfast there!

We had always heard of "Inn at the Market" from relatives and friends. We really wanted to experience the Inn on our pre-cruise night. It was certainly as nice as we expected. The roof-top terrace/seating area allowed us a perfect view of the Pike Place Market as well as the waterfront activities. The location of the Inn allowed us to experience some great restaurants. The staff couldn't have been nicer, from the bell desk to the housekeeping staff. Our room was small but extremely comfortable. We will look forward to going back to Seattle and to the Inn at the Market!

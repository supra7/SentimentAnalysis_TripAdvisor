Unless you want to experience the most AMAZING vacation of your life!! Secrets Maroma is incredible! Where do we start??? From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, there was nothing that this resort would not do for the customer. Ask, and you recieved whatever you needed. Free computers and internet - you got it! Cookies in the lobby/reception - fresh every day. Need a taxi - wait 2 minutes and one was at the door. Have a question - they drop everything to help you. The food - simply amazing. But what really took it over the top .... the appetizers poolside every day - OMG!!! The pools - fabulous. Service staff came by every 15 minutes ALL DAY LONG!! The staff - wonderful, everywhere on the resort. If you can get Freddy for breakfast or lunch, he is a shining star!! The room - perfect! My wife was in heaven. The beach - unbelievable. Talcum Powder sand, clear water, sandy and no rocks or weeds anywhere. The drinks - whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted, nothing watered down. Room Service - isn't just for your room, you can get it poolside too! Beach Grill - delicious!!! Oh, and the fried sushi apppetizers - WOW, what a treat! The Entertainment - very entertaining and what an amazing theatre!!!! No weather delays for this resorts entertainment. Can you see a pattern here? This resort is, without question, the place we will go back to over and over. I wish I could say, Don't Tell Anyone about Secrets Maroma - keep it a secret. But that would be selfish :-) We met some great new friends (Ontario and Albany,NY), met some wonderful staff and had an amazing Adults Only vacation. Don't make another vacation plan without considering Secrets Maroma. You will be spoiled forever.

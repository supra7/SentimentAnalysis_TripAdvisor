We stayed two nites at this hotel. We had a Suite and it was beautiful. It was my mothers 69th birthday and the staff really went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and welcoming. They sent up a bottle of champagne and fruit as a gift for her. It was wonderful! Since we traveled by train and the hours were not exactly in line with check in/out they allowed us to have early check in and late check out. I would stay at this hotel every time I visit Seattle. Beautiful and the best staff anywhere ever!

We recently took an Alaskan cruise and stayed at this hotel the night before we left and for 2 nights after the cruise. This hotel was perfectly located for us. We easily walked to the local restaurants, Pike Place market, the downtown malls and to access the free bus system (leaves from Macy's baselment) and the monorail for the Space Needle. The location was also a quick taxi ride to the cruise ship docks. Rooms at the hotel were spacious and clean. The customer service mentality was superb. Everyone we encountered at this hotel and its adjoining restaurant provided us with excellent and efficient service. The drinks at the bar and breakfast at the restaurant were superior. We would definitely stay there again and most certainly would recommend it to others.

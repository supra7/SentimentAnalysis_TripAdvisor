Loved this spot! I'm even somewhat hesitant in writing this review since I want to keep this location under the radar. The decor is a mashup of lodge and ultra mod. I was lucky enough to have perfect partly cloudy warm sunny days while spending hours with my friends dining and drinking on the waters at Edgewater; an amazing experience! Cheers!

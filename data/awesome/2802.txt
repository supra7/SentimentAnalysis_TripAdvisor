Having spent a night in the Chateau Ste. Michelle suite at the Hotel Vintage Park, I can honestly say I love the hotel. From the intimate lobby with the beautiful fireplace, to the delicious meal at the on-site Tulio's restaurant, the Hotel Vintage Park provides an experience you won't soon forget! Each room is unique in this boutique-style hotel. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The valet is a bit pricey at $30 a night, but that seems to be par for the course on downtown nightly parking. Each room is named after a winery, playing on the wine theme of the hotel. Each night at 5pm, there is a wine reception in the lobby where guests can try wines from local wineries and maybe a delicious appetizer from Tulio's. Our room was very clean, and there was a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us! The front desk was most helpful whenever we needed something. We loved the leopard print robes and the l'Occitane bath products. I can't wait to come back to the beautiful Hotel Vintage Park!

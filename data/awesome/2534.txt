This is what a hotel should be. Clean, comfortable room, soft bed, nice bathroom, good overall location and amenities. Friendly staff too. Downstairs restaurant is a little pricey but there is a little cafe across the lobby. Check out the happy hour in the bar. Valet parking is a little expensive, but prompt and easy. I'd stay again, definately.

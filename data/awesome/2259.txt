Like a gorgeous chameleon, The Sorrento Hotel in Seattle, with all its heart, wisdom and glory of over 100 years, embraced and hugged our family of 200 and became home. They invited us to dinner, bandaged our wounds, tidied our rooms, and treated our hundreds of mischievous seekers and followers of humanity as well deserved children of a full maternal affection. And they let our best friends stay over for a slumber party. I live in gratitude of the service and love you provided me. Ill be back.

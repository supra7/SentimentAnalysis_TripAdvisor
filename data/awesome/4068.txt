It was exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon. We had everything on the resort and didn't need to leave for anything. It was awesome to be able to get delicious food and drinks whenever we wanted. It was also nice to have activities going on around the resort all afternoon. The service was always excellent and we couldn't have asked for more.

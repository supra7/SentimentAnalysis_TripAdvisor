This place is absolutely perfect! The lobby is stunning, and the location can not be beat! You are right downtown....short walk to Pikes Place Market, and all the shopping, food and bars you like! The monorail is literally across the street - it costs $2 and takes you straight to the Space Needle. Our room was nice and was fully stocked with Starbucks Coffee - I really like this because it is a way for a local hotel to showcase a local business (Starbucks originated in Seattle). they aren't stingy with coffee either :) Another thing I LOVE about this hotel is they are trying to be "Green". They put directions in your room - they'll only change your sheets if you put a card on the bed, and will give you fresh towels upon request as well. I absolutely love this, and think it's important that such a huge hotel is trying to conserve anyway they can! The front desk was great, and very knowledgeable. We asked for suggestions for great places to go out in Seattle and they delivered! Anytime we called valet for our car - it was waiting for us by the time we got to the front door. there is really nothing I can complain about for this place - If you are going to Seattle, stay here!

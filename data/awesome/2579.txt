The staff was SO nice and helpful. The location was great. The hotel was clean. Housekeeping did a great job. It was just a very lovely stay that we had there. The pool and hot tub was also crystal clear and beautifully kept and all the other guest were friendly. With an atmosphere like the one that the staff provides, I see why everyone was in a good mood. I give them a HUGE two thumbs UP!!!!! Thanks! Lani and Sergio Mendoza

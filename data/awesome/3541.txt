My boyfriend and I took a road trip from Fitchburg MA. to Montreal for July 4th weekend. It took about 6.5 hrs to drive there. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel choice! The lobby was stunning. The staff was very helpful with booking restaurants and reccomending night life. If you want a special dining experiance have the Chefs choice at" Toque".. You wont forget it!! Ok- more about this hotel.. I loved the room decor modern and comfotable.. I loved the living room space that included a flat screen tv. The bar and the choices of coffee in the room. The bathroom was huge it had a jetted tub and two sink vanity along with a glass stand up shower. We had to check out the outdoor jacuzz which was located on the 20th floor(I think). We ate breakfast at the upstairs dining area every a.m. This hotel is walking distance from St. Catherine st. and plenty of shopping. I give this hotel a 4-5 star!! Can't wait to go back!!

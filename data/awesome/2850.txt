We had a great time at the W! They were so attentive to our needs. I mentioned that is was our first night away from our baby and they upgraded us to a king corner luxury room. The staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to ensure all our needs were met. The location was within walking distance to all the great things downtown Seattle has to offer. Great stay, we'll be back!

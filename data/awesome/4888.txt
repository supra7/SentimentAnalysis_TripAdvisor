My wife and I returned for the 2nd time to Secrets Maroma in April 2010. This was our 5th year in a row to visit the Yucatan. We had an excellent stay at Secrets Maroma. Other reviews have already captured much of what I would try to contribute so I'll keep this short. Rooms - exceptional, among the best we've experienced anywhere. Very clean and well appointed. We slept until 9:30 every morning! Food - good but not great. Great for an all-inclusive, good compared to high quality places stateside. Breakfast was outstanding. Service - good to excellent. Activities - fair to good. I was a bit disappointed that only one Hobie Cat was operational during our visit. But in fairness to Secrets, this is a third party operator. Pools - good overall Drinks - excellent, if they understood the order. If not, we just ordered another! Entertainment - good Beach - outstanding under normal circumstances. There was a rare seaweed event while we were there but the hotel had numerous workers removing it. This went over and above anything we've ever seen at any hotel. Overall - Excellent. None of the above elements themselves were the best we've experienced. But taken together, I would rate this hotel as an excellent vacation destination.

I won a free night at the W Hotel and was unsure if I wanted to stay a second night there after reading the reviews of it being a dark and dingy hotel. I was upset when I arrived and realized that I should have booked my second night here instead of at another hotel since the W was really quite amazing! From the moment we stepped in, I was impressed by the ambiance and the great service. We arrived quite early, and while they didn't have a room available quite yet, they kept our bags for us while we got lunch and got one ready quite quickly. The room was clean, comfortable and modern. And the view was to-die-for! Yes, the hallways are dark, but that's the vibe of the hotel... And really, who wants to walk into a hallway that is blaring florescent lights?! Honestly, I have no complaints about the hotel, and would stay here again in a heart beat!

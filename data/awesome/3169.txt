this hotel was so comfortable. After commuting back and fort from florida if too tired to drive back to my destination i always stay at this dbl tree. I have never once had a bad nights sleep in these beds. I love the big warm cookies in the evening. They never seem to slap my hand if I grab 2 or 3...recommendation goes to this hotel over others!

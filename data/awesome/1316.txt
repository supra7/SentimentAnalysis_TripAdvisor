After doing a little research looking for a 2 bedroom for 4 adults, I choose the Moore Hotel. I was given a rate of $135 a night (plus $10 for the extra 2) for a total of $150 a night. What we recived for our $150 a night was the biggest 3 bedroom you've ever seen! The 1st room had a full size bed, the 2nd room had 2 twin size beds, and the 3rd room had a queen. Each of the 3 rooms had a sink, and we did have to share a bathroom. Yes, we had no air conditioning, but we got 2 fans from the front desk, and left our windows (that open completly) cracked to get a nice cool breeze. I was worried at first when we arrived, as the lobby was very old and had not been updated in a long time, and there were a few "characters" hanging out right outside the entrance. However, the desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and assured us not to worry about the people outside. We took the (tiny) elevator to our room, where we were very impressed with the cleaning job and the size of the room. Being on the 4th floor, we wern't blessed with the greatest view in the world, but that was just fine. Yes the parking situation -----, but there are plenty of lots across the street, and if you park at night on the street, it is free, and very safe. Check out the Night Lite lounge next door for the best cheap strong drinks in the city. A funky little dive, where we were made to feel right at home.

My husband and I just came back yesterday from Secrets Maroma in Rivera Maya....OMG the best vacation ever! This hotel is all inclusive, top shelf alcohol and the best food ever! The staff goes above and beyond to cater to your needs. we can't wait to go back next year! Beautiful place! If you are deciding between this place and another, pick Secrets Maroma for sure! Be sure to bring at least 1 nice dress/skirt and guys should bring at least one pair of dress slacks as they have dress codes for a few restaurants

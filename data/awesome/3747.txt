I just returned from a week at Secrets Maroma and was truly impressed by the beauty & cleanliness of the property, level of service, quality of food and warm hospitality of the staff. Every effort is made to make guests happy and comfortable. I will definitely return to this property. (My only negative was the transportation provided by Amstar.)

We have stayed at several resorts in Cancun and the Riviera Maya area, and Secrets Maroma Beach is by far our favorite. We plan to return whenever we can. From the General Manager on down, the staff is the best there is, and will go out of their way to make you feel like royalty. The service level here is outstanding, as well as the accommodations, food, pool, beach, and spa. If you want to be pampered, never having to leave your pool or beach chair for food or drink, this is the place for you. A special shout out to Paulo, the pool concierge. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone is comfortable and have everything they need. Though it's not expected, we always bring money to tip the wait staff, housekeeping, and anyone else who provides a service. They work very hard and deserve to be rewarded. I am a travel agent, and I would recommend this resort if you are looking for the perfect honeymoon location, a place to celebrate a special occasion, or somewhere to just relax and soak up the sun. You won't need to look anywhere else. It's paradise!

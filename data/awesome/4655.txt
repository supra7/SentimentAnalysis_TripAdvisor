This hotel was amazing and from the moment we arrived to the time we (reluctantly) left, everything was out of this world. We arrived in a huge lobby and were given champagne as we checked in. The concierege and bell hops were excellent throughout our stay. Our room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. We spent a lot of time by the pool at the swim up bar and the barmen were fantastic, particularly Alfredo. The service around the pool was great: we were given a continual supply of cocktails/beers and snacks from a walk-around waiter every day. The entertainment staff made the afternoons, with volleyball, kayaking, blackjack and bingo and we made some great friends at these activities. We ate at all the restaurants and the food was fantastic every night and the waiters were so accommodating. We loved the French, Italian and Oceana. We also ordered room-service and our waiter was so nice and helpful. Entertainment in the evening was very well done and we enjoyed the traditional dancing, rock show and the mentalist. The club was really good if there were lots of people. We went to Chichen Itza which was great when we got there but a long long journey and very hot with only a little shade. We also went to Playa del Carmen but weren't particularly impressed. The jewellery shop within the hotel was beautiful and my partner bought me 2 lovely diamond pieces at a very good price. The weather was hot and sunny throughout the 2 weeks with only a few days with a quick downpour (usually at night). We are hoping to go back next year because it was faultless.

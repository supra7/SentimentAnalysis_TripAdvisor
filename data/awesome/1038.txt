My wife and I stayed at the Mayflower four nights, and it was everything we wanted it to be! The service was excellent! My wife and I are in the hospitality business, specializing in renovated historic properties and let me say we both thought the place to be well run, very clean, and tastefully decorated so that the motiff conveyed the feel of a 20's-30's era inn. The Andaluca Restaurant and Oliver's Lounge were on top of their game. Price points, presentation, and selection were on target! Delicious! Hats off to the management team! We could not have been more pleased!

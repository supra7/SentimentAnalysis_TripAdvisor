We stayed at Secrets Maroma for 9 nights for our honeymoon. It was definitely the nicest place we have ever stayed. It was great to get there, put our wallet in the safe, and not think about it the rest of the time. The whole staff was friendly and very accommodating. The room wasn't huge, but was perfect for us and we slept like babies in the king size bed. We enjoyed all of the restaurants, but the Japanese one was our favorite because of the sushi. The resort was very clean and well maintained, and all rooms were close by the beach and the pool. The only negative we thought of was the price of stuff in the gift shop. We forgot bug spray and $16 for a can of OFF seemed like 4 times what it should be. So bring your own bug spray, and enjoy the rest!

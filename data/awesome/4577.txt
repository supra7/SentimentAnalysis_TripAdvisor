In short, this was the best vacation I have ever been on! It was out honeymoon and we were greeted with a honeymooners banner, fresh flowers, champagne and a nice letter. Frow that day we were treated as first class guests from the room service, to bartenders, to the staff that passed us everyday with a friendly "hola"! the grounds are lush, meticulously maintained and stunning. You are served drinnks everywhere, the pool, the lobby, the beach...it was truely a relaxing paradise from beginning to end! there were fun activities such as pool bingo and volleyball as well as wine and tequila tastings. Suggestions: -Eat at Portifino and MAKE RESERVATIONS for hibatichi at Himitsu...both places are mind blowing -that sugar reef bar sucks but the lobby bar is by far the best! -on a busy day, make sure to hold down a spot with a towel at the pool by 10am... -chairs under palapas are nearly impossible to get after 2pm! -stay away from the room service pizza! its not what you think. but you didnt come to mexico for pizza did you?? -get to the World Cafe for breakfast! dont get room service everyday....make sure you get out and enjoy these amazing meals! -couples, take a walk of the property at night, its amazing -BRING BUG SRAPY! 3 days back in the states and im still red all over.. All in all, we have already started to plan a couples trip there next year, thats how much we cant wait to come back...its an incredibly romantic and perfect place to honeymoon, i suggest it to any couple. lots of other friendly honeymooners and couples of all ages to meet! And no kids running all over the place...sorry to say that was one of the best parts...just friendly fun adults to share a great experience with!

We stayed at the Hampton Inn following our Alaska cruise. We wanted to tour the Boeing plant. My wife made a reservation with a local tour business that botched the reservation. We told the front desk manager, Mirsela, who immediately called an alternative tour company and booked us right away. John and Tim the shuttle drivers drove us to the airport and restaurants and gave us the lay of the land. They went out of their way to make us feel right at home. There is a very nice park and lake right accross the street from the hotel that is great for kids and a nice walk.. The hotel is going through a make over but was easy to work around. The hotel features FREE WI-FI and a FREE Computer in the lobby. We ate two breakfasts and they were both satisfying and filling. I am not sure what the other reviewer thought he would hear being near the airport but the airplanes did stop in the late evening. The walls are cement and we had no trouble sleeping. They also offer FREE USA Today AND Wall Street Journal.

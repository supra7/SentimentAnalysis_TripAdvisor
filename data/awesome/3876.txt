We went last Nov 2010 then came back Oct 2011. Great experience both times. Water temp was better (warmer) in Oct than it was last Nov. Only complaint meat and fish was not great, but the chips and guac is out of this world. We did three Secrets Resorts in 18 months so I think we will try something else next time, but HIGHLY recommend it for those that have done Sandals. I'd say, this is a step up for about the same money. The staff at Maroma is much better than the staff at Secrets Wild Orchid in Montego Bay. If you have your choice do Mexico. Jamaica staff was slow unless you had tipped them several times before. I know these people don't make great money, but I felt WildOrchid could have done better. Another nice feature of Maroma, it is close to Cancun airport. You will not be disappointed for the money.

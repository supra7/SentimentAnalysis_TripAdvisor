My husband and I had not been away for over 15 years. It was our 20th Wedding anniversary. We chose Secrets Meroma because alot of our friends had recommended it. Well they were right. The service team was top notch along with our personal conceirge Roberto. Everyone seemed to know when your drink was low. They were there. We were made to feel like it was our second home. The food was excellent and tasty. The beach was clean and sandy. The pool and activities were enough to keep us busy. We also opted for the swim out which I would do again. We have made some great friends and have promised to see them again. When? Next year - same time at Secrets Meroma! Highly recommend!

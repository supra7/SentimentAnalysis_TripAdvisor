Had a great stay at Hotel Max with my husband and 2 kids. We stayed in a King's Parlour room which is a little bigger than most. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us with the kids sleeping on the pullout couch. The bathroom was a little small, but large enough to do your business. The staff was amazing - very professional but down to earth. My husband was best buds with Adam, the valet/doorman by the time we left. The Max was right in the heart of downtown, within walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. We all had so much fun going floor to floor looking at the photographs on all the doors. There was some street noise as we slept, but that's expected when staying in the heart of a big city. We will definitely stay at Hotel Max the next time we are in Seattle. The atmosphere and staff made it a wonderful time for all of us.

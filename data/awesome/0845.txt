Very nice staff, very clean and comfortable room . The bed was perfect. We were upgraded to a suite, which had a wonderful view. The location was perfect for walking to 5th Avenue Theater and for checking out the Seattle flower and garden show, which we found about it, from a sign that was advertising it in the lobby. Breakfast was very good. A very enjoyable stay.

My partner and I loved this hotel. Kitchen had a stove, microwave and mini fridge and the cupboards actually had dishes and cutlery to use (many hotels I've stayed in didn't provide them). We stayed on the 3rd floor for the view and we weren't disappointed. They don't have an elevator so we had to lug our bags up the stairs but believe me, it was way worth it. The bed was very comfortable, not stiff like many hotels and all the linens were clean. The bathroom was stocked with organic soaps which smelled divine. The surrounding area was filled with many restuarants and shops all in walking distance. We plan on staying here again when we visit Seattle in the future.

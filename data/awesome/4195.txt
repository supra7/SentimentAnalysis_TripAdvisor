My husband I and vacationed at Secrets Maroma May 29 - June 2, 2011. We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this resort. THE STAFF - from check in to check out the staff in every area was exceptional. Above and beyond in all those little ways that sets this resort apart from others. THE ROOM-the room was as pictured on the web site. Lovely. We were in Building 24 on the 4th floor and had a wonderful view. THE BUILDING CONCIERGE-each building has it's own concierge which was an incredibly nice touch. Roger in building 24 was exceptional. We miss you Roger! Roger went above and beyond and made our stay most enjoyable. THE FOOD-the waiters are well trained and professional.. My husband has a gluten allergy and had no trouble eating out. The chefs are experienced and knowledgeable. The food was very good, the breakfast buffet is outstanding. The presentation is great. Our favorite restaurants were the Oceana (sea bass was outstanding) and Portifino. Try the crepes at breakfast. Our favorite restaruant "manager" or "host" was Abel. He oversaw and assisting in making sure my spouse's allergy was recognized by chefs and waiters. He made meal suggestions. Most professional and made our meals relaxing and special. THANKI YOU ABEL. THE DRINKS. Really - I read so many complaints and all I can say is HUH? Seriously, I never noticed if they did or did not use" top shelf" liquor. The drinks were excellent. THE BEACH-incredibly beautiful. Clean. Spectacular. Comfortable. Great service. OUTINGS-we used YukaTreks for a Tulum tour of the Mayan ruins and I cannot say enough about what a tremendous job they did. This was an incredibly fun day. THE BEST PART - definitely the staff. They are the best.. The atomosphere at Secrets Maroma is warm, friendly, it captures the Mexican culture. MY SUGGESTION - GO - ENJOY - You will not regret it. We look forward to returning.

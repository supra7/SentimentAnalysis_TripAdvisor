We were eager to stay at the W Seattle, without kids this time. We were not disappointed. The staff and concierge were extremely helpful in suggesting restaurants and making reservations. After a long week on the road for business it was quite a treat to end our week in Seattle at the W. Very relaxing and refresing...even with the city construction below.

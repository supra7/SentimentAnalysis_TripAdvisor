This resort is absolutely spectacular except for one small thing....no hot water, just warm. I hate to complain about something so simple but after day three I just wanted a hot shower. They did however try their hardest everyday to give us hot water but it just didn't work. Besides that, we loved it. The room and especially the turn-down service at night was amazing. The people are so friendly and thankful for any tip that you give. We loved the food, pool, and nightlife. We loved a little of everything from the restaurants. Most importantly the resort was not crowded. This place would be even better if they had a casino, golfing, and a larger outside area for people to run in the morning. I highly recommend getting a room with the swim out pools. So relaxing in the morning, oh, and it's heated.

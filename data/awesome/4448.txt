We have been to a LOT of all-inclusives including Secrets Capri. This was the best. Rooms were excellent. Food was excellent. Entertainment was.. entertaining. The Italian restaurants was the best in our opinion. East coast quality Italian food. SCUBA: 7 minutes off the resort by boat was a nice reef.. A mini Cozumel. A shame they only offer 1 tank dives. The sign offers 2 tanks for only $5 more than 1. But they wont deliver on that. Makes the diving kind of expensive compared to other options. DECENT INTERNET ACCESS: $60 got us decent high speed internet for the week. A few issues: GYM had insufficient benches (one standalone bench for the whole gym) wholly inadequate. Wonderful smith machine could hardly be used to to no bench. Free weight selection was limited (50 pound dumbbells were the heaviest.. fine for the average goer) INSUFFICIENT BEACH CHAIRS: There was room for many more beach chairs but if you got to the beach after 10am there were none available. Sign said they would remove towels from abandoned chairs but they didn't. (I cant blame them.. just buy more chairs) SELLING SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT: They had someone with a lot of weasel words about something they would offer with a 90 minute presentation. Apparently a VIP membership or something. To fight the timeshares, I think. I might have actually been interested but they insisted on a 90 minute presentation and a tour of the resort. i was staying there. I didn't need a tour, just the facts. I could not get them without the tour. Too bad. I might have been a prospect. SOME WAITERS WOULDN'T KEEP US IN WATER: They spent a lot of time refilling others wine but we were ignored in the seafood restaurant when it came to water (we don't drink alcohol) POOL: Very shallow and very rough stone. Hurt our feet to walk without water shoes.

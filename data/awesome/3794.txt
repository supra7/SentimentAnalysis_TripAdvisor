As a frequent traveler to the area I must say that this is great place. Comparing it to Excellence Playa Mujeres, and Secrets Silversands, they all have their different true 5 star qualites. Food was best here, ratings, Italian have the rack of lamb, French, have the Veal Chop. As a party of 4 adults we each tried something different from the menus. The Japanese was terrible, very amateurish show. The World Cafe had many choices all great, both for breakfast and lunch. Their Mexican Show night buffet was terrific. The beachside Steakhouse had a lovely setting but the steaks were tough.The rooms at Silversands were the best, Marona were OK. Small shower with just a regular head with no controls, We had a swim up room and there no shrubs to give us privacy from the public walkways, only 1 chaise, and no table for room service, Excellence had both. Beach was great as was Excellence, Silversands was poor. Marona has wonderful beach and pool lounges with great cushions. I'd go back to any of the 3 in a heartbeat. Walk out room pools were heated. A wonderful treat at night, were almost as warm as hot tubs. Take your pick, what's important to you.

Each year I stay at the W Seattle at least once. In 10 years of traveling to Seattle, the last 3 have been with the W every time. The staff continues to be amazing, the accommodations are perfect, and the location is super convenient. I brought my wife this time and she was also very pleased...and my wife finds problems with every hotel so her positive experience is priceless.

We spent 2 nights at this hotel, as we arrived at Sea-Tac, and again when we were departing at Sea-Tac, and we can only be positive about our whole experience. The staff was wonderful, the accomodations were great, and if you can get an atrium view, you will think you are in Florida. We had a great room service breakfast both times. The airport shuttle was convenient and dependable. We would like to take the bed home with us!

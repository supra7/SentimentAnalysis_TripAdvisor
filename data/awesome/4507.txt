We just got back from Secrets Maroma 2 weeks ago and we're thinking about heading there again next year. My husband & I went on this trip with 3 other couples. My girlfriend & I researched resorts after deciding that Playa del Carmen was our destination. We kept coming back to Secrets Maroma after reading reviews and doing our online research. Although there were cheaper resorts, we wanted the upscale setting, great service and a la carte dining options. Our group was not disappointed! The property was beautiful and very well maintained. We did get upgraded to bldg 16 which is closer to the beach. Our friends all got upgraded to swimouts. The capacity at the resort was full the 5 days we were there. The service was awesome, the food was very good and there was a wide variety to chose from. Loved the food that was prepared around the pool & on the beach. Our room was very nice and comfortable. We never got room service...not a fan of eating in my room. We enjoyed dining at the various restaurants and visited the huge breakfast buffet every morning at the World Cafe. The beach was clean & the ocean gorgeous and clear. We always picked lounging on the beach the majority of each day. The entertainment staff would come out and start up volleyball games, soccer games at different times during the day. The evening entertainment was okay. We only watched 1 show in the theater and it was mediocre. We enjoyed the Mexican fiesta night which showcased different Mexican dances. My only complaint is that when the resort is at full capacity, it is difficult to secure a beach or pool chair unless you are down there before 9:30 am to grabs chairs. I think they should have more chairs available so that everyone can lounge. My husband and I are early risers so getting our beach chairs was never an issue, but it was a problem for others later. So to sum it up Secrets Maroma was awesome and we'd go back again!

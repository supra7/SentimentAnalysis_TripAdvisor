A very well maintained and friendly hotel. The room was large, the bathroom small, but not a problem. My room had a sitting area, large screen TV, coffee maker and robe and slippers. The bed was comfortable, the room quiet at night - altogether it was a great stay. The location is perfect for shopping, walking to the SAM and the market. Buses are free in a downtown area. I also had a restaurant voucher for IL Fornaio (in Pacific Place Mall, across the street) and had a lovely lunch there. I would return to both the hotel and this restaurant

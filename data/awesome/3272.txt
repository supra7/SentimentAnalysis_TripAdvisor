I continue to be impressed with Hampton Inn's makeover, moving upscale and keeping their "entry level" Hilton tier hotel. There are high end features in this moderately priced hotel. Recent renovations, well appointed features such as upgraded bedding, stylish bathroom decor, a nicely appointed basic business work center, adjustable mood lighting. Though our double bed room was compact, it had excellent amenities and provided a great value. A small outdoor pool, kidney shaped on the west side is well situated to maximize the afternoon sun while the weather is warm enough to keep it open. Excellent breakfast buffet, simple, yet filling. Though bustling Seatac Airport is next door, we did not hear any undue noise from its operations.

This is great little boutique hotel. The rooms are very well appointed, not large but very comfortable. The updates are certainly notable. If there is a downside, it would be the size of the bathroom. It was small, but not impossible. The location is excellent for shopping, a short walk (5 min.) and you are at Westlake Plaza, Macy's and the downtown stores. The food at the restaurant (Japenese) is excellent and well presented. The staff at the hotel are pleasant and very helpful. Definitely will stay there again........

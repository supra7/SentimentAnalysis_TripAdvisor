We left our car for 5 days and stayed in this Doubletree Hotel on our return,our shuttle arrived promptly and we were given a Tower Room . It was a huge room with great bedding,sheet count & pillows. We were pretty late 9.54pm but managed to get a decent meal in the bar, I will happily come back to this doubletrees. Only one hiccup when we were collecting our car through their valet ,the valet asked pretty abruptly as we $5 tipped him if we had settled our parking fee. Unfortunately I hope front desk could have better communication.

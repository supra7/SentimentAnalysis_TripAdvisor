My wife and I booked this resort for our honeymoon. We were welcomed to the resort with the term "welcome home". I can honestly say by the time we left it felt like home. Every staff member was friendly, we especially liked Eduardo at the World Cafe and Mauricia in housekeeping. The resort is beautiful and very well kept. The food was terrific and plentiful. I can't say enough about the beach but wow. The hotel has a lot of events but does not urge you to do anything if you do not want to. We laid in the beds by the pool and relaxed. The spa was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone that would like to relax and enjoy a pleasant vacation in a resort that is adults only.

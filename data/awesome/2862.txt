Just got back from a stay at the W. Hotel was fabulous. Easy to get to from the airport with the Light Rail, the University St. entrance is one block away at 3rd & Seneca. I had always wanted to try a W, and was a little worried staying there with my 16-month-old son, but it worked out fabulous. Although their website said they didn't offer cribs, I got it added over the phone and there was one waiting for us. The bed was incredibly comfy, and the Bliss bathroom products were a welcome luxury. We were also upgraded to a higher room floor (perhaps due to SPG Gold status). Two highlights for us were the Acura MDX car service and the Washington apples in the lobby. Very handy each day. They even had a car seat available for the baby. And the staff was always courteous and friendly. The MDX staff was great, and the Whatever/Whenever even assisted with getting tickets to the sold-out Sounders game. The best part is that my son fell in love with the little MDX squeeze toy in the room, and they gave us a brand new one for him to take home! So thoughtful. They wanted to charge for a fridge (for little one's food), but we were able to make room in the minibar, which was luckily not touch-sensitive. Make sure you go across the street to Cafe Migliore for your coffee (skip the free stuff downstairs, blah). It was the best coffee I had all trip (and I made a point to try a latte at every new place I saw). My only complaint is the cost of parking, because the Seattle Bus system is awful to rely on. There are some close garages that were cheaper. Earth and Ocean downstairs seemed priced for expense accounts only. Also, plan your Sunday activities well in advance, the area around the hotel was a ghost town after 2PM.

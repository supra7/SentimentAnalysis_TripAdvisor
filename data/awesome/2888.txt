I stayed at the W from 25 July until 5 Aug 2009 on a combination of business and pleasure. All staff without exception were extremely courteous and helpful at all times of the night and day. The business section of my stay was handled professionally and in manner which reflected well on the hotel and my company in the face of clients. All my IT and conference needs were more than adequately met. The pleasure section of my stay was exactly that....a real opportunity to relax and enjoy all that Seattle had to offer. As an international visitor the W and it's staff provided a very positive image of America, and when I am asked in the future what I wish for, it will be nothing other than a W !

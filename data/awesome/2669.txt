Love this hotel!! If it was cheaper I'd go every time. The lobby is like walking into the coziest living room ever. We had wine and brandy tastings by the fire in social, informative gatherings. Views were great of city, in a great location for pike place, theaters, and game day. My favorite Seattle hotel.

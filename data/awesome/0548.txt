We were involved in four days of all-day conference sessions at the Seattle Trade Center yet we felt as if we were on vacation at the Inn. The combination of warm and professional service was just right: every restuarant recommendation was great; specialized itineraries for our limited touring time were carefully prepared. We were in the heart of the action (barely a half block from Pike Market) but the room and bedding suggested were in the clouds. Seattle's integrated public transport system is always just two blocks away.I highly recommend it whether you have limited time due to business or you have Seattle as a vacation desitnation.

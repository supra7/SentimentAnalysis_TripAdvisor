Based on other travellers reviews I was expecting this hotel to be a hit or miss. Since I've booked with hotels.com i was expecting,as usual,an old,worn out room with no view. When asked to have a better view the lady at the front desk gave us a city view wich was really fantastic. Ok no fireworks,but the view was stunning anyway. The hotel has still that '80 feelings that does not bother when clean and rightly updated. You can actually notice this place has gone tru renovation more than once in the public areas. The staff was very attentive,especially in the grill restaurant/cafeteria. The rooms are in a word HUGE,very clean and well kept. A little bit on the darkish side maybe. Bed was just ok,I was expecting a bit more from a Westin Heavenly bed. It turned out that it's the same mattress I have at home ( Sealy) just way bigger... I'm not fancy about Seattle,but If it will happen to go back there this will be my place to stay.

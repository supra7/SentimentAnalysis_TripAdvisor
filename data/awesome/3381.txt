I have stayed in the Hilton Seattle Airport several times on business (most recently, January 2009) and have always had a great experience. The rooms are large and comfortable, with a great work area and lots of light. There are extra amenities in the room (body wash, robe, umbrella) that are appreciated. The hotel's breakfast buffet is very good, with a lot of healthy options. The fitness center is well-equipped and clean. The hotel's staff is particularly excellent -- in the one instance where I had a problem, it was quickly resolved. The shuttle drivers to the airport are really nice and the shuttle service is reliable and fast. The hotel has a great location, both for convenience to the airport and for using the bus to get to downtown Seattle. Highly recommended!

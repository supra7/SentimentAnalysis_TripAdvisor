A PERFECT HOLIDAY! We stayed in buliding 12 on the fourth floor. Fantastic view of the grounds and the ocean. A walk to the beach, but no problem there. If you are a light sleeper know that the disco is close to this building. We loved being in this location. Our concierge, Roberto was the best! He made our stay even better! We are "foodies" and can say we enjoyed all the food, especially the outstanding breakfast they put out at World Cafe! WOW! The grill at the pool and the beach were also perfect for lunch. We did get seating for the show at Hitmitsu (?) and it was worth it. The pools were so nice, and the beach is outstanding so very very nice! Was a bit surprised that there are broken lounge chairs on the beach. We took the trip to Cozemel and it was a great day. It was hard to give up even one day at the resort. The entertainment staff was fantastic. You can join in or not, no pressure. The theater is top notch, very cool to be in the somewhat open air building watching a movie or a show. The entire staff was THE BEST. We thought they were worth every tip we gave them. Incredible service. You want for nothing. The only thing that made us uncomfortable was hotel guests that put cigaretts out on the concrete or in the sand at the beach. Rude. We will return to the best vacation spot we have ever been to.

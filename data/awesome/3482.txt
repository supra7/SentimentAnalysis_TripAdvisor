What a fabulous hotel. Booked a deluxe suite for 2 nights. Great location, service, with beautiful modern spacious rooms. We did not eat at the hotel as we prefer Reuben's restaurant around the corner for breakfast. The beds were very comfortable, clean and the hot tub overlooking the city was spectacular. Bathroom was very large with overhead rain shower head and separate tub. Having been raised in Montreal, it was nice to return and have such a great experience. Booked online not knowing what to expect and we loved it! Will be back for sure.

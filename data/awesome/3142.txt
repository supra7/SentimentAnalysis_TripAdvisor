I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. As usual I was travelling for business and working at a large event at the Washington State and Convention Center which is half a block away. It's a gem of a hotel so close to the centre and different to the other multinational hotels in the immediate area that are the same the world over. I had chosen a mid range room and was pleasantly surprised to find I was given a suite. This place isn't uber plush but it's really comfortable and my room felt homely which is a rare feeling in a hotel. My bathroom had a charming New England feel to it and it was a nice place to relax and soothe my jet lag. There's no restaurant per se but you can order room service and there's a bar that gets busy at the weekend with fun locals. On the whole it's a quiet hotel, with chilled out and relaxed staff. It's a pleasure to stay there. A friend of mine who lives locally informed me that it's a well established hotel that's been around a long time and has a good reputation which I feel is well deserved.

We stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon August 1 - 8. We stayed in the honeymoon suite ocean front, and we were blown away with the gorgeous room and view!! The staff was so awesome, and catered to our every need. They were so friendly and helpful. The resort is so beautiful and clean. We loved the food and the entertainment!! Our concierge went above and beyond for us. Their entertainment staff was amazing!! We love to play sports, and they always had something fun going on every day!! We can not say one bad thing about this resort!! We are definitely going back for our anniversary!!

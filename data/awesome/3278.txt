This hotel is clean, well managed and has all a tired traveller wants. The rooms are huge, bed is to die for (love those Hampton beds) and they get breakfast out at 5.00AM!! The front staff got us a private car for 20.00 less than a taxi to get us to the train station!! Will stay again!! Thanks Willie!!

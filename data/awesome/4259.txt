We went to SMB for our honeymoon almost two years ago and had an amazing time. We spent a few days doing excursion and felt we didn't fully get to experience all the resort had to offer...so we had to go back. Our second trip we planned with another couple that would focus on enjoying the beverages, activities and incredible food. This was certainly accomplished and we look forward to returning for a third trip - why go anywhere else when you have already found the best! Also, upgrading to Preferred was a very nice extra touch. It was a great place to get a wonderful espresso/latte/coffee in the morning as well as a wonderful pre-dinner cocktail area. Once again, everything was top-notch.

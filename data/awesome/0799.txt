My best friend and I stayed at the Ace from June 23rd thru June 28th. First of all, I have stayed at MANY hotels. The Ace was by far the coolest. As soon as we arrived we were hauling our luggage up the stairs and Ed the manager wouldnt let us carry our bags any farther. He jumped right up and carried them the rest of the way for us! Our room wasnt ready when we got there (4 hours before check in) but our wait was only about 15 minutes. When we got into our room we were so excited..we had room 106. It was very chic/hip. Bright white walls and a stainless steel sink. A flat screen tv attached to the wall and a view to die for...perfect for people watching! The hotel is right across the street from the Belltown Market, a little convienience store, and Belltown Pizza. The Cyclops downstairs was great. My friend and I both suffer from insomnia, and while yes it was very noisy outside, it didnt phase us one bit. We joked that our bed must have had sleeping crack in it! We slept like babies! The people at the front desk were great...Ed actually told us the best ferry to ride and where to go(we went to Bainbridge Island on his recomendation and it was beautiful!) The bathrooms were clean..and having to leave the room to shower was not a problem, they offered shampoo,conditioner, and bodywash in the shower. Breakfast was great. Coffee was strong. You could generally never tell that anyone else was staying at the hotel unless you saw them in the hallway. The employees leave the hotel at midnight and your room key works as the front door key...not a problem what so ever. The mirror in our room had the phrase "you are beautiful" etched into it. The area was FANTASTIC! 2nd ave is a blast as far as the bar scene goes! I 100% loved the Ace and would most def go back. In fact, I would love to plan a trip to one of the other Ace destinations just to get to experience it all over again!

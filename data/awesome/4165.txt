We honeymooned here a couple weeks ago. Got married at the Excellence Riviera Cancun Hotel and then spent the following 3 nights here to relax. So of course we compared it to the Excellence while we were there. It's funny though because Secrets was a part of Excellence a couple years ago but split, but they never tried to differentiate, they had similar menus, activities, the spa, everything really. I'm not really going to go into detail because you have to just book it and come, you won't be disaapointed. It's visually stunning, all this great decor and tile work, they really did a nice job building this place (only 2 years old btw). Beach is gorgeous!! Pools are beautiful too. Loved it! We were here for 3 nights and had a swim up room in the preferred club. I'm not sure Preferred club is worth it but I enjoyed being really close to the pool and we did go in the club a couple times, one to get a nicer glass of wine and enjoyed some apps before dinner. Swim up rooms are beautiful and the water was so warm, I loved it. The spa was the most beautiful spa I've ever seen (massage rooms) but the massage itself was just ok for me, maybe I got the wrong one and should have picked something that gave more pressure. The ONLY real negative I can say is that they kept the restaurants and common areas around 75. So when you first enter them they feel refreshing but then after you're in there you still find yourself warm. Food was excellent, we especially loved the Italian restaurant. So much so we went back a second time in only 3 nights! So book it and enjoy! ;)

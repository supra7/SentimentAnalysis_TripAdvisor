Hotel and room was impeccable - great style, clean, chic, and functional. I actually stayed here twice in early 2008 and loved it both times. Cleanliness: absolutely spotless everywhere, including the gym (which was great by the way since it had a great view and state of the art machines). Service: polite and courteous from the front desk to the bellboy. Location: located right in the downtown core so it was easy to walk everywhere, from St. Catherine's St to the Bell Center (which was just right across the street!). Value: expensive but worth every penny as the rooms were just wonderful and so comfortable and stylish. Bathrobes were a great touch! Rooms: as I've said again and again, they were just fantastic. I have never stayed at a nicer hotel and I've stayed at my share of Fairmonts and equivalent hotels. Overall: Would return again and again and recommend it to everyone - just make sure you're willing to take a hit in the wallet!

This was our second visit to Secrets Maroma Beach Resort. Our first stay was in April 2010 and during that stay we were offered a free, 5 night return stay if we would transfer to one of their sister resorts (Secrets Silversands) for the last two nights of our trip. Since we had paid for a Preferred Club, Ocean View Room, they guaranteed that on our return trip, we would be guaranteed the same accommodations. We took them up on their offer and returned for our free trip this past week (March 5-10). We were not disappointed with this decision. They offered us an ocean view preferred club room as promised, plus the option of upgrading to an ocean front room for only $75 per night. We jumped on that opportunity and did not regret it. The view was stunning and being able to wake up each morning watching and hearing the waves was priceless. Since our trip was so affordable, we treated ourselves to 80 min massages at the spa. If I ever had a complaint, it was only that my stomach wasn't big enough to try all of the wonderful food. The hor' derves by the pool were such a treat and the service was fantastic. My husband and I will definitely be returning!

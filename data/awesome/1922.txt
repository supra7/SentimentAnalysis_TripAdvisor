We stayed at this hotel because it has a fantastic downtown location and because it has relatively inexpensive suites. We have two young children (2 and 5 years old) and so a suite helps a lot. The hotel is in an older building which has been renovated. The rooms are nice. Ours was on the 8th floor. One concern was that the doors between the two rooms of the suite are not solid, they are open slats. So if you are in one room and want to watch the TV while someone in the other room is sleeping, the sound gets through. Unfortunately, I've found most suites are like this these days. The room was new and nicely decorated. Rooms size is decent, and the closet is huge -- like small walk in room. Hotel seems well built and the rooms are quiet. The main bed was great. The fold out bed was not so good. Very saggy. An adult might not be happy with it, but the two children were fine. Valet parking is available. Not cheap, but about the same price as it costs to self-park in Downtown Seattle so a good deal. One concern we had was that the windows could be opened all the way. This was a huge worry for us since the hotel is on the 8th floor. We watch the boys but you never know -- and it is a LONG way down. The air conditioning works well so we did not need to open them. I mentioned this to the front desk, not expecting anything to come of it. But, surprisingly, the next day a guy came to our room and attached some brackets to the windows which blocked them from opening at all. He said the manager had sent him, and that he would come back after we left and take the brackets off. This just blew me away. How many hotels would send someone to make physical modifications to a room based on a guest concern? Major kudos to the management of the Hotel Andra Seatlle. We'll certainly consider staying there next time we come to Seattle.

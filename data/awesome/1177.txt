My 2 friends and I stayed 4 nights at the Mayflower Park. We had a room on the 12th floor (top floor) with two queen beds and a roll-away. The room was just great ! It was not huge, but was nice and roomy. The bathroom was on the small side, but more than adequate for the 3 of us. The decorations were lovely and the beds comfy. The location is fantastic ! Just a short walk to all the stores and just a few blocks to Pike Place Market, We had dinner (tapas) in the restaurant in the hotel, Andaluca. Very nice meal. We also had dinner one evening at a great seafood restaurant just a few blocks walk away called McCormick's. The staff at the Mayflower Park were exceptional. One day I was reading in the lobby and one of the staff asked me if I would like a glass of water. He then went to Oliver's (the lounge) and brought me back a glass of ice water with a lemon in it, and moved a table beside me, How nice of him ! We would stay here again is a flash, and loved this hotel !

This hotel was an "easy" beach vacation. It is 30 minutes from the airport. The beach in the Maroma area is much better than the Mayakoba or Playa del Carmen beaches. This resort has great rooms and accomodations (make sure you get a room with a moat!). Tons of honeymooners were there. There is entertainment at night that is fun. We went with friends and this was a perfect set up. No checks to split! Drinks were plentiful (a little too plentiful) and the food was good. The service was top notch (as always in Mex). Would I come back here? yes! For an all-inclusive, this is a nice one with a great beach. Email me any questions.

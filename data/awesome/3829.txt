we have just returned from maroma and had a wedding there just made for 2 there isn't one bad word i can say about this place except for the petty comments that others have left if thats all you have to worry about on a holiday then stay at home!!!!!!!!!!! everything was perfect i have never recieved service like what i recieved here all the staff are so friendly and welcoming there was nothing we needed for i have never experienced the kind of care and attention that we recieved here. this paradise should be more publized in ireland than it is it's just heaven we had a swim out room and to be honest we could not believe our luck talk about living the dream if could afford it i would be back there year after year fair enough the red meat is a bit tough but you'd get over that they will learn in time as a mam of 2 small kids i've never and i mean never have experienced so much relaxation special mention to louise and james from from kilkenny and angela and tommy from buffulo ny you guys were amazing we stayed in building 22 and our lovely concierge sara what a beautiful girl inside and out she was beyond fantastic i cannot recommend this place more i actually don't have the words to describe how fantastic it all was and as for cecila reyes our wedding planner bloody fantastic i don't know how that girl does it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

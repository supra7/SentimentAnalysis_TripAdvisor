We stayed at Hotel Max for five nights and I can't think of a single thing really wrong with the place. Sure the room was smaller than usual, but who cares. It more than made up for it in quality, and besides you don't stay in your hotel room the whole time. The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful. Often times they would go out of their way to make sure we were taken care of and if we had any questions. We dined in the restaurant once, and it was excellent. The wait staff was friendly and the sushi was prepared well. We could never hear out neighbors in the adjoining rooms, and the street noise wasn't bad at all from the 6th floor. Yes, the snacks and drinks they provide in the room are expensive. We ended up getting our own drinks and fresh fruit from Pike's to fill the fridge instead. We took a towncar to and from the airport, and it was worth the convenience ($38 one way). Also, if you can plan ahead don't bother renting a car and taking it to the hotel. If you can plan far ahead enough in advance there is a zip car right across the street and others only a couple of blocks away. I would definitely stay there again.

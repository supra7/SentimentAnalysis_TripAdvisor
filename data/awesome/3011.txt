Rocked up here after 3 days camping in the rain with a leaky tent. When the front desk staff heard this they upgraded me to a king room for free. The room was clean and comfortable, there's a minibar, free wifi, and some lovely extra touches like a pillow menu, so there was no chance of not getting a decent night's sleep. The staff the next morning remembered me and asked if I had been more comfortable than in my tent. I only had a couple of hours to spare in Seattle but the central shops and locations were only a few minutes walk away. The sushi in the adjoining restaurant was really good and the staff there were super friendly too. I will definitely go back and stay here again next time I'm in Seattle.

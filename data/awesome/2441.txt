We really enjoyed ourselves and felt that the location is ideal for a trip to Seattle. The rooms are quite large and the lobby bar area is great. The staff at the front desk and bar area were really friendly and definitely helped us enjoy our trip. Including making great suggestions about places to visit and eat in the nearby area.

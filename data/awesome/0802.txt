OMG! At the last minute my husband and I decided to take a last minute, spontaneous trip for a conference in the state of Washington. The service of the staff, especially the manager made the trip for us both! I flew from Hawaiii and my husband flew in from Michigan. I arrived early and tired to the hotel, but I was accomodated immediately with a lovely room. In the first room we stayed at there was a glass shower behind the bed. How wild is that? Then we were upgraded into another chic room that had a revolving bathroom door with a mirror on it. My husband thought it was the coolest thing and would like to build one in our house. The complimentary breakfast and the mint scented amenities were nice to have. The ambiance of the place was so warm and cozy. The manager gave us a list of great places to dine at and visit and we enjoyed them all! Truly, it was the warm and kind service that made me feel at home and welcomed to the beautiful state of Washington. I strongly recommend giving the manager a raise! Thank you for having us. We look forward to making a trip back!

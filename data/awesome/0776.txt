Stayed at the Inn At The Market for one night in October on our way to Vancouver Island. We were very pleasantly surprised as when we arrived, our room had been upgraded to a fabulous two story suite from a standard city view room. The room decor was very nice and very clean and had a view of the city from one window and a view of the Pike Place Market and ocean from the other. The Tempur-Pedic bed provided a great nights rest. There is a rooftop deck that you can relax on and we enjoyed the night time view very much. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating and even though we were only there for one night, the whole experience was terrific. We wished we had a few more nights to spend, but we will definitley be back in the future. Thank you everyone at the Inn for providing us with such a wonderful time.

I read a lot of great reviews for this hotel so I had fairly high expectations going in and was not dissapointed. Yes, the rooms are small but so comfortable. I loved the comfy beds, fluffy towels, and a great shower. I even liked the italian coffee in the coffeemaker.The gym was clean and had new equipment.Red Fin was great. I ate alone and the service was very attentive. The location is very convenient too. It's an easy walk to the convention center and shops. Love the Max!

My husband and I stayed at the Maroma Beach from 10 July - 20 July and it was absolutely amazing. Everything about it was just perfect, the staff were really attentive, the food at all the restuarants was fabulous and the hotel its self was 5 star in our opinion. One of our favourite places at the hotel was the Coco coffee bar, the coffees and afternoon cakes were lovely! The beach is one of the best we have had and we have stayed at other 5 star resorts. The grounds of the hotel are kept immaculate. We went to the evening entertainment on a few occassions and thought it was very, very good. All in all a perfect holiday and we wouldn't hesitate to go back!!!

Excellent location....Very helpful staff....I was traveling with my eight year old son and we arrived very late at night from a very long trip super tired....They had everything ready for us when we arrived, excellent service with a friendly and familiar feeling....I just loved this hotel.....Oh and by the way, the bed....My gosh....you are sleeping in heaven....!!!

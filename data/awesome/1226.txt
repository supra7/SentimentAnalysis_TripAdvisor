Highly recommend the Mayflower Park. Stayed in a queen delux room two nights, (August 3rd and 4th) on the 10th floor. Beds are great, room very large. Could not hear people in the hallway or other rooms at all. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. The bar is very cosy - and great food. I cannot say anything bad about this hotel. It was everything and more than I expected. I'll certainly be back.

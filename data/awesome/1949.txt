We visited the Andra and stayed three nights. It was a wonderful hotel and they made us feel very special from the moment we checked in. We are an older couple and enjoy the quiet atmosphere. The lobby restaurant was animated, but was never a problem - smelled delicious! There was always someone to greet us at the door and the desk. Our room was very small, but we did not request a large room. The bathroom perfect, with super comfortable bathtub. The bed and bedding was wonderful. We found the website and will check out the pillows! The Andra was very clean. There are not a lot of reasonably priced restaurants within sight of the Andra, but about two blocks away is a large shopping mall. The Andra didn't mention this to us when we asked about dining, and we found it on our own. It was fine for our early dinner, but would avoid after dark. We would definitely return and we thank everyone for making our visit a happy one!

This was our second visit to SMB and was even better than the first. The resort has added a few additional touches that are superb  umbrellas at the Sugar Reef pool so that you dont have to roast while sitting at those tables, serving snacks in the pool on Saturday was fabulous  a real wow factor. My husband and I both thought the food was even better than last year, with the exception of the steakhouse, which we both felt was adequate, but nothing spectacular. This is the only adult AI that we have returned to. Weve loved the others (both Excellence properties, iberostar Grand Bavaro and Sandals Royal Bahamian), but would easily return to SMB for a third visit. A few suggestions would be to have an outdoor lounge area on the beach for evening enjoyment, similar to the X-lounge at the Excellence properties. Id also love for them to show the nightly movies on the large inflatable screen at the Sugar Reef bar rather than at the indoor theatre. The theatre can get very stuffy. Finally, the hydrotherapy circuit is still a mediocre experience. The ones at the Excellence properties are far superior, only because they are staffed and you are guided through the circuit. Here at SMB, you are left to your own devices. The spa itself, however, is spectacular, as was the massage I received from Fabioa! Our concierge, David was very helpful and attentive. He made our reservations at Himitsu and when I needed to change them to add another couple we had met the previous year, he did so immediately with no problem. Kevin at the pool is fantastic, I love how they actually enforce the rules surrounding leaving belongings on chairs to reserve them. If you do so prior to 10:30, they will be removed. I loved not having to worry about finding a spot, even at 100% capacity, you could always find a chair at the pool and beach. I wish more resorts would do this. Another wonderful Secrets experience and we look forward to returning a third time!

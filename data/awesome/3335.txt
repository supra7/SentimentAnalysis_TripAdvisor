We needed a place to stay for an airport shuttle. We had a rental car form the airport to get around town, so we checked in, then took the car back and then called the shuttle to return us to the motel. The man was a little late since he had been delivering people to various restaurants in the area: what a service for all! It is rather an large property and they wer enot busy. We stayed, had a nice breakfast and then took the shuttle back to the airport for our flight. Yes, we would recommend this: it is an excellent Quality Inn stay.

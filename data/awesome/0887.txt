Great price of $120/night. Upon check in, we were given a free room upgrade, with a beautiful view and access to their complimentary breakfast the next morning. The front desk was friendly, and the room was beautiful, clean and luxurious. We had to leave early the next morning so we did not see much of the hotel but from what we saw, we were pleased. I will definitely stay here again when I am in town- I love free upgrades.

For us, a young married couple looking to spend new years at the beach, Secrets Maroma was the perfect place to be! Beautiful, romantic and lots of fun! The service: even in high season impeccable. The beach: postcard perfection. The room: very clean, spacious and well decorated. Tip- ask for room on the top floor if you really want an "ocean view", if not you will not see it! Upgrade to preferred club is NOT worth it!!! Excursion: go for the taxi-alternative (better, more private and equally priced as the excursions offered by the hotel). Ask for taxi Playa del Carmen number 1471 driver's name is Oscar! Please say hi to him from the Swiss lawyer couple;) All in all: GO MAROMA!

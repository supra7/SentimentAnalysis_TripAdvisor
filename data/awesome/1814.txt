An outstanding smaller hotel. Perfect location to walk down to the Pike Place Market, across the street to the many restaurants or just a few blocks to so much more that Seattle has to offer. Walk 3 blocks to the mall and take the monorail to the Seattle Center (the Space Needle and the EMP) or the light rail to the airport for $2.50. I was in town strictly for fun with my wife and the Hotel Andra offered everything for a romantic and enjoyable stay. The rooms seemed large, well appointed and comfortable. Only downside was hearing so much of the street noise (including the walk/don't walk audio prompts). I prefer boutique hotels and this was an great place.

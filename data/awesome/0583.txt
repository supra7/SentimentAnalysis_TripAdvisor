We just spent 5 nights at the Inn at the Market to celebrate our 25th anniversary . We had a room with a view of Puget Sound that was glorious (even though you also see a few roofs as well as the water and the iconic sign of the public market)! We made the choice to stay at the Inn (rather than the Edgewater) because of the TripAdvisor reviews of both (Edgewater got bad reviews for management, staff, and noisiness) and I am thrilled that we chose the Inn at the Market. The staff was so gracious and friendly, the beds were the most comfortable we have ever slept in (Hypnos mattresses - we asked!), it was quiet, the rooms and the view were perfect, and the location is wonderful (while Edgewater is away from the center). We were only a few steps away from fresh fruit at the Pike Place Market, locally made Beecher's cheese, a wonderful wine shop, the best gelato we have had in the states, great clam chowder, amazing European hot chocolate made from chocolate shavings at the Chocolate Box , and International restaurants and bakeries (from crumpets to Piroshky's!)- all within a few blocks. We had picnics every day! The location is perfect for a stay without a car. The light line from the airport took only 37 minutes even when it is snowing, as it was on our last day. The light rail line ends 3 blocks from the Inn and costs only $2.50! The Seattle Art Museum (now showing a marvelous Picasso exhibit from Paris), Pioneer Square, the Seattle Center (for theatre) and the harbor/lock tours are close enough to walk. And shopping is only a few blocks to the east. The Inn is expensive but worth it. We do NOT recommend the cafe Champagne. The cafe is highly rated but the food was almost inedible - maybe just a bad night - or maybe it is resting on its good reviews?

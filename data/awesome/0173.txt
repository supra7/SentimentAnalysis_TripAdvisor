You need to stay here if you are in Seattle, we went with a two year old and they had a toy chest by the front desk which kids can chose a toy from. A wonderful and unique perk! The staff is amazing, they have a free wine happy hour everyday from 5 to 6pm. They also brought up a goldfish in a bowl for us to keep us company and my child was in love with it. The rooms are standard but we had a cool big window seat and DVD player. This is our favorite chain for sure and this was out first time at this one. To top it off, my daughter brought her blanket and bunny into the bath with her and the housekeeping manager was nice enough to throw it in the dryer and bring it back to us. Above and beyond! The location is walking distance to some stuff but mostly cabs. You can walk to Pike place though... Stay here for sure!

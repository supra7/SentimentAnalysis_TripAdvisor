Leave the kids at home and have a romantic 3 day weekend here. I visited on business but plan to return with the husband in tow. I loved the bed and didn't want to leave. The service was excellent and the hotel is centrally located within walking distance to the convention center, shopping, local theatres and tons of restaurants. If ordering room service you have to be indulgent and try the gingered banana pancakes with coconut - to die for! I didn't see one other hotel in the Seattle area that I would have prefered to stay at. one warning: seriously leave the kids at home, this place is for adults only!

This hotel is a 5 stars with 4 diamonds and 5 heats. I've been located into the Prefered Club with a Junior Suit with a Bath on the balcony. Restaurants are 5 forth. The have a great collection of wine. Spa is one of the nicest I've ever seen in an Hotel. Service is perfect. If you looking for one of the best hotel in Rivera Maya this is the place to go.

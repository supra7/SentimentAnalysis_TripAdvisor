The staff are the best and enjoy serving you. Ladies should pack enough dresses and guys should count on pants and shirts for evening dinners. Do budget in a day or two at the Spa, it's the best. Don't forget to tip your favorite servers. The room was beautiful. We were in the main building on the PH floor with a king bed, a tub on the patio. You could see the whole resort along with the ocean. Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy!!!

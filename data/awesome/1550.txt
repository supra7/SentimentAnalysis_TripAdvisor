The Sheraton Seattle is a great location if you are taking an Alaskan cruise. So much so that a major cruise line has a desk in the lobby! Pike Market Place is an easy walk. Bring back some fruit and a pastry and you have "breakfast in bed" the next morning! Coffee pots with good coffee (it is Seattle!!) are in each room. Chihuly decorations are in the lobby, and guest rooms. Public transportation is very near, but you can walk many places.

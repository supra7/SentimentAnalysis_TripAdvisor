we had a group of 5 couples.. ages 30 - 45..sept 2011.. this was the 1st all-inclusive vacation for all of us... we had a WONDERFUL time.. could not imagine it being any better!! rooms were very clean & very nice.. had a swim up pool which we did use a few times... water was cold and after we left i remember reading where someone said you could ask them to heat that water up.. hate we didnt think of that while we were there.. we did have a hard time being able to sit together at dinner.. had to wait a while.. but that was ok... only had music by the pool one day.. would have loved that every day... enjoyed the night shows & the disco.. food was good.. i gained 5 pounds.. glad it wasnt any better.. staff was the best!!! spa was awesome!! got the couples massage.... we did have to wait a while at the airport when we landing.. but no big deal.. we made the best out of everything!! the road going up to the resort is really bumpy.. and had we not of read this we would have been worried about where we were actually going... when we got there one of the couples suites was not right beside us but they changed that the next day... they will try to make you happy.... we had pictures taken.. they do a good job.. beautiful place for this.. went out on the sail boat.. pretty cool.. should you have any questions i would be glad to help... we really, really enjoyed it alot.. going to another one this year.. hope they can hold up to what we have already experienced!!!

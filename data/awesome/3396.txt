Hoorah to Radisson Hotels for having the Sleep-Number beds at their Seattle Airport location! This hotel has been around for a while and has had several name changes in it's time. However, it is apparent that it has gone through an extensive renovation upon Radisson's acquisition. My room 619, was very close to the elevator, had newer dark walnut furniture with a wrap-around desk and large flat screened television. The sleep-number bed is heavenly and guarantees you a good night's sleep. I also had free wifi in my room, and coffee/maker/liquid Coffee Mate, which I used since I had no time for breakfast. This property is perfect for anyone flying in or out of Sea-Tac on short notice. The location is directly across the street, and if a person wanted, they could actually walk from the airport to the hotel. Of greater importance, the hotel is right next door to "13 Coins" restaurant, a five-star Seattle staple. When everything else is closed, 13 Coins is open and serving breakfast to dessert--sit at the chef's bar! The Radisson also provides free airport shuttle service on the half hour. If you are tight for time, get down to the lobby early as the shuttle driver doesn't like to be rushed. I highly recommend this Sea-Tac hotel over all the rest for its quality, location, and amenities.

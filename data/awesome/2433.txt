The Westin Seattle is a great place to stay. The lobby is huge with a bar with a decent happy hour. Check in was relatively quick. The hotel itself is made up of two towers, which have about 40 floors each. The elevators are pretty quick to get up and down. The room was spacious, the bathroom was nice with a dual shower head but may be just a bit cramped for more than one person, and the beds were fabulous. I slept great each night. I forgot toothpaste, and it was brought to my room in about 2 minutes. The Westin is located near great shopping and within a short walk to the water and market.

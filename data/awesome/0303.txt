My sister and I spent 5 days at the Warwick Seattle on our recent trip. We stayed at 5 or 6 different hotels but none compared to our stay at the Warwick. It was absolutely awesome. The staff was very kind, the rooms were excellent and the food was outstanding, especially the prime rib. If we ever return to Seattle we would head straight for the Warwick. Seattle is one of the prettiest cities I have ever visited. I highly recommend that everyone that visits Seattle to stay at the Warwick.

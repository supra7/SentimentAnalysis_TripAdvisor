My wife & I stayed here August 29-Sept. 3. It's a quick 30 minute drive from the airport. Check in was easy & we were on the beach in no time. Maroma beach is very nice, with a feeling of seclusion & relaxation. There are hardly any beach walkers & there were no beach vendors during our stay. We also enjoyed lounging by the pool everyday. Service in both areas was great. Around noon everyday they'll have servers around the pools bring by different food items. The grill was good & the sit-down lunch option was good, too. All restaurants we tried at night were very good. We'd probably rank our top three as 1) the Japanese hibachi, 2) el Patio (Mexican), & 3) Portofino (Italian). It's nice that they have a wide selection of Mexican beers & top shelf liquor if asked for. The room was modern, clean, & very quiet. We thought it was one of the quieter resorts we've stayed at, in terms of hallway noise & noise coming from rooms around you. We hardly heard anything, which made for quality sleep throughout the week. Overall, it's a wonderful place to go for a relaxing vacation & we'd go back without question.

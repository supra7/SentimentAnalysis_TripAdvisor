We recently spent our 20th wedding anniversary here and realized that we have done more anniversaries here than anywhere else. The Inn's location is wonderful with Pike Place Market and 1st Avenue so close; lots to see and do. The rooms are large and full of light, the bed was wonderfully comfortable, and staff were helpful and friendly. We had reserved a city view room but when they found it was our anniversary, gave us a free upgrade to a water view room - and a deliciious chocolate dessert in our room. The rooftop deck expands the view even more and is a great place to spend time. We spent time at the Market, had a martini at the Triple Door (live happy hour music, no cover) and a delicious dinner at Chez Shea. We love the Inn and I'm sure we'll be back!

Secrets Maroma Beach was absolutely beautiful! Their attention to detail, along with the friendliness and professionalism of all the staff made it one of the best vacations we have had. Everyone there, from entertainment staff to bartenders, to housekeeping, concierges, servers on the beach -- could not do enough for you. They went far and above -- from a Super Bowl party on the beach to Mexican fiestas at night to daily luncheon buffets on the beach and at the pool -- their sole purpose was to make Secrets Maroma Beach a place you would definitely recommend and want to return to.

I stayed at Hotel Le Crystal on business in July 2011. The hotel itself is beautiful, and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. What's even better is the staff; very attentive and welcoming. The location of the hotel is also very central. If I ever return to Montreal, I will definitely stay at Hotel Le Crystal.

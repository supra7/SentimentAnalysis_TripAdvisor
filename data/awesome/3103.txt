A truly individual yet high end place in a great location. Hotel Max presses all the right buttons for anyone expecting the Emerald City to be a little bit alternative but a whole lot welcoming. Stayed in a "Queen of Art" room which to be fair was a little on the small side (don't try swinging a kitten let alone a full moggy) but wonderfully light and super hip with plasma screen and hi tech bathroom. The vibrant ambience of the lobby and landings with all the art and photograpy is a cultural experience in itself. Will be back!

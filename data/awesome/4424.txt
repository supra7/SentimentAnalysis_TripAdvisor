I am still at Secrets Maroma Beach as I write this review. This is our first visit to Secrets Maroma Beach, we have however travelled to Secrets Punta Cana in Dominican Republic, I can honestly say that as a brand they have got everthing 100% right. We have stayed for 11 blissful nights in paradise and are so sad to leave. Everything about this place is beautiful. Obviously there will always be some fussy travellers who complain about the smallest things but we have nothing bad to say at all. If anyone has any questions about Secrets Maroma Beach or Secrets Punta Cana don't hesitate to e mail, I am happy to help. Thanks for another wonderful holiday Secrets...... As usual Excellente!!!!

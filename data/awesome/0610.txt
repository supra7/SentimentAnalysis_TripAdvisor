A great place to stay. The rooms were spacious, surprisingly quiet for such an active part of downtown, extremely clean, and as advertised. If they said partial water view - you had a view out your window! Room service was on time and the food was good. Valet parking is a must because of location, but a large selection of great restaurants are in walking distance. Staff really knows how to make you feel welcome. It is nice to experience quality customer service in this day of self-serve.

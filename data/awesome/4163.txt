We booked a 5 day 4 night get-a-way with Secrets Maroma, Mexico. The little extra for direct flight from Charlotte, NC to Cancun was worth the money. We were greated at the AirPort by the driver to our resort. Its very confusing when you arrive. As you go thur the Airport you will be approached by people saying they can help you get to your resort. They are basicly time share people. Dont stop and talk, keep moving out the door and you will find your ride. Once out side you will be directed straight to a van to take you. When we got to the gate of the resort, The security took note of how many were in the van and who was staying and who would be coming back out to go to the next resort. Very Secure. Upon arrival we were given a map, a glas of champane and a cool towel and we knew we did the right thing comming here. Our room was not ready but they took care of our luggage and you were free to do what ever pleased you. Bars everywhere, the pools were awesome, and lots to eat of course. The rooms were beautiful. A turn down service each night and a fully stocked room frig. A garden tub in the room, Which did not fit the decor, but was useful just the same. Flat screen TV's with 1/2 spanish speaking and english. Every day the Cheifs would come around the pool with trays of the most wonderful food. Plus you never had to look for a waiter, They are around every where. We tipped our dinner meal and some of our favorite waiters and waitress, but money spent was nothing. Several special dinning facilities on site and a show every night. This is the place to go for sure, One great thing, This is a Adult location ONLY. And it was great. No running Kids, No screaming, Just peace and quiet and adults. W-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l-!

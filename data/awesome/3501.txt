We stayed here for 3 days with our two small children. The suite was extremely clean and nice, the bathroom was huge with nice amenities. The pool on the 12th floor was great, heated with towels and a lifeguard which was appreciated. The hotel helped us hire a babysitter for the nights. The location is right near the shopping on Sainte-Catherine. Don't forget that you also have to pay $20+ a day to park your car.

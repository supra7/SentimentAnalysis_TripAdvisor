My husband and I stayed here for a couple of nights during our time in Seattle. The room (a suite) we had was beautiful (dark Italian wood design) with lots of wonderful touches to make it homey - not the least of which being an absolutely luxurious bed. The service was excellent, very friendly and helpful. I can imagine that the small room sizes could be a problem for some people, but they play it off with delicate old fashioned style decor and the rooms were perfectly scaled (with the furniture chosen to fit the space). We loved our time in the lobby which had simply stunning decor. I would definitely stay there again.

My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Seattle and a wonderful four day stay at the Inn at the Market. The hotel was recommended by a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased. The hotel is well-maintained and very modern, but not stuffy. We had a lovely partial water view room - comfortable queen bed, small bay window with table and chairs, sofa, excellent armoire and closet storage, mini-bar with enough room to hold drinks, etc. we purchased elsewhere, and a large writing desk. The bathroom was modern yet warmly decorated. If there is one thing we could change, it would be to upgrade the TV channel selection. While it's true that you don't go on vacation to watch TV, it would have been nice to have entertaining television to watch a little before falling asleep and when we wanted to just relax and enjoy the room. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Anything we asked for was taken care of with a smile, from making reservations for a tour of the Boeing plant (highly recommended, by the way) to printing out our boarding passes the night before we left. The location cannot be beat. The hotel is just steps from Pike's Market, and within walking distance to almost all of the major sights. One place not to be missed is the little french bakery, Le Panier. Exit the hotel on Stewart Street and turn left; cross at the corner and the bakery is on your right. (It faces the Market.) Zeek's Pizza on 5th & Denney is a great place to stop for lunch after seeing the Space Needle, which is only about a mile from the Inn. We can't wait to go back to Seattle and the Inn at the Market.

I'm not 100% clear how the TripAdvisor rankings work, but I'm sure the equation takes into account the overall number of reviews. Being only 1 year old, Le Crystal must not have enough overall reviews, because make no mistake about it, this is THE nicest hotel in the city! I travel to Montreal at least 3 times/year and have been doing so for several years. I have yet to stay in the same hotel twice, just because there has always been room for improvement. That is, until now. All the previous reviews are right on: the highest quality bed and linens you will experience anywhere, exceptional service, high class furnishings, a bathroom to die for, and the quietest suites ever. Even the doors to each suite are quiet- slow closing, and completely sealed so absolutely no hallway noise gets through. The pool and hot tub area are beautiful. The location is central. Perfect. The only issue may be the price; there are other nice hotels around (although not as nice) such as the Gault, Germain (although in need of some updating) and the Loews up the street. I managed a decent price on skyauction, but they will have to try to stay competitive price wise. If you can afford it, well go for it! (just make sure you take the Metro and walk and explore the Plateau/Mont Royal area and not just spend your time downtown). La Colombe on Duluth- small French Bistro worth the trip to Montreal in itself!

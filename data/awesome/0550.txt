I stayed here for the first time on a recent trip to Seattle. The great location was the first thing that drew me to this hotel, but after spending two days there, it was really the fantastic service that stood out. Everyone I dealt with at the hotel was super friendly and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. And of course, the location can't be beat! Less than a block from Pike Place Market and within walking distance of the main downtown area. I highly recommend this hotel.

Recently, I attended a business event @ Hotel Andra and the detail to customer care was outstanding. Guest Rooms, Ballroom & Galleri Room were all utilized and set-up perfectly for our needs. Employees were polite, helpful and went above and beyond to see that our group of 50 was well taken care of during our three day stay. We will most definitely return again next year. We have had nothing but positive feedback from our group with regard to the plush, comfortable rooms and exceptional food from Tom Douglas Catering.

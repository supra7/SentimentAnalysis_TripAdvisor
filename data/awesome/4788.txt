We checked out of Secrets Maroma Beach Riviera Cancun at 8:00 am central time on Saturday, 6/26/2010. An Olympus tours driver picked us up at 8:30 am from the lobby for our trip to the Cancun Airport. We took our last picture at 8:20 am in the lobby of the resort. We securely placed the camera away into a zipped black carry-on personal bag. The camera was a Kodak digital in a small black vinyl case, our name and address was attached to the bottom of the camera with an address label. Our black zipped bag approx 13" x 19" was located in the rear baggage area of the Olympus Tours van. We placed 4 total bags in the van at 8:30 am. The driver went on to Secrets Silversands Resort at 8:45 am to pick up another couple. All three couples were asked to sign for our bags while still traveling to the airport by the Olympus driver. We removed our own bags and wheeled them in to the Cancun Airport. We checked our 1 large bag and went on to the checkpoint scanners. We wanted to take a final picture of our plane for our grand children and the camera was not in the black bag. We went through our 2 carry-on bags thoroughly while waiting at the C16 gate before boarding the aircraft, no camera found. The camera is not as important as the pictures of our 30th wedding anniversary which are irreplaceable. A bad ending to a perfect and beautiful trip. NO PICTURES. We hope something can be done before we make a formal posting on the internet about Olympus Tours and not to Book thru Cheap Caribbean.com due to security reasons. The Better Business Bureau will be notified. We did purchase travel insurance and noticed a clause for baggage and personal effects $1500. The value of the camera was $400.00. The missing pictures, priceless.

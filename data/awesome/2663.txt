This has been one of the best hotels I have stayed at, the beds were amazingly comfortable and the staff could not of been more friendly and helpful. Complementary wine night in a comfortable relaxed setting, they even brought out amazing appitizers for everyone. My experience there for the one night we were in Seattle could not of been better, I will choose this hotel from now on when visiting Seattle. It must tell you something when I have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is the first review I have ever written. :)

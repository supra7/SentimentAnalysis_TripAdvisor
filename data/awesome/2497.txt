The room was nice, it had a murphy bed. The view from #2450 was spectacular. Express checkout was simple, and boarding passes were printed in the hotel lobby free of charge. The room was clean, but the wine glass kept disappearing. I had to call once for a replacement, the next time I did not bother. Self parking is $36 per day. Stores and restaurants are close by.

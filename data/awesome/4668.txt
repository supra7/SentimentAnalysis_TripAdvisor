My husband and I honeymooned at Secrets Maroma, it was the type of honeymoon we dreamed about. It surpassed our expectations in every way. The food was good and they were very accomodating to my vegetarian husband. The room (Jr. Suite) was beautiful and spacious. The mini bar was always stocked with our favoite drinks, room service and turn down service never was a disappointment, we were even surprised with rose petals in our jacuzzi and bed when we returned from our romantic dinner on the beach. The service was amazing and the staff was very professional, accomodating and courteous, no one ever made us feel like they expected a tip (unlike people outside the resort) we always left one anyways. The shows in the theatre were fun. No matter what you're doing (beach, pool, or just around the resort), if you're sitting around you'll always be asked if you need anything (drinks, food, etc.). I could go on and on about how much I love this place. It was heaven on earth, we're already planning a trip back and I can't wait!

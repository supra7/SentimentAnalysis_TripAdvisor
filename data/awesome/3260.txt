We stayed here our first night in Seattle and it worked out very well. The room was a typical Embassy Suites room, which always works out well for our family of four. We love the Happy Hour in the evening, and the breakfasts are always good with lots of delicious options for everyone. Breakfast was busy, but not too crowded. This Embassy Suites has a free shuttle that will not only pick you up from the airport and return, but also take you to any place within five miles of the hotel - for no charge. Since we were not scheduled to pick up our rental car untl the next day, this was great. Our room was not ready when we arrived, so we left our bags with the front desk and had the shuttle take us to the Mall. There is a beautiful large mall very near the hotel. We went and saw a movie, then gave the Embassy Suites a call and they came and got us. No problem, no long wait, no charge. After Happy Hour we decided to go 13 Coins for dinner, which is a wonderful 24 hour restaurant near the airport. Again, no problem. The shuttle driver took us there and then we called when we were ready to go back. Of course, we were sure to tip our driver who by the way was very friendly. We almost felt as though we had our own personal driver! I have no complaints concerning our stay and would be more than happy to stay here again. It was both relaxing and comfortable.

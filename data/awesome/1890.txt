An amazing hotel....Booked it through the websites -- 2 hours after booking, I got to the hotel, they had my room ready, and had a great stay. FYI -- valet parking is $35 a day, but was cheaper than some of the other hotels I had looked at, so assumed it was the price for parking in Seattle. Location is excellent within downtown, but within a five minute walk of shopping and the Pike Place Market. Also about a 15 minute walk to the Space needle. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The restaurant in the hotel is always packed, so don't expect to eat there.

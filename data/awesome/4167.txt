We loved the resort, the beach, the restaurants and the pools. The swing bar was a neat touch as well. Our only complaint is how aggressively we were sold regarding the vacation club. We said we weren't interested in going to any presentation and the gal kept pushing. We were approached again by another staff member while enjoying a drink in the lobby bar. We really felt hassled and did not attend a presentation. I really think you all should eliminate the pushy sales approach.....it seems out of place for such an upscale resort.

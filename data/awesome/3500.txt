This is one cool place. We had a suite, and from the moment we walked in the hotel, we felt we were someplace special, not your typical hotel. The room was spotless, quite contemporary, and had many amenities, including a great rain shower head and nice sitting area. We only stayed one night, but wished we had more time at Crystal.

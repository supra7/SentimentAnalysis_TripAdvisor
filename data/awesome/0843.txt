Loved our stay at Crowne Plaza. It was just easy. No hassles, no complaints, great service and very comfortable linens/bed = great nights rest. There was even 2 different thickness of pillows (which is awesome!), eye masks, ear plugs (in case the hint of city noise bothers you) and linen refresher spray. Service at the bar was just ok....hense why I dropped a notch on the service review but otherwise a wonderful, comfortable stay! Will stay here again!!

First I admit, I'm a huge Kimpton fan. They just have such a fresh approach, and they have a handle on how to make guests feel special. The Kimpton rewards program (called InTouch) is worth joining. They have a great wine hour along with a non-alcoholic selection for those so inclined as well as for the kiddies. The loaner program of a pet goldfish also was a huge hit. The room decor is trendy and unique. This is the third city where we've stayed at a Kimpton, and our family will seek them out wherever we stay.

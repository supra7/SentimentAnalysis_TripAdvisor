Wife and I stayed for a night in a corner suite on second to top floor. Had a great view of Elliott Bay through buildings and the rest of downtown from a great vantage point. The large windows and comfortable furniture provided a great feel. What really stood out for us was the service. Had flowers delivered and forgot to order vases, but hotel staff had flowers delivered and without asking provided vases! The restaurant provided the best breakfast we've had in a long time at a hotel. We decided to come back for the lunch and we're again surprised by the great meal. Perfect portion sizing and just a delicious treat. We walked to the Seattle Art Museum to enjoy the picasso exhibit that's touring the world. The concierge recommended a walk over a cab and he was right, it was a pleasant walk and gave us a good feel for the city. All in all, a great hotel in a great city with fantastic staff. And, unlike most W hotels, this W was not too dark and instead had well lit hallways and public spaces. It certainly didn't give the feeling of entering a night club in full swing when we returned late in the evening. We usually prefer Westins over W's, but this W was definitely a more enjoyable and intimate than the Sheraton and Westin in downtown Seattle. I'd highly recommend for business or pleasure. This is our new favorite starwood property in Seattle.

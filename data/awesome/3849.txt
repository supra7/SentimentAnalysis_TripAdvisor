A wonderful weeks stay at Secrets Maroma Beach - 5 star in everything from the food, the rooms, the pool, the beach and location. The friendliest most attentive staff that take such good care of you. I found Repel mosquito repellent fended off bugs, with the exception of a few determined biters! Four bites in a week - I can live with that. Would return in a heartbeat. Thank you to all at Secrets.

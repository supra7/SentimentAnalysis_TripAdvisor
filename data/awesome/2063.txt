Beautiful view from our waterfront room. Friendly helpful staff. Perfect place for a romantic getaway. Had dinner in the Six Seven restaraunt Friday night which was amazing, and then live music came on around 930pm which added to the atmosphere and made the place even more enjoyable. Check out isn't until noon which is nice, as a lot of places have an 11am check out. Had lunch after check out in the restaraunt which was also really good. We will definitely stay here again when we get the chance.

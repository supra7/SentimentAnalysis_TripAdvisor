This trip was my third to Seattle and my third time at the Sheraton, my favorite downtown hotel. Although I may be biased, each stay has exceeded my expectations. The front desk and bell staff go out f their way upon your arrival and are always there to help. The room is perfect for business needs as well as relaxing. The views from the room the hotel are breathtaking, showing the action of the city. This hotel is close to everything you need to do as it is only a couple minutes to walk to the Pike Place Market, restaurants, shopping and any other event. The lobby lounge and Daily Grill in the hotel are great for meals and drinks.

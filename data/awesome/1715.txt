We stayed at the Sheraton on Auguest 20, 2007. We were pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. I had emailed the hotel earlier requesting a King room in the new tower. I didn't really expect to receive what I'd asked for, afterall I only payed $125 with Priceline. However, upon checkin I was pleasantly suprised to have been assigned a King room in the new tower. The room was lovely. Very comfy bed, lovely view, and a nicer TV than I have at home :), . Bathroom was bright, clean, and comfortable. Location was very convenient. Concierge was most helpful in helping us find out which city bus to take to get to King Street Station. Will not hesitate to stay here again!

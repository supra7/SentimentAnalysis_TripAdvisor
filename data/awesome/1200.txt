This hotel was great. Very clean and perfect location. We had wonderful service dealing with everyone employed by the hotel and even were upgraded to a suite without asking for that. Britney at the front desk was completely amazing and certainly knows what customer service means. They are very lucky to have her. This is an old gem that has been kept up to standards that travelers should expect. Hope you choose to stay here, I am pretty picky so this was a very pleasant surprise.

Wonderful staff, great weather, good food, cant wait to go back. Nothing bad to say. Take my advice, get a swim out room and bring plenty of sunscreen. You can't go wrong here. If you do take a trip to 5th ave. in playa del carmen. Tip the cab driver that picked you up at the resort, and set up a time and place to meet him, he'll show up to take you back. Makes you feel more comfortable than wondering if your about to step into the wrong cab.

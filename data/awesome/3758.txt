My brother and sister-in-law had stayed here, and highly recommended it. Completely lived up to their hype! We stayed in a ocean view swim out suite that was bigger than some apartments I've lived in. (In fact, the bathroom alone was bigger than some apartments I've lived in!). Service was very attentive in the restaurants, as well as on the part of the concierge. Very nice selection of restaurants. Food quality varied somewhat between restaurants (a little disappointed in the Italian restaurant; steakhouse was excellent). Dinner on the beach was fantastic. Material condition of the property was excellent; everything was well maintained and clean. Private transportation to and from the airport also nice. Will definitely go back.

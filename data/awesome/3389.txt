In my whole US Trip, this was the best hotel so far. I had the best sleep ever in that bed. Good quality and a nice room as well. The welcome when entering the hotel was very warm. Friendly and helpful receptionist. The room was nice and big, the only minus point, is that the hotel had no safe in the room, but that seems to be normal... Thanks a lot for such a great stay - finally some really good stay, a pitty, that it was just one night.

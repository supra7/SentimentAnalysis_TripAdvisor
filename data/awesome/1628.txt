My recent stay at the Sheraton Seattle more than met all of my expectations for a Sheraton property. The staff was friendly, the service and food in the Daily Grill was spot on, my room was very comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient for my business travel. I look forward to staying at this hotel for future business travel to Seattle.

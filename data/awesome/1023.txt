Spent 5 nights at Mayflower with my partner in September and after 37 hour travel time with only a few hours of sleep from Hobart, Australia, the greeting and service provided by the all the staff was a fantastic welcome to Seattle. Caught the fast train service from the airport to right near the hotel. Our room was comfortable, clean and quite spacious. The only drawback was not having a refrigerator in the room which is something we are used to. Most of the attractions like Pike market etc are in walking distance and being right in central Seattle shopping is a breeze. Olivers is a bar with class and character, the food was tasty and original and the complimentary evening snacks went well with drinks after walking for many hours. Seattle is a lovely city and coming from Hobart the weather was just like home to us!! I cannot fault any of the hotel staff from the doormen, barpersons, reception and restaurant staff who assisted us willingly and with great courtesy. They even managed to fix up our Boeing factory tour which I had booked online in Australia thinking public transport would be an option to get there. I would highly recommend staying at the Mayflower.

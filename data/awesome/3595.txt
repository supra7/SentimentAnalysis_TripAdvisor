I stayed here for a week whilst on business and would happily stay again in the future. The hotel was clean and my room was tidy and had everything I required - hot shower, hairdryer, comfy big bed, coffee maker, fridge, desk, excellent internet connection etc. The staff were friendly and helpful and the manager couldn't do enough for his guests. The free breakfast was popular and great to start the day off, but got busy towards 9am with groups of holidaymakers - perfectly quiet at 7am! Food and drink were constantly being replenished. I had a quick swim in the hotel outdoor pool which was clean and quiet. There were a few restaurants, a gas station and a McDonalds next to the hotel, with further restaurants and a Super Target about a mile away. The Disney theme parks were close by and the hotel ran a complimentary shuttle bus each morning.

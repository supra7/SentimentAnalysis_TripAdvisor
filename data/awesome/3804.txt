I have been traveling to this part of Mexico long before there was a Riviera. I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the country, including other Secrets resorts. Secrets Maroma Beach is by far the best. The grounds are perfect without being over done. They have left many of the natural plants just where they are supposed to be. The food is exceptional, with variety and beautiful presentation. The staff is well trained in each department. Housekeeping is meticulous.The accommodations are pure luxury with better linens and bath sheets instead of normal size bath towels. Our room was ocean front and I could not have been any happier. Last but certainly not least, the best beach in the entire country. Perfect white sand,, enough sun lounges that you do not have to run down and reserve one before dawn. Truly a five star resort.

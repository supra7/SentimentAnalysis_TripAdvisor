This is our fourth stay at this hotel. Even though we only live 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Montreal, we love to use this as our escape away from the kids. It is located directly across from the Bell center. It is adjacent to all the bars and nightclubs on Crescent and St. Catherine street. The restaurant, La Coupole, is also very good. The rooms are large, especially if you upgrade to a King Suite. Two LCD televisions, refrigerator with liquor & snacks, expresso, coffee, tea etc.. Beds are comfortable. Room is quiet and well climate controlled. The staff are helpful & friendly. The price is reasonable for what you get. This is an upscale hotel. I am typing this while sitting next to the pool which has large windows overlooking the city. When I close my eyes with the sun beating through the windows, you can almost imagine yourself in a tropical locale. Now the big decision, do I get into the Sauna, or take a dip in the outdoor hot tub where I can see all of downtown Montreal. I love this place.

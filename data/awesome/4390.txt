Secrets Maroma Beach was incredible from the minute we arrived. The entire staff is there to serve you and make the trip that much better. Anything you want, you got. Food was abundant and great quality. Cleanliness was like no other I have experienced. This is the first time in my life that I didn't want to leave at the end of vacation because of the facility. I will definitely return!

The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was always plenty of activities to be involved with if a person so desired. The beach and resorts grounds were beautiful. The spa treatment was excellent, very relaxing. I did not like being asked to set through a meeting about purchasing into the property. If I am going to a resort of this caliber I do not want to be confronted with this, I expect this type of thing at a mall kiosks. Turn down service might of been a little early on a few evenings but this one can live with. Even though the age was suppose to be 18 there seemed to be few teenagers that were not of this age running around the week we spent at the resort. I would definitely go back.

Over the New Year's holiday, we enjoyed our first two-night stay at the Hotel Monaco. We frequently travel in North America and Europe and often to Seattle but had never stayed there. They pay attention to the guest in so many ways: examples: the personal email reservation confirmation, genuine care, pleasant conversation and excellent service from all: front desk staff, room service staff, cleaning staff, managers, and especially the valets - we forget the importance of that first encounter with a hotel - the parking valets!- and follow-up personal response to us following our completion of their service survey. This, in addition to a very competitive nightly rate, a very, very clean and comfortable room, great food, the 5-6 complimentary wine service for guests, and, oh, those comfy robes! Monaco is now 'our' hotel in Seattle.

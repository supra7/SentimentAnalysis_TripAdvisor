Just returned from Maroma Beach. An outstanding experience. Have been to Sandals Antigua and St. Lucia. This resort blows them away by far. The help can not do enough for you. The food is outstanding. It seems there is almost a 1/1 ration of staff versus guests. I'm not bashing Sandals since we love their Carribean locations, however, if this chain of resorts starts to expand into the Carribean, Sandals will be out of business!

I booked a 3 night stay at the Hotel Vintage Park on Hotwire, and was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome. It was classified as a boutique hotel. I would classify this hotel as a bit old school in terms of the decor and furnishings, but very well maintained. Yet the staff was extraordinarily friiendly, helpful, and well trained to respond to every need. The Conceierge was amazing. The desk staff was probalby the most friendly/helpful/prepared that I've seen in this hotel category. I would be prepared to pay full price for this hotel, considering the service, location, and overall quality.

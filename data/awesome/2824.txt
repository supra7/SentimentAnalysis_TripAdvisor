Best W I have stayed in by far. London is ok........all 5 W's I have stayed in in New York are cramped with horrible bathrooms, although the staff is excellent. The Boston and San Diego W are ok, but the Seattle W is everything the W wants to be, but maybe only Seattle can be. Cool, friendly, and happy about it. upgrading to a corner, higher floor room is a good idea, which is what I did the 3 times I stayed there, with a view of the water, the ferries, the Space Needle, and Mt. Rainier from one of the rooms. My stay was in June 2010, and I understand there are rennovations, thus to not be put off on this W, perhaps wait til it is over. The gym is well equipped, and since it is in Seattle, and not in Milan, is filled with friendly people and staff, as is the entire hotel. The serve yourself iced, flavored waters and choice of coffees in the lobby for takeaway is a very nice touch...very Seattle, very W. maybe it is the combination. I traveled in 2010, but this option was not available so I put April 2011.........so, I would say you should take my review with a grain of salt....but, I am a seasoned W traveler.

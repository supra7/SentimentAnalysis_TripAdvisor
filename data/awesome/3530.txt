Stayed 5 nights from June to July after coming across this hotel on Tripadvisor. Nice property with impeccable cleanliness and responsive staff. Bathrooms great. Front desk helpful. Can't speak to the restauraunt as we didn't eat any meals here. There were many options in the immediate vicinity (going two streets in either direction gives you a nice mix of european (Europea!!!), Ethiopian, Italian, Steakhouse (both high-end and upper-middle), Irish pub etc. Helpful about Jazzfest information. The times we went to the pool/jacuzzi it wasn't mobbed with kids (which was nice).

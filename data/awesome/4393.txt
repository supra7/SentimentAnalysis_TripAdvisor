We had a wonderfully relaxing time at Secrets Maroma. It's not the place to be if you want to party wildly. It's the place to be if you want great food, drinks, and service. Considering it's an all-inclusive, those items are all top-notch. The beach is amazing. The overall vibe of the resort is just mellow relaxation. You can either get involved and be social, or you can keep to yourself and enjoy quiet moments. The spa is wonderful also. The only issue we had with the room is with the bathroom. There is not much privacy b/c the toilet door is just a frosted shower stall door. To me, if you are not incredibly comfortable using the bathroom in close proximity to your travel companion, you won't be happy with the bathroom situation. We worked around it fine though.

This was the first trip to Mexico for both me and my wife, and both of us agreed that this was probably the best resort we've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The staff was simply incredible. The room was great -- they even put up special decorations for my birthday, which was unexpected. The food -- which was not high on our list of priorities when we were shopping around -- exceeded our expectations. And the beach was gorgeous. We were lucky on the weather, though I understand they plan rainy-weather activities as well. If I had any suggestions at all for anyone considering this place: 1) There is a preferred package that they will offer you. We did not take it, and I'm kind of glad we did not. You get a better view of the ocean, Internet access and more liquor in the free minibar... but we hardly spent any time in our room anyway when we weren't in bed. And if you are surfing the Internet while on vacation here, you have bigger problems. 2) The Japanese dinner experience was just alright. Personally I think I'd just as soon suggest a lower-key evening at another one of the restaurants. But that's just me. 3) Be very wary of anyone who wants to have you attend a presentation for free stuff. This sounds like common sense, I know. But the pull is pretty strong once you are there. This applies to anyone not affiliated with the resort as well. We got very little of this from the actual employees of the resort, fortunately. I can't think of anything worse than being forced to sit in a room during a presentation or take a tour when you could be enjoying the beach and other amenities at this place. 4) I've read some other reviews suggesting how crowded this place could get on the beach and pool areas. We did not experience this at all, perhaps because we were there this month (October). Of course we barely dodged a hurricane in the deal. Again, the setting was beautiful, and the courtesy and kindness of the staff put this place way over the top. We will be going back.

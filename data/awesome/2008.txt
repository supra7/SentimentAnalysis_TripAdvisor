I stayed 4 nights at the Edgewater and enjoyed every minute of my stay. My room was charming and had a great water view. The weather was cold and rainy so the fireplace in the room was appreciated. The location was great...walking distance to Pike Place Market, the art museum, lots of great shopping and restaurants. The staff was wonderful and they offer a free shuttle that runs around Seattle every hour. Try the Edgewater....you won't be disappointed.

We had a great five night stay at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle in late September. Great hotel that's very comfortable with a great location. Even took the link light rail from airport to within two blocks of the hotel. Perfect area for walking, sightseeing and picking up transportation to wherever the mood takes you. Good food is certainly not lacking in the emerald city--try Sazerac adjoining the hotel or ask the desk staff for recommendations. The staff is very helpful.

We spent 4 days at the Edgwater for a conference. Booked a waterfront room, (well worth it.) An older property but very clean and comfortable. Fireplace in the room provided heat but it was an on or off situation. I still liked it. Bed and pillows great. Ate both at the restaurant and had conference meals, top notch all the way. Staff was really excellent, never met a person who didn't smile and acknowledge me. Valet parking was efficient. Couldn't be more pleased.

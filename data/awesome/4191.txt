My husband and I have lived and traveled extensively - we never go to the same place twice--until now, we can't wait to go back to Secrets Maroma again. Let's see, what did we love: our room, our swim-out pool, the room service, the restaurants, the service, the spa, the bars, the pool, the spa, the ocean, the comfy chairs, the entertainment, the coffee bar, the spa, the waitresses, the waiters, the spa (yes, I know I have said this already, but needs repeated!) Now, what did we not like: the sales men in the lobby and large groups (but were able to avoid both).

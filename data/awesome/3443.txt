Could not fault this hotel it was brilliant, a bit hard to find but if you get the bus from the Tegal Airport to the Hauptbahnoff (main train and bus station) and then walk to the front of the building where the bus stops are it is the M85 bus which takes you right outside the door! We didnt have breakfast but the beer was very cheap and seen as though we found it difficult finding any decent bars in the town we really should have stayed there! It was only 5 euro for a large and small beer! The location was good, the busses into town ran every 15 mins and if you get a 'welcome card' from the airport this allows you to go anywhere for 72 hours and costs 22 euro, in our opinion well worth it and you get money off lots of attractions with it! The rooms was massive and bathroom just as big with wet room shower and comfy beds and the whole hotel was spotless clean. All staff were obliging and help you out if your trying to get to somewhere out of town or need to know where to find something. Cant fault it, overall a fab hotel! P.S if your booking ask for a room not near the front of the building as the road noise can be a little annoying if your a light sleeper!

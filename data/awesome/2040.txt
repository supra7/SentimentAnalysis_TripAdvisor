This was our first stay at the Edgewater and we loved it. The hotel has a lodge motif with lots of woodwork and fireplaces, even in the rooms. It makes for a very cozy, comfortable feeling. The rooms have luxurious beds, large stone showers, leather chairs and footrests before the fireplace and all the amenities. Our balcony, right above Elliott Bay, was the perfect location to view the waterfront and see Mt. Rainier, when the weather was clear. Being right next to the pier for the cruise ships to Alaska and the ferries to Victoria and the San Juan Islands make its location ideal for these trips and walking distance to almost all the attractions. The hotel also provides a shuttle service within a two-mile radius. There is a gourmet restaurant and lively adjoining lounge, as well as a cozy large lobby with floor to ceilling windows looking out on the water. All in all a very relaxing and enjoyable stay, and we will return here when next we visit Seattle.

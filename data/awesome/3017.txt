This hotel is over the top for us! I have never stayed at a hotel as nice as this and it was amazing...I loved every min of it and will defiantly be recommending it to other people and hopefully be able to go back. I was able to get the night stay at a charity auction and it was the best purchase ever!! We booked the night the same day as the Seattle Pride festival, it worked out perfectly, and we loved every minute of it.

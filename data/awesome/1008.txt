I really like this hotel, the room was perfect and the location couldn't be better, it is close to everything: the Pike market, Macy's is accross the street, malls, good restaurants etc. The room was at the top with a little bit of a view and we also got a promotion of $5 parking since we booked it directly with the hotel.The staff is super friendly and the restaurant and bar at great.

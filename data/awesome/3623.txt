We went to Disney for the weekend and stayed at Destiny Palms Hotel and it was AMAZING. The service was outstanding, FREE breakfast, very clean and the Manager Alan was super nice, and his little helper chuck was so funny. I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family members any day. The staff was very nice to my children and included them in almost every conversation. I will definitely come back my next trip.

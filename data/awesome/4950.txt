This is the first review I have ever written and feel strongly that this resort is worth the time and effort required...Every aspect of our vacation at Secrets Maroma Beach was superlative. Our swimout room was tastefully furnished, well-appointed, and impeccably clean. Each member of the staff from the concierge to the landscape maintenance crews to the pool and beach cocktail servers worked ardently, ceaselessly, and sincerely to attend to our needs, always eager and NEVER inconvenienced. The food available at each restaurant outlet was fresh and well-prepared and full of variety. The most impressive part of our experience was that while the resort was near full-capacity, we NEVER felt like part of a crowd, never waited for a table at a restaurant, never searched for chairs by the pool. Almost every other paradise in the world seems overcrowded, but not this one. We felt very much like we were enjoying a private experience. At every turn, I felt like I was more than pleasantly suprised, asking "are you kidding me!?!" The spa, for spa-goers, was among the very best I've ever experienced in terms of atmosphere, facilities, cleanliness, attention to detail, ammenities, snacks, and service. It ranks with the Spa at Pebble Beach, CA and any quaity spa in Las Vegas. The beach is gorgeous, perfect for strolling or even swimming. I'm not a beach lover, but happily swam in the calm, super blue water alongside beautiful fish. We traveled with friends and enjoyed morning yoga over-looking the beach, evening festivities by the pool, and danced for hours to suprisingly up-to-date music in a club atmosphere that also rivals dance clubs in Vegas (if only smaller in size, like a boutique club). In short, this resort provided everything we hoped for - luxurious rooms, endless drinks, great food, no crowds, eye-popping natural beauty, and total relaxation.

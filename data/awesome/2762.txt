Wonderfully cozy hotel. The entire staff was exceptional... kind and polite... very attentive in all aspects. Tastefully decorated, nice amenities, great location for venturing out in the downtown area. Their evening wine tasting in the lobby is a nice touch and gives you a chance to sample Washington's great wines. We highly recommend The Vintage Park and would return without thinking twice!

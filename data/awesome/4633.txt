I just got back from Secrets Maroma a few hours ago and my review will be pretty long, but I wanted to pay it forward to those planning on a trip to SMB. Before my trip I was a TripAdvisor stalker and read reviews each day, so will try to pepper in some helpful tips and info to help you. To start my friend and I (2 female's mid/late 30's) wanted a relaxing beach vacation to get away and my oh my was SMB just what the doctor ordered. I"ll break my review down in categories to make it eaiser to read: Airport I know this is not reflective of Secrets, but for anyone that has never flown into Cancun before, wanted to give you a heads up to completely pass the people standing right in front of the doors to go outside. Regardless of what they say "let me show you where you need to go" , etc just go right past them and go outside to your transfers or taxi. These people try to sell you excursions and they say things that make them sound like they know exactly what you need to do to find your car/bus/taxi but again just walk right past them, regardless of how they say they can help you. Check-In The drive from the airport is about 30 minutes. It's literally a straight shot on the same road as the airport. As soon as you turn at the Highway sign for Secrets you go through winding paths on a bumpy road to the hotel. Upon arrival a bellhop greets you to take your bags & gives you a ticket. You then walk into the lobby and sit with the concierge. You are greeted with the best smelling cool washcloth and glass of champagne. Our room was ready immediately, some people had to wait. We were lucky. You then follow your bellhop to your room. Room Ahhhh the room. We booked a swimout (non-preferred) and it was worth every single cent. For the ladies SMB provides 4oz bottles of shower gel, lotion & 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner. The bathroom has a jacuzzi tub that has a window cut out with a see thru curtain so you can sit in your tub and basically look into the rest of the room. There are sliding shutters for the main bathroom door and the toilet and shower had it's own door (frosted glass door). No one can see you while you're using the restroom due to the frosted glass. The light has a fan so when its on the fan is on. The bed was VERY comfortable. We had issues with the alarm clock either not working or resetting times each day. 2 other couples we talked to had the same issue, so make sure to bring a cell phone for time or a watch. You can always call the front desk for a wakeup call too. The swimout pool was magnificient. Honestly I can't imagine not having a swimout. Not 1x did we see a mosquito. We were in building 14 (room 1411) and loved this location because or pool was very secluded from passerby's and close to the main building & via the shortcut close to the beach. I would recommend this building again if I come back (which I plan to). It was nice because once you get back to your room, instead of just hanging out, watching tv you could float in the pool. ***TIP*** bring your own inflatable raft so you can float. We used our inflatable chairs every day. The mini fridge is always stocked with Corona, Coke and Diet Coke, Water and Orange Juice. They restock every day. If you prefer a different drink, just call room service and they'll bring you whatever you want, no problem. Our conceierge Luis was awesome. He memorizes your name the first time you meet and is so helpful. Our building (and I'm sure the rest) had 10 rooms each with 4 floors. For the swimouts, basically it's your own private lagoon that expands from room 1 to room 10. We met some great people this way and again the swimout made our trip. SPA UH-MAZING........Notice the spelling is the heavy blissful inflection in my voice .....it was beyond wonderful. Is by far the nicest, most relaxing and tranquil spa I've been to. I had an 80 minute aromatherapy massage ($158 but thanks to my Himitsu New Jersey friend she gave me a $40 coupon that was very much appreciated) and went back the next day for a manicure ($55 and really not worth it in my opinion). We got to the spa with bathing suit on under a coverup an hour & a half before the service and used the pool, jacuzzi and relaxation room. The relaxation room is a dark quiet room where you lay on your own super cushioned lounge chair, with pillows and a cushy blanket. There is fresh fruit & cold water for the taking. While lounging a girl comes and places a warm tea scented wrap around your shoulders (think airplane pillow type). We felt like the amenities before the actual treatment was a complete spa package in and of itself. The massage was the wonderful topping. Oh and if you're a scent kinda gal like me (love all the candles and lotions) you will love the amazing scent/smell of the spa. Remember those wonderful cold scented washclothes upon arrival I mentioned before? Well I found the spray the spa uses and sells and bought 3 bottles of it to take home. In the spa gift shop it's a clear spray bottle and about 6oz of Tea White Body Lotion. I've used it already to spray on my linens and couch & it' amazing. Food/Drinks We tried all restaurants but Bordeaux. Himitsu was the best. Ok so tip, as soon as you check in and get settled go to your building concierge and have him book you a reservation at Himitsu. Ask for the hibachi table. For breakfast you can either order room service or go to the buffet. There is a lox/cheese/procuitto station, 2 omlett and 1 crepe making stations, then a smoothie bar, juice/fruit/cereal station and then a couple bars of bacon, eggs, breads, etc. No one goes hungry & there is something for everyone. For lunch you can either go back to the buffet or eat at the barefoot grill by the pool serving burgers, hotdogs, etc. For the restaurants everyone had nice clothes on. I wouldn't say black tie by any means, but biz casual at the most. The only time you will ever pay for alcohol is if you order a bottle of the non-house wine. House wine in each restaurant is a Chardonnay or Merlot. Also for those of you that like the fru-fru drinks here are a few we loved: Mango daquiri at El Patio, Dirty Monkey (banana creamy drink) and the pink flamingo (creamy frozen coconut flavored drink). Beach The beach at SMB is wonderful. We got to the beach at the latest at 10:30 one day and never did we have a problem getting 2 seats under one of the palpa huts. Servers come around all day providing drinks. Lydia was our favorite. **TIP** if unsure of what to drink, ask the waiter to view the drink menu they carry in their pockets. The sand is white sugar, never hot and the ocean is a crystal turquoise color. Lots of fun waves. One day it poured rain for 30 minutes and we along with other people ran to the ocean and swam while it poured. It was amazing. No need to bring your own towels, SMB has plenty of huge long beach towels that you pick up at one of 2 stands on the path to the beach, so don't bulk up your luggage bringing them from home (or from your hotel room). Entertainment We saw the fire shows on Wednesday and it was a group of fire twirlers that was amazing. We also saw American Idol which was great. *****TIP****** even if you don't sign but are a ham and like to perform sign up. The winner gets 4 days/3 nights stay at SMB and 2nd place gets you a 50 minute massage. There were 6 performers my night and they were nothing special at all (no offense but they were just up there to have fun) and I really kicked myself for not signing up. So don't be shy, do it and who knows you may get a free mini trip out of the deal. Grease was a little hokey and several people got up to walk out. Good to sing along though. There is a bar in the theatre so again drinks flow freely. Every Friday & Tuesday night they have vendors on the property that sell jewelry, Mexican items,etc. They really put on the pressure "ooooh eeeeee you're so pretty, let me show you a necklace", etc. But we looked and bought a few things. Was nice to browse the shops since we never left the resort to shop elsewhere. They hosted a Mexican Fiesta Tuesday night as well and it was wonderful. Tons of outdoor seeting around big round tables so you could meet other guests. TONS of food and drinks. You have to try the homemade fresh Churro's..holy moly were they good. Loved the Mariachi band & singers too. Random I said this over and over during my stay "you never want for anything". The service is impeccable, you are waited on hand and foot. The beach is amazing and the rooms were great. If you want anything just ask. They have a room in the main building with 5 computers for internet access open 24 hours. The other people vacationing as well completely made the trip. SO nice. Some memorable for us are: Adam & his wife from Seattle, John & Cindy in our same building, Mandy & Mike and their friends from Jersey, our neighbors Renee & Mark from Australia (I'll be in touch about Bali) and our musician friend we met in the ocean Clarence & Pam. You guys were great. Don't give this trip a second thought. Call your travel agent pronto and book a stay at Secrets Maroma Beach. You certainly won't regret it. If you have any questions feel free to email me. I'm happy to help.

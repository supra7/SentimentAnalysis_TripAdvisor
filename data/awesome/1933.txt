The hotel was conveniently located and we were in walking distance of everything we wanted, restaurants, attractions & shopping. Our only taxi need was to and from the airport and a random trip to shop at Title Nine in Greenlake. Room was clean and staff was helpful. Went during the off season, so rate was great too! Fitness room is small (1 treadmill, 1 bike and 1 eliptical ) but no problem on this trip and there is no pool. Would stay again.

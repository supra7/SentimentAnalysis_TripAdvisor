We stayed 3 nights here before moving to the city because the price was attractive and we were staying a total of 11 nights in Seattle. As it turned out, the room was larger, housekeeping better, bed more comfortable, staff FAR more hospitable and ambience nicer than the 4-star Renaissance in downtown Seattle that we moved to (stay away from the Renaissance/Seattle). The Hilton daily provided guests with fresh apples and refreshing, cool water with lemon or oranges in a large glass and silver urn in the Lobby. The front desk check-in was very hospitable and asked if we had ever visited, then proceeded to arm us with information. She also put us on the 5th floor concierge level so it would be quieter for us -- although we never heard noise anywhere during our stay. Doormen/bellmen opened the doors and welcomed you. Public transportation to the city ($1.75/peron) was just at the corner and the airport was within walking distance if needed, although they had a free shuttle. There was even a free shuttle to a large shopping mall -- a great place to go if it's too late a start to go to the city, Eat outdoors at the Thai restaurant there, with views of Mt. Ranier! If price is an issue, stay here, take advantage of the rate (we paid $83/nt ), use the great public transportation to the city, then rest sweetly at the Hilton hotel at the airport location.

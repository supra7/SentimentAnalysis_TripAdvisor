Our stay during the holidays at the Crowne Plaza was wonderful. The staff was so nice, very friendly. We parked at the hotel and walked everywhere we wanted to see. The Christmas tree and lights were just beautiful, they even served Christmas cookies and hot apple cider in the lobby. The rooms are large and very comfortable. We got adjoining rooms with our family, and that was perfect. It was recommended to me, and we pass this on to you! Enjoy Seattle....stay at the Crowne Plaza.

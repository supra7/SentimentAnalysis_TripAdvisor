We arrived at Sea-Tac after midnight and was glad to see the hotel shuttle arrive a few minutes later. The driver was very helpful - even arranged a private car to take us into the Amtrak station the next morning at a better price than a cab. The room was very large and the bedding was the best. We were sorry we only had a few hours stay.

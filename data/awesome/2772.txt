I had an opportunity to stay at the Hotel Vintage Park and once again, the Kimpton Hotel service was fantastic. My wife and I learned about Kimpton several years ago and have stayed in hotels in Portland, San Francisco and Seattle, but this was my first time at the Vintage Park. The small, boutique style hotel is very comfortable and the service is exceptional. Dropped the car off at the valet and within 10 steps, I was at the front desk. The front desk staff were very professional and pleasant to work with. I found I had gotten a corner room on the eighth floor that turned out to be a great room. The room had plenty of windows letting in lot of light. The king size bed was fantastic and I found I had a couch and chair in the room so relaxing was easy. I was also surprised to find a bottle of Merlot from the staff with a personal card signed by the front desk staff. I had been given $10.00 to use with the mini-bar and had the choice of continental breakfast or two evening cocktails. The only bad thing, I was only their one night. After I settled in, I wished I could have stayed for a few more days.

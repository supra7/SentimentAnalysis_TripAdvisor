I had the pleasure of spending 3 lovely nights at the Hotel Max and what great service we recieved. After leaving, my friend and I both recalled only 2 occassions when someone was not at the front door to open it for us. Usually my requirements are clean, safe and a bargain and Hotel Max was all 3 and more. I've traveled extensively, staying in everything from 5-star hotels to huts in S. Africa and this was a real gem. The rooms weren't the most spacious but all the other qualities made Hotel Max a great place. Trip Advisor was a big help with this choice. Great downtown location too!

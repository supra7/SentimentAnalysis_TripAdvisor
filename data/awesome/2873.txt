I stayed at the W in Seattle on my way to a business engagement and I couldn't have made a better choice. I have travelled extensively for both business and pleasure, but have never had a better or more luxurious experience than that of the W. The room had a fantastic view of the city and Puget Sound, and it was blissfully quiet. The bed was so comfortable and both my travelling companion and I wanted to go shopping for one just like it for home. We ordered room service (a very reasonably priced menu, considering) and the food was a great selection of Northwest delecacies. The menu also included more traditional fare, which my travelling companion appreciated. We highly recommend the sexy fries! The hotel staff was unbelievably gracious and unobtrusive. I want to give a special shout out to the guest services manager Brian Bunich. Brian was attentive and anticipated our every need. We definitely felt as if we were a guest in his home, and quite frankly we never wanted to leave. The W hotel is a one-in-a-lifetime experience that I cannot recommend highly enough. It's pricey, but no more so than any other hotel of it's calibur. But considering what you get for your buck, it's a bargain. Stay at the W!

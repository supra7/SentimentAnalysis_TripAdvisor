Very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel. Reception was friendly, received upgraded room, room in fine shape with excellent shower and nice bed. Restaurant food was very, very good, especially for a hotel, and regional wine list was fine. Workout room did not disappoint either. Would stay here again.

4 couples have travelled to Mexico for several years and decided to upscale from a 5 star to the Secrets Maroma Beach. We loved it and won't be going back to the 5 star. The service was incredible. Lydia was the hardest working server I've seen. The nighttime entertainment was topnotch. The food was excellent and the beach was spectacular. The only fault I could see was a lack of a beach bathroom,but it was a short jaunt to the bathroom by the pool. We were overbooked,but were well taken care of for our trouble. All in all, a great value and an enjoyable vacation.

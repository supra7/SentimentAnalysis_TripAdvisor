If you are going to stay in Seattle, this hotel offers everything right outside its doors..the Market, the ferry, restaurants, and many things to do and see. The only thing I was missing was a fireplace in the room to warm up from checking out all that Seattle has to offer. The staff was great and the view from our room was fantastic.

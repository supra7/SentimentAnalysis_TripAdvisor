I stayed here while attending a meeting at the hotel. I presented my Starwood Preferred Guest card when I checked in and got a room on the 26th floor with a magnificent view of the bay and the Space Needle. I would have been happy to stay in the room the entire four days and enjoy the view! The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the gym was well-equipped, the staff was accommodating (with the exception of this crabbly older woman who was a concierge), the location is great, with easy access to the monorail, train to the airport, Pike Place Market, and all the downtown sites. But, definitely ask for a room with a view of the water when you check in.

The W Seattle gives you everything you would expect of a W and more. With a cool vibe in the lobby and restaurant that extends all the way to the sleeping rooms. I received a corner room with a view of the Space Needle, the mountains and the city. It was amazing! The service was also very high quality and the staff was extremely helpful.

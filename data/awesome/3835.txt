All the rave reviews for this property are well deserved. The buildings and grounds are exceptionally well maintained. No mildew in the shower or rusty fixtures. Everything was spotless. Secrets Maroma Beach has an army of polite friendly employees. We couldn't find even one crankie worker in our 7 day stay. I spoke at length to a waitress in the lobby bar. She was born in Mexico and raised in the US. She came back to Mexico to get a job at Secrets Maroma. She felt very fortunate to have been hired. She claims that all workers be they servers, maids, kitchen help or entertainment staff are on the same level. No hiararchy due to job description. Everyone is treated fairly and equally. Also she said there was an extensive interviewing and screening process before hiring. Whatever management is doing, it is working very well. Food, as mentioned in most reviews is always available, diverse and well prepared. Pools and beach offer many choices for relaxation. You find a spot that appeals to you ... Lots of people and activity... or quiet privacy. Only negatives I found were Mosquitos iin and around heavily landscaped areas and no wifi in most rooms unless you agree to a $15.00 daily charge. They do give you 1 hour of free wifi in the lobby. Computers are available in the business center at no charge. Our overall experience exceeded our expectations. We hope to return in the future.

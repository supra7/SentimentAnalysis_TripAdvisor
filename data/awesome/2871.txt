We spent a Thursday night in Seattle and have always been a fan of Starwood Hotels. The W in Seattle is in a perfect location, it's within walking distance to Pike Street and the Piers. I traveled with my husband (who's never been to Seattle) as well as my parents and auntie. They too loved the hotel and didn't mind the walk. My mother is very picky about hotels and she was very satisfied. The rooms were clean, concierge was helpful, service and valet were quick. It's true that the lighting is dark (per other reviews) but I like that type of ambience. It was a bit busy at night (bar and hotel desk) but was fine otherwise. I know we only stayed one night but we were debating on staying another. I highly recommend the W.

Our trip to Seattle has been very good, and Hotel Vintage Park has made it excellent. Their in-house restaurant (Tulio) is quite superb, but for those who like to explore, the hotel is right downtown and there are quite a variety of great eateries within a few minutes walk. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We're on our honeymoon, and they presented us with a bottle of champaigne and a very kind handwritten note of congratulations. In addition, they have a complimentary wine tasting each evening (with a very knowledgable staff). The rooms are quiet. The beds are comfortable. And they suceed in making their patrons very happy! There isn't another hotel we'd stay at in Seattle!

We are from Montreal originally and have now stayed at the Crystal 3 times when back to visit friends and family. The location is great... a short block to Ste Catherine street and easy to get on the highway when it's time to go. And if you're there for a hockey game you're right across the street from the Bell Centre. The main reason we stay is the fact that the hotel is all suites. When we have one of our daughters with us we can go to bed and she can stay up as late as she likes using the free internet or watching TV. Much handier than a regular hotel room. The suites are modern and the bathrooms large. I need to have internet access and it's free and fast plus having the kitchenette and coffee at hand means not having to leave the room until after a couple of espressos in the morning. We've always been checked in and out quickly and efficiently and parking is right next door so it's easy to get to your car or have the valet retrieve it. We'll be back next time we need to overnight in Montreal.

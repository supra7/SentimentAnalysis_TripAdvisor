Since my last review in 2006 the hotel has had some updating. Our room had new carpet and bedspread as did the hallway. Also I am now Hhonors Gold so we got the Hhonors floor. Excellent hotel breakfast - we got Gold coupons but had to pay $5 extra to get the hot breakfast. Still it was very good. Our room was very nice. Comfy beds one of the better Hilton beds I have used. I asked to have the feathers removed when we checked in - and the housekeeping staff beat us to the room they were already there doing it by the time we got there on the elevator. Valet parking was $26 a night somewhat pricy for a leisure stay. The entire staff was great during our stay I can highly recommend this hotel. Very convenient to airport.

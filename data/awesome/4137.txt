The photos on the resort website do not even come close to seeing the beauty of this place in person. It was simply amazing. The staff does a wonderful job keeping this place clean and beautiful. The rooms were stunning and we loved having the swim out suite. It was definitely worth the extra money. All of the staff was very nice and made sure our stay was top notch. We watched two shows in the theatre while we were there and they definitely have a great entertainment staff. The pools were amazing and my husband and I could not get enough of the stunning beach. Restaurants... we were not a fan of french restaurant, Bordeaux. Portofino (Italian) was good and the staff was and service was excellent. We LOVED breakfast at the World Cafe, lunch at the Barefoot Grille and dinner at Himitsu and Seaside Grille was good. Overall, the food was good but not great. It didn't bother us though considering we would give the rest of the resort six stars.

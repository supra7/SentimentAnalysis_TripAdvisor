Wonderfully charming historic hotel located in downtown Seattle. I'll never stay anywhere else! This boutique hotel came highly recommended by a colleague in California who has stayed here numerous times. The Mayflower absolutely exceeded my expectations. I am so glad that the hotel I had planned to stay at for a big conference at the Washington State Convention Center was booked. The Mayflower Park Hotel was less expensive and far superior (we stayed four nights). The ambience in the lobby and upper sitting room by the fireplace is comfortably elegant and inviting. All the staff, from the moment we entered, were extremely professional, kind, and knowledgeable. The concierges are very helpful. Jane did our booking for the Seattle 2-Hour Van Tour (great tour, by the way) and Andy secured for us a fantastic museum package for the Gauguin Exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. They made my birthday very, very special, even delivering a small box of chocolates to our room with a birthday card signed by numerous staff. Katya at the front desk is lovely and the doormen are courteous and have friendly smiles. Our deluxe room on the 9th floor had 2 bathrooms and a view of the Space Needle with free wifi. Oliver's on the main floor is perfect for happy hour drinks and hors d'oeuvres in the late afternoon. The West Center Shopping Mall is connected to the hotel as is the Monorail station to the Space Needle and the Link Light Railway Tunnel Station to the Sea-Tac Airport, 35 minutes away. All the Seattle highlights are within walking distance -- even the Space Needle, to which we walked for dinner at the Needle's Sky Restaurant (about a 20 minute walk). The Mayflower Park Hotel made our first visit to Seattle a dream. We can't wait to return.

Stayed 5 nights, February 24- 29 2012. This hotel is a gem. Everyone was nice. The room was a bit small but clean. The kingsize bed was very comfy. Great water pressure in shower. The complimentary breakfast was an added plus. Location location location, perfect to say the least.. Nothing bad to say. Would definitely stay again.

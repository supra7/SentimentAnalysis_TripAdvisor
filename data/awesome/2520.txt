We stayed here 2 nights and it was wonderful. There were great views from our room, our room was modern and the bed was so comfortable!! everything was spotless and the hotel itself was very close to all the shops, which is why we were there! All in all a great time. The only downside was how busy the bar and lobby was, at bit of a heathrow feeling.

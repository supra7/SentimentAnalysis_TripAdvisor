I spent the night of the 21st April at the Crowne Plaza and was upgraded to a Club room on the 34th floor at check-in. The room was large and well-equipped and had panoramic windows with a spectacular view over the downtown highrises and the Space Needle. Due to our late arrival at the hotel we had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The Friday night Seafood Buffet was slightly overpriced for what was on offer but was worth it for the convenience. Friendly restaurant staff. The hotel parking charge of $28 is outrageous. We parked in the Convention Centre parking (Union St & 8th) just a couple of blocks from the hotel at a cost of $11 for an overnight stay. (on the back of the ticket it says no overnight parking but the attendant told me it was ok). The complimentary breakfast served in the Club Lounge was good with a standard selection of baked goods and juice/coffee. Overall a very nice hotel in a central location for leisure or business trips.

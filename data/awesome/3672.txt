This was the best place I have ever stayed. The staff (even the landscapers) were extremely friendly. The drinks were superb. The activities coordinators do their jobs very well encouraging people to play the many activities. The beach was cleaned every morning and was a joy to walk on the white sand looking into the beautiful blue ocean. The food was above my expectations from the Himatsu Restaurant (I think thats how you spell it), to the Seaside restaurant and even the Barefoot grill. The rooms were beyond belief. There are no words to describe the beauty you see from the balcony. If you have the opportunity to go to a Secrets Resort THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!!

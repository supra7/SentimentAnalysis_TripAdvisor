We were upgraded to a water view room yesterday upon arrival with no extra fee involved. The restaurant was top notch and the food was delicious. The decor of cabin type lodging was comfortable and first class linens and extremely great bed made for a good nights sleep. Staff were accomadating and efficient. A Christmas tree was just being put in the lobby when we arrived and this morning on our way to breakfast it was looking beautiful in the gorgeous lobby. Unlike previous reviews I just read we found this hotel to be first class.

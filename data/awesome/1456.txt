Before we entered the lobby, we were greeted by several employees. Service was excellent. When issues arose, they were promptly and efficiently taken care of. Rooms were clean and well furnished. Concierge was very helpful. Very close to downtown attractions. Views only of other buildings, but not a problem. Restaurant at top good.

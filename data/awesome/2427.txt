I was looking for a downtown location and my wife and I had stayed there for our honeymoon 36 years ago so I thought we would try it again. I had read many bad reviews on the hotel so I was a bit concerned. But I went ahead with the stay but checked out the room before unloading our luggage Our stay was great - excellent view - warm well furnished clean room, friendly quick check in. All in all, I would stay there again and would recommend it to friends

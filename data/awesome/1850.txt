This place is at the edge of downtown and Belltown. Great location if you want to easily get away from the downtown touristy places. The hotel was renovated when the Andra took it over but you can see the bones of what it once was. The rooms are big and well appointed. Tivoli clock radios, couches, walk-in closet, wet bar. The only negative on the room is that the bathroom is pretty small. Remnant of the old bones I suppose. Service was good. Free newspaper and shoe shine. Lobby is nice with fireplace. Definitely recommend over any of the chains.

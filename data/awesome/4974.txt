My wife and I decided at the last minute to go to the Riviera Maya for a well deserved rest after my dad past away. From the time we arrived (greated with Champagne) to the time we left, we were treated like royalty. Our only concern was the check-out time as our Tour Company was going to pick us up around 9pm, we did not want to have to wait in the lobby for a whole day with nothing to do. Without asking, and I insist, without any request from our part, the check-out staff offered (at no additional cost) to extend the check-out time by 1 hour, to ensure that we could use the resort (and all the restaurants) until we actually leave the property at 9pm, and most importantly, they provided us with a Hospitality Room to shower, change and get ready for our flight back.... Now, that is what I call going above and behond the expectations.... In a few words, this was the ultimate rest and worry-free experience. When I was asked to complete a satisfaction survey, I could not find anything that needs improvement until I remembered the road leading to the resort. There is a very bumpy section shared with 2 other resorts that could use improvement. But..... with the resort, the staff, the restaurants, the pools, the beach, oh! did I mention the staff, the restaurants, the pools, the beach... you know what I mean... with all of that, you are sure to quickly forget about the road... Thank you Secret Maroma, hope to see you soon.... Mr. and Mrs Champagne

Everything about this place is amazing.... the beach, the rooms, the food, the staff. Couldn't be any happier. We went on our honeymoon, and it was like heaven. We even got a free couples massage, and dinner on the beach. Staff was awesome and helpful, and the beach is wonderful. Food was great at all the restaurants, the only downfall might be the dress code, long pants and dress shirts get kinda hot, still we will definately come back. And cant wait to try the other Secrets.

Pretty much the best place I've been in 31 years of life! This place is special. From when we got the location, building and grounds are amazing. The room had large jacquizzi bath, free mini bar, was huge. We got one with a swim out pool that is the best medicine ever for hangovers each morning. Loved each and every restaurant. We ate in them al and I liked the French best. Only surprise was the was no lobster! Relaxing by the pool in the day was just what the doctor ordered. The service was excellent. Constant supply of food and drink whereever you turn. The beach was easily the best I've ever seen and I've been a lot of places. Grab some fruit from the pool bar and take it in the water and you'll have loads of gorgeous angel fish swim around you. Our first morning we were up early with jag lag so headed down the beach at 5.30 to see a magnificent sun rise. Very special. We are very lucky to be on the beach when they released turtles back into the ocean. We both got to hold a turtle for 10 mins and then a line of people 100 released them into the ocean. Mind blowing! In summary if this place is in your budget reach then book it right away. If it's not take out a loan! I promised myself I'd never go to the same place or even same country twice but I'm sold on this and hope to go back many times.

My husband and I were super impressed with the fact that ALL of the staff seemed to know our name. Whether we were in our room, in a restaurant, by the pool or heading out for an excursion, it seemed that the staff went above and beyond acknowledging who we were. We felt like we were royalty. At first I was not so impressed with the look of the resort because we are used to a more "upscale" look. But then I had to remind myself that we were in fact in Mexico. "uspcale" look aside, we had a wonderful time and we would definitely go back because of the super above board hospitality. These folks have hospitality down to a science!!

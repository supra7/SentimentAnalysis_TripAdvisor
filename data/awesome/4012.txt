We just got back from Secrets for our honeymoon. We had an incredible time. We went into this resort knowing all of the good reviews on service. They still exceeded our expectations. The food was great and our room was beautiful. Everything was spectacular!! Going back to mediocre customer service will be painful... Secrets Maroma has set the bar! Oh and we LOVED the service we got from Mariseo at Bordeaux (french restaurant). Cant wait to visit other Secrets Resorts.

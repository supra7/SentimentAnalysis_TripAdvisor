This place was unbelievable! The service is impecable, the quality of the food was fantastic, and one of the most beautiful beaches in mexico. I travel at least 2 -3 times a year and I am not snobby but I know what I like, and I always make sure I get what I payed for. Now Screts Maroma beach, way exceeded my expectations on all levels! Never did I get such amazing service and the quality of the food for an "all inclusive" package. You simply cannot get better. Trust me and come here for your vacation get away! I will tell you this though, If you are looking for a "spring break crazy thing", this is not the place. It is very secluded and quiet. This is a place to go to relax, get all that stress out of your system and sit at the beach all day and enjoy a great meal and a great evening how and then go with you loved one and do your thing. Thats it, just a quiet place to get away from everything. Enjoy!

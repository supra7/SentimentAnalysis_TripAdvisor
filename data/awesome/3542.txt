I usually stay at the Queen Elizabeth when I am in Montreal, but I had to use some Hotwire credits before they expired. I got this hotel for around 180 with taxes, it was rated 4 1/2* on Hotwire. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. There is a mini kitchen in the rooms. My only complaints would regard the noise coming from Ren-Lvesque blvd that can be quite disturbing. At check out, the morning bellboy, half asleep, wouldn't help us with our 5 suitcases, I wasn't happy. Fortunately, the man in charge of the front desk realized the situation and helped us. He got the tip.

From the moment we arrived the staff at Secrets Maroma beach exceeded our expectations. My wife and I spent our honeymoon at this romantic resort and reccommend it to any couple wishing to relax and spend quality time together. The food and drinks were much better at this resort than at some other Yucatan all-inclusives. They had premium alcohols and superb restaurants. The room service staff is also quick and will bring you the best fajitas and cocktails.

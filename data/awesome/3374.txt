I stayed at this hotel for one night as we had an early forning flight. We got the 7 day Park N Fly package. This is a great hotel. The bellman came up to us right when we pulled up and helped unload our baggage. They then took the car and put it in the secured covered parkade. This hotel is huge. It took nearly 5 min to walk to our room. The room itself was very nice, comfortable king size bed and a nice bathroom. We love the Crabtree and Evelyn shampoo. The WiFi is expensive and the business centre is a small room with only two computers. when we returned we called the hotel at the airport and they had our car waiting and warmed up out front of the hotel. The bellman and shuttle driver even loaded our bags into the car. I highly reccommend this hotel and will stay again.

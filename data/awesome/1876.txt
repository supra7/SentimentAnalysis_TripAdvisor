Hotel Andra greatly exceeded our expectations. I did extensive research on trip advisior and other sites prior to booking this hotel. I know that there are opinions that are skewed at both ends of the spectrum and I account for that. I can truely say that this was one of the finest hotels that we have stayed in. The room was spotless and well appointed and the staff was always eager to help. The location was great and just a short walk to Pike Place Market. You would do well to dine at their restaurants as well. I am probably the worlds pickest eater and I was extremely satisfied with the food. We dined at Serious Pie, Lola's and Dahlia's and all were great.

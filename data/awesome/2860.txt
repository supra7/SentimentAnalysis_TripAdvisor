Our first stay at the W was very good. We arrived in Seattle on Sunday morning after our Alaskan cruise and were immediately given a room and were upgraded to a large room facing the Space Needle. There was a sofa the length of the Long window big enough for my husband and I to stretch out and read the Sunday paper. The hotel is a five minute walk to the Pike Place Market, a great way to spend a Sunday morning. We had two very good meals close by at Tulios restaurant excellent Italian food and a good local feel. Monday am we had breakfast at a French bakery at the Fairmont

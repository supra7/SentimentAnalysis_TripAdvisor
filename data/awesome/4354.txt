My new spouse and I stayed here for our Honeymoon. From the minute we arrived we were catered to and it didn't stop until we left. :( We loved the access to food and loved trying new things. We really enjoyed the entertainment, although not sure if we would attend the evening shows as they were sort of promiscuous at times. The beach was the best, and we loved the white angelfish that swim around you in the water. The room was superb and never had a problem with the room service. The bed was ultra comfy. The pool was so warm and was nice just to lounge around in on any afternoon. The restaurants were top notch and the service was so great. Our favorite was Himitsu for the entertainment aspect, but the rest are very comparable.The employees of the resort LOVE to cater to you, and anything you want, it's yours. We loved the Flamingo drink at the Manatee Bar. The greatest part is that we are for sure going back because we got 4 free nights for next year. We were given a note in our door that if we wanted to switch resorts for one night we would receive 4 nights stay for free! We got a certificate of validity and know that it is not a con. We are thrilled to be able to enjoy this resort next February for our 1st year anniversary! The only complaint I have is that I did get sick during the trip and it lasted until 2 weeks after the trip. It has faded out now, but mostly stomach problems immediately after eating. They were manageable but still a little frustrating.

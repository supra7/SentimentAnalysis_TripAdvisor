Just a quick review. We went down for 4 days and had an incredible time. Rooms - Upgraded free of charge to a Preferred building. Didn't use any of the extras. Not worth the additional money IMHO. We reserved a swim-out room and it's the only way to go. The way the resort is laid out the Ocean View rooms are to far to really enjoy. Plenty of space to lay around and not be on top of each other. Food - Portifino was the best. French restaurant just okay...World Cafe where the buffets are was really good. They do have mobile food carts going around the pool with Paella, Quesadillias and assorted skewers. Nice touch. Service - It was fantactic all the way around. Ask your Consierge for anything and it was received. Ivan, Rafael and Fabi were great. Grounds - As my 21 year old niece said..."Very Chill" It was relaxing, fun and not over the top. Just perfect. Spa - Very nice. Did the couples massage and it was perfect. Golf - Played Iberostar. If you like golf you will love the course. Tips - 1.) You can bring your own wine to the restaurants. There is a corkage fee and it's $20 per bottle. A little rich but better than ordering off the expensive wine list. 2.) If you want the Japanese table that has reservation only do it as soon as you check in. Couldn't get it for any nights. 3.) There is the towel game there. But if you look around there are stewards who will move belongings of others if they have been gone for 40 minutes or so. Just ask. 4.) There are beach side cabanas next to beach bar. You can reserve for an entire day. Cost was $50 but I had asked for 3 cabanas and they gave it to us for $30 each. Reserve the day you get there. No towel game and its yours all day. 5.) Your probably are not going to get your room by 2:30 on arrival. So go eat, reserve your cabanas or Japanese Table, hit the beach or pool (Pack swimsuits on carry on bag!) Okay not so short but hey it was fun and looking forward to a return trip.... JBH

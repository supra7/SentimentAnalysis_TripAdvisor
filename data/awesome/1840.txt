We have lived in Seattle for almost 20 years and love to spend a night or two a couple times a year downtown. Needless to say, we have tried many hotels over the years and Hotel Andra has become our number one choice hotel for a getaway. The prime location, elegant and relaxing decor and impeccable hospitality make Hotel Andra our absolute favorite place to stay in Seattle. And added bonus... two of Tom Douglas' restaurants are right there. Lola is literally attached to the hotel and Dhalia Lounge is right across the street. We recently spent my husband's 40th bday at Hotel Andra and we couldn't have asked for a better evening.

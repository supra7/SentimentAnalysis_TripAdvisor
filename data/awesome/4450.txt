We had an amazing honeymoon at this resort!! The beach here is absolutely beautiful.... I have been to Hawaii, Aruba, Myrtle Beach, and all over Florida and this is the best beach I have ever seen. We were upgraded to a swim-out suite, which I would highly recommend, and the private pool was heated (which was a lifesaver in December)! The private pool is shared with 5 other rooms, but we basically had it to ourselves the entire week. The food was good for an all inclusive, especially the italian. Room service was good and usually didn't take too long, and you can have drinks delivered to your room. I thought it was kind of silly when I read about it, but the secret box for room service was actually a really nice touch. The room was great, the bed was really comfortable and I loved the jacuzzi! Service was always good, and many times we were greeted by name. The activities staff was very involved and the nightlife was better than I have found at other all inclusives. There is a marina near the hotel (about a twenty minute walk down the beach) where we went parasailing, snorkeling, and rented waver runners. It's a $20 cab fare into Playa Del Carmen and totally worth it. We took the ferry to Cozumel where we rented scooters and drove around the entire island. The road follows the coastline and the views were breathtaking! The only negative of the entire trip was some issues with American Express transportation, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I'm not sure where some of the negative reviews are coming from because everyone we met was just as impressed as we were. You can't go wrong with this resort for a romantic getaway!

We got a rate of $85/night on Priceline (in December) so value for money was excellent. We had a fabulous stay at the Sheraton. No complaints about anything. The fitness room is great - lots of equipment so not waiting around at all. It's adjoining the pool so well located for a run and then a swim. One of the best features was the bed - it was very firm and comfortable. The sheets were a bit odd, they were like paper. We went for a shopping weekend and it was an excellent location for that, a block and a half to Nordstrom's! The only slight downside was there was no wi-fi in the rooms and you had to either pay $12 a day or go to the lobby for free wi-hi. It amazed us that a large hotel wouldn't have free wi-fi in the rooms. We also had to request robes which was a bit odd as well but housekeeping was quick to bring them up. Perhaps this had to do with their green strategy. If you don't need your towels washed daily, you get a choice of starwood points or a coupon for the coffee shop downstairs. Great idea! Head to Speciality's Cafe & Bakery for the best breakfast sandwich and latte (only a block away). If we got another excellent price on Priceline, we would absolutely stay here again!

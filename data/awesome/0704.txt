If at all possible, stay at this wonderful hotel!!!! What an unbelievable place!!! I am a travel agent & just returned from 3 nights at The Inn At The Market. David Watkins, you are a truly remarkable manager. Your hotel stands out, miles above the rest. You have trained your staff very well. They all seem to enjoy their jobs & truly care about the clients. Kudos to all!!!!!!! The room was spotless & well decorated, bathroom is a dream bathroom, view -spectacular, bed very comfortable, chocolates - delicious. I could go on & on, but everyone should experience this themselves. I will sell this property to any clients coming to Seattle. And of course, I plan on returning within the year. Thank you again to everyone at the Inn At The Market!!! You made our Seattle trip the best!!!!

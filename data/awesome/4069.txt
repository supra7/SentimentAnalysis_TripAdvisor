The resort was wonderful. Food and entertainment was great. WE WOULD LOVE TO COME BACK. The only thing we were not prepared for was the dresscode for dinner. Guys needed long pants and dressshirt in all the resturants for dinner but two. Online it said only one resturant. So make sure you bring them. Everyone gets dressed up for dinner and the nightclub. so you wont feel out of place if you girls bring something fancy!!

Stayed here in August. Enjoyed the stay. Hotel is centrally located - I walked to the man tourist spots like the Space Needle, Pikes Market, and even walked to the Mariners baseball game one night. Hotel is very ellegant and has clean/comfortable rooms. Would recommend to anyone, singles, couples, or families with kids. Tood several photos of my room and view from the 17th floor. Take a look.

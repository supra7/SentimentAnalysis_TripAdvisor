This was the first time I was staying at W brand and was not sure what I would get. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I reached there. The reception area was small but well decorated and it seemed there was party on when I checked in late at night. Later I learned it was the restaurant which comes to life after sunset. The rooms were very tastefully decorated and seemed ideal for romantic getaway (alas I was travelling on business there). The staff is very helpful and eager to fulfil your wish.

My husband and I went here in June for our honeymoon and it was amazing. The rooms were beautiful, clean, and comfortable. We had an ocean view room on the 4th floor. The swim out suites looked cool, but we would have probably never used the private pool so it wasn't worth the extra money for us. The service was fantastic. Everyone was polite and very willing to help. The resort is spectacular and the grounds are well maintained. There was never a shortage of beach or pool chairs. The beach is so beautiful and the beach bar with the swings is great. All of the food and drinks were delicious. I didn't except everything to be so good since it was an all inclusive. Our favorite restaurant was the Japanese one, the hibachi grill was fantastic. Make sure you make reservations if you want to check it out. The spa is definitely worth checking out. I got a mini facial and massage, both were worth it. Before the massage I soaked in the spa pools and used the sauna, which was also nice. While we were there we booked our excursions with the American Express agent on site. We swam with dolphins and went to a zip line park. Both activities were very fun. We didn't go see a lot of the entertainment, but we did see a fire show that was really good. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel!! The only thing I wish is that it was closer to Playa del Carmen, so that we could have explored the city a little more.

I will keep this short because most of my comments have already been made. I have nothing negative to say about this place. One of the best parts of the stay was the people working here. Wonderful people who are so eager to help and make your vacation a very memorable one. Enrique in the World Cafe is an amazing guy. SO much fun! The Entertainment staff was EXCELLENT. Not pushy like some can be, but lots and lots of fun and sooo friendly. Alex and Gabby were our favourites! Best restaurant for us was the Italian. Would have loved to go back and try every entre, but there were so many other restaurants to try out. All of them were excellent! We've been to a few different all inclusives in the Caribbean (including Sandals in the Bahamas approx 10 year ago). This was the best by far! Thanks to all the wonderful people at Secrets Maroma Beach!! We will return!!

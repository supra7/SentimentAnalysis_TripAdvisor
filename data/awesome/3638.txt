Our group of 16 students and four adult chaperones from a public high school in Northern California stayed for four nights at the Destiny Palms Hotel during the last week of February, 2011. This was part of a high school field trip to Florida that included Walt Disney World on the itinerary. Our students can be a bunch of tough critics, but everyone in our group, students and chaperones, were absolutely pleased and delighted with our stay at this hotel! While the rooms were small, they were immaculately clean, nicely furnished, and well maintained. Our students liked the refrigerator and flat-screen TV in each room. The beds were comfortable, and the property was quiet at night. There was also more than ample free parking. Breakfast got good ratings as well. They had toaster-ready waffles and pancakes, bread, bagels, cereal, and coffee and juice. Management was friendly and went out of their way to please. When we reported a phone in one room was not working, Chuck, the manager, installed a replacement phone within five minutes! The location was also ideal, out towards the western end of US 192, away from the constant traffic jams and congestion. We were able to enter Walt Disney World each morning through some convenient back roads and avoid all the traffic delays. The price was an exceptional value for our group, and we would not consider staying anywhere else near Walt Disney World should we plan any future trips to Florida. We do two student trips each year to various destinations around the country. Our group leaders all felt Destiny Palms Hotel was one of the best hotels, and best value, we have ever found!

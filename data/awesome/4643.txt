My husband and I went for our honeymoon and we were so glad we picked Secrets Maroma. The beach, room, and staff were perfect. We don't have any complaints. We had the swim up suite and it was perfect!! The room was spacious and the pool was an added bonus to our stay. Room service was always on time and the food was good. I think we ordered it every day. I had never been to an all inclusive, and I cant wait to go back. It is so nice to be able to drink and eat what ever you want and not have to worry about a bill at the end. The location was so nice and the staff was so attentive. I would love to go back!! I would suggest a couple things: Make sure you bring dollar bills to tip the staff. We tipped at dinner every night. Then if we were by the pool or beach and ordered a lot we would tip them too. The other suggestion is if you like to spend time in your room, bring DVDs, they have a DVD player in the room. Also, since we had the swim up suite I dont think the preferred club is necessary. The location doesnt really matter for this, since the "view" is the pool.

I stayed here for 3 nights last week. Great hotel and very helpful staff. I didn't bother posting my pictures of the hotel because everything is completely brand new and in excellent condition - exactly as you see posted on their website. By far the best hotel I stayed in during my 2 week in Germany and Austria, and surprisingly, the cheapest as well. The hotel is in a good location, albeit a bit of a hike to some of the main attractions if you're walking. It was rather cold while I was there so I cabbed to most of the places I went and never paid more than $10 to get anywhere. I highly recommend springing for the breakfast that they offer - its well worth the money. I stayed in one of the "Lifestyle" rooms which is a bit larger than the Standard room. While it was a great room, if I stayed there again I would stay in a Standard room. The Lifestyle rooms face the front of the building and you hear a lot of noise from traffic well into the middle of the night (which you become painfully aware of if jet lagged like myself). The hotel is on Potsdamer Strasse which is a 4 lane major thoroughfare for the city. The Standard rooms face the back of the building where there is just a parking lot and I suspect those rooms are much quieter. I hope to get back to Berlin soon and will definitely stay here again.

My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach for our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived and greeted with glasses of champagne... to our every request being met with a smile... our stay was perfect. If anyone is looking for a relaxing, romantic getaway, this is the place! The resort did offer nightly entertainment which was always fun. The service poolside was always excellent. My husband loved the surprises offered at lunchtime like chicken tacos or grilled shrimp kabobs served to you as you relax on your lounge chair. We stayed in a swim-out suite which was very nice. We used it early in the morning or late at night. We would have been just as happy in a regular room because it was such a nice place! We also tried the spa which was very nice!!! Finally, room service was 24 hrs and couldn't have been nicer. Waitstaff always pleasant, ven at 2 a.m. when I ordered shrimp cocktail!!!

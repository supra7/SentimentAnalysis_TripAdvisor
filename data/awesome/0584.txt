Two nights at the Inn at the Market seemed out of our reach until we found the special package that they had to attend the Picasso exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. The package included parking and tickets to SAM. We booked the package for two nights or we thought but when we got there we discovered that we had one night at the regular price, which was fine except for the $30 per night parking. The hotel kicked that in for free and we were off to a weekend of family, sightseeing and shopping. We had a street view room and no room in downtown Seattle is quiet on a weeknd night. A few buses, a fight and an accident woke us up but we fell right back to sleep. The location could not be better. We walked everywhere and brought family back for a bit of pre-dinner socilization. The room was great for two people, very quiet and clean. For us out of towners, it was a trip of our dreams. The internet was a little slow but fast enough for us to get to our email and weather links.

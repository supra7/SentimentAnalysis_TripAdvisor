Glowing reviews are usually suspect, but this place certainly deserves it. The location is half a block from Pike Market, and a short walk from the light rail from the airport. Our room faced the bay and was pretty much perfect - quiet, with a separate sitting room and a view to die for. The bathroom was fairly large and the bed really, really comfortable. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful. They give you the choice of two newspapers or, if you want, both. The only complaints (if you even want to call them that) is 1) no turn down service (a surprise at such a nice place) and 2) the television is in a weird place, sort of on the side of the bed. Picky, picky, picky... This hotel is not cheap, but for a couple of extra bucks it definitely is worth it. We can not imagine staying elsewhere in Seattle.

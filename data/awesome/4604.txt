This is the second time my husband and I came back for our anniversary. It was just as beautiful as we remembered it during our honeymoon. The only suggestion I have for the hotel is to ensure that coordination for the romantic dinners and packages (such as the honeymoon and anniversary packages) are coordinated prior to the guests arrival. We had notified the hotel of our anniversary prior to our arrival expecting to receive the Anniversary banner and a welcome letter, but this was not there and we had to remind the staff which was promptly taken of. Aside from this small issue, the food/drinks, staff, and facilities are exceptional and we hope to return next year!

Pros: we had reserved 2 rooms. Teenage daughters stayed in one and husband and myself in the other. Check-in went quick and staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean. Pool and spa area was clean and inviting. There is Limited outdoor Parking but this does not have to be an issue: there is a secure underground parking garage - be sure to ask about it at check-in ! Rooms have fridge and microwave, ironing board, free wifi, hairdryer. We do not smoke, but there is a huge outdoor terrace for 'smokers'. Only minutes to walk downtown-great location. Cons: the carpet needs updating, so does the wallpaper in the guest rooms. Both elevators are SLOW. Breakfast was not great, but it was not any worse than the breakfast at a Best Western or a Holiday Inn!

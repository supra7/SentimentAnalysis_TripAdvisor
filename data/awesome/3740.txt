Absolutely loved the place. We spent 12 nights at SMB. Room(we had swim-out room ) was very clean and cozy. Delicious and high quality food in numerous restaurants and buffet. No complaints! Great all inclusive! What a professional staff members Secrets Maroma Beach have! Everyone was very helpful, courteous and polite. Even the people carrying your luggage knew us by name. Concierge and check in and out services were excellent. Every question was addressed and solved(like internet issue we had) in a quick manner. One of housekeeper staff Dalila(spelling?) found our friend's earrings she lost while she cleaned their room. What an honest person! Entertainment team do everything to cheer you up and they do it without being pushy. Waiters at restaurants, buffet and beach, barmen are all working very hard to please their guests. Spa was very relaxing and wonderful! We fell in love with SMB! Can't wait to come back!

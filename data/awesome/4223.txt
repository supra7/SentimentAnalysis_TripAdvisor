My wife and I have been to Mexico seven times and stayed and different resorts each time. This is the first time we contemplated returning to the same one. We typically like to pick resorts with a nice beach and it is difficult to beat this one. I will quickly list a few positive comments and a two areas that could be looked at. "Awesome food and great selection, excellent rooms (secret box is a nice touch), excellent service & all staff are very pleasant and extremely helpful, you can walk for miles in either direction on some of the best beach in the world, excellent bar & food service on the beach & at the pool areas. "Very clean resort in all areas" Some areas that could improve but are typical of most resorts: The seating area could be spread out more on the beach so it was not so tight, the volleyball/sports area take up too much of the prime area, they should have a special area away from the area most guests utilize for their weddings since it can be quite distracting to other guests. There are re-stocked mini bars in the room but very limited amounts. Overall we had an awesome time and we especially loved our room on the third floor overlooking the ocean. If we could be reserve a similar room again we would positively go back but we were told there are no promises regardless of how much in advanced we booked. This resort definetly takes pride in all aspects of their operation"

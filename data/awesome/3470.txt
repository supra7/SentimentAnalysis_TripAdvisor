I booked Le Crystal to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday as we were going to a Habs game and had already heard good things about the hotel. We were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived until our departure everything about our stay was wonderful. We were welcomed with a room upgrade and very pleasantly surprised by the complimentary bottle of wine waiting in our room along with a card wishing my husband a happy birthday. The room was spacious with a beautiful, pristine bathroom (this is a huge plus for me) and the incredible rooftop hot tub provided us with some lovely, quiet adult time. I would highly recommend this hotel to couples wishing to stay in the heart of Montreal. We will most definitely stay here again.

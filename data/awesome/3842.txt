My wife and I just got back from a 7 night stay at the secrets resort and there is nothing but good things to say about the resort and its great staff. From the moment we got there our bags were taken from us and we were taken by golf cart to the Preferred check in and given a cold towel and a glass of champagne and after a long flight it was perfect. From then on it was great food at all of the restaurants, great bartenders at the Pool bar (Carlos) and the Beach bar which we frequented the most, and a great entertainment staff that always had something going on. Lastly our concierge was so attentive it was almost a negative making sure daily that we had everything we needed and constantly checking up on us just to make sure. I could not recommend this resort more to anyone looking for the best in an all inclusive resort.

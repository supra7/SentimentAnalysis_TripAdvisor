The Moore is quirky, clean, and an amazing value for staying in downtown Seattle. My husband and I rented a suite on the 7th floor with my MIL for Mother's Day, and we had a wonderful time wandering the market, visiting the Sci-Fi Museum and Experience Music Project, as well as taking in a Mariners game at Safeco field, which is about a fifteen to twenty minute walk away. Comfortable queen and twin beds, great little kitchenette, dining room table, and our own bathroom for less than $150 in downtown Seattle on a Saturday night -- this is unheard of at any other property in the area. Perfect place to stay if you need a safe place to crash for the night downtown. Noisy? You're in the middle of downtown Seattle -- what do you expect? We heard the usual assortment of vehicles and city sounds, but no problems with our neighbors in the hotel. The elevator is tiny and old, but I consider that to be part of the charm. If you are high maintenance and need every detail to be spit and shine, stay someplace else. If you like staying in an offbeat hotel and want to be in the center of everything, this is the place to book.

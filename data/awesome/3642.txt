Our family could not have been more pleased with this hotel. The staff managers Allen and Chuck went out of their way to make us feel right at home. Our room was very clean and comfortable with great furnishings and pillowtop beds along with a great breakfast.. We were glad to see that they had a free business center along with wireless internet. My kids had a blast in the pool. Our family is looking forward to our next vacation at Destiny Palms. The Burton Family

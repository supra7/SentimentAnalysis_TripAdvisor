We stayed one night before an Alaskan cruise. The location could not have been better. We could easily walk, shop, and sightsee. We probably had the most fun that evening in the bar, Olivers. We talked to locals and enjoyed the people watching-sit at the bar to enjoy the views. The bartenders were nice and the drinks were good. Our room was a good size with a small but very clean recently remodeled bathroom. I would stay here again when I return to the city.

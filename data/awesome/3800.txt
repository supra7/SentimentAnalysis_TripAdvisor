I can't say anything that is detrimental to this outstanding hotel. It was "home from home" for my wife and myself. We will be heading back next year hopefully hooking up with some new friends found at Secrets Maroma. Many thanks to all the staff for making our stay as memorable an event - Feliz Navidad.

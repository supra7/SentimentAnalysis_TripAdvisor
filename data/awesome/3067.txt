I stayed at Hotel Max for a week during a business trip to Seattle. I really enjoyed my stay - the service was REALLY good and everyone was very friendly. Whenever I asked for anything, I got it in 15 minutes or less. The hotel is artsy and fun, a vast improvement over the generic mega-chains available nearby for 2x the price. My room was smaller but perfectly adequate, the decor was contemporary and I LOVED the bed - excellent quality on par with the Westin 'heavenly' bed. Location was also excellent - just around the corner from the retail core and walking distance to any of the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle. Really a great deal for downtown Seattle.

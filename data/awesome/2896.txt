Stayed in Seattle for last 2 nights of trip and as Sheraton point holders chose W because of locality and luxury - it certainly turned out to be luxurious - if a little expensive! Parking is a problem a if the hotel park is full, there are public parks but they charge $25 per day. Check in was great as was the helpful staff when we asked if there were any smoking rooms. There was none on check in (we should have thought about this earlier) but they were able then to reserve a room for the following evening. Rooms were great, half price cocktails on some evening an while there are restaurants nearby, for a special treat we ate in the hotel because of quality and standing of chef. We ordered the 5 course meal where the Chef picks the dishes and also the special wine option where different wines complement the dishes . . a really good choice. Several other small dishes thrown in as well as the main 5 so there was always something to eat. Expensive but as they say, you get what you pay for - it was the highlight meal of the holiday. very business orientated with conferences but this was not a problem for us - we liked the buzz.

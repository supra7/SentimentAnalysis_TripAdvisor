We stayed here due to a few reasons. The great deal we received through Clipper Vacations and for the location. We paid a bit extra for a better room because I like a nice view. The beds were amazing and we were close to shopping. Having to go to the lobby for wi-fi was annoying. For the room cost it should have been free. Busy hotel but the lobby is nice and big to accommodate everyone so you don't feel crowded. Fast elevators and friendly staff. We will be back.

We got married at Secrets Maroma in early May of 2011. We had an amazing wedding, low stress, beautiful weather and the resort was amazing. All of our guests were pleased with the food, drinks, pool, beach, rooms, overall we would do it again in a heartbeat!! You can't go wrong, it can be hard to find beautiful beaches in this area and it lived up to the reviews. The resort seems to be set right that there's a nice breeze that keeps you comfy even in the heat. We loved every bit of it!

Amazing resort for couples. I've been to several all inclusive resorts, including 2 others in Mexico and this is by far the best. The food, drinks, service, and the grounds are top notch. This is the first time that I have NEVER had one complaint. The beach location is wonderful. I will recommend this to everyone that wants to feel catered to 24/7. Awesome Resort!

Just got back from a week at this wonderful hotel. Couldnt be happier. I am really sceptical of those who gave this resort a bad review. Like the woman who said it took a half hour from the main road to the front door. Wrong. Takes five minutes. Rude staff. Wrong. Dirty. Wrong. The beach and sea were perfection. No rocks in he water like at other hotels in the area. I cant praise this place enough, food was great, rooms were great, just everything was great. I would go back in a heartbeat. Any person writing a review of anything less than 5 stars, has some issues. I almost take a bad review personally. We loved this place.!!!!!!!!!

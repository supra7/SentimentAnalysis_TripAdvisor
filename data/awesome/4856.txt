Welcome home was the first thing that was said to us when we arrived as they passed me a cold towel and glass of champagne, and they did above and beyond to make us feel at home!!! This is a fantastic resort that lived up to our expectations and more, the staff are so friendly and helpful and will do everything and more to help your every need. The rooms are large and very comfortable with a jacuzzi in every room. The restraunts are very good and the japanesse is a must!!!! The resort only has 400 rooms so is never to crowded and it is very easy to get sunbeds etc. The beach is awesome and if you take some bread to the beach you can feed the angel fish out of your hands. all the drinks are top brands and you can drink any spirits you like. The beer is Corona, Modello, Pacifico and Budweiser. The Spa is very good too and I strongly recomend you go for the couples massage it is very relaxing and enjoyable. All in all this will be a holiday that you will never forget for all the right reasons and we will be definately going back!!!!!!!

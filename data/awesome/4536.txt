The food and the service was excellent! Staff extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were just as beautiful as the brochure. The only thing that we had a problem with was the air conditioning, we thought the room could have been colder than what it was. The entertainment was great. The entertainment staff was very involved with the people. It was a great vacation. We are ready to book again and we are home for 1 day.

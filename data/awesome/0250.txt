Spent the evening of April 22nd, Tuesday. Read all the Trip Advisor reviews before I visited the Hotel Monaco Seattle and was most worried about street noise. Stayed on the the 7th floor facing the busy city street, but heard very faint, almost no vehicle noise which I was relieved. The hotel is located in the center of a big busy vibrant city, and I expect to hear a little normal street life noise, but thankfully there was not a noise problem. Besides the very cool gym, I also enjoyed the complimentary yoga equipment in my room with the video fitness workouts on TV. Loved the fun animal print bathrobes and cool toiletries and the offer of their trademark pet goldfish during my stay. Hotel staff was always friendly, from the housekeepers to Art and Amanda at the concierge & front desks were always smiling and very helpful. The doormen/valets always with a warm welcome as they opened the doors as guests enter the lobby. Evening complimentary wine and beer hour from 5-6pm nightly, and morning coffee in the lobby was a treat. Complimentary Wi-FI in rooms and lobby was another added touch of value. As principle, I get tired of being nickled and dimed by the big hotel chains. I am glad I can honestly recommend the Hotel Monaco.

We stayed at this hotel one night before an Alaska cruise. We arrived very late, were greeted at the desk by a friendly employee who handed us a warm chocolate chip cookie to munch on while we were waiting for our room key. The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, and the staff was very attentive and friendly. The room was very clean and comfortable. The gift shop was well stocked and very reasonably priced. We would highly recommend this hotel for before and after cruising because it is minutes from the airport and is lovely.

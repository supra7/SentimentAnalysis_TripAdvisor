We stayed Christmas and New Years and I just want to say it was one of the best Christmas I have ever had - or 9 days of my life. The entertainment was great, they had a constant flow of great food and buffets and different restaurants so you never got bored of the food. They had BBQs on the beach and would bring out food and waiters to bring you drinks on the beach. And they didn't go cheap on the good alcohol. New Years was awesome there to. Definitely go and take the day trip to Chitizenita, but the town is not so great. I would highly recommend it and my boyfriend is very picky, we research places months ahead of time before we go anywhere. Don't take the taxi inside the airport but outside and you can bargain them (much cheaper). The only downside was if you went to the beach late it was a little hard to find a chair and we would have to stay by the pool instead.

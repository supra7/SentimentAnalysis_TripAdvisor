This hotel was an absolute gem. Small, but great service. The room was not huge but certainly adequate, clean and comfortable. Ask for a room on a high floor and get a great view of either downtown or the Space Needle. Best of all was the attentive staff. Concierges were friendly and helpful. The shuttle drivers also went out of their way (literally) for us. They will take you to the Victoria ferry and pick you up as well. Very convenient. Would recommend to anyone!

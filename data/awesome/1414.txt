We love staying at Marriott's, but this was our first time at The Renaissance. What a great hotel! We stayed in one of the Executive Suites on the 23rd floor in the SW corner. We had great views and weren't bothered by the I-5 traffic. Room service was fantastic...the food and the service. We had breakfast delivered every morning (we purchased the Valentine's special so breakfast was included). The pancakes were fluffy. The oatmeal was hot and served with raisins and brown sugar. The bacon and sausage were cooked to order. Needless to say, we were well equipped with energy to have a great morning walking around town. Dinner through room service was good, too. However, I think the nearby by restaurants probably are a bit better. We received free parking, free wireless internet, and free breakfasts along with two $100 reward certificates to be used during a future stay at any Renaissance Hotel. We'll be back to visit this hotel soon!

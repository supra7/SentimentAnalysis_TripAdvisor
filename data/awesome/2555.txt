We needed a room for a 2 night stay before our cruise. I had read several bad reviews concerning this hotel, but I got a great price on hotwire so decided to give it a try. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and bright. Service was top notch. Great location. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

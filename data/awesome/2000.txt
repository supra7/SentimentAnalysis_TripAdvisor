We rented Vespas which is by far the best way to see Rome. As a result we didn't need to be within walking distance of the central sights. We loved the hotel. Clean, bright, brand new and with a huge balcony terrace overlooking a very green treed neighbourhood. The beautiful breakfast room was in a "backyard" filled with huge pine trees. The room was very well decorated with a flat screen TV and a modern bathroom The staff were all wonderful, friendly and helpful (particularly Simon who was very good to us) If you want a classy, clean, new hotel in a quiet verdant part of Rome this is perfect. There is a bus that is also easy to take to the sights We'd go back in a flash.

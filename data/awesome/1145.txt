Family and friends from all over the country stayed at the Mayflower for our daughters wedding in the city. Every level of service was excellent. Booking a group of rooms, the concierge desk answering many questions and helping find services, a whimsical bridal Tea Party! From the moment we pulled up to the hotel to the moment we left I always felt that there was not one need that could not be handled. A beautiful, historical hotel with many wonderful personal touches. And the location is perfect!!

Just returned from Seattle visit & 4-night stay at Hotel Andra. We had a 2-bed corner room on 4th floor facing 4th Ave (per request). The room & closet were both large. The modern bathroom was adequate with a large shower & lots of comfy towels. We appreciated the helpfulness of the doormen/women (especially Dustin). The location was exactly what we wanted - convenient to downtown (1 block from Macy's), light rail, Pike Place Market - yet part of a quieter neighborhood (Belltown). We easily walked to the Seattle Center & Space Needle, and to Myrtle Edwards Park & Sculpture Park on the waterfront. There were many restaurants & grocery stores within easy walking distance. Fortunately, we discovered nearby Top Pot Doughnuts on the last day or else we'd be several pounds heavier!

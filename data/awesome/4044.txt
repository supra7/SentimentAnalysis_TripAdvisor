This was our second trip to Maroma Beach and it just keeps getting better and better. This year we actually bought a membership with AM resorts and are planning to return next year. The food is absolutely delicious. We stayed in the swimout room both times we visited and found it to be very private and relaxing. I can't even describe how nice the beach is. The sand is like powder and the water is so clear and a beautiful acqua color. The staff can't seem to do enough for you. I will definitely recommend this resort to all my friends without hesitation. Can't wait to go back!

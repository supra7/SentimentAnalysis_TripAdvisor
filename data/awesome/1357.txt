We only stayed for one night but it was very close to attractions in Seattle. We stayed in a room that had 2 queen beds in separate rooms which was nice travelling with 4 adults. It was very quiet, clean and a very comfortable bed. I would stay here again. Small bathroom but very adequate with nice soaps and products.

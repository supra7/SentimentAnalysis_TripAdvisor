Stayed at the Sorrento for the first time after moving away from Seattle 10 years and after never stepping foot in the door while residing in the city but had always heard glowing reviews of it. Was immediately taken aback by the generosity of the staff who were very friendly and immediately offered a room upgrade. Upon entering the room i found out why this hotel was given such high marks, separate sitting area with couch and desk, the most comfortable down-filled bed, large marble bathroom with excellent toiletries. We were most pleased. It is a little stretch for walking down to Pike's Market unless you happen to be in tiptop shape as Seattle is very hilly. The breakfast was excellent also and plus they have a nice happy hour in the lobby with the fireplaces glowing which can be handy during the wet weather that may great you while in Seattle.

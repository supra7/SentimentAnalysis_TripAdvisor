In the heart of downtown Seattle is a gem of a hotel! The Hotel Monaco surpassed our expectations. Their genuinely kind and gracious staff, the beautifully appointed rooms at an affordable price coupled with the evening cocktail party made for a wonderful stay. It was even better than that, though, when they gave us our own goldfish for the weekend and sent it up to our room. Our 7 year old was thrilled! I would definitely recommend this hotel and personally, we won't stay anywhere else in Seattle!

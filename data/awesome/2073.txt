My husband and I stayed in a full waterview room for our anniversary. We were impressed the moment we entered the hotel lobby. It was the perfect blend of Pacific Northwest Chic with an incredible view of the bay. We had appetizers and drinks in the lounge. Try the prawn corn dogs. It sounds strange, but tastes delicious. Our room was adorable and came with a fireplace and furry bear stool. The staff we came in contact with were friendly and accommodating. We had an issue with the toilet one evening that was quickly fixed while we were at dinner. The only negative was that we requested a king room and received a double, but they are clear that requests are not guaranteed. The upgrade to a full water view room more than made up for it. We ate twice in the restaurant and were impressed with the food and the service (breathtaking views as well). Also, the amount of food was more than we expected to get in a restaurant of this caliber. I highly suggest the lobster macaroni and cheese, 16 oz NY steak and the Washington apple pancakes. We loved the location as we could easily walk to many sites and attractions. Also, the ferry to Victoria is only one pier over. We are planning to return again!

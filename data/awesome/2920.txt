Very comfortable and funky hotel. The decor and overall experience is clearly targeted at younger professionals and vacationers, so for older or more conservative travelers, this hotel may not be your cup of tea. The hallways are dark with very dramatic blue spotlights throughout, which is very effective and funky. The room was clean and very well appointed with a large LCD TV, DVD player, minibar, a copy of Wired Magazine, and modern decor. The bed was a 10 out of 10 for comfort and felt exactly the same to me as the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper Bed offered at some Sheraton properties (W is part of the Starwood / Sheraton chain). The bathroom was large and had a cool frosted glass counter with a steel sink suspended in it. The only hiccup in our stay was a mix up at check-in where the king bed room which we had booked wasnt ready yet. Because of this, we had to wait about 45 minutes while the room was cleaned, but they gave us a ticket for 2 complimentary for cocktails in the lounge while we waited. This hotel is a bit pricey, but well worth it if your expectations are high. We will stay again.

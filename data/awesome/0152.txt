We've stayed at the Monaco in the past during the Christmas Holidays and thoroughly enjoy the excellent ambiance, comfort, service and location. The Monaco is unique, offering all of the amenities one expects in a quality hotel, with a relaxed eligance and level of warmth one does not find in a larger facility. Their staff is consistently the most friendly and efficient group of people you could wish. Besides being a great hotel the location is outstanding, withing easy walking distance to the Benaroya Hall and the Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Art Museum, many other Seattle entertainment venues, great shopping and excellent restaurants. The Hotel Monaco is a great buy, and I recommend checking it out! We will definitely return! Tom Dozal, Olympia, Washington

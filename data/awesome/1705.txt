We stayed at the Sheraton because we were in town for a wedding and the Church and Reception was close to our hotel. Little did we know when we booked this hotel that it was very close to all of the Seattle attractions. The hotel is located downtown near all of the shopping. The Monterail is two blocks away and that will take you down to the Space Needle. Pike's Place Market, where they throw the fish, is only 5 blocks down, about a 15 min walk. We did not rent a car, everything we wanted to do was in walking distance. We took a taxi to the hotel from the Sea-Tac airport. It was about a 15-20 min drive and it cost $35. If you want to go cheaper than that you can take the bus for $10.25 per person. We arrived almost three hours before check-in time. But it was not a problem they already had a room ready for us. We were on the 29th floor and had a beautiful view of the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone we really liked it. They also have free internet for guests. My only complaint was the bathroom sink drain was broken and the service at the restaurant was not very good. Other than that we would definitly stay here again!

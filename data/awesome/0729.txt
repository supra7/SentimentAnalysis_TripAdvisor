We had but one night in Seattle on a tour of the pacific northwest and we wanted to be able to have a great view and experience downtown Seattle. What a great choice we made with the Inn at the Market. We were upgraded to a full water view, which was fabulous! The room was not huge, but the view made up for that, and everything about the hotel was first-rate, from check-in to check-out. The rooftop garden was incredible--even at the beginning of October, we were able to sit out for both breakfast and cocktail hour, enjoying the view and the weather. Being right next to the Pike Market was terrific--we enjoyed the shopping and eating. This is a great hotel and the perfect spot to experience Seattle!

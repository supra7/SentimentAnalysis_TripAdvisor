We have stayed at the Hotel Andra every visit to Seattle for the past 5+ years. We absolutely love it. We've gone for anniversary trips, and also with our kids. Here are the reasons we keep coming back: Location- Easy walk to all our favorite spots Staff- Super friendly, helpful Rooms- Comfy bed, fab reading lights, ipod dock, room to stretch out and relax Food- LOVE Lola at Breakfast, warm pita and dips and greek salad at lunch are wonderful! We also love the Dahlia lounge for dinner- it's right across the street. Decor- modern, hip, fun

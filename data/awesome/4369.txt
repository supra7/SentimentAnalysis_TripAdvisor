We went to the Valentin Imperial last year, and this was a huge improvement. The food, while not the best we've ever had, was much better than at the Valentin. We were upgraded to a penthouse suite and it was just breathtaking. The service was wonderful and the staff were so gracious (although the entertainment staff's homophobic humor during the Love and Marriage game show was a bit of a killjoy.) The beach is lovely. Really, it was a stupendous experience. Our only complaint would be the spa; the sauna and steam room are mixed gender. My husband and I love to just relax in these rooms before a massage. Unfortunately for us, we were using the facilities at the same time as a group of women who prefer to relax by having a loud and raucous conversation. They seemed to be having a ball and good for them! But we had to run out of the place before our heads exploded. I'm not sure that's the resort's fault- what it means to "relax" is so personal- but it definitely negatively impacted our experience.

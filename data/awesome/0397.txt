When my wife and I want to treat ourselves to a great time by ourselves, Inn at the Market is on the top of our list. The location is spectacular and the rooms are comfortable if you want to rest and they're functional if you need to get a little work done. The reading lights over the bed are the best we've seen. Room service offers some of the Seattle's finest food, but you're also only a few feet from all the treats of Pike's Market and environs. The staff is always friendly and alert, and we've never been stuck in a traffic jam at the elevators like they have at the giant deluxe hotels downtown.

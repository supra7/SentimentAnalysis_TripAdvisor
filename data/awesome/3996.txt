Secrets was everything and even more than we could have expected! The resort is beautiful, and kept very clean! So many romantic spots to enjoy too! The food and service was 5 star all the way! The housekeeping and all services provided were beyond amazing, and as they would tell us, "it was their pleasure" to serve us! Our room was on the 4th floor, beautiful views. Our kids had the swim out rooms which were awesome too! Secrets also provides many activities throughout the days and nights that offer such a variety of fun for you! We would love to go back!!!!

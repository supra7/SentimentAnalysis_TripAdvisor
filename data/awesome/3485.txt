The Hotel is right near the Bell Centre and Crescent Street and is centrally located to many of the major office towers in downtown Montreal. Attention to detail and level of service was exceptional. The European "green" features for energy efficiency and comfort were not only interesting but highly functional. Upon arrival and without request, I was upgraded to a corner suite which was extremely spacious and well equiped for a business trip with an ample size desk and ease of connection to internet. Faxes that came in were promptly brought to the room by hotel staff. Considering the time of year for travelling the hotel was a very welcoming place to return to after a business day. Staff are knowledgable about restaurant recommendations and travel times. The only negative is the busness cenre is in the heart of the lobby and does not offer much privacy and can be distracting because fo noise. On the whole it was a great hotel.

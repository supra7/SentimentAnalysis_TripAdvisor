After staying @ this resort we know it's going to be extremely difficult to find another that tops it! The grounds, pools, beach, food, staff, entertainment, drinks-everything was just great!! Such a beautiful place that provides a high level of specialty! We felt like kings for a week and would recommend this resort for anyone traveling to Rivera Maya! It was our honeymoon-so we got the upgraded preferred club package which was well worth it for the massages, dinner on the beach, preferred club lounge that had lots of yummy snacks and great bar tenders-it was a more private bar than the lobby bar which was nice for our taste! The rock show in the theater was great! At lunchtime they have a bbq setup with hamburgers/hotdogs/fish, french fries, fresh fruit, jalapeno poppers-gave us a taste of home, which kept us from not craving american cuisine! The dinner restraunts were great too!-the Japenese steak house and Oceana were are fav specialty restraunts! And breakfast-wow is all we have to say!-they had everything you could want and more! The crepes were delicious!-we do not think many took advantage of the crepes, but we sure did every morning! They were stuffed w/ fresh strawberries, mangos, bananas, kiwi!-so delicious! The room service was great too-margharit pizza was great! It would be a great loss to anyone who didn't stay @ this resort! We give it five stars!!

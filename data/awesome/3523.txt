My 21 year old son and I chose this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. We were torn between the Queen Elizabeth and this but when read the reviews about the QE being worn, we went with a 2 year old hotel instead. We couldnt have been happier. The rooms are suites and we had a small kitchen, desk, table with 4 chairs, couch and 2 chairs with TV and then a king sized bed room with a sliding door for privacey. It was the perfect suite for the three of us as the couch was a pull out. The bathroom was large and clean and the location downtown was 2 blocks from shopping and Crescant street wich is a big restaurant/nighttime spot. We really liked the desk with large hot tub and the pool was terrific. Small work out room but adequate. We loved the fresh apples each day and the staff was very pleasant. We asked for a room on a higher floor and they accomodated and it was very quiet. Really great experience and would stay here again.

Check in (with Jackie) was wonderful. She was welcoming and very kind. Our room was so comfortable and homey. We felt like we were in a luxurious home. Decor beautiful and elegant. Sheets were silky perfection. All of the bedding and towels fresh and clean. Bed perfectly comfortable. Wonderful nights of sleep. Much needed as we were in process of moving from AK to VA. The Sorrento was the perfect respite for us during the long transition. Love the charming, historic feel of the hotel but all of the modern luxuries are there. Take a look at the book in the lobby about the history of the hotel. Interesting especially if you like history. The valet parking staff was excellent. Alex and Cody were prompt, attentive, and very informative. My only suggestion for the hotel is to offer some vegan meal options on their room service menu.

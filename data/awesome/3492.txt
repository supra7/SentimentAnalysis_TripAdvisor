My wife, three children and I stayed at the Crystal for two days. The staff was outstanding -- always happy to help with even the smallest detail. The property itself is exquisite. The room (a suite) was impeccably detailed and maintained. Located right next to the Bell Centre, this hotel is in a fantastic location, close to countless sights and restaurants. We can't wait to return!

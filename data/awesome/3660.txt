My wife and I stayed at Secrets Maroma from March 11th to 18th. An absolutely amazing, 1st class establishment. Every single person who works there greeted us with eye contact and an "Ola" or other friendly greeting and they truly exude hospitality. The entertainment staff was Excellente! (particular shouts out to Jesus and Manuel, they gave my wife and I some great laughs and were just incredible with making us feel at home, while away from home) Joel at the game center bar too did an awesome job keeping us hydrated with many tasty drinks, some his very own creation :)...Chocolate Roadrunner people...try it! Our room was fantastic, awesome views from the balcony, clean, well kept, nothing but the best. We never had a meal we didn't like there also. All the food throughout the entire day was just amazing and we would love to give a special Thank You to Mauricio at El Patio who's above and beyond service he gave us on our first dinner at Secrets was truly an appetizer of what excellence this resort has to offer. So much to do on the resort and so much to do around Secrets too as there are plenty of opportunities to shop, dine or sight see around there too. I could go on for great lengths but to wrap this up and summarize: Our first trip to Mexico was amazing, we will defintiely be returning to this wonderful country...Viva Mexico!

We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for 1 night on a northwest road trip, we had a wonderful experience with the staff and the location couldnt have been better. Arrived at check in time, 3 pm, and got a great room on the 31st floor with a breathtaking view of downtown and surrounding areas, room was HUGE with a big dining table by the window, and big comfortale beds, HUGE bathroom, and very clean, probaly one of the best Sheratons ive ever stayed in, if you come to Seattle this is the place to stay, plus request a room on a higher floor, the views are worth it!! and despite all the construction, noise was low.

My husband and I had a wonderful vacation at Secrets Maroma Beach. I celebrated my birthday while there and the staff was so kind. They decorated the room super cute and even sung to me at dinner. Everything was truly the best. Tip- We rented a beach bed for 2 days and we thought that was the perfect amount of time. We LOVED our vacation and have already been telling our friends about Secrets for their upcoming weddings. We would love to come back! Only bummer part was that the hot tubs were not working while there but that is soooo minor in comparison to our amazing trip. The staff were so friendly and made us feel at home that is for sure. I know it is addicting reading trip advisor reviews. You will not be disappointed at this beautiful resort.

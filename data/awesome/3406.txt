We stayed 4 nights at the Radisson Gateway as the last leg of a Phoenix to Seattle road trip. We had a suite, and my son had the sofabed in a separate room with a door you could close in between the rooms. Fantastic! The room was very spacious and we had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Our bed was ridiculously comfortable and for being right on the road, directly across from the airport entrance, there was No Noise. I was very impressed. We all used the pool and hot tub, which felt like it was exclusively ours because no one else did. My husband did use the fitness center and liked it too. I think the hotel must be used a lot for one-night stays for those expecting to fly, but in our case, we chose it because it was close to downtown Seattle (20 min drive away) as well as close to our friends in Maple Valley and Covington. It is also very close to the Southcenter Mall. I think the hotel even has a shuttle to the mall but we didn't use it. Parking is now $10/night but the woman at check-in charged us for only 2 of the 4 nights that we stayed. I did use the guest laundry and it was $1/wash and $1/dry, and worked very well. We didn't eat here so I can't comment on that, but I loved the nobbly soap they had in the bath! Overall, wonderful stay, friendly staff, great location, decent price - we liked it a lot and would definitely stay again.

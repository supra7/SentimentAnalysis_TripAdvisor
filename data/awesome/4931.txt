I do not have enough nice things to say about the Secrets Maroma. From the moment you arrive, the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel like the most important people at the hotel. From cool towels and champagne as you check-in, to a personal concierge at each building (who gave us a personal call during our stay to see if we needed anything). Of course, we didn't need anything - as everything is taken care of for you. The food at each restaurant was definitely above average and had a good variety of options. Each restaurant specialized in a different style. There is a Hibachi/Japanese, French, Mexican, Seafood, Steak restaurant, and a few others. Pool and beach side service that not only delivered drinks but snacks as well - we enjoyed the ice cream delivery (unrequested!) while lying on the beach :D If you can't tell - my wife and I were very impressed with our stay there. Due to certain business obligations, we actually stayed at 3 hotels while in Cancun, (which was our first trip to the area) and upon our return, we will be staying ONLY at Secrets Maroma.

Stayed with wife for two nights after cruise. Booked room through Priceline at a very reasonable rate. Priceline rates this as a four star hotel and I would agree. We were checked in early with no problems, and asked for a quiet room on a high floor. Our room on the 29th floor of the north tower was very large, with two queen beds, a sizable work table, and two easy chairs, as well as a large screen TV. The room had a lovely view, partly obstructed, of Elliott Bay, and was very quiet. The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, and the bathroom facilities quite excellent, especially the shower with dual heads. Hot water was plentiful and water pressure quite adequate. The service at the hotel, although we did not require much, was excellent. The lobby is efficient but lacks charm or character. The lobby seems to be fitted with wi-fi, although I don't know if it is free. The room itself also had a high speed internet connection, but I believe you must pay for it. The hotel is well situated for most tourist and business needs, and the concierge staff was friendly and helpful.

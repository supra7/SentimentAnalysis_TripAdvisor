We visited Seattle for the first time this June and found the VP on line with good reviews here in TripAdvisor. It certainly lived up to expectations. Great location, yes its up a hill, but its Seattle, virtually everywhere is up a hill! The front desk staff were very friendly, the room spacious with a beautiful bed so sleep away our jetlag, and fully equipped with everything we needed. We had a lovely view of the modern city Library and Courthouse and never had any noise problems from either outside or other rooms. The staff were always on hand to answer any questions or book a taxi when needed and we enjoyed the excellent all day coffee in the quaint foyer. The free wifi was also a very nice extra. As I mentioned we had wanted a bit of luxury to recover from our jetlag and the VP fitted this excellently.

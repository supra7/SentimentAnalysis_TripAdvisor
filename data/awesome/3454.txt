We had a wonderful 3 day stay at this hotel. The acommodations were equivalent to 4 and 5 star hotels we stayed in in Prague, Budapest and Vienna. It is a brand new hotel so the entire facility is spotless. All linens, furniture, and fixtures are new and modern. We paid $72 cad. per night. The location is strategic and central. We were a 20 min. walk away from every single attraction and site in Berlin. We walked everywhere the entire 3 days we were there. The street has several markets, restaurants and a Lidl grocery store around the corner where you can purchase wines and cheeses for 1 euro. Absolutely incredible! All the restaurants were cheap as well as shops on the street. Potsdammer is the main street (the hotel is on this street) with most attractions. Our stay was memorable because of the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff who had information on everything possible we could ask them. We took a train from Berlin to Vienna. The station is 15 minutes away from the hotel. A great convenience! Most of the guests seemed to be European. The breakfast is geared to this group. We did not have breakfast at the hotel since there are half a dozen cafes and bakeries on the street where we stopped off for treats. Loved it!!!

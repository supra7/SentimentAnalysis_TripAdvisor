Every single employee we encountered impressed us with there helpfulness, politeness and great overall attitude. We have never seen 100% service like this before. The property is located right at Pikes Pier - a should be staple for perusing through every day. Remodeling property next door and an antiquated heating system did not dampen our experience. Great view of the sound and terrific food. Truly excellent experience overall. Thanks, mcj

This is a spacious, clean, modern yet great value hotel. Although it's not really within walking distance of the main sights of the city, the hotel is just a short bus or metro ride away (public transport is excellent in Berlin). There are plenty of good value cafes and shops on the same street as the hotel and a Lidl round the corner so you don't have to overpay for essentials! There also a couple of banks within 100m of the hotel. Wifi is 5 euros a day and the hotel has a large, stylish bar in the lobby area. The rooms are immaculate. Lack of a room safe was the only downside.

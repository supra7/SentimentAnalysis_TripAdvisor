Finally a hotel that gets it right! Everything from location, food, welcoming, helpful, friendly employees, and so much more! The dining room food was gourmet and well worth the price. The views from our premium jr suite were fabulous and the balcony outside our room allowed us special time to enjoy the city view as well as the bay view.

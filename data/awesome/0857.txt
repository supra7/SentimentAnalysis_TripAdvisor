My colleagues and I stayed at this hotel for business. It was in a great location to work during the day and close enough to the downtown attractions for evening entertainment...we were able to walk there. I booked my room through Resorts Plus International so I received a better rate than my colleagues, but we were all very happy with the cleanliness and friendly service this hotel provided.

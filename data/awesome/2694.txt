A wonderful small Hotel. Centrally located, walking distance to the market, the old part of town, shopping, waterfront, etc. Light and large rooms. Comfy beds and crisp linen. Wine tasting in the afternoon, coffee and tea in the morning. Nice restaurant and excellent late night bar menu. Very nice staff... I wanted to stay longer, one feels pampered there. (There is also a small fitness center.)

I stayed here while at a conference and I brought my wife and child along with me. It was a truly exotic place to stay... to walk out the door and be in the hustle and bustle of fabulous Pike Place Market... who could ask for more? Oh but there is! All around us were fabulous restaurants and shopping that made my wife giddy. Anyway, I wish we could afford to stay there more often - it was quite an experience.

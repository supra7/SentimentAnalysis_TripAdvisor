Excellent location, tasteful, nice sized room in a hip hotel with a swell restaurant. I had business in town, so my husband and I stayed over the weekend and enjoyed Seattle. We were able to walk just about everywhere in town from the hotel. Lola Restaurant downstairs was eclectic, fun and delicious! Bar scene off of lobby seemed very happening. Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery and Serious Pies are right across the street. Best coconut cream pies and donuts ever. Our only complaint was the size of the bathroom, too small for two people, so getting ready in the morning took a little longer. The closet was huge though and the flat screen TV was nice. The bed was crazy comfortable. Watch out for the bottled air in the bathroom, you will be charged about $60 if the wrapper is removed! Not a place for little ones.

We were there for a convention in Feb. But I was there to scope out places for our family to visit when we make a 4 generation trip in May. This hotel is close to everything! Easy to walk, to catch the monorail, to walk to Pike Street Market and the waterfront. Took a cabback up the hill. The restaurant was very good, nice menu for both breakfast and late snacks. Had partial view of waterfornt, and the view from the fitness center and pool of the Cascades was awesome. Enjoyed our stay very much.

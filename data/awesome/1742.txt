We arrived early and although the desk clerk tried to find us a room, there were none available so they gladly held our luggage and when we returned just an hour later, our room was ready. The service people were all so very nice, especially James! so friendly, cheerful and helpful. Our room was clean and very nice. The hotel is in a perfect location, short walking distance of all the tourist spots in the downtown area. We will definitely stay here again.

We stayed here for four nights prior to a cruise from Seattle. We had booked only an ordinary room, but we were given a corner water-view room just above the "Public Market" sign at Pike Place Market. The location is fantastic with the market and all the restaurants nearby. We enjoyed several lunches of delicacies from the market while sitting on the roof terrace of the hotel and overlooking the bay. Just a block or so away is a large Macy's Department Store and the tram to the Space Needle. Some cruise ships dock just below the market and Inn, but Holland America docks a short taxi ride away. The staff is wonderful; when a tour company the concierge recommended overcharged us for a tour, the overcharge was deducted from our hotel bill. This is the perfect hotel in the perfect location. What else can I say?

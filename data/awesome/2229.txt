We stayed at the Sorrento for 2 nights in mid-November of this year. We had a room with a king sized bed that smelled very clean. The bathroom is smaller but very classy and clean. Besides, how much time are you spending in there anyway. The bed was super comfortable with nice bedding. We used the free wifi quite a bit to research restaurants - it was nice and fast. All the staff was very helpful and friendly. One of them recommended a great, family run Indian restaurant in Capitol Hill and another offered to return a hotel key we accidently took from our previous hotel in Queen Ann on his way home. There is only one small elevator but it never was a problem even though the hotel was full. We used the courtesy car a couple of times but mostly walked everywhere, even at night. Yes, the hotel is on a hill but all of Seattle is on some hill or another. If you are an active person walking to and from the hotel should be no problem. We also utilized the light rail to get to and from the airport and used the public buses. We took in some of the live jazz music in the lounge over a few cocktails. Keep in mind those cocktails don't come cheap. The lounge area had a nice fire going and is a beautiful, old, wood paneled room. Over all a great experience. If you are looking for a cool, older hotel that has been lovingly maintained over the years this is your place. We would definitely stay here again.

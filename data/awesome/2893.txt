The best W we know! The Front desk staff was so helpful and caring especially the manager. I broke my ankle while in town and they were so amazingly helpful and accommodating! Normally, W's kind of fell like a night club, you have to look the look or they'll shrug you off. This W still looked like the night club, but the acted like the St. Regis. Thank you!! The rooms were very nice and had great views of the city. Surely the best value for your dollar in town.

From the moment we arrived at Secrets for our honeymoon, to the moment we walked out the doors and got into the taxi to head home the employees at this resort bent over backwards to serve our needs. Whether you wanted room service (which is free) anytime of the day, pool side orderves, or for them to cook you something special at the buffet they would do everything with a smile. This was by far the best serivce we have ever seen at a resort. Everything was top notch including the rooms, pools, and beach. The weather in July was very hot, but having so much to water it was easy to stay cool. We would definately go back.

We arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon. We got a very nice room. It was very clean (which i find very important) and the kitchen gave it a more homey feeling. The room was a very good size. The bathroom was well-equipped and had everything you can think of. The staff was friendly and switched over to English when needed. There are a few good restaurants across the street and it's just a little walk to the big shopping area. There is also a metro-station very close by. I have nothing bad to say about our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to my friends. It was great! We ordered food from the restaurant a few times and that was good too. The breakfast is not complementary but they do have a restaurant where you can use your breakfast without leaving the hotel. You can also bring stuff to the room and have your breakfast there, there are plates and cutlery in the room. Again, nothing but good things about this place!

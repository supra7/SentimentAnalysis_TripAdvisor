i first stayed @ the warwick last winter. it felt like i was living there as i was in and out constantly while dealing w/ the deaths of my parents. i always received good service. one evening i thought to put my i book in the room safe. when i came very late after a night out, i couldn't open the safe. no one on site could either due to the lateness of the hour. as i had an early flight, they called someone to come back in and moved me to a different room so i would not be disturbed. on another visit my balcony door jammed; i was eventually moved and the manager of the shift bought me breakfast for my inconvenience. as a non smoker, i wasn't even aware the hotel had a smoking floor. i never thought to request non smoking, but fortunately i was never placed in a smoking room. the rooms i have been in are always clean and comfortable. i always choose the south (parkade) side of the hotel as i am a light sleeper and prefer to be away from the street. i have never been given a room below the top of the parkade. stafff both at the front desk and on the telephone are always friendly and helpful. for travellers, the hotel is a few minutes walk from the light rail, a 15 minute walk from the victoria clipper and under 25 minute walk from south lake union where the float plane departs for victoria and the san juan islands. the neighbourhood is full of shoping and dining opportunities and walking distance to most downtown attractions. my stay this weekend was great

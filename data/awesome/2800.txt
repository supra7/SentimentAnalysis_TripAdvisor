PROS: 1. Free wine hour every night 5-6PM in lobby by fireplace. They feature different Washington wineries. 2. Free coffee service in morning in lobby, with good coffee. 3. If you drive a hybred car like we do, they waive the parking fee as a reward for being "green." Nice surprise. Very secure. 4. Location is excellent and walking distance of shopping, restaurants, Pike's Market etc. 5. Restaurant at hotel (although we didn't eat there). 6. Lounge at hotel with friendly waiter. 7. Excellent service. They obviously focus on this during training, as everyone was more than helpful and extremely friendly. 8. Robes in room for use. 9. Turn down service with chocolate, upon request. 10. Free internet hookup in rooms if you have a laptop. 11. When we were there, they were in the process of replacing all the mattresses in the rooms...will be nice for future guests. 12. Concier service helpful. 13. We got room on hotwire as 4 star boutique hotel for $110 a night. CONS: 1. $30 parking (although free if drive hybred and lot secure; also other parking garages nearby or free street parking after 6PM). 2. Have to bring your laptop as they don't have a computer or business center for you to use. We loved this hotel and will stay there again if in Seattle. The best thing about it was the service. Everyone there made us feel welcomed, always greeted us with a smile, and expressed it was their pleasure to help us.

Stayed at Hotel Max this past weekend. The hotel is very nice. Other reviews I read mentioned that the room size was small. Our room was on the small size but well laid out. Rooms are nicely decorated and the bed is super comfortable with great sheets and pillows. Slept like a baby! The location is superb. We parked the car all weekend and walked to shops, restaurants, cafes and Pike Place Market. I would definitely stay at Hotel Max again.

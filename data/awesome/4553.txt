Secrets Maroma Beach was absolutely wonderful. Not only would we go back in a heartbeat, but we wanted to extend our stay. The staff is beyond helpful. Barbara at Concierge was the absolute best - she took such great care of us. The food is great, the drinks are great, and there are plenty of options with 7 restaurants on site. We were there for a wedding and it was all put together beautifully. The pools are kept immaculate as is the beach area. There are plenty of activities to keep you occupied - you never feel like you need to leave the resort for excursions. The entertainment staff is very good as well. For an all-inclusive this fair exceeded my expectations. I wouldnt have changed a thing (except the length of our stay! - 5 days just wasnt enough)

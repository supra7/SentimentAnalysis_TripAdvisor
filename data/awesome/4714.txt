Upon arriving at the resort we were greeted with "Welcome Home" and traveling with a group of 200, they made each and everyone of us feel welcomed, OUTSTANDING & FRIENDLY service and the food was EXCEPTIONAL. My husband was unable to attend with me, but I do hope to visit again for him to experience Paradise at Secrets Maroma. I would highly recommend this location, we all had a FANTASTIC TIME!! This resort has set a new high standard and I don't believe we will be able to find another resort as exceptional as this one. Thank you Secrets Maroma!! <3

Loved my stay at The Monaco in Seattle. I traveled for business, but I also had my kids and my family with me. Walking distance to Pike's place and to the monorail that takes you to the Space needle center. Also walking distance to the aquarium. So I was able to do all three things in a weekend with a 3 and a 6 year old. Friendly staff. Nice rooms. Nice restaurant. Safe area. Very enjoyable. Will definitely come back.

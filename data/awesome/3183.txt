When you need a hotel near the Sea Tac Airport, stay at the Doubletree and ride their shuttle. The Drivers are very professional, courteous and make you feel like you are their only customer! If something might goes awry, the staff are quick to correct and aim to provide a memorable stay that makes you want to return. The quality of customer service should be an inservice for a number of their competitors. We have stayed at Hotels that are many times more expensive yet the staff are nowhere near as impressive as the Doubletree. The Wynn in Las Vegas should sign up for tutoring to learn how to treat customers. Perhaps then their vacancy rate would dwindle!

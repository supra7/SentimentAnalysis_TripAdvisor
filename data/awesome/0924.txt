The first impression of this hotel is great with old charm in an inviting lobby. The gal at the desk, Abby was great. She was friendly, full of suggestions, and more than happy to help with anything we needed, offered plenty of eating suggestions. The rooms were absolutely adorable, small studios converted into hotel rooms. Great space, beautiful nook with a bench in the kitchen, a small sitting area, and a spacious room. You really can't get any better. The service was great throughout my three night stay. No complaints and I am eager to come stay again and enjoy the neighborhood and the service.

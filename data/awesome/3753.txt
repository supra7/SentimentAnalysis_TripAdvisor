We are on our third day at Secrets and it couldn't get much better. The food and service are fabulous. Everything is first class at this resort. We stayed at El Dorado Maroma last year which is right down the beach. El Dorado is perfect if you prefer a smaller resort but if you prefer something a little bigger, Secrets is the way to go. We lounged at the beach yesterday which was great but we decided to try the pool today and that was fabulous too. The pool water felt like bath water which is a major plus for me. The beach is beautiful but It has been a bit windy the last couple of days for swimming. I have no complaints! Perfect!

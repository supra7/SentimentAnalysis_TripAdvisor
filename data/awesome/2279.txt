This Hotel is classy without being stuffy. The rooms had all necessary amenities for a very comfortable stay, free wi-fi is a great help for getting work done & exploring the city, & the beds were unbelievably comfortable. I got 2 amazing nights of sleep and even wanted to take the bed home with me, but my suitcase was way too small :) The staff were all friendly & helpful even though we arrived at 1am, and very welcoming to our dog. We loved that you could open the windows for some fresh August air. This is a true piece of Seattle history, my mother ate prime rib at the restaurant here on her 21st birthday, 37 years ago, the best in town she said. We are so glad it is still here & seems well kept. We will definitely be back.

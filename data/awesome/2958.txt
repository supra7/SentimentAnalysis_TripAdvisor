If you're traveling with a large family, a pampered partner, or someone with a LOT of luggage, then the Hotel Max is not for you. But, if you're a couple on the go with a sense of fun and adventure, or a single business traveler, then you should NO DOUBT stay at Hotel Max. Small, contemporary rooms with very comfy beds, nice t.v.'s and everything you need to be comfortable (except space). A very artsy-feel with an urban/contemporary vibe,it's not your run-of-the-mill hotel experience. It's also one of the most affordable options in the area.

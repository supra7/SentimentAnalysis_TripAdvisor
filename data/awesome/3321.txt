We came through Seattle on our way to Maui and stayed at the Fairfield Inn. It was is always clean, close to the airport, and it was free as we had cashed in reward points. The rooms were comfortable and nicely appointed with a small refrigerator, microwave oven, and other small items. The breakfast spread that they serve every morning in the dining room can't be beat. It comes with your nightly stay and was very good. We were given 4 bottled waters and we checked out. All I ask is a clean, safe, comfortable place to rest my head, and the Fairfield Inn always comes through

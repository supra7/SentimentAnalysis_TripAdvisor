The room had a separate seating area with a partial wall, more like a junior suite. Flat screen TV could swivel to view from either the sofa or the bed. Nice decor and friendly staff. Convenient location across from Westlake Center. Bathroom is small but first rate amenities. Bathrobes and slippers provided. Our only issue was resolved promptly. Construction on the sidewalk in front of the hotel was only a small inconvenience.

Secrets at Maroma beach is by far the best the Mayan Riviera has to offer for a romantic honeymoon! IWe enjoyed 2 weeks of impeccable service, delightful gourmet food of many varieties, and no attention to detail spared in our accomodations or service. Maroma Beach is amazing and Secrets is also the last hotel neighboring a vast private jungle and it is more intimate than any other between Cancun and Playa delCarmen. All-inclusive, the food and beverages were pletiful and readily available at all times which made us feel completely spoiled! The property is really well maintained, activities abundant and the spa facilities and treatments were truly pampering in every way. We have already planned to return for our first anniversary!

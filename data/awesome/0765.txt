After much researching of hotel properties for our four-night stay in Seattle after a cruise to Alaska, I chose the IATM. It couldn't have been more perfect for our stay. It was "right AT the market", close to all restaurants, shops, coffee shops etc. The room was quite small but staff accomodated our request for a high floor (8th). Clean and well maintained and the personnel were efficient and very polite. Repaired a "running toilet" within a very short time, after complaint. Deck on 5th floor overlooking Elliott Bay is a plus, to be outdoors and relaxing with a view in a large city is a nice touch. My concern was coming from sunny Florida, I planned for four rainy days in Seattle and wanted to be within proximity to everything, which we were. Were very lucky with sunshine most of the time. Hotel was great. Would be our choice next time!!!

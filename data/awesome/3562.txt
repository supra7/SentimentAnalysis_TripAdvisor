This hotel is one of the best EVER! My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in May and it was the best experience ever. The staff was very nice and very attentive. Our every questions and every concern was addressed. The rooms are great. We were upgraded from the urban suite to the Superior suite without even asking. The bathroom was huge, with a large shower and jack/jill sinks. It was great to have the separate living and bedroom area. Speaking of the bedroom, the bed was better than the Ritz of any other place we ever stayed. It's a pillow top mattress with very soft sheets and great pillows. The Jacuzzi on the deck and the indoor pool are great places to relax before dinner after all the sightseeing and walking around. It is a very expensive hotel, but we got a great deal through Hotwire. The hotel is located on the English speaking side, walking distance to the Old Towne, the Basilica, the underground malls, bars and clubs. There is a great Irish bar across the street, The Old Orchid. If you are in the mood for an authentic French meal, Chez La Mre Michel, is a great restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. It's our family owned restaurant and our waiter, Marc, has worked there for years. Don't go to Globe restaurant regardless of what anyone tells you. The service is the worst you'll ever get, not worth the atmosphere or the money. If you go to Montreal, Hotel Le Crystal is a must!!!

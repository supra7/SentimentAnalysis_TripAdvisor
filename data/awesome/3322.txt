Look no further. This place is awesome! It looks and feels like a mini-yosemite-mountain lodge, not even a hotel. The atrium with pool, lounges, chairs, trees, etc. feels like you are outdoors, but it's nice and warm because it's not open to the air. Wish I'd had my bathing suit with me. Food and service were exceptional. The staff is amazingly warm, friendly and helpful, possibly because they know that customers may be stressed about flying in and out of town, so they go the extra mile at the front desk and the restaurant. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to everyone. AND....IT GIVES YOU FREE INTERNET IN A LOUNGE WITH 3 COMPUTERS+ ANOTHER SPECIAL COMUTER TO JUST PRINT YOUR BOARDING PASS + A MONITOR THAT SHOWS DEPARTURE TIMES JUST LIKE AT AN AIRPORT! As I said, look no further. One suggestion: ask for a room far away from the elevator (which could be quite a hike) if you have an early flight and need as much quiet a possible. It's a natural event that people exiting an elevator make some noise, and we realized this too late. I take responsibility for that.)

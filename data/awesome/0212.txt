5 old friends from university meet every year taking turns between eastern North America and the west. We have stayed in Vancouver, San Francisco and now Seattle in the west. Our accommodation in Seattle and the general ambiance of the Hotel Monaco was the best yet. We had 2 great rooms with both a king bed and curtained alcove with a hide a bed and a meeting room in between with a chesterfield/hideabed. The whole package was ideal for hanging out with friends. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Love the wine hour and Sazerac, the restaurant's Happy Hour. This is an incredible hotel. Everyone at the hotel ensured that our visit was customized to our individual, unique needs in order to provide the best possible guest experience. I highly recommend this hotel for any occasion as they will take care of you and your party as though you are the only guests on site.

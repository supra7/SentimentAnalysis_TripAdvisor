My family and I are just back from a wonderful 2 night stay at this hotel and we had a fantastic time, so much so i am posting my first ever internet message. W you not only spoiled us above and beyond inadvertently you have moved me into the 21st century as well . The staff are very helpfull especially Brian Bunich who could not do enough for us . Working mums have a hard enough time so seeing my wife being spoiled in the very chic surrounds of the W made our short break all the more special . Guys you get it right keep up the good work , thanks so much we will be back i can assure you , Working Mums go on treat your self's you deserve it .

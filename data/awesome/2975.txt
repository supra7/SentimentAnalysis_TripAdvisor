I came up to Seattle for the weekend with a few friends. We stayed at the Hotel Max because it is close to all the attractions and was recommended by a friend. I am glad we did. The Hotel staff was helpful and always smiling (except our bellman who didn't even wait for a tip). The decorations were fun and individual (different picture on every room door). The room was on the smaller side but still had plenty of space. The bathroom was a bit small, but I understand it's a historic hotel and you have to work with what you have. I even ordered a pillow off the pillow menu. Overall it was a great trip everything in walking distance and watched a movie to put myself to sleep.

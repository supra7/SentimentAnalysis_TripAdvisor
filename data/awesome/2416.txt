I was attending a conference and I stayed at the Westin for a week. I was on the 34th floor & the view is just amazing. Luxurious rooms, with very comfortable beds & a full mini bar. The surrounding of the hotel is pretty good. Lots of eating & shoppig options. The conference centre was very near to my hotel, so I used to walk, and it was fun. The staff was very courteous. However, if you are one of the floor at a higher level as I was, then beware, you hear crackling sounds or rather creeking sounds. There is nothing to worry, its the way they build the high rises, that it moves due to heavy winds & it is just a proof of a good healthy stucture. The hotel was kind to give the guests checking in with a letter explaining the creeking sound.

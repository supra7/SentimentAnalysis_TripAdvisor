Across from Airport, free shuttle every 20 minutes. The most polite and helpful staff I've EVER encountered as a whole. Very clean. Short 10 min walk to light rail system to downtown. Nice lounge and really decent food. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The rooms in the back overlooking the lake are the quietest; they graciously moved me after my request. There is a bit of noise from airport/street if you are in the towers facing the street so I moved. But they hauled all my things for me. Large property and walk can be long to the rooms but bell staff is very efficient. Pool was heated; hot tub nice and hot and everything was great. Nicely decorated especially at Christmas. The room rate was excellent buy rather than staying downtown and the light train system is so easy to use it's a bargain.

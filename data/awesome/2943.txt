We recently stayed at this hotel and for the price point, the place is fabulous! Rooms are around $100 a night, and have a cool and artsy modern European feel to them. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are even small, but again, reminds me of staying in a European hotel. VERY clean with modern and artsy colors and a flat screen TV. The feel of being in a museum is everywhere, right down to the photographs of European landmarks that cover the entrance to every guestroom. Aveda products provided in the guestrooms. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I just could not believe what a great hotel this was for how inexpensive in downtown Seattle. I will definitely be back. I just hope they don't catch on to how great they are and raise the prices :-) My only advice would be to NOT stay here, if you are wanting to soak in a big tub at night or if a swimming pool is essential. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong here. Oh, and go around the corner to Barollo for a great glass of wine and appetizers!

My husband and I had a New Year's Eve wedding to attend, as well as our anniversary to celebrate. We spent 2 nights at Hotel Andra, and made a fun weekend of it. The hotel is beautiful in every way, the most comfortable beds, and the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. The location was perfect - we walked everywhere, and only took our car out to go to the wedding. Lots of great shopping and restaurants very nearby. We will definitely think of Hotel Andra the next time we want to stay in the city. Awesome!

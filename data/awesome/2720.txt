I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years but this is now my favorite! My granddaughter, her friend and I stayed there for several days and I have absolutely no complaint. The staff is amazing...from Rocket on! They were always so willing to help with anything we needed and took very good care of us...from the ladies behind the counter to the bellmen to the coffee ladies in the morning. We felt so at home. It was wonderful. Highly recommend! Thanks to all of you!

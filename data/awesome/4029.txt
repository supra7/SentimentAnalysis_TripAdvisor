My husband and I went for our honeymoon June 28  July 5. We LOVED Secrets Maroma Beach! I have been home for a month now and still think about our trip daily. Its really hard for me to believe that people would complain about anything at this resort. We have been to other all-inclusive and thought they were great, but this place was top notch, 5 star. Food, drinks and service were all amazing. I am a picky about everything and this place exceeded my expectations. 3 couples that we are friends with went last year for their honeymoon and loved it so we decided to try it too and we were not disappointed.

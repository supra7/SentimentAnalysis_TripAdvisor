Beautifully decorated, chic hotel. Yes, the rooms are small -- especially the toilet room and closet space -- but certainly adequate. Room was quiet. Took us a while to figure out the heating/cooling system. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Staff friendly but not effusive. (I think they were a bit stressed the day we checked out.) Order your car from valet parking well in advance of needing it. Would definitely stay there again. Walking distance to everything we wanted.

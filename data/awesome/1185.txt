The Mayflower Park was a great place to stay. It is 82 years old and the room are a bit smaller to match but definitely fine for a solo traveler. The service was impeccable. The location is great - four blocks from Pike Street Market, two from the Convention Center and right next to Macy's and Nordstroms if you are a shopper. The monorail connects right there if you want to go to the EMP or Space Needle. There are lots of other transit options right outside your door. Great stay - would stay again.

I stayed at the Mayflower during a conference in March. I got conference rates, which were not extremely inexpensive, but also not full rates. Overall my experience was positive. The location is very good... it's attached to a shopping mall that also houses a station of the Seattle Monorail -- I didn't ride the Monorail, but it was extremely convenient because you can get into the mall and to the station all indoors, by going through a back hallway of the hotel. However, I mostly walked everywhere, because the hotel was at the most just a few blocks from everywhere I wanted to go. Although the decor in the room was a little dated, it was not what I would call shabby -- and the room was kept very clean. And I loved the botanical art on the walls of the room (that type of art is one of my favorites). So many hotels have very unremarkable art hanging in the rooms -- this was a step above the usual, in my opinion. Some people don't care much about art, though, so take that comment with a grain of salt if you are that type. The service in this hotel was excellent. I stayed 4 nights and rarely had to call for anything, but when I did my concerns were addressed promptly. This hotel is not part of a chain. It has been locally owned for over 30 years. That is fairly rare in most urban hotels these days. My room was not noisy at all. I could never hear much from the neighboring rooms, even though I knew there was somebody in there. And I could not hear traffic noise at all. I would stay here again.

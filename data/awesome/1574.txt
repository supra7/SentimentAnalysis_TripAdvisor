I had been a little hesitant to stay there as I had noticed how large it was and thought we might get lost. I'm so glad that I changed my mined and booked the room. The hotel was centrally located and the hotel staff were just awesome. The people at the Concierce Desk were so friendly and so helpful and every restaurant they booked us at was just more and more incredible! The rooms were beautiful and very modern and had a very lovely view of the city. We could not have asked for a more wonderful hotel......................

I surprised my husband with a one night stay in the "Beatles Suite". This suite was made famous in 1964 when the Beatles stayed there and fished out their window. We loved the comfy room with all the photos, books and a Beatles CD to play. We live in the area, but really felt like we were on a vacation with the awesome view, service and fabulous meals in the restaurant. We will go there again, but may not spring for the Beatles Suite because it's expensive and a special occasion splurge.

We have just stayed four nights at The Inn at the Market hotel in Seattle and can do nothing but highly recommend it to other travellers. We had a partial water view room that overlooked the patio area and water, which we booked via the Internet. The room was large, spotlessly clean as was the bathroom and the hotel generally. Any question or request made to the hotel reception staff was dealt with efficiently and all in a warm and friendly manner. The hotel is located just metres away from the Pike Market and Aquarium, and the water front activities in general. Being an avid tea drinker I find that you can not make tea in a coffee pot and when I requested a kettle it was delivered virtually before I hung up the phone. Guests are invited to use the patio area, and to even take snacks, food and drink up to the patio. The hotel uses Bacco Restaraunt for breakfast in room service, which we did not use as in room service, but we did have breakfast there on our last day and it was very good value for money and excellent food. If/when we return to Seattle we will definitely be staying at Inn at the Market.

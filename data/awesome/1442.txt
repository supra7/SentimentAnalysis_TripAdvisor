I had a corner King room, it had two tvs, lots of closet space and a very nice bathroom. Great night sleep. The leased out restaurant in the lobby is excellent as is the bar , The Japanese restaurant in the hotel has the conveyer style sushi delivery system, great food and if you are in a rush it is great also.

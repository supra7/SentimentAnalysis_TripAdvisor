We had booked the hotel both on our way out of the country and returning as a stopover to and from our home on the East Coast. So, when our plane was cancelled in Shanghai and we missed a connection, we had to stay 2 extra nights in Beijing at a not so good hotel. I was able to both call and email the Radisson about our change of plans and no problem, they promided to find another room for us. The staff was helpful and considerate and when we finally arrived 2 days later, the staff were extremely helpful and gave a us a great room. As previously mentioned, we had stayed one night on our way out, and it was very good, but I must say that the staff went out of their way to help us and make sure we were comfortable on our return. The breakfast is also excellent as is the bar and the bar and restaurant staff are very attentive. Excellent service all around. Fine management and staff that is very service oriented.

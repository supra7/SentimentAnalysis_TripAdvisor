During a six day business trip during which a group of eight stayed at the Seattle Renaissance I was completely impressed with the hotel, the room, the food, the service and the whole experience. The room was modern, clean and focused. My room had a nice view of a piece of Seattle (not a panorama -- but a great feeling of being in the city). All eight people on the trip statedpositive comments about their hotel room. A open-area (not walled in but flowed around a corner) restaurant on the lobby area served amazing food -- or you can stop for drinks or good wine. The same area is used in the morning by people for coffee, reading the newspaper or computer time. Very inviting. Service was perfect every time. A favorite small detail of myself and many of my co-workers was a very large table in the lobby/restaurant area at which one could pull up to a piece of it and use as desk or for computer. People would be sitting at different parts of it that did not know each other. Comfortable. I once worked there for about three hours and it was pleasant not being stuck in a room working. The staff were consistently very helpful and very nice. The hotel is walking distance (15 minutes at least) to the famous Pier area and shopping, restaurants, and other attractions. I will stay at this hotel again when I return on business. A general observation -- I have had many consistent and positive experiences at Renaissance hotels in the past two years -- especially in service and food. Our favorite part

Recently stayed at the Sheraton Seattle on a business trip. The hotel is very well situated and a great property. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable as is the lobby area - bright airy - lots of room. But the overwhelming vibe you get from this hotel comes from the staff. They were amazing. From check in to concierge to the valet folks they were friendly, helpful, knowldegable and fun. You can't ask for more and most often get much less as a business traveller. Highly recommended

Ok....so just got back yesterday from our second trip to Secrets Maroma Beach and the second was better than the first!!!!! Our first trip was shortly after the resort opened and things were great but still not what it now offers. The food was great!!!! The service was exceptional. An added to the pool service is they now bring around trays with INCREDIBLE munchies for the guests...the poolside grill has great selections for poolside snacks. Not only hamburgers and hotdogs but grilled fish and fajitas for fish tacos, grilled veggies and the most incredible homemade chips and guacamole you will ever want for. This is not to negate in ANY way what you can also order poolside (I love this all inclusive property!!!) I have a attached a couple pics of a couple dishes we ordered poolside....amazing seafood!!!! I could go on and on....but will stop. This all coming from someone who is not on their first go around....we are well traveled and work in the travel industry, so this review is not from a travel newbie....If you have any questions just ask!!! Above all enjoy your stay at the awesome property!!! :-)

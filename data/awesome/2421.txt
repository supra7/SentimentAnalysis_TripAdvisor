I had read some bad reviews of this hotel before I left for my trip and I was worried, but I was pleasantly surprised. We had wonderful service from the bell station that greeted us to the person checking us in. The staff directed us to a great sports bar, (The Fox), to watch the Final Four. We had a wonderful view from the 36th floor and a very clean and spacious room. I walked to Pikes Street Market in the afternoon. It was also close to Nordstrom and Macys for shopping. I would go back here again. I was lucky to get a great price on Priceline, so the value was wonderful. I don't usually use Priceline but we just needed a one night stay in Seattle on our way home and I was lucky to land here.

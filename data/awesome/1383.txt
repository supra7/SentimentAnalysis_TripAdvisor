I was able to secure three rooms at this hotel via Priceline.com for about $100 ea. on a Thursday night. For a full service hotel in downtown Seattle I thought this was an excellent bargain. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The location is convenient and and easy walk to many attractions, museums and restaurants. I personally had a room on the 8th floor and thought that there was a bit too much road noise coming from the street. If I ever go back, I will ask for a higher floor. The bar on the 28th floor has an amazing view on a clear night. You don't want to miss it!

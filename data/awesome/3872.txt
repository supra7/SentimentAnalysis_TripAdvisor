We went to Secrets Maroma Beach for our Honeymoon and had a wonderful time. The staff there is willing to do anything to please you and everyone is very friendly. We had a few days of bad weather but there was still plenty to do. We used the spa, saw the shows, used the pool & beach as much as we could. All were great and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it at all times. We took advantage of the 24 hour room service a few times and it was always there in less than 30 minutes (even on the rainy days when I thought they would be overwhelmed with requests). The restaurants are also very nice and offer a wide variety. We were always seated immediately and the service was great. Our room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. I slept great while I was there. My only complaints were that we had someone in the room above ours (we were on the third floor) and it sounded like a herd of elephants were above us. We didn't say anything because they got there towards the end of our stay but if I had to deal with that the whole week I would have been more bothered by it. We also had a junior suite- ocean view. We could see the ocean but it was pretty far from our room. Still a pretty view but definitely thought we would see more of it from our balcony however we were not on the balcony enough for this to bother us either. Overall, this was the best vacation of my life and I would go back tomorrow if I could.

From the moment you step into the lobby, you realize that this is not a "typical" hotel, rather more of a boutique hotel feel, bold colors, and lot's of art. We took advice of other travelers and requested a room on the 9th floor in a corner, no corners were available but the gal at the front desk found a suitable room instead. We ended up in a queen room which was very tiny, but it had everything we needed. The pillow menu was an added bonus! We were too late when we returned from our evening on the town to order sushi from next door but ordered in from Pizza Mart, and had great food in a matter of minutes delivered to our door! The next morning we headed out to breakfast and the Pacific Place mall prior to checking out so close!! When valet went to get our vehicle the battery had died (been having issues with that) the valet person was so kind and got us up and running in no time!! We'll stay here again for sure! Thanks Hotel Max staff for the fun place to stay!!

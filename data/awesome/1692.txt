We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton since it was the HQ hotel for our convention. It was so convenient to the WA Convention Center where our meetings were. We walked everywhere since the location is so convenient to shopping, Pike Place Market & restaurants. Even though the hotel was sold out for the meetings, we were able to check in early. We had a room on the top floor (for Sheraton Preferred Guests) of the new Union Tower which had a fair view between other buildings. Because we are SPG members, water was complimentary & we were greeted with a bottle of sparkling wine & a box of Dilletante's chocolates. More important to me was the quiet room, comfortable Sheraton Sleeper bed, clean, shiny bathroom, thick towels and quality sheets. However, the room was not very big & barely had enough storage space for clothes for two people. We were told the pool would be closed, but I used the adequate work out facility in the Union Tower. We parked our car using the valet service and had excellent service w/the bellman & valet. We did not eat at the restaurant, but did go to the bar and we found it strange that on a weekend night, when the hotel is sold out that last call was at midnight. We would stay there again.

Super trendy hotel in a great location for walking everywhere. Yes the room was super small (we were in 408) BUT how much room do you need when you are either out and about or in bed. Loved the Aveda amenities and the bed was comfy. The bar is cool. The door and bell staff were friendly but the front desk could warm up a bit... Not that they were not friendly just more neutral. This is my new Seattle go-to hotel for sure.

Great overall experience...especially the restaurant (Tulio) in the hotel! We booked a great rate (around $150/night) that also included $20/day in restaurant vouchers, and the food was so good that we ate breakfast there 3 days and dinner there once. I love Kimpton hotels for their cleanliness, service, decor, and small/mid-size hotel feel. We arrived after midnight and were assigned a street-level room the first night, which I would avoid in the future due to street noise. However, the front desk reassigned us to an 11th floor room for the remainder of our stay and moved our bags for us while we were out. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk made some great sightseeing recommendations and suggested how we might avoid some overpriced tourist traps (skip the space needle/free observation deck elsewhere). This hotel is withing walking distance of everything and conveniently located. The staff/service was great, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Free internet for InTouch members, and you also get $10 minibar credit per stay.

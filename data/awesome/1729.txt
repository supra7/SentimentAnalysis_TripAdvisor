I booked this hotel off of priceline so I received a really good rate and of course didn't know before i booked that I would get this hotel. I was very happy when i arrived at the Sheraton. Excellent location. The perfect large urban hotel. I had a room on a high floor with a great view. The room was clean and comfortable if on the small side. But that was ok. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft. The pool and gym on the top floor of the hotel have panoramic views of the city. A perfect place to stay if you are in the city for the weekend. There was high speed internet which was $9 a day which was reasonable in my book. I wish I could have stayed longer. Highly recommend

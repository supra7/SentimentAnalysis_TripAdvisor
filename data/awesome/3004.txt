I loved this hotel! Yes the rooms are small but as I was travelling alone it wasn't a problem for me. The hotel rooms are really nicely decorated, and I loved all the artwork on the hotel room doors, all individual. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in, I usually have difficulty sleeping in unfamiliar hotel rooms but I slept incredibly well here, so much so that I came back to this hotel after a 2-week trip to Canada. I should have been staying elsewhere in the city on my return to Seattle but decided to return here knowing how comfortable and clean it was. The staff were very friendly and helpful with any enquiries that I had and the location was excellent - great for exploring the centre of Seattle. I didn't eat in the restaurant next door but had a couple of drinks at the bar chatting to a couple of locals which was nice! I would have no hesitation staing here again.

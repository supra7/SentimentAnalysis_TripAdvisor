Sixth Avenue Inn is centrally located at Seattle's Downtown, close to restaurants, Space Needles, Pike Market and stores yet it is pretty quite. It was particularly helpful for us, Canadian Christmas shoppers, since we didn't drive. The room was nicely appointed, the frontdesk staffs were very friendly and helpful. We had a minor problem with our room door and the evening receptionist handled it quickly and professionally. We would recommend this hotel for its great value and location!

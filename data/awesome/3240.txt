I was here for another business meeting. We used the meeting facilities and team and WOW is all I can say. A very attentive team. Our every need was met before we even asked for it. The catering staff, banquet sales staff, A/V team, set up and banquet management were all 100 percent superb. The meeting rooms are very large and comfortable. The A/V equipment is up to date and work great. The food is really good and the catering and banquet team are nothing but hard working and smiles. I strongly advise this space for anyone looking to have a large event or conference. The sleeping rooms were very spacious and comfortable. The beds are soft, but not too soft and the linens are warm and cozy. I loved all of the amenities in my room. Fluffy towels, nice shower head, beautiful balcony that was almost larger than my apartment in New York!! All of the food was really nice. Service was always with a smile and always on time. Everything I tried, I really enjoyed. The eggs benedict was BEST!! Front desk staff was very nice. A warm welcome check in coupled with a yummy warm cookie. Can't beat it. All and all, this is a really great place for a stay or for an event, or both. It is very close to the airport, not to far from downtown Seattle, and just a great place to be.

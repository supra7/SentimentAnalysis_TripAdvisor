We have stayed at the Seattle Airport Marriott many times over the years. However, this most recent stay was our first time in quite a bit. We decided to return because the indoor tropical is fantastic and still is!! Rooms are very nice (a little small but great beds and workable), staff was very helpful and we loved the new lobby! Breakfast was fantastic and parking was easy. Close to the airport and easy access to get downtown. We were very impressed yet again, and we plan on returning!

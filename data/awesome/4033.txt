My wife and I went back to this resort recently with two other couples (we went last summer also). This is an incredible resort in all regards; the food and wine selection is the best for any all-inclusive resort we've been to, the grounds are lush and well manicured, the rooms extravagant, the size of the resort is large enough to have plenty of dining and entertainment options but not too big to feel lost or have difficulty getting places, the beach amazing and the quality and attentiveness of the staff is impressive. We have been to many of the most highly rated all-inclusive resorts in the Mayan Riviera, and this is our favorite, truly hitting on all cylinders. The only trouble we had was with the air conditioning in our rooms and in the fitness center, we were never able to get the room temp down the the frigid 68 degrees we prefer to sleep at. That being said, we managed at 73 or 74 while we slept by just sleeping under the sheets. I feel petty remarking about this, but I guess that everything else was so impressive that anything falling short of perfection catches our attention! I would also recommend the Preferred Club and swim-up rooms. Being able to slip into your own pool outside your room is really cool and enjoyable both in the morning and before bed, and the Preferred Club is a great segway into your next stop. We like to drink and have fun with our friends; the club was a cool place to hang and get appetizers at will. Also, the bartenders serve plenty of almost any top-shelf liquor you want! Ask for the wine sommelier Guadalupe. He's really a cool guy and has an amazing knowledge of wines around the world and will gladly find the best bottle for your price point. Also, if you buy enough good wine you can request a meal in the wine cellar in Bordeaux's!

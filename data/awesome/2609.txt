Me and my brother went to Seattle to catch the LSU / Washington game. Seattle is a great town.....clean, nice people, good food, modern, low crime, educated and friendly people. Only thing i can complain about is the rainy and cool weather. Getting around town is easy, public transportation is good, walking is also easy to do. Good local restaurants everywhere. Space Needle is worth the visit, as is a trip to Mt. Rainier and the waterfront. The hotel was great, good location, clean, good TV, free internet, continental breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. I recommend it and would definitely stay there again.

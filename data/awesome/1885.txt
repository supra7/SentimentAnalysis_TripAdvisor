We arrived in Seattle and were lucky enough to secure a room at the Hotel Andra. This is the second time we have stayed here and as before, it is an oasis in bustling Seattle. The room/suite was clean and very quiet, we had a great view of the city. Everyone from the valet to the housekeeper made us feel welcome and at home. They offered complimentary coffee/tea service in the afternoon and a turn down service at night. The restaurant, Lola is downstairs and open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Hotel Andra is 2 blocks away from the light rail that takes you to SeaTac airport for just $2.50 per person! The area is safe and a short stroll from Pike's Place Market. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and plan to do so again soon.

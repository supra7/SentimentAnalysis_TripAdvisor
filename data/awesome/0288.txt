Stayed on business for only one night, but will return. It is not often that you find an establishment that truly cares about the quality of the guest experience, but the Warwick does. Great location within easy walking distance of the waterfront, a team of caring professionals and elegant furnishings. Reviewers who say "a bit old" are missing the point - it's called "character" and this place has it. Killer views as well.

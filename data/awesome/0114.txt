This hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle. Room decor certainly has a WOW factor. Best description is eclectic sophistication. Room was comfortable, clean and very quiet. Check-in person was very friendly and courteous. Complementary wine hour was an unexpected bonus. After answering the hotel's e-mail survey (post departure), I made a minor comment and was surprised to receive a personal reply from the regional director of operations. Says a lot.....so I will return to the Hotel Monaco again. We live 2 hrs from Seattle and spend the night there at least once per month. By far, one of my favorite experiences to date.

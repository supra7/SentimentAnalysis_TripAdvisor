We stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 5 nights. Our room was located on the 17th floor with 2 beds. It was quite roomy and comfortable.I was a little weary before arriving after reading previous comments on this page. However, I did not not encounter any of the problems that were mentioned here. The Crowne Plaza is a great hotel with very courteous, well- informed staff. Our room was very clean and in excellent condition. We also had a fairly decent view, however had we been about 10 more floors up it would have been even better. Also , the location of this hotel is excellent for doing all sorts of downtown activities. I highly recommend this hotel.

Very cool, sleek Seattle hotel. This hotel was easy to find after exiting I-5. When you arrive plan to be well taken care of. The doorman was there waiting for us and the lovely staff at the front desk had us checked in and on our way to our room. We stayed in a suite which was quite spacious, had a very comfortable king bed with great linens, a deep bath tub and was decorated with cool art. Make sure to check out all of the rockstars on the 5th floor doors (each floor has a different theme). The staff is very attentive and really knew the area well for suggestions. The sushi was great at the hotel's Red Fin Restaurant. I would recommend this hotel for business or leisure, it is in a great location to walk to Pikes Place.

We absolutely LOVE this resort! We traveled to Secrets Maroma beach for our honeymoon and it was the most beautiful place I have ever stayed (and let me tell you I have been everywhere!). I especially was extremely pleased with the customer service. An example of their great service was when I mentioned that I had forgotten my camera charger and immediately they provided me with a new camera charger and I was then able to take all the pictures I wanted. I also thought their food was amazing. We were able to have a different cuisine every night and there was definitely something for everyone. I highly recommend this resort. Try it out!

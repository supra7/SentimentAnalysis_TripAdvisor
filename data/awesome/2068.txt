This is a very special hotel, a true Seattle Icon! I've looked at the rates before but felt it was more than I could muster when my guy suprised me with a weekend stay for our 25th wedding anniversary! :D With an upgrade to a water view. Needless to say, we had smiles on our faces all weekend! The location is supurb and the food is top notch. Everything is with-in walking distance.

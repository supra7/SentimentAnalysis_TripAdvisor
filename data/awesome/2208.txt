Wow, what a great stay. My now husband and I travelled to Seattle from Florida to get married this February, and chose to stay at the Edgewater since I'm a sucker for a water view and the Edgewater is the only hotel located 'on' the water there. There were some initial bumps in the proverbial road with our reservations, and also the matter of the vases - as it is now known. I had ordered hundreds of roses to be delivered to the room for our arrival (which was right after our wedding) and needed vases for them. The hotel initially said that they could provide them, but then couldn't, then after some haggling with my sister in law could, and on and on. Long story short - the hotel DID end up providing the vases. Not to mention that not only was our reservation fixed, but we were upgraded to the infamous Beatle's Suite, compliments of the management. And all of this was with minimal hassle. I found that the staff was nothing but polite, professional, and eager to make things right. The room was out of this world, the view was spectacular - I swear that the famous Seattle cloud cover even cleared for the time that we were there! The bed was easily the most comfortable hotel bed that we've ever slept in, with great linens and down pillows to boot. We couldn't have been happier. The only downside, and it's a really minor one in light of all the great stuff, was that whenever another door on our hallway slammed closed, it caused quite a racket. Very temporary though, and it didn't happen often enough to be a real issue. I would happily recommend this hotel (especially the waterfront rooms!) to anyone, and can't wait to get back myself!

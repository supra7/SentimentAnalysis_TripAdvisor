Very small scale hotel. Everything in this hotel is small , especially the bathroom, and a shower. However, the room is clean and comfortable. A great location of downtown for the price compared to the major chain hotels in the area. Check in is very fast. Hotel staffs are friendly and courteous. A street noise can be a bit annoying. I like the modern and contempory look of the hotel.

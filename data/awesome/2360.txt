Major disaster averted thanks to Westin Seattle's super staff! I raced to Seattle to give a talk after tending to a family major hospital operation. Technical materials and resources for my talk were, unfortunately, sent to my twin grandsons' birthday party while I received the boys' presents and party favors--not a good day, but funny! Concierge Richard sent a car to pick me up. Ms. Helms along with arranged a room where I could work to collect materials and meet with colleagues. Concierge Judy told me where to find replacement materials. The bell staff are great! They hauled boxes, taped them, Sorid, only recently hired, actually moved furniture to arrange the suite to meet my needs and the bellman on duty overnight taped my boxes and handled my Fed Ex shipment, packed my cab to the airport this morning and mailed the presents home.. Vardo at the business center reprinted my handouts and immediately rushed to help me drag my suitcase out to the curb when he saw me struggling down the hall. Thank you all! This one day whirlwind trip worked out because of you! It is what makes me such a loyal SPG fan! The staff even reminded me to remember to eat "to keep up my strength." I am literally old enough to be their parents! Thanks guys!!!

Great airport hotel. The beds were firm, ample pillows, and an ample breakfast. A call to the hotel sent the shuttle service to pick us up quickly. They volunteered to take us to a nearby restaurant but we selected to walk. Great food at a nearby Dinner. In the morning the hotel shuttle took us back to the airport. An airport shuttle took us to downtown Seattle to pick up our Hertz rental car. We arranged to return the car to Portland. Thus, all the extra fees of renting a car from the airport were avoided. Very friendly staff at the Marriott that made everything convenient.

Much nicer than it needed to be, as it was just a place to crash for the night after our flight. Very attractive public areas with a fun atmosphere. We unfortunately didn't get to try the pool, but it looked great. Had breakfast in the hotel, which was a little overpriced, of course, but really very good, and the staff were just lovely. The chef came out to our table to check on us and offered to make something special for our toddler. They also found us maps and directions for where we were headed. I chose this hotel partly because it was a Hertz rental site, and that all went very smoothly, too. I would definitely stay here again.

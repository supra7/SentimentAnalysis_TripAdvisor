The Hotel Andra is a fab hotel in Seattle. It's decor is very funky and we had a suite so the room was large with it's own bar area. A big comfortable bed with a large walk in closet.Your own sofa with a partial view to Lake Union. The hotel is very central to shopping,nightlife,Pike Place and the Space Needle. I'd definitely stay here again when in Seattle and hopefully try the restaurant next time. The staff really set this hotel apart as they were so friendly, from the check in staff, valet parking and the concierge.A big thumbs up! We'd read about this hotel in the United Airlines magazine on the flight up to Seattle so were very pleased when we experienced it in person.

My husband and I always stay at the Warwick in Seattle. We love the hotel. The location is in Bell Town, near Pike's Street Market, the shopping district, Whole Foods, but also very close to the jogging trail along Elliott Bay. The staff is always friendly and accommodating (many of them have worked there for years. Always a good sign.) The price is reasonable and our view of the Space Needle is an added bonus. On Christmas night Chef Chris made us the best seared tuna we've ever eaten. We stayed 8 nights and hated to leave!

I have travelled all over the world and tend to stay in hotels which are 4 or 5 stars. We booked through the Sheraton website and got the room practically for free! (only $156 per night). So I was going into this with the mindset that if things weren't all that great, it was okay, because of the cheap price. I am so happy to say that this hotel was WONDERFUL! The rooms were new, beautifully decorated, and clean. The Sheraton chain is known for their great beds and pillows, and this hotel was no exception, among the best I've slept in. The staff were extremely professional, polite, and friendly. The bellhops and the receptionists were first rate. The location is excellent as it is only a few blocks from Pike Market. There are several restaurant and shopping options all within walking distance. Also, lots of banks nearby (if you need to withrdraw cash, etc). We used room service twice. The food was excellent and recieved very fast. Of course, it was expensive, but hey, it's room service and you're staying in an upscale hotel. If you're looking for an economical or practically priced meal, you need to leave the hotel and eat elsewhere. We also had breakfast in their restaurant. Excellent food, exquisite service. Again, pricey, but hey, if you're on a budget, don't stay at the Sheraton. One more thing to note, their toiletries were wonderful! Mandarin orange and mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions. I didn't even take my own out to use, as theirs were so nice. The only negative thing I can comment on is that when we arrived mid day, we took a nap. During the day it was quite difficult as it was very noisy outside the room, in the hallways. However, at night we had no problems and slept very well. I wouldn't even think about finding another hotel if I'm ever in Seattle again. The Sheraton is just right for me.

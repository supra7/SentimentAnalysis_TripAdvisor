Stayed here for a long weekend conference in Nov. The staff was VERY helpful and friendly: from check-in/out, to concierge recommendations for dinner and sites, to room cleaning staff, to lobby lounge servers. The rooms were clean and very roomy; quiet; free internet in lobby/lounge. Taxi/shuttle service to and from airport was quite easily arranged. Close to things to do. Saw many families---seemed to be kid friendly enough for them. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone whether it be for business or pleasure.

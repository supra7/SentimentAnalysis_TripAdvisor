I give this 5 stars even though we had a hurricane AND our ceiling leaked water and collapsed. Yes, on our honeymoon. LUCKILY this happened the first 2 nights and we had 8 more. And let me tell you.....those last 8 nights made up for any grief we had when we arrived. The hotel staff was so accomodating and made up for everything! I would go back in a heart beat. We had a private pool suite but everyone that stayed below us in the swim up suites said the water was too cold, so I would opt for the upgrade for sure.

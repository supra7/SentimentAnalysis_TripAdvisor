Great location in Seattle, very well appointed hotel and the staff is really helpful and pleasant. Room was twice as big as I expected, had a cool, funky feel to it without being over the top. Fitness center is very small but nice enough to get a workout in while there, about what you'd expect from a small boutique hotel.

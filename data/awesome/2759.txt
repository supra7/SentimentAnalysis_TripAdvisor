It's location might not be as convenient as some for the leisure traveler...depending on one's interests. Hotel Vintage Park is located diagonally across the intersection from the main branch of the Seattle Public Library (a contemporary architectural attraction) and two blocks south of the 5th Avenue Theater. We thoroughly enjoyed the onsite restaurant, Tulio's, both for dinner and breakfast. The front desk staff and bellmen were always pleasant and helpful. Housekeeping actually honors the "towel on the floor, towel hanging" choice for the replacement of linens. We were upgraded to a king premier room which was spacious and tastefully decorated. Bed, pillows and bed linens were high quality and comfortable. The hotel offers wine tasting between 5-6 PM. We spent two nights at Hotel Vintage Park and were allowed to check in about 1:00 PM on the first day and out at 12 noon on the third day. We would happily return again.

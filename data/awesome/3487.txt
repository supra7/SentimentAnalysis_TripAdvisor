We recently stayed here as part of our honeymoon. The hotel is brand new, clean and centrally located near the Bell Centre and train station. We enjoyed our large airy room with free use of the fitness centre and roof-top spa. The concierge was very helpful in allowing us to print some onward tickets in the hotel lobby, when the Business Centre PC was out of use. The free Wi-Fi is a plus.

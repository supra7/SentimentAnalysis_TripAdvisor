Sheraton on 6th is the perfect blend of price, location, luxurious feeling, and cleanliness. It's located in the heart of downtown. All the shops are in front of the hotel or within a few minutes walk away. Pike St. is great to walk towards Pike Market and takes less than 10 minutes. Also major bus stops are all within a block or two. So if you are taking bus to other area, it works great, too. Friendly concierge and staffs made the stay even better. The Chihuly art in the room and lobby made the stay more posh and elegant. Definitely would go back there to stay again when I will be traveling to Seattle in the future.

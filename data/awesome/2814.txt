The Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle is part of the Kimpton Group chain of boutique hotels. While I've stayed elsewhere in Seattle, I keep coming back here due to its comfortable rooms, convenient location and its eccentric European-style charm. Upon arrival, I handed my keys to the valet ($30 for overnight parking) and was quickly checked into my room. The rooms have recently undergone a modest renovation, including new wallpaper, carpets, bedding and cushioned furniture. The bed has a very comfortable Tempur-Pedic mattress, which may take some getting used to if you've never slept on foam before. As with all Kimpton Hotels, the Vintage Park uses high quality Aveda bath products, has a very nice evening wine reception (featuring Washington wines) and has a very good, very creative restaurant in the lobby (Tulio). There is a nice selection of free newspapers available in the lobby, along with complimentary coffee in the morning. As a Kimpton InTouch member, a plate of grapes and two flavors of sparkling Italian fruit beverages were brought to my room. While I do have some small quibbles with the property--there is no Fox News on the TV, it is very difficult to get into the on-site garage during peak traffic times, there is no view from the rooms, the lobby is very "intimate" (i.e. small)--the unique feel, attentive staff, wonderful food and great downtown location make it a great place to stay in Seattle. I highly recommend this four star property.

My wife and I decided to stay at Secrets Maroma for our one year anniversary and that was a great decision. The Service/Staff: From the second we walked into the resort, we felt very welcomed. The staff, every single part of it, was just tremendous. Check in was flawless. Concierge was great. Cleaning service was tremendous. Activity team was great. Waiters/Waitresses/Bartenders were friendly, timely and courteous. The Resort: The cleanliness of the resort was spectacular. The grounds and landscaping were very well done. The Beach/Water: If you haven't been to Riviera Maya yet, you need to go. The water is beautiful and the beaches are second to none. The Pool: The pool was perfect size and we didn't really have any trouble finding chairs. And don't bother trying to put up the umbrella...the second you sit down, there is someone there doing that for you. The Food: The food was better than any resort we stayed at. Of course it is not going to be exactly what you are used to at home, but it was as close as I have had while staying in a different country. I don't ever write reviews, but I felt the need to do it for this resort. The staff and the hotel deserve it. They made our stay very enjoyable and we are already planning our next trip back. I hope this review helps anyone that is on the fence as to where to go. You will not be dissapointed.

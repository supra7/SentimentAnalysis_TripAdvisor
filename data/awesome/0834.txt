When we arrived at the crown plaza in seattle we were greated with great desk clerks. They were very helpful. The room was fantastic!! Very clean with a wonderful view of the space needle. The Bed was also Fantastic I got a great night sleep! My only concern was the restaurant service was slow and the waiter was not friendly. it was a shame that on a saturday night that the restaurant was not filled with people, other than that I would definatly stay there again and would recommend this hotel to any one.

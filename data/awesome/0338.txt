Booked this hotel on their website, based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, the location, and the price. Good price for a downtown hotel in Seattle. The hotel is close to downtown, Belltown, and the Pike Place Market. When I say close, I mean within a few blocks walk. When I booked the hotel, I asked for a room on a higher floor with a view. I got to the hotel about noon and just wanted to drop off my luggage before I headed out for the afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised that my room was ready. I was returning a rental car and the staff was very helpful in coming out to the car to get the luggage and taking it to the room while I returned the rental car. Wow! The courtesy and helpfulness of the staff was excellent! The room had a fantastic view of the Space Needle! The view and room exceeded my expectations. The room was very comfortable and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room had all the amenities of a modern, American hotel. Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and helpful during my stay at the hotel, from check-in, to the front desk answering questions, to the bellhops. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. Ralph's, which is a grocery store, is across the street. It has has some normal items and a lot of specialty items. You can eat there if you want; there a few tables. It's a small store and a little upscale, so normal things like soda cost a little more than a Walgreens. You can't beat the convenience and that alone is worth the slightly higher cost. We like to walk and we could walk to a lot of sites from the hotel--space needle, park place market, downtown, restaurants. We went to Belltown one night to eat and one afternoon for a snack. I always felt safe walking to and from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.

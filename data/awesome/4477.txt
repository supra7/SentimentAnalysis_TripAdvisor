This was our second trip to Secrets Maroma Beach. My husband and I went last year to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and returned this year with our adult children. There were seven of us traveling together and the amenities at Secrets couldn't have been better. For those in the group that just want to relax and enjoy the beach or pool - that is clearly available but for the more active in the crowd - there are plenty of activities and amenities to satisfy everyone. The staff (especially the Entertainment Crew) is awesome and the quality of the food beyond expectation. We will definately return and wouldn't hesitate to book at any Secrets location.

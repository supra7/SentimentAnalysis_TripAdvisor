There is only one bad thing about this resort  after you visit it, no other resort would be good enough. Maroma is a true paradise. Spotless and nicely decorated rooms, invisible cleaning people, superbly trained staff, fantastic food, tequila tastings, entertainment and spectacular beach. Try the spa, its expensive, but 100% worth it. Out of all resorts I visited in Mexico and Caribbean, Maroma, without any doubt, is the best one.

I have stayed at this hotel through many of its incarnations starting with the time when it was the Hotel Claremont. It has changed/grown into one of the premier hotels in Seattle. It is in one of my favorite areas of Seattle, Belltown, and right across the street from the Dahlia Lounge. And it now includes another Tom Douglas restaurant on the first floor of the hotel itself---an especially a great spot for breakfast. The rooms are well appointed with most of your needs anticipated; however , the staff will try and help you secure what extras you feel you need. I anticipate my Seattle trips because of this hotel.

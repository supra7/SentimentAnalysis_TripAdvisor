Just returned from 3 days in Seattle where we stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park. Exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable staff who went out of their way to assist with any need. Trulio, the attached restaurant is outstanding and has a comfortable clubby atmosphere. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. A wonderful small hotel in downtown Seattle.

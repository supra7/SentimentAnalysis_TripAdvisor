We enjoyed a two night stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel in August, 2005. While it was a busy time in Seattle (The Ring Cycle was at the opera that week) we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. We had a wet bar with coffeemaker, mini-refigerator and sink, large living area with desk (free wireless internet access too, very nice), sofa and comfy chairs, king bed, large closet/dressing room, and nice bathroom though small, but with historic fittings. The Hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and the lobby is small but evokes a historic feeling. Another nice bonus was the invitation to the Wednesday early evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres in the restaurant, Andalucia. Very pleasant experience. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but the hotel's location right in the center of town provided us lots of exercise walking up and down Seattle's hills. We walked to REI, the Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and even the Victory Brewery from the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were particularly helpful, and the host at the wine tasting was very pleasant. We would certainly recommend the Mayflower Park Hotel and will definitely stay there again-there was so much to see and do in Seattle, we barely scratched the surface!

We stayed two nights in downtown Seattle to visit our son who lives in Pioneer Square. The Sheraton is perfectly located, within walking distance of all major attractions. There is plenty of shopping at the nearby malls and plenty of coffee shops and restaurants. We took the new transit from the airport with a short bus ride and arrived in the Westlake shopping center, around the corner from the hotel.

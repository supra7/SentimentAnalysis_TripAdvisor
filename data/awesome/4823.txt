The resort was awesome. I've stayed at 3 other all inclusives and this was by far the best experience. They have top shelf beers, wine and liqour and the food was far better than expected. We chose to stay in a swim out and we could not have been more pleased. You can order room service 24/7, what could be better than that. The hotel staff was friendly and curteous. Just remember you're in Mexico so the service is not as fast as you receive in the States. I trully understand the meaning of "in a Mexican minute". We only had one problem and that was at checkout. We cleared our bill the night before so that we would not have to bother so early in the morning. When we were receiving our clearance to leave the resort a mystery charge for a bottle of wine appeared on our bill. I tried for 10 minutes to explain that I already paid my bill, even showing my receipts, to no avail. I chose to pay the $22 USD rather than wait anymore as our taxi was waiting. Other than that it was the best Mexican vacation I have ever had. The beach, resort, pool, staff, food and beverages were amazing. Plus no kids at the resort.

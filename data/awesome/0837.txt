Moved to this hotel after a disastrous stay at another hotel in Seattle. This was great, we had a Suite which provided a complimentary continental breakfast and canapes in the evening. It is close to all areas oh interest to a discerning tourist. The staff were very helpful and friendly and could not do enough to make our stay comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. All lifts worked and came quickly when called even though the hotel was full, the TV's in room worked as did the safe.

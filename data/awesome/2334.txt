I was lucky enough to win a Gift Certificate to the Sorrento hotel, and what a beautiful place! I thought they might look down their noses at me, given that I had a "Donated" gift certificate, but the front desk treated me well, as did the concierge. The room was lovely, if a little small, but it had a French Press, and the coffee was actually not bad at all! There was a cd player, and complimentary use CD's, including a Blues compilation that I listened to while I took a bath. The bathroom was really beautiful, lots of white and grey marble. The Sorrento offers complimentary car service, and they took my friend and I to Capitol Hill, in no time flat. If I had the money, I would stay there all the time.

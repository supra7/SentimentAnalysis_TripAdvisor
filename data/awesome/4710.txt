My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed spending our honeymoon at Secrets. The hotel's food and drink options were limitless, the pools were relaxing yet fun and vibrant and the beach was gorgeous and peaceful. We ate and drank ourselves into nirvana and slept it off poolside daily. Hitmitsu was our favorite restaurant for dinner, but thoroughly enjoyed the Seaside Grill and Barefoot Grill for lunch. Better yet was the butler-passed poolside snacks between 1-3pm - worth sticking around for. If you like a particular brand of liquor, ask for it by name when ordering your cocktails otherwise you get the house brands. If you like tequila and are used to it chilled, ask for it that way, otherwise you get it "room temp." You should definitely say hello and make friends with the following staff members, who were amazing: Eduardo (aka "Donkey"), Rendevous lobby bar - he will get your drunk, even w/out asking Paola, entertainment team Antonio, Seaside Grill Balbina, poolside server Yannik, concierge Julio, from Apple Vacations (if you're in need of an excursion) Our only negative experience was with two pool bar bartenders - Javier and Silvario, who were rather dismissive for having such a killer gig. And, if you haven't been to downtown Playa before, spend the $20 for a cab ride (one-way) and make a late afternoon/evening out of it. You'll be glad you did. If you're considering Secrets, please feel free to reach out. We're happy to make the recommendation. We also have 500+ photos from our trip that we're happy to share. Cheers, and happy/safe travels!

Secrets Maroma was amazing. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years and finally decided on doing a vacation together. I wanted to stay away from "cancun" party scene and more close to something more exclusive and away from all the craziness. We arrived in Maroma and our driver took us on a mile long weird turns with rocky roads and my bf and I were like" ughhhh where the heck are we going." However, as we approached the hotel everything changed. It was abs. beautiful. We arrive and were received with bell boy saying "Welcome Home." We were given towels and Champagne on arrival. The best part was we were there as a couple just having a vacation, but they upgraded us to "Honeymooners' haha. It was funny because my bf was convinced I was scheming for something :) It turned out great. I made reservations to "Himitshu" before I got to the resort. The food was amazing, especially the fried ice-cream at the end. We also went to the Italian restaurant and omg it was to die for. The food is amazing...amazing..amazing..amazing. Every restaurant is out of the world. THe only real compliant my bf and I had were that the people at "orbitz" at our arrival told us to meet this man named " Oscar" at 4 am the day we arrived to schedule our departure. When we got there we scheduled everything with Oscar, and than he was very forceful and made us sign up for activities right away...a little too forceful. We didn't get our promised breakfast and fully air-conditioned bus with a toliet on our way to chitiniza. I was pretty pissed about that, however it had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HOTEL. Anyways, its an amazing resort and soo much to do. A lot of great foods, activities, and dont forget the AMAZINGGGGG SPA!! Enjoy! OH OH OH BTW, BRING A LOTTTT OF MOSQUITO REPELLANT....THEY ARE KILLER AT THIS RESORT...ONLY DOWN SIDE :( Kill them the first night or ur screwed

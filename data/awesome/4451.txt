We just returned after a glorious week of sunny 85 degree weather at the Maroma Beach Resort! The resort was beautiful, very well manicured throughout and the service was above the top. The wait staff (as well as the resorts staff in general) in all of the restraunts were extremely attentive and did everything possible to please the guests. The food, no matter where we dined, was superb with beautiful presentation. Dinners were gourmet and the drinks great. There are plenty of activities if you so desire and the total relaxation by the pool or on the prisine beach was so refreshing. We loved every minute at the resort!

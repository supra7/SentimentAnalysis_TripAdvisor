I am an international traveller, with access to all types, sizes and brands of hotels worldwide. I love this hotel. The location is excellent, the staff friendly, cleanliness is exceptional and again, the location, location, location is the best ! This property if for the seasoned traveller, like me, who know the difference between a real city hotel, and a hotel in any city. This hotel represents the way Seattle is and was before all the large brand hotels rebuilt and knocked down the ones with character. It is not for the cheap, inexperienced traveller who does know know the difference between vintage and old.However, it is for those of us, who have the ability and knowledge to chose what we want, and where we want to stay. This hotel reminds me of the one I also perfer to stay in when in London England, The White House whose rooms are well appointed and smaller, because that is how they built them to attract the city dweller, not the inexperience traveller who does no the difference. If you want to experience the history and charm of Seattle this is the place to stay.

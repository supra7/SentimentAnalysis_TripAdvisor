Our first trip to SMB was the 2nd week that the resort was open and we had a great time then. Now, 1.5 years later, the resort is even better with the same excellent service. I thought that the food was very good and we never had to wait more than 20min for a table. The grounds are beautiful and the beach, IMHO, is the best in Riviera Maya. We upgraded to the swim-out room and it was nice to be able to wind down the day in basically your own pool. The only unpleasant experience we had during our stay was some drunken rowdiness during water volleyball one of the days at the pool, but I guess that is to be expected when you are on vacation. We will definitely stay here again.

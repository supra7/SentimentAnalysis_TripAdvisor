I did not encounter any rude employees or a lack of service while I stayed at the Sheraton on 6th Avenue. The prices are quite reasonable compared to other 4-star hotels in downtown Seattle. I did a price search and found that they were the same no matter what website I used. I booked through Sheraton directly. You might be able to find lower prices with AAA if you book in advance. My fiance and I arrived at 10:30am and the Sheraton let us check in early. The room service was very good. We had a large corner room with a view of Union Street all the way down to Pike's Market, which was a 5-10 minute walk. The beds and sheets were very soft and comfortable. You can find plenty of shopping within a block of the hotel and there is a very good crepe place a block away at the convention center. The only things I could complain about were the water pressure in the shower, the lack of a fan in the bathroom, and expensive parking (but all parking is expensive in Seattle) ...otherwise our stay was wonderful and I will return the next time I am in Seattle.

We have stayed at this property several times. Has come up for us on a couple of bidding websites at a great rate. We also have booked directly with the hotel's website and using the AAA rate, received a great deal. The staff have always been friendly and helpful. There is a cute little library style lounge for a nightcap or snack. Prices are very reasonable. We found the rooms on the front of the property to be a little noisy as they face International Blvd and the airport. The rooms on the back side face a small lake and are much more peaceful. We always ask for a room on the back and have never had a problem getting one. We stayed once in a One Bedroom Suite. Nice room, but unfortunately right by the elevators and facing International Blvd. We heard the elevator motors groaning and humming all night form the living room and the airport / road noise from the bedroom. The Suites are all by the elevator. I would take a standard room on the back over the suite, even if it was offered at no extra charge. We have otherwise always had a King Sleep Number Bed room. I Like the layout of the room and also the bed. After a couple of stays, we did what the Sleep Number people want - we bought a Sleep Number Bed for home. They are really a great bed. This hotel is the first thing you see when you come out of the airport. I guarantee you it is quicker to walk to the terminal than take the shuttle. Problem is, the route all hotel shuttle busses take to the airport is not exactly direct. Even from this hotel, it is about a ten minute ride. If you want to walk from the airport, come out the doors at baggage claim and immediately turn right. Do not cross the road to ground transportation. You can't walk from there. You will find the hotel at the end of the sidewalk in about 5 minutes. To walk from the hotel, just cross the street and follow the little concrete path. Easy. Good for you, and saves time too.

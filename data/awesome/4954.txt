My wife and I planned this trip as our honeymoon, and to attend a friends wedding on the beach. We arrived Wed morning, departed the following Monday. This resort was excellent, we could not have asked for anything better. Had we not have planed an excursion before we left on our trip, we never would have left the resort. There are activities starting at 9am and running almost through midnight. With so many restaurants to choose from, we didnt have a chance to try them all but the ones we did were excellent. The service we received at this resort over the few days we were there has added this location to be one of our frequented locations.

The hotel is newly renovated and our room was very clean and comfortable. There was a bit of noise from the concert going on in the theatre, but hardly noticeable on the fifth floor. You can hear it more in the bathroom but since I don't sleep in there it was of no concern. The room was very modern and we had a claw foot tub in our bathroom. The only downsides are that there was no mini fridge or microwave in the room and since the building is ols so is the plumbing. The water temp tended to fluctuate a bit during showers, but nothing uncomfortable. As far as the frige and the microwave go, we ate everything fresh from restaurants and the market. The fridge would have been nice to keep drinks in the room cold, but we just filled out ice bucket up and kept them cozy in it. Overall the hotel was much more than I hoped for. Very friendly staff are at the counter 24/7 and they can recommend some great local eateries. Now on the the location. It's 2 blocks from the market! Seeing as most everything we did was there it was super convenient. What was farther (Space Needle, EMP Museum) we took the monorail. It's in the Westlake Center (1-2 blocks away) and ends right beside the Space Needle. It's $2 one way and it takes 90 seconds. When you're running late for a tour because you've spent too much time lingering in the museum it's a very nice option. Totally worth the 2 bucks.

I've never stayed at a Doubletree before, so I don't know if this is typical for the brand or not. However, my next visit to Seattle, I will definitely stay at this hotel again, without question. The room was excellent, clean and well appointed. The beds were insanely comfortable, with down comforters and pillows, a big flatscreen tv (although channels are limited), and very clean and comfortable. In room single-pod coffeemaker with Wolfgang Puck coffee - the utility of the coffeemaker was nice, but the coffee sucked. Elsewhere in the hotel, the landscaping is impressive and beautiful. The Seaports bar & lounge I cannot recommend highly enough. Michael and Bob, two of the bartenders, provided entertainment as well as quick service, well made drinks, and quickly delivered food. The salmon and clam chowder is a must eat if you are here - I've never had better. The Coffee Garden restaurant is a breakfast only location (except for conventions), and I recommend room service. This is the only bad part of my stay here - the staff was just shy of rude. They appeared to not care about making the guest feel welcome, and when they closed early one day for a convention lunch they simply told people "we're closed" with no explanation. Seaports, Coffee Garden, Maxi's lounge and room service all come from the same line, and the chef is excellent. While I don't recommend the CG eatery, I do highly recommend the food prepared here. Of all the meals I ate in the hotel, none of the food was less than spectacular. The front desk was prompt with responses to anything I needed, quick on check-in. I will definitely stay here again.

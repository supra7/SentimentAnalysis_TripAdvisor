My wife and I just returned from Secrets in Maroma Beach. I don't have one complaint. The pool and beach areas were spectacular, rooms and services superb, food and drink great for an all-inclusive. This is a couples focused resort so the entertainment is fun but low key. Perfect for a romantic get away. Recommendations, spend some time at the beach bar with Asuncion and Gener they were fun bartenders. Bordeaux was are favorite restaurant with excellent service and great food.

I recently stayed at the sheraton seattle and the service that we recieved was A++++ . the staff were extreamly friendly . They were super fast at checking us in and gave us a stunning suite on the 18th floor.The pool and hot tub on the roof in the pike st tower were very nice . We will return in the future. The only con i must say is the parking it's 45$ for valet and 35$ to self park and it's a few blocks away.

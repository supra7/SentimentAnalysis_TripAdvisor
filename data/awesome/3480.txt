My husband and I stayed at Le Crystal for our 25th wedding Anniversary from Septeber 12th to 14th. From the moment we arrived, we were meet by a very friendly and courteous concierge. We arrived at 1:00 pm and were able to check in early. Also, we were given a complimentary upgrade because it was our 25th. Shortly after arriving in our beautifully appointed suite, we were delivered champaign on ice!! The hotel itself is very modern, clean and a great location. It was also very secure requiring the room key to use the elevators. There was a beautiful indoor pool and an outdoor hot tub overlooking the city. The location was perfect. The bus stop was just outside which we used to take the bus to and from the airport. The metro station was nearby. Shopping and restaurants were just a short walk away. Old Montreal was a little further but easily accessible using the metro. The suite was exceptional! It was very spacious with a kitchenette, sitting area, separate bedroom and a large bathroom. It had all of the amenities required for our stay, including a nespresso machine which we enjoyed being able to make our morning coffee. The bathroom was beautiful and modern with a rainshower, separate tub, chic decor and fixtgures, and Molton Brown products. In conclusion, this hotel has it all. Service is second to none, great location, fantastic rooms with the best of everything. Would definitelly stay here again if we ever return to Montreal.

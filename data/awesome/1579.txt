We just got back from a 2-night stay at the Sheraton. Having had a nice stay there two years ago, we were pretty excited. It was a little busier this time and the lobby was constantly packed with the crowd that had come to see the gingerbread display. It was a little annoying passing through the lobby, as it felt like navigating through the flea market. When we checked in, we were placed in a room next to a family with (several) small children. Fortunately the front desk manager Jeremie was able to move us to a more quiet room (thanks Jeremie). It was next to the ice machine but it sure beat listening to loud talking and door slamming! Rooms were clean and pleasant. Beds could be replaced as they were crinkly every time someone tossed and turned (springs inside mattress were getting old). We parked at the self park on 7th for $28/night, which was pretty easy and faster/cheaper than the valet ($40/night).

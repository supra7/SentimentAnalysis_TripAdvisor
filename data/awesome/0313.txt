This was my 2nd or 3rd stay here, and it's been better each time, and great to start with. It's the location- downtown but also easy walking distance to Seattle Center/Space Needle, Pikes Place, Westwood underground bus station if you want to go to other areas. Beranoya Hall, theaters, restaurants, shopping, monorail, just a great location. Easy to get to. Spotlessly clean. Comfy bed. Juliet balcony with sliding glass door, so it was light and airy. Really nice bath products, deep tub. I like the restaurant, reasonable bill, sensible portions, nice flavors. The surprise gift of a plate of macaroons and mineral water, and lovely turn down service after returning from evenings out made me feel especially well cared for. Parking seems a bit steep, but I think it's comparable to independent lot parking, and it is covered parking. The mini fridge wasn't cold enough, but I've never seen one that is. Highly recommend, hated to leave, will certainly go back!

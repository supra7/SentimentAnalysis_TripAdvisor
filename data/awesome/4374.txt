First time ever to Mexico and first time all-inclusive. Have been to Greek islands, Monaco, Great Barrier Reef, and many other desirable world class destinations. Secrets Maroma is in the top 3 of best locations. Staff was extremely kind, food was great (portofino restaurant-best) beach was absolute paradise. They thought of everything here, Beach side Paella and Fajitas.... endless Pina coladas flowing. Nights are very quiet here... def get in a cab and venture to Playa for some more action. beautiful European town. will go back!!

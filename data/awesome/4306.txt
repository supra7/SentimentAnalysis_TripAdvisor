Just returned from secrets marimba for our wedding anniversary- really was fabulous. Luckily we were upgraded to preferred club block 26, and although we had already booked a swim up room this upgrade was great, the rooms on the preferred block seem to be the same as the rest of hotel, all great, but they are closer to the beach and a bit more private than the rest. The service, food and general attitude of the staff was exceptional, having been to a sandals resort a couple of times I would say secrets maroma was of a higher standard. Being able to eat in the speciality restaurants without having to book was so good, we hate the usual rush to reserve a table as often happens in 5star hotels. If there were no free tables straight away you were given a pager but we never had to wait more than 15 mins at most. We love the beach rather than the pool and yes it's just as it looks in the brochure we were not disappointed! You could sit by the pool and never get up, the waiters bring a real mixture of taster foods and drinks for you to try all day, it didn't happen that much on the beach but who needs food when you have a constant supply of cocktails! The waiters don't press you for tips but hey a couple of dollars after the have been walking up and down the beach all day is not unappreciated! Would definitely book another secrets hotel I am a picky holiday lover but this was worth every penny and would highly recommend the resort. Lucky you if you have the opportunity to visit,

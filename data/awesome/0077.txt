Wife and I stayed at Hotel Monaco Seattle middle of September 2011. We have stayed at Kimpton properties and Hotel Monaco (in San Francisco) before. We love the Kimpton group and Hotel Monaco Seattle was outstanding. Service cannot be beat, rooms are very nice, bar and restaurant are good, and downtown location was excellent. I heartily endorse this hotel.

I am a business traveler in the Government sector who stays at hotels for extended periods of time. I have experienced Destiny Palms Hotel for approximately two months now and would like to give them an extremely elevated rating! The staff has provided an amazing value by providing a weekly rate of $149.95/single which pays for a very clean room, a plasma screen television with full cable & HBO, daily fresh linens, weekly full maid service when paid by the week, cherry hardwood furniture, a convection/toaster oven, microfridge, excellent room lighting, a large stand-up shower, wireless internet in all the common areas, a continental breakfast with waffles and pancakes...and the list goes on! I have experienced ValueStays, Home Sweet Home Extended Stay Hotels, Microtel Inns, and a multitude of other extended stay and hotel facilities throughout the United States of America and across the world. This is by far the best value! Pricilla is a great asset to this hotel and provides great service every afternoon!! Pricilla has worked with me when I needed to move rooms or work out the next few weeks payment arrangements and has acted appropriately and in a very friendly, endearing manner! Thank you Pricilla! Tony is also one of the premier afternoon clerks and provides a friendly greeting and accommodates customer's needs at every request. I have observed the staff handle a hostile consumer situation and was surprised by the maintenance of a professional air throughout the encounter by the Assistant Manager! He spoke articulately and wisely for a young man! Kudos to this facility for keeping the rare quality service that should be the norm rather than the exception!!! The General Manager of this facility also deserves recognition and should definitely pass along my extensive praise to the staff members. I do not hand-out compliments with regularity unless a person as strived for excellence - it has been achieved at Destiny Palms Hotel Maingate West!! -Nathaniel

Kathy and I had a marvelous experience at Secrets inspite of Rina. The staff did a terrific job preparing the resort for the event. From the grounds crew to the wait staff, all was readied and the guests were well attended to. The resort itself was more than expected. The spacious room, the swim out pool, the restruants and bars were extradordinary. The preferred club was anchored by a tremendous individual...William...who went out of his way to make our stay memberable. His hospitality, humor, and attention made the day. The beach is beautiful...white sands for as long as one can see. The spa was a true relaxing day. The hydrotherapy, steam and sauna relaxed the most tense muscles. The treatment to die for. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. The night before we left, out traveling companions renwewed their vows on the beach in a delightful ceremony, and then we shared an elegant sea-side dinner. WOW! If you get the chance to experience Secrrets Maroma Beach, take it. You'll never regret it!

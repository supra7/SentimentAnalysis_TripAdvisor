I have never received such excellent service at any hotel/resort in all my years of traveling... I would recommend anyone stay here... I know I will be back... Everyone was so helpful and ready to answer any questions we may have had... The food was amazing.... The rooms were breathtaking.... You step out of the slidding doors and you walk into a heated pool... The beds were so cozy... the bath was undescribable... The view from my room was unbelievable... The beach was well taken care of... They were always playing some game or trying to interact with the guest as much as possible... Alejandro was our concierge and when I come back I will request to stay in his area for he was always willing to go above and beyond his duties to help anyone... I always seem to get hurt anywhere I go and Alejandro called to have someone take care of me in a matter of seconds (it was just a stubbed toe & I wasnt even drinking)...

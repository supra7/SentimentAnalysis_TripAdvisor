This hotel is within walking distance to Pike Public Market, retailers, and monorail to Seattle Center. The room was very well maintained and spacious. Our view from the 24th overlooked the nearby Westin but also the roofs of quite a few other buildings. The hotel is next to the Convention Center and this probably encourages maintenance. The gym was being upgraded; however, nearby options were offered at no additional cost.

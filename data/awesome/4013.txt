Just returned from our 3rd time at SMB. This was our 13th trip to the area, and Secrets is the only resort we have returned to. Our 1st 2 trips we were on the 4th floor, with an amazing view, this time we did a swimout suite, which we truly enjoyed. Our concierge, Fabiola was wonderful. My husband celebrated his b'day while we were there, and when we were gone snorkeling, she had our room decorated with a banner, balloons, and a cake. It was a very nice touch. The only complaint I have, and I have had it all 3 years, the rooms, the lobby, and all the restaurants are not near cool enough!!!!! They really need to do something about it. I knew to ask for a fan as soon as we got to our room, it helped, but the air does not go below 75. It of course does not stop us from going to such an incredible resort. As many others have mentioned, the food and the service are the BEST. Definitely will return for a 4th time, and hopefully a 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.

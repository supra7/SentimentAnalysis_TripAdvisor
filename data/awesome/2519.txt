Went for a Seahawks game with a few friends. Took a limo from Airport to hotel which was the same price as a taxi, but taxi drivers don't want you to know that. Hotel checkin was quick and painless. We were in the opposite tower as the swimming pool so if that is an issue bring it up when checking in, me personally I don't like running around the lobby in swim trunks. concierge was very helpful pointing out hot spots and location is a decent walk from the heart of downtown, but nice scenery makes is tolerable or $5 cab ride for the non-walkers. All in all we will be back next year for sure!

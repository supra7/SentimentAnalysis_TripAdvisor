Our stay at Maroma was amazing! The staff was always so generous! The entertainment and entertainment staff (Uri) was awesome! Yessica in building 16 was always there for us and helped us in anyway that she could. We had a blast with all the shows and the beach. The food was awesome! We didnt have one complaint from our stay and we plan on coming back for our 1 year anniversary. We suggest anyone to have the dinner on the beach but make it a little earlier, we made ours for 7:30 not knowing that it got dark early down there, but dinner was amazing! We came home and recommended it to many of our family and friends and hope to get a big group to come with us next time around!

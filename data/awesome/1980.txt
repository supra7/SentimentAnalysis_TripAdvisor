We just returned from a 4 day stay in Seattle at the Hotel Andra. We had the studio queen. The rooms are not huge but they are BEAUTIFUL, Trendy and perfect - Like staying at the W but without the insane cost. Our room was 169$ a night booked through the hotel's website. It is in a perfect location near all of the great areas. We walked everywhere. There are awesome restuarants right nearby in the up and coming, funky neighborhood of Belletown, like - FlyingFish (HIGHY recommend), Toi, great Thai, Mama Mexico, Assagio (next to the hotel). I absolutely LOVED Seattle, loved the location of this hotel and would absolutely stay there again. The beds were the most comfortable and luxurious I have slept on outside of the W. The rooms are funky, the people are so nice and friendly and helpful. The rooms remind me of a room at a Spa - very calming and serene. The lobby is cool and trendy, yet cozy. The bar is great... The area is perfect - great for walking east to the VERY COOL area of Capital hill, or to the dowtown water front, it is also right near the shopping district and very close to the Space Needle... it's all you could ever want.....

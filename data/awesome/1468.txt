Hotel is in a great location within close walking distance to the space needle and tram, and also offers a shuttle service which due to the limited parking, is a great thing to take advantage of. Staff went above and beyond to make sure we knew where everything was and had some great recomendations for dinner etc.....especially the shuttle driver (younger big male shaved head) he took us anywhere we needed to go! There are loads of resteraunts and bars within a short walk, breakfast spread was huge, only complaint was it was in the heart of downtown so both of the rooms we stayed in were smaller than we would have liked and the rooms didn't have refridgerators but they were clean and serviceable rooms. Anyone traveling to seattle that want to be in a great location with great staff come here!

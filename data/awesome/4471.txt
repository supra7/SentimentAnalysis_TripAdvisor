I booked Capri but paid the extra $$ to escape and stay at Secrets Maroma. This is the best Secrets Resort in Mexico. I've stayed at Silversands, Capri and here. This is one of the best beaches in the world. It's ranked top 10 on Travel & Leisure magazine so don't just take my word on it! It is so clear you can see all the fish coming up to you (relax they don't bite). The food was great, spa was awesome and the service was amazing. No complaints. If you're looking for a relaxing trip this is it. I'll definitely come back and try out the other secrets resorts in Jamaica and DR. A Quick taxi ride to play golf at the Iberostar, so make sure you play there! Nice rooms, great layout and a fabolous hotel. The GM is doing a great job at this hotel. Perhaps he can give some assistance to the Secrets Capri?

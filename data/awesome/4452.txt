I am totally confused by the reviews. We had a great holiday. Loved almost the whole package at the hotel and would not hesitate to return any time we could, but we did speak to one couple who found the food attrocious. Everyone else had the same fabulous holiday that we experienced. Believe what the good reports tell you, as this is an excellent hotel which others have explained very well. There are a couple of things that could spoil your tip. 1 We stayed in one of the penthouse rooms above the lobby and the music that is played all night can be very disturbing when the air con switches off. 2 Some people fail to read the hotel blurb about adults couples and romantic experiences and chose this hotel instead of a larger hotel more suited to their noisy disregard for the usual peaceful ambience others were enjoying before they destroyed the peace. 3 Despite the wonderful staff that make this such a fabulous experience, an item of clothing disappeared from our room, so take care with your belongings. The bottom line is - book it without fear, it is the best hotel we have used to date in Mexico (hotels used before were Riu Yucatan twice - Moon Palace - Blue Bay Ezmarelda)

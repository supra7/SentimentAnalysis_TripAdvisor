Fabulous stay and I'm a very picky traveler...i've used my travelers insurance on more than one occasion to change hotels if they didn't meet my standards. Rooms-nice, comfortable, not terribly spacious-small sitting area and a desk, smallish patio. Only one oceanfront building (building 27) I don't think there's a "bad" room but again only one oceanfront building. Secrets "box" is really cool, instead of knocking for room service the just place it in the box. Pools-only one pool really swim up bar area slightly crowded we enjoyed the infinity pool a bit more. Service around the pool was top notch as it was everywhere else. Don't try putting your stuff on chairs to reserve seats...the pool attendants will only allow you to save seats for 30-40 minutes which we thought was great. Beach-breathtaking and ocean is amazing with angel fish swimming around us. Beach area is slightly crowded too though. Food-breakfast and lunch left a bit to be desired not bad but got redundant. Dinner was typically great with great service as usual hibachi was fun but we enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar within the restaurant even more the next night. Overall incredible experience with unbeatable staff.

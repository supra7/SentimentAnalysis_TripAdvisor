We spent two weeks here as our honeymoon at the end of May, and I cannot rate this place highly enough. A couple of things that may bother some people but didn't worry us were: on arrival the front desk staff did try to talk us into a site tour which invoved a selling pitch for time share but my flat no was taken with good humour, they said europeans never take these tours up, I would imagine a time share involving a 10 hr flight puts most of us off! Second thing, weddings are big business here and the hotel gets very busy at the weekend with large parties staying 1-3 days for their weddings, this means that some areas especially around the infinity pool are cordoned off to other visitors in the early evening. The food, activities, service and grounds are excellent the beach is a wonderful surprise and you can walk for miles before encountering anything else apart from jungle on the beachfront. The entertainment is a bit cheesy in places, which is entertaining in itself, and the daytime cocktails are weaker than those served in the evening, but thats probably not such a bad thing. Don't expect top grade cocktails (except for the margharitas and mojitos) as no fresh fruit is used and you do have to ask for branded spirits, however most bars have the choice of at least 8 tequilas. This is my third visit to Mexico and for a beach holiday of pure luxury this place is hard to beat, there may be more upmarket places or more exclusive places but I doubt that there are more relaxed places. Everyone we spoke to including ourselves are already planning their return trip, and I can't wait! Oh yes and please SMB can we have bendy staws in the beach bar so we don't have to sit up on our loungers to drink our cocktails!

My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel and from the moment we checked in we knew we stayed at the right hotel! The staff was very friendly. The rooms were extremely clean, quiet and pleasantly nice. The location can not be beat as it is close to the water and the market. Our next visit we will deffinately stay here again!!!!

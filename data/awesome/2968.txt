The Hotel Max has a great location and very nice amenities. The room isn't the largest in the world, but it was very well designed and decorated. It has to be the best value in downtown Seattle. The hotel has a pretty hip look and furnishings. But even though I just turned 50, I appreciated the atmosphere and overall vibe.

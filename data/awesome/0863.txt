Loved this location and could walk everywhere we needed to go. We arrived in Seattle late morning and was happy the front desk staff was able to check us into our room before noon time. The room was very clean and comfortable, we were fortunate and got a corner room with 2 huge windows, yes it overlooked the highway, but it was nice to see the beautiful sunrises. The beds were very comfortable and the flat screen TV was great. We liked that there was a mini fridge in the room to keep things we purchased cold. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and always had enough towels and toiletries. The bathrobes were a nice touch. The location was great, just a few minutes walk (10-15 minute) to Pike Place Market, the Ferry terminal, Pioneer Square and some great restaurant options in the area. We rented a car one day and the on/off access to the freeway could not have been better situated to the hotel.

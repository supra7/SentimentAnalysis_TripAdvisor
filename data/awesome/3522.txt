My husband and I along with a group of 20 family members stayed at Hotel Le Crystal for two nights in early July. The place was just beautiful and what a great location! All 20 of us occupied nearly one floor of this luxurious hotel. The rooms were all suites and were amazing, with a large bedroom, separate living/dining area and a good sized bathroom complete with shower stall and separate bath tub. The hotel is very new and has a great, modern feel to it. They even had fancy coffee machines in each room that tape coffee capsules. Staff was also friendly and helpful. Great place, will definitely stay there again.

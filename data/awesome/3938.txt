Just returned from Secrets Maroma. EVERYTHING about this resort continues to be amazing. The staff at this resort are by far the best we have stayed at. From the moment you arrive until the minute you leave there isn't anything they would not do to make our stay perfect. I could not possibly think of one problem in seven days! The weather was perfect, the entire resort is kept immaculant, the beach and pool are outstanding. Our room was cleaned spotlessly every morning and turned down nightly. Dinners are amazing nightly. The Fire Show at the pool was excellant. From the people that made the omelets each morning to the girls in the coffee house that made our special coffees each day and everyone in between, they work so hard to please you... effortlessly. We cannot wait to return.

Rooms, service, food, drinks, entertainment, pools and beach all get an A+ The staff was by far the most friendly and helpfull of anywhere we have ever been. Rather than write a long review i will just say this, You will be hard pressed to find a better All adult all inclusive anywhere in the Myan Riviera. CAUTION: WHEN WE WERE AT MAROMA BEACH ON SUNDAY MORNING NOV.14 AN EXPLOSION ROCKED ANOTHER RESORT DOWN THE ROAD FROM US THAT KILLED 7 PEOPLE. THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING IT WAS "SWAMP GAS" ALL I CAN SAY IS, BE CAREFULL ON WHERE YOU GO AND WHAT YOU DO. Our next trip, more than likely, will not be back to Mexico due to the "swamp gas bomb" Be safe my friends.

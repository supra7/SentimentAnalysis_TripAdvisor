We stayed at the Monaco during a one night stay in Seattle with our daughter and son-in-law. I booked by calling directly and got a very reasonable AAA rate. The service was impeccable, from the valet who quickly assisted us with our baggage and parked our car, to the doorman who greeted us warmly, to the front desk personnel who efficiently checked us in although we were a bit early. Even more impressive was that later that evening when we arrived back from dinner, we were informed that we had missed the complimentary wine tasting hour and were offered vouchers to go have a glass of wine "on the hotel" in their bar. No hotel has ever done that for us before. The lobby, restaurant/bar, and rooms exuded a warm ambience and the location was perfect, as we easily walked a few blocks to Pike Place Market and a huge selection of restaurants. And even more important, the beds were comfortable! We would definitely seek out a Kimpton hotel again in the future.

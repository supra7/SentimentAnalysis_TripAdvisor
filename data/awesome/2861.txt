A terrific place to stay - Central to everywhere, close to Pike's Market and shopping. The service is exceptional, the rooms are very spacious and well laid out and are finished to perfection. I checked-in very early in the morning and Katie (grave shift at welcome desk) was able to checked me in no problem. She is very friendly even though she works the late shift! All of the staffs are so friendly. Thanks to Ms. Jennifer Lee at the welcome desk for making our stay so perfect!

After New Years Day 2011 it's the second time we have choosen Hote Monaco. Its friendly and caring staff as all the facilities and amenities are second to none in its class. Surely the best for tourists and business visitors is the hotel's central location in walking distance to the train station, the ferries and cruise-ships, great shops and many tourist attractions (MonoRail to Space-Needle, Pike Place Market, Pioneer Place, Smith Tower, China-Town, etc.). We're looking forward to come back soon.

Stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne for 3 nights in August. Granted, it's not for everyone, but if you like comfort, convenience, cleanliness and value, this hotel is for you. It's a great location just around the corner from the Seattle Center and close to so many really wonderful restaurants. There's a real neighborhood feel here. Front desk folks could not have been more helpful. So glad we didn't opt for high rise in downtown!

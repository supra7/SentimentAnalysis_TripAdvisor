Stayed three nights, in a corner suite on the 12th floor. If you want restful sleep with little neighbor noise, this is the way to go. Because the suite literally was a corner of the hotel and my little living room was one on side of it, I had no bedroom walls that adjoined neighboring rooms. I know I had neighbors because I saw housekeeping cleaning their room, but I never once heard them. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff did NOT knock on my door at the crack of dawn, and they DID restock my little complimentary toiletries without me having to ask. I would absolutely stay here again, in the same suite. The restaurant, Andaluca, was wonderful. My only complaint there was that it was closed Monday AND Tuesday. Several minor little things...not much counter space in the bathroom, at all. And when they tell you room service is served 24 hours...that means you can get a fruit or deli plate any time. No hot food after 10. The windows only opened about three inches. Another hotel was being built fairly close by, and construction noise started around 0800 each day. But, hey, I wasn't there to sleep in. Everything that mattered to me (comfy bed, peace and quiet, great staff, convenient location) I got.

We stayed at Secrets Maroma last year and loved it so returned again this year for two weeks and again had a wonderful time. All the wonderful things people write about SM are correct. We stayed in an ocean front preferred club room. I would like to commend the staff for their helpfulness and friendliness especially Yessica our building consierge and Esther the evening turn down lady. If you have the chance, walk to your right (facing the ocean) down the beach about 10 minutes. There is a white sail boat moored there. On that boat is a gentleman named Captain Memo. For $40 he takes you snorkelling and sailing for 3 hours. He gets in the water with you and shows you the different life under the sea. We got to hold a spider starfish. He is very protective of the reef. He takes a max. of 6 people. There were 4 of us the time we went. He does 2 tours per day. 10-1 and 2-5pm. It was so relaxing and enjoyable.

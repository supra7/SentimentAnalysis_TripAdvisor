This place has to be one of the best in all of Seattle. It has location, 5 star service, and the beds live up to their reputation. The 24 hour room service is very convenient and surprisingly delicious. This place understand business travelers and one example is the rooms have plenty of electrical outlets and a spacious work area. The fitness room is like going to gym.

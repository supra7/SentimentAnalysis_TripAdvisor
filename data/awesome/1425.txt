The hotel is currently being remodeled. Our room was very nice and newly redone. I'd suggest asking for a room on the 5th street side of the hotel. The other side faces I-5. The staff and everyone was wonderful. The pool and spa are quiet and perfect for a evening wind down. My only other suggestion is to avoid the hotel restaurant. The food was terrible and with so many wonderful restaurants in Seattle, anything is better than the hotel food.

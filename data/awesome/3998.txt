This place was all inclusive which included 24 hour room service, alcoholic beverages, and entertainment. We stayed at the Preferred Club for our honeymoon and it was totally worth it. We didn't even leave the resort because there was always some activites for guests at the resort. Our room was on the top floor and very close to the beach. We had a great view of th beach from our balcony. The rooms are all suites and inlcuded a fully stocked bar and a jacuzzi in the room. Needing a romantic getaway for our honeymoon, this perfectly fit the bill. The beach had beautiful white sand and nice clear ocean. The Secrets Maroma resort was very well kept and modern. The staff were very kind and always helpful. Their service was impeccable and made us feel like V.I.P. This resort is great for couples wanting to relax and enjoy!

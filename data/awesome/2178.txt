The room was small, but nicely decorated, comfortable, and lovely. The bed was comfortable, and the room was quiet. We did not have a room on the water, but we did have a beautiful view of Seattle, at night, despite the parking lot below. We didn't spend any time in the room during the day. The staff was friendly and helpful, the lobby was nicely decorated and comfortable. A business center on the 2nd floor was adequate for our computer needs. All in all, it was a great place to stay.

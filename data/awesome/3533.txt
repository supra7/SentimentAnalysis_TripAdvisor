Forgot to write this review until now. Traveled to Montreal for the first time last summer and stayed for 4 nights at the Le Crystal. Should have stayed much, much longer! The hotel is centrally located so you can walk to Mt. Royal or to Old Montreal. Everyone at the hotel was gracious and accommodating, from the front desk to room service. Room was well appointed and very comfortable. We had a suite with a separate bedroom. Bathroom was spacious - only minor complaints - there was a huge support pillar in the bath in a bit of an awkward spot (I banged my head on it). Also the area under the sink wasn't swept well - my husband cut his foot on some glass from a previous guest. Had this been the US we would have been comped and they would have been mortified. All this hotel did was ask if we needed a bandaid (smile). But, since it was a minor cut, we did not let it overshadow what was really a marvelous trip and experience. I would stay here again.

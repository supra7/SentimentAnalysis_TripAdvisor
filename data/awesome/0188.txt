Absolutely the best service, location, and rooms! We went for a quick getaway for our 16 year anniversary. The surprise bottle of champagne and wine tasting were just a few of the amazing features of this hotel! It seemed very family and pet friendly as well. I work for an airline and we have stayed in many different types of hotels (price ranges) in our 16 years together, and this is our favorite so far! I would recommend this to everyone.....really!

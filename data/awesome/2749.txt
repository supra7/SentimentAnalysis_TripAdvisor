We wanted location - Check. We wanted unique but with a bit of an upscale twist - Check. We wanted a BIG bathtub - Check! We also wanted enough room to spread out, so we tried out the hotel's only luxury suite. It has a separate living room, decorated quite tastefully with a large high back sofa, chaise, & a couple of arm chairs. Enough space for a small get together, with a flat screen t.v. & dual-sided fireplace that actually works! The bedroom is also nice-sized, with another t.v.,dvd player. The bed is sooo comfortable - not squishy, not too firm. And lots of pillows. The dressed 4 posts really make this bed feel formally luxurious. The bath is HUGE ladies. The jetted tub is also really large - totally comfortable for 2 adults, already set up with candles. The separate shower is really nice with multiple shower heads above & below. And the room was always so clean. We were a little apprehensive about the pet-friendly policy meaning we may have a little odor to the room, but this was definitely not the case. To think of drawbacks....well, there's not really much of a view except a slight view of the water between 2 buildings. But we knew this beforehand, so to us, that wasn't a big deal. At night a couple times we heard some sirens down below, but come on, it's the city - it didn't bother me. And we would have liked a coffemaker in the room too...thought it was unusual there wasn't one, but I'm sure if we'd called the front desk they would've gladly brought one up. Otherwise, the room is fabulous. The staff is really great as well. So accomodating, friendly, & unobtrusive. Easy easy check-in/check-out. No problems. We didn't try the restaurant but did hear it was good. If you are interested in staying somewhere uniquely out-of-the-normal-box-hotel experience with a touch of class & good location, this is it.

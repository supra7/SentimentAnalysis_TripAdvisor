We were trying to decide which hotel to stay at. We found several in our price range, but couldn't decide so we went for a Travelocity Mystery hotel. The one we chose was well reviewed even though they don't tell you the name until after you book. We took a chance and ended up at the Mayflower Park Hotel. It was right in the middle of downtown, right where we wanted to be. We flew in and took the Light Rail from Sea Tac Airport and got off within a few blocks of the hotel. The Mayflower Park Hotel is older but beautifully redone in pretty original form. It was extremely clean and the staff made us feel like we were old friends visiting. We were invited to a wine tasting in the restaurant and were served in a first class manner. Our room was nicely decorated and had everything we needed. We were on the 11th floor with a great view of the downtown area. The bed was wonderful, didn't want to get up in the morning, but felt great when we did. We slept with the windows open so we could hear the sounds of the city. The room was very quiet with them closed. This will be our first choice for our next stay in Seattle.

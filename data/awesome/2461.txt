I stayed at the Westin Seattle in April of 2010. I opted for the upgrade of the city view and I was not disappointed. The view from my room was nothing short of spectacular. The window looked out at an unobstructed view of the Space Needle. The beds were comfortable, but my only complaint was the pillows were a little to fluffy for my taste. Still that was a minor complaint, everything else was fantastic. The staff was friendly and gave us pointers on the best places to eat and see. Looking forward to my next stay.

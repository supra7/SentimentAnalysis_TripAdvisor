We stayed here for a couple of nights while visiting and relaxing in downtown Seattle. The staff was great, the rooms are excellent and overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a 1st class hotel at a reasonable price. What we loved the most was the friendliness of the staff and how they made us feel at home.

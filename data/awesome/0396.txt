Can't wait to go back to Seatlle just to stay here! The staff is excellent and I can't say enough about them. Hotel is very clean and you can't get a better location close to the fish market. We had a water view and it was beyond what we expected. Everything is within walking distance. Price was excellent. We highly recommend this hotel and are looking forward to going back again very soon.

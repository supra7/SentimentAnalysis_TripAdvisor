We booked this trip last minute with Priceline and were really not sure what to expect, until I looked up tripadvisor reviews and felt very reassured. Everything others have said was true! The hotel is quite charming, the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, and the location was extremely convenient. It is an old building but nicely renovated and the room was very clean and comfortable, with lovely furnishings, a kitchen and a nice continental breakfast each morning.

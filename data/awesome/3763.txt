We stayed at Secrets Maroma December 11 to 17, it was an amazing trip. All of the staff at this resort go out of their way to make your vacation perfect. The front desk got us checked in promptly to our room, and when we decided we wanted to upgrade to a room closer to the ocean they took the time to show us a few room options. And the valet/bellboys were so friendly and helpful. I apologize for not remembering everyone's name but we do appreciate all their kindness and help. We ended up choosing the honeymoon suite with a breathtaking ocean view and jacuzzi on an oversized balcony. The room was beautiful with a dining table, living room, bar area, indoor large jacuzzi tub and double shower. It was spotless and the bed very comfortable. It was a preferred room and the upgraded amenities were well worth the money. Our conceirge Fabiola was great and attentive to any request or question we had. Room service was always prompt and delicious. We enjoyed breakfast dailly on our balcony. The resort was immaculate at all times. The infinity pool was a bit on the cool side, but the main pool with the bar was heated and very large. All of the bartenders and servers were great, I miss my daily mangomosa! We loved the grill by the pool for lunch each day, fresh chips and guacamole too. Oceana had wonderful seafood for dinner. The beach was beautiful, soft sugary sand, and, again, great service on the beach too. We took advantage of spa coupons that came with our booking and enjoyed a couples massage, very impressive facility. We look forward to returning to Maroma. We have stayed at Dreams Puerto Adventuras with our children and have been more than pleased with AM Resorts. Again, thank you to all the staff at Secrets Maroma, you do an excellent job and really made our trip special.

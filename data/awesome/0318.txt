Got here last night - and found a ''Welcome back in the hotel'', personilized note in my room (last time I stayed here was in 2007, so they must have a very good database). View on the Needle, spacious, clean room. Only thing is that you have to pay for the internet (US$11 per 24 hours). Hotel is located perfectly. Staff (reception, brasserie and room attendants) are very friendly and service minded. Will be back!

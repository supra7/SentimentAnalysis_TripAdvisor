Excellent hotel, got a great price through Expedia. Brand new and spacious hotel room with lovely wet-room style bathroom, huge shower, no bath. Warm, comfortable beds, massive windows overlooking street but very quiet. Good bar in lobby too. Did not have breakfast at the hotel so cannot comment but the service of staff was faultless. Great location for us but depends on reason for your visit - Berlin is pretty sprawling, so check it's near where you want to be, though transport links on doorstep. Highly recommended.

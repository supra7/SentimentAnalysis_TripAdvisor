wanted to take a break from the regular routine in Scottsdale. got a great rate through Priceline to Sheraton Seattle of all places, and knew Seattle was where we were meant to be (I work for an airline so fly standby and the flights looked awesome to get there too). Very classy hotel with somewhat easy (there are hills in Seattle), walking distance to ferries, Pike's Market, restaurants, microbreweries, SEAFOOD, the newly finished light rail, etc. Have to mention the 35th floor 2 level fitness center, pool and jacuzzi with views of the city, harbor, and mountains..... as my wife stated- probably the best facility she has ever had in all the hotels she has stayed in.

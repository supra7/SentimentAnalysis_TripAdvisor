We came to Seattle for the Memorial Day weekend to see family. What a great place to stay. We arrived from the airport around 10:30 and there were no rooms. The staff was great and held our luggage while we explored Pioneer Square. The front desk had my phone number and as soon as our room was ready, they called (It was probably less than an hour). Check in was easy. I have to mention the doormen. They were always friendly and very helpful. All of them smiled all the time. The front desk staff always said goodbye and hello when we were coming and going. The hotel also served free wine between 5-6 each night. What a nice touch. Two of the nights they made wine cocktails and the young lady fixing those was very sweet and pleasant. The room was very comfortable, with a big bath and big closet. I was a member of Kimpton's program, so had free internet. The hotel was close to everything and we walked all over downtown. Very close to the market. If you're visiting Seattle, you can't go wrong staying here. Thanks Hotel Monaco, you made our trip very enjoyable (despite the cold, rainy weather).

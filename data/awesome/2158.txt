upgraded to a balconey/full water view room, the only way to go here. beautiful hotel, reminded me of the ahwanee in yosemite....right on the water, you could jump in. very pleasant staff, great food in the bar (didnt eat in the main restaurant). great location to walking around the waterfront, go to pike place, get to the ferry terminal, etc...we parked across the street at parking garage, too expensive to valet at the hotel. what wonderful sights we saw from our balconey...ferries, cruise ships, freighters, fishing boats, the city skyline, the stadiums, west seattle, bainbridge island, etc...very clean and super contemporary bathroom. also, a really fun bar at night, local musicians and lots of pulse. went for opening yacht day, great event.

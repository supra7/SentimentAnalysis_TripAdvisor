I just came back from my trip to Secrets Maroma Beach (1/22 - 1/29) For my week, I was treated like royalty. The beach was tremendous, a few miles in each direction. The grounds were plush and tropical. Traveling as a single, the staff seemed to pay extra attention to me. Special kudos to the entertianment staff, (Tomas, Marcello, Hector, Giovanna, and Cici), and Portifinos, (Ceasar, Mario, and the wondeful hostess). The only negative, and it was miinor...check-in and check-out could have been less dificult. Muchos Gracias- Rick...aka Simon

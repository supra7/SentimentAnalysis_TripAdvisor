I had the best hotel experience of my life at this hotel! Right beside the Clipper so very convienient for travellers coming from Victoria with no car. We had an ocean view room and cruise ships passed back and forth the entire stay. The lights at night time were a beautiful view from the bed and the shower was amazing with a raining showerhead and glass walls with no door. The hotel was so uniquely decorated. The location is so close to eveything. I only want to stay here when i go to Seattle from now on.

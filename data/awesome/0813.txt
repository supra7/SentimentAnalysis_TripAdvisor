I really stayed here about 8 months ago, but when I noticed all the horrible comments I just had to make my own. The concensus seems that if you're over 40 you most likely won't like this place. It's a different type of hotel, complete with condoms and kama sutra books. So anyone that's very religious might not find this too humorous, while others will think it's hilarious (as did I). Even the art on the walls weren't your typical boring hotel feel. I actually took pictures of this room because I loved it so much. Plus, the most fantastic part about my stay here (besides the great shampoo/conditioner and how the bathroom was designed in general) was the free breakfast! It wasn't your standard old banana with some concentrated OJ. It was make your own parfait, with fresh OJ and even Soy Milk. This is definitely for a certain type of crowd. And people that want something more luxurious shouldn't stay here. People that appreciate a cleaner more modern style should. Plus, it's located in Belltown, which is in walkable distance to Pike Place Market (where they throw the fish) and the Space Needle. Side note: They bought their cool Swiss blankets at the Army Navy Surplus store, which is right down the block from the hotel. Another side note: Macrina Bakery is considered one of the best breakfast/pastry places to eat in Seattle, which is right across the street from the hotel. Hope this steers people in the right direction.

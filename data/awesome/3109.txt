Was in Seattle for a long weekend conference. Friendly staff, clean and comfortable. Good price for the location. Great location in the heart of downtown convention center district. Easy walking to all the tourist spots. When I come back to seattle with my family this summer, I plan to stay here again, in a bigger room.

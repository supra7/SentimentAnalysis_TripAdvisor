We arrived at the hotel at 3:30 a.m. after a long flight with our three tired children in tow. I was very impressed with the lobby and lounge areas. We stayed here years ago when they were undergoing a renovation and everything looked completely different. Prior to our arrival to Seattle my husband spoke with a hotel staff member about whether we will be charged for two nights due to the time of check-in. He was told that he would not be but when we got to the hotel the hotel manager said that he would have to charge us for two nights but will discount the rate by 50% which was fine since the rate was very reasonable. My husband was helped by a very friendly staff member who showed him the layout of various rooms so he could choose which room would be most suitable for us. Since my husband is an SPG member we were able to get a room on the floor reserved for SPG members with a king sized bed and a fold-out sofa bed. It was a fairly large and spacious room with a nice view of downtown and partial view of the bay. It was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large with double sinks. The location of the hotel was very close to nearby restaurants and we even walked to the Space Needle which was much closer than I thought! We easily took the monorail back to Westlake Center, ate at the food court and then walked just a short distance back to the hotel. Furthermore, when we wanted to extend our stay we were able to do so with the same room and great rate as well without any problem. I would most definitely stay here again. Valet parking was pricey but self-parking at a nearby garage was $28.00 per day. Internet is still $11.00 per day which I agree with other reviewers that this seems like an amenity which should be complimentary for a hotel of this caliber.

So I am super late with this review as we went July 2011 but I just felt compelled to say something about this beautiful hotel. My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate our 5th anniversary and we couldn't have picked a better place. The service was amazing. The grounds were gorgeous, the rooms were beautiful, and so on. There is no perfect resort but this one came close. There were just a couple of things I would change. First, of all the food we ate on the property, by far our least favorite was the Mexican restaurant. I have had authentic Mexican food several times before and at Maroma it was just not good. But it didn't really matter because we just went next door to the Italian restaurant after we left and had a great dinner. Ahhh the joys of all inclusive. The rest of the food we ate there was good. I also could have done without the Secrets Club pitch. Although the guy who approached us was pretty cool about us saying no, it still was annoying to deal with 20 minutes after arrival when all we wanted to do was get to our room, change, and get in the pool. Other than those two things, everything was wonderful. The entertainment staff was great, especially Jesus. To sum it up, we absolutely loved Maroma. So much so, we are planning on going back in 2013 to celebrate my 40th. We are going back because the hotel was great but also because we enjoyed the property so much we never left. :) Next time we plan to actually see some ruins, zip line, and do some touristy stuff! P.S. we totally disagree with those who say the swim-up isn't worth it. We enjoyed ours every day. There was nothing better than a late night soak, especially in July when it's super hot.

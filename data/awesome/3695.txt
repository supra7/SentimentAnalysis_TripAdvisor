My husband and I just got back from the most spectacular vacation of our lives. We have traveled the world, and no where have we been treated and pampered in the fashion in which we were at this resort. The service was incredible. From the moment we arrived, our every need was satisfied. Champagne upon arrival, warm smiles, and the never ending "Welcome Home"! I can not imagine a more warm and inviting experience. The rooms were decorated very elegently, but with warmth. The bathrooms, all high end amenities. The room was so amazing, we could never decide to order room service or go to one of the amazing restuarants! The room service food was as good as any of the restuarants, SUPERB! Although this is an all inclusive resort, this is truly an all inclusive luxury experience. We actually had the the opportunity to meet one of the managers, Rafael Cordova. He was over the top! What an amazing staff. Everyday, sushi served in the pool! My husband can't stop talking about the two sushi chefs serving him sushi, actually in the pool, on a beautifully decorated float. The beach is incredible. The water, crystal blue, and the private beds, are out of this world. You can rent a bed for a small fee. Totally worth it! Our beach conceriege, Alajandro, never let a drink get warm, or low. If you want to be pampered, relax, and have an amazing experience, Secrets Maroma Beach is the place! Enjoy! We are definately going back! Planning it now. Thank you Secrets Maroma Beach! FYI, Mario Batali was there when we were! Even the stars are finding out about this place!

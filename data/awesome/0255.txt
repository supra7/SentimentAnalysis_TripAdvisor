My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. The hotel is fantastic. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. A fun quirk - they will put a goldfish in your room if you like. The management is very responsive. During our second night, the people in the room next to us were extremely loud. When I told the manager this in the morning, I was immediately given 1/2 off the night's stay and moved to suite at no additional cost. The hotel location is ideal, within walking distance of the fishmarket, shops, bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying here.

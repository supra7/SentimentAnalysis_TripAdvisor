Perfect location and great staff. Alex checked us in and was friendly and helpful. Rooms are great - not sure why people are saying they are too small. Yes, the bathroom is tiny, but the use of space and storage is amazing. There is also a separate vanity outside the main bath which is great for a couple trying to get ready - an additional walk in closet added to the storage. We were on the 8th floor and it was incredibly quiet. I don't think we even heard another door close! The lobby was bustling, and the fireplace was wonderful. We didn't try the restaurant, but it looked and smelled great. You can walk to ANY of the main attractions from here. Use the parking garage in the 1900 block to save some $$$ over the valet...

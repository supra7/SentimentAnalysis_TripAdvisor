We were in the "better" section (I've forgotten the name of the tower) and were 100% pleased with the decor, amenities, space, etc. We did not book via a discount site -- but rather used a AAA rate of $167 (thus maybe got that "better" room.) I gathered from other guests that rooms in the other tower are older and less desirable. This may account for the varied reviews. The hotel lobby was always bustling, but it never felt crowded or loud. Staff (concierge, valets, front desk) very accomodating and friendly. Location is very good.

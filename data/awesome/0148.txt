My husband had to go to Seattle on Business so I tagged along. Hotel Monaco had a special rate and we love kimpton hotels - so we booked. We were very happy! Cozy room with living room and bedroom, lovely bathroom with great products - our little fishy kevin passed away during our stay (not due to anything we did!) but we managed to enjoy ourselves despite this traumatic experience (totally kidding) This is in the center of everything, staff so helpful - and always love the kimpton's wine happy hour. You will not be disappointed with the stay if you chose Hotel Monaco!

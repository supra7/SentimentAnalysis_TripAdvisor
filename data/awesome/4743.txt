I went to this hotel for my honeymoon and it was awesome. The pool was beatiful. The beach was amazing. The room we stayed in was perfect. Most of the guests there were on their honeymoon or anniversary and the staff was very good at attending to needs without being to pushy. They catered to romantic getaways very well. We also did a few excursions through the hotel and highly recomend the "Trainer For A Day" through Dolphin Discovery. We had a great time and it was worth the money.

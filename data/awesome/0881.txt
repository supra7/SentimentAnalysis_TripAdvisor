I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night on business. I live only about 1 1/2 hours away, but because I had an early morning meeting and traffic can be quite congested, I needed to stay in town. The pluses: I booked on hotwire and was given a suite with a separate bedroom for a great price. The room was immaculate and came with two TVs. The bed was quite comfortable. The extras like the sleep kit (lavender spray, ear plugs and face eye mask) and clips to hold the drapes closed were a nice touch. The food at the restaurant was excellent, and fairly priced for Seattle. If my kids were with me, I probably would have selected somewhere less expensive because there are so many great restaurants in the area. I loved the workout room,-- had great equipment, two TVs and bottled water. The minuses: (1) the location is close to the freeway and comparatively noisy; (2) the location is not as central as most downtown hotels but this is not a big problem becauses buses are freqent and free in the downtown area; (3) even from the 14th floor the view was not very good, I mostly saw nearby roofs and the streets below. Parking: Parking was slightly more expensive here (28.00) per night, but parking is expensive everywhere in the downtown area. I paid $26.00 the next night at the Red Lion. And at the red lion guests can only park until 4:00 pm on the day of check out. I was able to park until 7:00 pm at the Plaza with no extra charge. I would have stayed the next night as well but booked at the Red Lion instead because the Plaza was full. See my review of the Red Lion for comparisons. Instead I stayed a below.

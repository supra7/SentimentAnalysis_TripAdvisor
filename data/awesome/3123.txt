I stay in Seattle about once a year for a conference, and I always stay at the Roosevelt. It's a block from the WA State Convention Center, where the conference happens. Nearby are restaurants, a movie theater, shopping, and Pike Place Market. Location is great, but mainly I like the Roosevelt for its old-school vibe and relative affordability. This is an old, solid building that's been kept up. The carpets and rooms are clean, the bathrooms are updated, the doors close with a satisfying "snick," and the lobby is cozy. Booking ahead, I paid about $135/night, which included parking - a very expensive perk! I've also stayed at the Mayflower, which was lovely, but about $50/night more; and I've stayed at the Travelodge by the Space Needle, which was a lot less, but depressing. This last time, we asked for a fridge, which we got - for an extra $10/night. Hey ho.

I never write reviews but feel compelled to do so this time. I am staying at this hotel currently and have several times in the past. It is the only hotel in the center of the city under $100, nearly impossible to find in Seattle. It is a block from the Westlake Center and a few blocks from Pike Place Market, really an ideal location. No-frills hotel but the rooms are always clean, comfortable, and well-insulated w/ basic amenities including in-room coffee. The housekeeping staff is great and the front desk personnel are always extremely kind and helpful. There is a nice restaurant downstairs and a laundry and fitness room onsite as well. I highly recommend this place and will return again and again!

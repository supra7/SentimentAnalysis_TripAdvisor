We spent a few days touring Seattle before we boarded a ship for our Alaskan cruise. It was our first time in Seattle and we were very glad that we booked this particular hotel. We had a room on the 26th floor which was the concierge level. The room had been updated with lots of nice amenities and a great view of the city. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean (I'm a stickler for cleanliness!). The food in the Concierge Club was so-so, but the friendliness of the staff made up for what the food lacked. I had spoken with the hotel prior to our visit and asked them to book a Town Car to pick us up at the airport. The car arrived right on time, with a very pleasant driver, who handled our bags and delivered us to the front door of the hotel. Before we left for the cruise we wanted to ship home some items we had bought in the city. The front desk staff went out of their way to find us packaging supplies for our gifts and get them picked up by FedEx. Next time we go to Seattle we will be staying at this hotel for sure!

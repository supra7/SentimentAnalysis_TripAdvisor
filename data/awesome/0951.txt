Absolutely beautiful building.....loved the unusual room floor plans - definitely not cookie-cutter! Staff was very helpful and pleasant.....enjoyed our first visit to Seattle.....will definitely be back and would stay at the MarQueen again! It was not a problem for us at all, but the lack of an elevator may be a consideration for some.

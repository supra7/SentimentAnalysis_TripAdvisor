Went to Seattle for business in June and in an attempt to save the company some money I booked a room at the Moore. All the reviews I had read about the hotel were right-on. It is CLEAN, safe, old, and an incredible price. Every employee was exceptional and friendly. I was a little intimidated by the location at first, but after getting familar with the area, found it to be very convenient and safe. I will stay there again.

I have a married niece who lives in Seattle. When I first visited Seattle in order to see her and her then new husband, she and I discussed the hotel possibilities. Of the two or three obvious choices I chose the Inn. I have visited Seattle every year since 2001 and I stay at the Inn as a matter of course. It is a small boutique hotel. its presentation is outstandingly good. Its facilities are first rate. It has no restaurant, but in the same building is Bacco, an excellent place for breakfast, and Campagna, a restaurant seving food of a quality that I have never found to be less than excellent. Its location is ideal: a stone's throw from the celebrated Pike Place Market; surrounded by very good places to eat, (try the recently opened Diner across the street from the main entrance to the Inn); within a comfortable walk from the Seattle Museum of Art and Benaroya Hall, the home of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. A walk of a couple of blocks reaches the monorail that travels back and forth between the Westlake Centre downtown and the Seattle Centre, which contins, among much else, the Seattle Opera and the Pacific North West Ballet. The staff are uniformly agreeable and efficient. The air conditioner in my room was a bit noisy, but given the outside temperatures in November, I didn't mind. I simply warmed the room well and before turning out the light at bedtime, and turned off the A/C while I slept. A top choice

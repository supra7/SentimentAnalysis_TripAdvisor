The Edgewater was the best thing about Seattle and genuinely made our stay in the city. We found a great on-line deal which made it incredibly good value for money, and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and at home. We were upgraded to a water view room which was just magical - fantastic size room with a wonderful view and roaring log fire. And a bed to die for, we had a superb night's sleep every night. The bar and restaurant were both top notch - one of our favourite places in Seattle to spend a cozy evening. The views were fabulous, food top quality and service faultless. If we're ever back in Seattle we wouldn't stay anywhere but The Edgewater.

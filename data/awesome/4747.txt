I returned from this vacation completely relaxed and destressed. My husband and I chose Secrets Maroma Beach to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We were accompanied by another couple who was celebrating their 20th. Neither of us had ever been to an all inclusive and we didn't know what to expect. Our biggest fear could an all inclusive supply the quality we were used to on vacations. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we could feel the fear was unfounded. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Not only that they always appeared happy and never made you feel as if anything was a bother. Our rooms were impeccably kept, and beautiful. The turn down service each evening where the curtains are drawn around the four poster bed is a nice touch. Although the food was all inclusive it was of excellent quality. We enjoyed every restaurant except for Bordeaux, the French one. It was beautiful, but the food wasn't our cup of tea, however, the creme brulee for dessert was fabulous. Although our husbands left the resort to snorkel and to fish, my friend and I did not. For seven days we laid by the pool, read, ate, drank and did water aerobics. The four of us did enjoy a catarmaran a few times which my husband was quickly taught by the staff to use. We went kayaking as well on site. The resort oozed sensuality and a visit to the spa just pushed that feeling over the top. I could think of no better way to have spent my 25th anniversary, at first, we felt like we may be the oldest there, surrounded by honeymooners and younger couples, but soon realized there were plenty of people in our age bracket and beyond, and it didn't matter anyway. I highly recommend this for any couple or couples to go at anytime. I wouldn't recommend this resort for single people. I didn't see alot of them around so unless you are going with a group and not looking to meet other people, I would choose another resort.

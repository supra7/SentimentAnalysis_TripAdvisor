My husband and I just stayed in a King room on the 5th floor and we loved it... The room, the elevator the bathroom and all were small but that added to the charm of the hotel. It is close to and within walking distance to most everything. And the staff was very accommodating, friendly and responsive!! And the beds... amazing... and last but most certainly NOT least... on one night stand I found a laminated card that indicated the ability to choose the "type" of pillow you wanted or needed and on the other nightstand another card that asked if you had a spiritual book preference and gave an extensive list... VERY cool!! And you had the option to save water and not have them daily change your bed and towels. Overall very impressive little touches!!

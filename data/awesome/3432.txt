My partner and I stayed here in February 2008. Decided to write a review as we still think of our break in Berlin with very fond memories. Our stay was made all the more magical by the hotel and by the weather we had whilst there. It would be a shame for others to miss out on a fab hotel and city. It was a very snowy, very very cold Berlin evening when we arrived and we couldn't wait to get to our warm hotel. We weren't disappointed. The heating was on in our room which was really spacious, clean and modern and we were able to warm our selves and our coats/gloves/boots (perfect for the next couple of days which were just as cold) on the huge radiator that covered one of the walls. I spent a lot of time sitting by it! The bathroom was fabulous - slate look floor and walls with a walk in shower/wetroom. Amazing shower! Clean, fresh and modern. After staying at the Lindemann Hotel we realised we could get lovely modern hotels for decent prices, so it has set the standard for EVERY other hotel we now pick! Go to this hotel!

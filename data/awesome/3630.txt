You won't believe what you get for the money at this hotel............. IT is comparable to a four star hotel costing a couple of hundred per night more. Virtually new furnishings, mattress you love to sleep on, sheets new and soft, everything works right and well maintained. Maids do a great job. Breakfast is better than many others and they go through I don't know how many dozen boiled eggs! Bagels, cream cheese, cereals, juice, milk etc............. great way to start the day. Get to know Alan Wirshborn, the Gen Manager........ he is totally helpful and a funny guy! The owner, Chuck, almost trips on his feet to do anything you need (or think you need.... he may be a mind reader!). Hands down the only place to stay while visiting the parks of Orlando. You can take a taxi to the parks or better yet, drive your (rental) car. Ask about how you can park outside the parks and take the free trams in............. save about $14 in parking per day! The hotel is right next door to a great restaurant and McDonalds and a 7-11 for snacks. It could not be better. Thanks for making our stay so pleasurable and memorable. We'll be seeing you again...........Allan, Raquel, Alejandra

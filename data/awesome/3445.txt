I have no complaints after my first stay at Lindemann's: The hotel is just as stylish and smart as it looks on the website. Friendly and helpful staff. Elegant and minimalistic design. Even the breakfast selection was minimal, though still eith a taste of quality. Three different U-bahn stations within 10 minuts walking distance. Bulowstrasse, connected to the U2-line (stops at Potzdamer Platz, Alexander Platz, Stadtmitte etc.) is only two blocks from the hotel.

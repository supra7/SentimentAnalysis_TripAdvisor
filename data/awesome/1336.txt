I stayed here on a business trip that was extended for some personal time and I was very impressed with the property. Its in an ideal location across the street from the public library (beautiful building). Walkable to most of the major sites in downtown Seattle (Pikes market, Seattle Art Museum, Pioneer Square, Waterfront). The cardio center is not much to speak of (1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 1 bike) but other than that, service is great, room was quiet, clean. I would definitely go here again, especially considering its reasonable price for ideal location.

We booked on Travelocity at a most excellent rate (other than parking cost!) and enjoyed the two bed room we were given as I had a cough and didn't bother my husband. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. Had breakfast at the restaurant - the buffet is better priced than the full breakfast on the menu.

Our family booked 3 rooms for New Years. We were all impressed with the service, starting from the front desk. The Managers reception was awesome! The breakfast was Great! The rooms were spacious and clean. We enjoyed our New Years dinner at the Restaurant. Like all Embassy's, this one is worth its value! We all had such a pleasant stay and are looking forward to staying there again!

Secrets Maroma Beach was a beach vacation at its best. The grounds are beautiful and the beach amazing. If you plan to go, spend a little extra on the Club Level Concierge as it is well worth the money. The food was diverse and well prepared. Activities are as much as you want to participate. Even a shopping trip to Playa seems to be classier than in years past. Management has this hotel well run. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

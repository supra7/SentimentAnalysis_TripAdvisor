Stayed at the Hotel Max for three nights in a room that would be small even by Manhattan standards. But the bed was extremely comfortable, and everything was well laid out, clean and attractive. Staff was very friendly, and the room was made up relatively early each day. I completely enjoyed my stay (at a price, including wifi, significantly lower than the "special" rate others were paying at a conference hotel nearby). My only caution is that the "double" room is really only big enough for one person, and the shower is even smaller!

As a solo Canadian traveling through Seattle for the first time I am so glad I ended up at the Moore Hotel! I'd been on the road for a bit and my credit cards were running low, about $70 left on my MasterCard. After being turned away from half a dozen downtown hotels I found myself in the lobby of the Moore. The front desk was understanding and set me up with the most affordable, safe downtown room I could ever dream of! I was able to get a huge basic room with beautifuly clean baths and washrooms down the hall. The location is perfect for the city sights and sounds and walking distance to everything. The Bar staff and regulars were very welcoming to a stranger, being a Chef, I soon realized I was in the after work hangout for the downtown service industry. What would be the chances of ending up in the place I'd be hanging out at if I worked and lived in Seattle? I have a couple Seattle trips planned for this year and there is no doubt where I will be staying. Falling in love with your city started at The Moore Hotel! Whistler, BC, Canada.

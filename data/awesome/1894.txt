The Andra does it right. It's a top notch, big-city, boutique hotel. Great location downtown. Well-designed space with lots of storage, Top quality beds and linens. Clean! Great service, from the front desk to room service. Same-day laundry and dry cleaning, 24-hour room service from Lola. Wish we could have stayed there all week.

I chose this hotel because it was located in the center of our weekend activities and was a reasonable rate. I thought perhaps that we might not be hip enough to be comfortable there but I figured it was only one night so we could just try it out. I was wrong - we loved it! - comfortable bed (hard to find in a hotel!), very nice staff and cool eclectic style. We did discover that while I apparently could sleep in the city my husband could not but since I had read all the reviews I could find we had armed ourselves with earplugs - but the hotel was honest enough about its locale that they furnished these anyway. He used them but I did not. There are plenty of places to eat within 2 or 3 blocks and you aren't far removed from downtown. This was just a one night getaway as we don't live more then an hour from Seattle but we will definitely be going back the next time we are going to the big city!

From the moment we arrived until we departed, we were charmed by every aspect of this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is an easy walk to Pike's Market, the Seattle Aquarium, the warf, shopping, and great restaurants. My husband and I had the two room suit, 'casual elegance' would be the best description of the room. It had wonderful views. We had room service for breakfast, it was excellent food. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else when we come to Seattle.

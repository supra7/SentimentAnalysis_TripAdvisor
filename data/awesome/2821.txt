I had a FABULOUS stay at the W for the past four days. The hotel staff is exceptional, the room was great, and location is perfect--right in the heard of downtown. The service really stood out to me--for example, I was checking in with a friend and we inquired if our rooms were near each other (didn't expect this as we booked separately) the hotel staff said no--but would you like them to be? We said yes, and immediately re-booked us to adjoining rooms! Also, after I left, I realized I had left something in my room. A manager e-mailed me letting me know they found it and asked for my mailing address so he could mail to to me (or also said I could pick it up if it would be easier). The room was really cozy, yet still very stylish and hip! I just had a standard room with a King bed but it came with a wall long couch too. The room also came with a place to plug in your ipod and play music, TV, and a DVD player (which is nice for longer stays as it seems silly to pay so much for the pay per view movies). I love all the Bliss products in the bathroom and the bathroom was very chic and modern. Oh, and the hotel bar/restaurant Trace was excellent. Very yummy drinks and a good late night happy hour! I would highly recommend this hotel!

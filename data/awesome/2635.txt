Great Hotel - We stayed in the new "wing". It was clean and quiet. Everything worked and the beds were comfy. - Parking was easy The staff were very helpful and courteous. You never had to stand and wait for service. The morning breakfast and afternoon snacks were great! The pool was fine: a little shaded, but it had a nice deep end What more can I say. My wife and 2 young kids loved it. We would definitely stay there again.

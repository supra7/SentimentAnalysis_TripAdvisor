After much searching and review reading, I chose the Vintage Park as the hotel to take my husband on a surprise weekend for his 40th birthday. We booked our trip through a vacation package with Clipper travel. From the minute we arrived to the time we left, we had fabulous service. When we checked in I mentioned that it was my husbands birthday and was told they had upgraded our room. After coming back from our dinner than night, we found a bottle of wine waiting for us with a lovely note wishing Sean a happy birthday and hoping that we enjoyed their gift to us. I was blown away. The room was beautiful and very clean. Since we were on the 3rd floor the traffic noise could become a little loud at times but the heavy curtains definitely helped to drown it out. In the mornings there was complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby, in the afternoons there was ice tea and lemonade and in the evenings there was a free wine tasting. Needless to say it ended up being a fantastic weekend to just getaway, relax and reconnect. Thank you Hotel Vintage Park. We can't wait to come back. Krista Dubas

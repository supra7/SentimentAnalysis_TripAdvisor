Being a guest at the Inn at the Market for my first trip to Seattle was exceptional. The hotel staff were more than accommodating, the room was very comfortable, and the location was in the middle of the Pike Place Market area and close to the downtown area. Coffee on the rooftop overlooking the Sound, ahhhh! Look forward to returning to Seattle -- loved the city!

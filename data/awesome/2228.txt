The Sorrento Hotel was the highlight of a recent trip my mom and I took to Seattle. The place is charming, spotless and comfortable, and the staff was super friendly. We had a great time listening to Brazilian jazz one evening in the lounge. The location is not entirely central, but it's close to the Frye Art Museum, which is worth checking out. This hotel is for people who don't need (or want) over-the-top luxury but who dig character, cleanliness, comfort, and staff with a great attitude. I'll definitely stay there again, and have told my friends about it.

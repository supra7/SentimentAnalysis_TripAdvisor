If you're planning a sales meeting, the Roosevelt is the place to stay. Great location, walking distance to Pikes Place Market, and restaurants. We had 25 people stay here and the rooms were great, but the meeting accomodations were even better. We had a personal asssitant with the hotel to help us with any technology and food and drink. Very impressed with the friendly staff and accomodations. This hotel has a buzz that led to a great envirnment for our meeting. Highly recommend you have your meetings here. Areas Sales Manager

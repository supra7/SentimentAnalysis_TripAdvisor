This is an amazing property. I truly enjoyed all six days I spent at Secrets. The hotel is beautiful it is on a beautiful white sandy beach with amazing water. The service is the best I have ever experienced. I never did not have a drink in my hand. The food is good, the drinks are good. It is wonderful. I loved it. It is 100% couple place. I went with thirty friends for a wedding and I would have been totally out of place if I didn't have them. Only go with a date or wedding party.

My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma for our honeymoon - after our wedding at another nearby resort in Mexico. We were so glad we switched resorts to get away from guests and have a great honeymoon! We had a swim out pool room - I highly reccomend staying in one of these rooms!!! The service was great, we even got room service delivered to us at our beach chairs on the beach!! High quality food and drink. Lots of different food and drink venues, most were always open. They were great about showing sports games (Monday night football, world series, etc.). More of an active nightlife at this resort than our other one (Now Sapphire). We had a romantic dinner just the 2 of us in the wine cellar one night - most romantic and amazing dinner I've ever had - spend the money and do it! The beach at Secrets Maroma is AMAZING. So beautiful The perfect blue that you see in pictures. I spent an entire day just floating in the ocean. We did a day trip to Tulum and Xel-Ha. I would have skipped Xel-Ha...take a snorkeling trip instead you'll see more. Only downside is that we felt the resort was really big and not very warm or friendly. We didn't care, we were on our honeymoon and the place is beautiful, but I'm glad we had our wedding at a resort that just is designed to be more open and welcoming. I reccomend this place for anyone who wants to get away and be waited on hand and foot!

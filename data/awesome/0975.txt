We arrived at the Marqueen in the early hours after we moved from a noisy hotel downtown. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly and his colleague delivered a well earned bottle of wine promptly to the room. All of our family and friends were already at the hotel as we were there for a wedding. The location was within easy reach of the Space Needle and many bars and restaurants. We welcomed the use of a kitchen and found the 'little extras' which you could purchase from a basket in the room a nice touch. The staff were always courteous and friendly and turn down service was another nice touch.

Chuck and his team are top of the line. We always stay there when visiting Orlando. Our last trip my son had to be hospitalized with a kidney problem. Chuck and his staff were so accomodating. The Destiny Palms is a home away from home for us we would never consider staying anywhere else. Thier concern for my family has garnered much respect and engendered much appreciation for this Hotel and its staff. Thank you again Chuck for the TLC you have given my family you guys salvaged our vacation...

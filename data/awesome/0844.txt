I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza-downtown Seattle for years whenever I travel to Seattle. The downtown location is perfect. The hotel is spotless, and the rooms are among the most comfortable hotels rooms I have ever experienced. As if that weren't enough reason to stay at the Crowne Plaza, there is one member of the front desk staff who has always welcomed me as though she is welcoming a guest into her home. It is the most wonderful experience, especially on the few times I've arrived at the hotel at 1:00 AM after a long day of traveling. Even though she sees me only once or sometimes twice a year, she always remembers me. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be a sauna, whirlpool, and swimming pool. However, the downtown YMCA is only a short walk away and offers daypasses for about $10. I would recommend the Crowne Plaza-downtown Seattle without hesitation.

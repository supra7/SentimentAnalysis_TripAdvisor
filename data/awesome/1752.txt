We stayed at 6th Ave Inn for two nights after our cruise (our 2nd stay at this hotel). The location is very convenient, the price was good for such a centrally located downtown hotel. The room was clean, comfortable, and has a refrigerator to add more convenience. The wireless internet is free. There were street parking spaces available in front of the hotel that were free for the two days we stayed (on memorial day weekend), so we did not use the hotel's parking lot which cost $15/day. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly for checking in and out and giving local directions. We would definitely consider to stay again if we come back to visit Seattle in the future.

The staff of this small hotel were very responsive and professional. I stayed for about 5 nights while in town for a conference. The location is great - scenic and walkable area. Moments from great restaurants, shops, museums, and the Market. I had a duplex suite with a kitchenette a huge living/dining room and 2nd floor ensuite bedroom. There was enough room for a family (though mine were not with me) and plenty of room to have colleagues over for a drink without feeling like you were entertaining in your bedroom. Furnishings were tasteful and modern, two large TVs, and bath, luxurious. The shared roof terrace is a great bonus - colleagues and I shared a bottle of wine and watched the view for hours. The only downside was the extra scrutiny my expense report received after my bosses saw my posh digs (they stayed at the Marriott waterfront in standard rooms for the same price). One final note - if you are staying anywhere in Seattle, try to get a fridge and coffeee maker (if not a full kitchen) so that you can try out the amazing produce, coffees, and cheeses and bakery items that area available at the marketplace. And be sure to pick up a GIANT bouquet of fresh flowers for $5-15. What a treat.

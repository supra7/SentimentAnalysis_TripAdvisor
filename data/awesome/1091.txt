Fantastic place, especially for the vigorous. If you have even moderate moblity, the MPH is the perfect headquarters hotel for exploring Seattle. You can get from the airport to the Pine street light rail station just minutes away from the front desk - for less than $3. The monorail to the Space Needle is literally through a door into the Westlake Center. Pikes Market, Elliot's, Etta's and the watefront are no more than a 15 minute walk away. Best of all, even if you just want to chill out, the wonderful staff and amenities make the MPH an incredible value. Also, the restaurant Andulsa and the lounge Oliver's are top flight. Been there twice, would absolutely go back again.

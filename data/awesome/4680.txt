We just returned from Secrets Maroma Beach. Had a great time. The food was excellent. Himitsu was the best. The service was excellent. Every staff member would greet you with a smile. Our drinks were never empty. We felt so indulgent the whole time we were there. The spa was superb. My wife and I travel quite often and we cannot stop talking about this place. I cannot understand how anyone could not be happy with this resort. Just book it you will not regret it.

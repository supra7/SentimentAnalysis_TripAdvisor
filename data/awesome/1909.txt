Hotel Andra is a great example of why I enjoy staying at boutique hotels. The room was big and comfortable with a HUGE flat panel television. The hotel had lots of thoughtful details - like a coffee maker in your room (which you think is standard until you find yourself someplace that doesn't offer one) and a whole bucketful of umbrellas right by the entrance to help you brave the Seattle rain. There was also a selection of books on local Native American culture on the lobby bookshelves, which was a nice nod to the Seattle area. Andra's also in the heart of a slew of Tom Douglas (the Seattle celebrity restaurantuer du jour) eateries, of which we tried several. Of the ones we tried (Lola, Dahlia, Dahlia Bakery, and Serious Pie) I would recommend Serious Pie (pizza pie, that is). If you like a good cocktail, skip the Douglas restaurants and try Oliver's down the street.

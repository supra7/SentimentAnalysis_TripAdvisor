I stayed at the Secrets Maroma for a week to attend a destination wedding with friends. First and foremost, the ammenities are superb. Very clean, the room was lovely as was the ocean view. The grounds are meticulously cared for and the beach was immaculate. Second, the service at the resort was beyond top notch. I had a problem with the dress that I had for the wedding and they found someone to fix it for me...for free! Everyone was pleasant, helpful, and gracious. Also, the restaurant captains were the absolute best I have ever seen. This resort is accustomed to dealing with romantic couples and we had several large party dinners...not a problem and our groups were served in a superb and timely manner. The room service was also amazing. All in all, the best resort stay I've ever experienced, and I travel often. One word: GO!

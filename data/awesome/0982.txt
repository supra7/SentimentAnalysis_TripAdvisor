At first I was a little hesitant about staying at the hotel. The hotel itself is fine, but the people at the bar outside can be a little loud. In retrospect, I am so glad I chose to stay. This hotel has some of the nicest front desk people I have ever met. One person, Kris, in particular was fantastic. He always greeted us when we passed by. Even if it was 3 or 4 times in 15 minutes. He was personable and professional and always had a smile on his face. Each night when we walked through the lobby he offered to set up a wake up call for us, instead of waiting for us to ask for one. The rest of the staff was just as good. Plus the location is perfect. Try to get a quiet room because of the noise from accross the street, but if one isn't available, remember that the bar closes at 2am, so it should be quiet after that. I highly recommend you stay at the Mar Queen Hotel.

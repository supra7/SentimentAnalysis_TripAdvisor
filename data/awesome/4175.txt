We enjoyed our stay there. Resort is clean and the employees work very hard. We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. We had our vow renewal on the beach. We had a photographer from the resort take many pictures. The food for the most part was good. The al a carte restaurants are good. We especially enjoyed Bordoux, veal chop and duck were delicious. We did not eat at the Mexican or Japanese restaurants. We upgraded to Preferred Club to have our renewal package included. There are some nice perks. There was 24 hour room service available and we actually utilized that service. Our ocean view from our room was beautiful, the room was very comfortable. The description of the resort and pictures are true. The beach was wonderful. We spent time at both the pools and beach. Again the employees work very hard to keep guests satisfied and happy. My only complaint and it may become a big one is that I left the resort without any of our pictures from our renewal of vows. We had revisited the photographer 3 times during the rest of our stay and they were not able to pull up the pictures from their computer. We left and were told that they would have the pictures available via the web site. So far 2 phone calls, a email have not gotten me anywhere. I now have my travel agent involved. Our adult children also made this trip, 21 and 25. They were upgraded and also had a wonderful time. The drinks kept flowing, we played pool, darts, listened to music, saw a couple of shows. The gym is adequate. In all we had a good family vacation. Andreas the bartender, Freddy the waiter at Bordoux, Fabriola our concierge were very helpful and fun to speak with, as well as Cecilia and Elia who helped finalize our vow renewal.

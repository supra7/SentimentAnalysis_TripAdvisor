My wife and I recently spent three nights at the hotel while we were attending a medical conference held at Swedish Medical Center. Everything about the hotel was excellent. The bell desk and valet parking staff were very polite, quick and efficient. The front desk acted like they were happy to see us and always said hello when we went past them. Our room was beautifully decorated and comfortable and was very quiet and very clean. We enjoyed the Fireside Room for a pre-dinner drink and cheese plate. The Hunt Club restaurant served us a great meal with a nice wine selection. After dinner drinks in the bar were fun. Because of our daily medical meetings we were unable to enjoy the afternoon tea, so we will try to return at a time we can enjoy this as well. Overall, everyone working at the hotel was extremely professional and pleasant and we will be back.

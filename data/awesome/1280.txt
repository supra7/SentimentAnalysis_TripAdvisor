Wow! I thought it was a fairytale to be able to pay $89 a night for a room and for it to have a clawfoot tub, for it to be VERY clean and for check-in to be smooth. Did I mention the soap and shampoo smells amazing. And let's give it a heck yeah for being a very short walk to Pike's Place Market and shopping. Our stay on the 6th floor was absolutely lovely. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

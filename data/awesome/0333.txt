We picked the Warwick due to it's location on the Grayline airport schedule and the hotel price. Once there I was overwhelmed by the level of service. We checked in early so the room wasn't ready. I expected that. It was very early. The gentlemen that stored our luggage was vey helpful. He asked if we had plans for the day, then proceded to supply us with maps and other literature. He became our personal ambassador to his city. We found a similar level of helpfullness from all personel we interacted with. It was a wonderful treat to stumble into such great service when we picked the hotel based on location and price. One note about the Grayline. We picked the Warwick because it is he last pick up on the route back to the airport. This turned out to be a problem. 2 or 3 busses filled up before they reached us and went on to the airport. Had I not already purchased Grayline I would have taken a cab. Warwick employees called Grayline to find out what the problem was. Not many hotels would do that for you!

This is our second time staying at the Sixth Avenue Inn and we loved it even more this time. Our room was perfect, bed comfortable, flat screen TV. Room faced the street but was very quiet. The front desk staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, especially James. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant, but the food was excellent and reasonably priced. Centrally located {within walking distance} to most everything to see and do in Seattle makes the Sixth Avenue Inn a great place to stay. We will be back. Thank you.......Janice and Dennis, Ft.

Our trip to Seattle was made extra special by staying in this hotel. Not only was the location Killer-right in Pikes Market, but, the people who worked there really added to it. They were so friendly and helpful for anything we needed. Plus they were very knowledgeable about the city so the really helped us out with where to go. The rooms were large and clean and there is a rooftop deck overlooking the sound to watch the sunset from. Our room was "partial water view" which overlooked the courtyard but, we could see the sound over the roof of the other side of the hotel. I worried about noise either from the market or the courtyard, but, it was totally quiet.

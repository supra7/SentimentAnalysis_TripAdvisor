My husband and I stay at this hotel whenever we come to Seattle, and we have never been disappointed. The building has a lot of character and the service is always excellent. Also a great location, especially now that you can take the train from Westlake Mall (adjoining the hotel) to Safeco Field - we are usually in town to see the Blue Jays games. It may not be the cheapest but it is worth the price - you get what you pay for! Our only complaint was that the shower head was very low - and being an older property the bathrooms are on the small side.

Spectacular room, excellent staff, and off-the-charts terrific dining experiences. I stayed for four days and enjoyed every minute of it. The Edgewater is one of those rare hotels where you are sorry to leave the premises to do your business, even in a beautiful city like Seattle. I entertained some locals who were blown away by the experience.

This was our first time to Riviera Maya and we were not disappointed. From the white sugary sand beach to the pristine accommodations to the excellent food we had it all. The beach was a stones throw from our balcony and about a two minute walk. The service was always fast and friendly. There was a great selection of restaurants along with a poolside grill every afternoon. Although we did not care to use the spa it was very beautiful. We returned four times to the Porifino Restaurant. This restaurant is a must. Just ask for Julio, he will take excellent care of you (let him choose your meal you will not be disappointed). The only negative thing I could say about this resort is the surprise sales pitch we were given to buy into there vacation lifestyle (more or less like time sharing) Overall a fantastic vacation well worth the money. My husband also did scuba diving,(at the resort) cost of $100 for the course and a 45 minutes dive. He was alone with the dive master his name is Sergio, if you dive with him you will be with the best...

This was the absolute most amazing honeymoon I could have ever asked for. The grounds are exactly like the pictures. It is gorgeous. Do not waste your money on the preferred club because you get all of the best ammenities without that status. The beach is gorgeous. The staff is so helpful and always happy to fulfill your every request. I stayed for 8 days and was so relaxed. They offer plenty to do on the beach and in night life. We didnt participate but also we were not distracted by the night life or activities going on. They cook for you out on the beach it is amazing. The drinks are really good. If you want top shelf just ask for it. The house wine was great. We didnt spend any extra money. We tipped a few bucks everyday and at dinner but it isnt required. The world cafe was great for breakfast and lunch. The french restaurant was so wonderful we went there twice. The entire experience was incredible. The only advice I have is bring your own mosquito repellant. They provide wipes but those little suckers still got to me. That is the only downside. My husband wasnt bothered by them at all but they like me for some reason. Swim out pools are nice but not necessary the pool has lots of room. To get the best beach spot go early. We went right after breakfast and laid there all day. Room service was pretty good...but the restaurants were better. The rooms are perfect for a romantic getaway. I cant say enough...if you have the opportunity to go....GO. You wont regret it unless you have rediculous standards and a bad attitude. It was awesome. My husband and I are 24.

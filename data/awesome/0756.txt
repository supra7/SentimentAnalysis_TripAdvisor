I just returned from a wonderful 4 night stay at the Inn at the Market. The most wonderful feature of this boutique hotel is its location which is literally at the Pikes Pier market. It was wonderful to be able to simply step out of our hotel and walk through the market. From our hotel window we watched as the flower booths were setup, we watched cruise ships, ferries, and the bustle of the market activity. Wonderful. When we arrived we found that our room had only 1 queen bed and we expressed that we would prefer 2 queen beds. They made every effort to accommodate this request and we were given a room with a pullout sofa -- it suited us very well. The room was not large but it was very clean and well furnished and suited our needs. We also enjoyed the deck on the 5th floor which is nicely furnished with deck furniture and affords a great view of the water and the market. 4th of July firewords viewed from the deck are spectacular. We also found the staff to be very friendly and competent. All of the desk personnel are concierges. They booked several reservations and cruises for us. The only area which I felt could possibly be improved was the room service menu. The room service is provided by a restaurant which shares the courtyard called Campagne. We found the menu to be too limited and the items too obscure to be appealling. However it was of little matter since the area that the hotel is situated is surrounded by a large number of restaurants and eateries. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this lovely boutique hotel!

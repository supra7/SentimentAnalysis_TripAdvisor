We stayed Friday and Saturday nights at the Hotel Vintage Park in Downtown Seattle. First off: always check the Kimpton Hotels website for web-only deals and packages, many don't require pre-pay and have just a 24 hour cancellation. We did this and booked a king suite for $163 per night. Valet parking was a snap, if a bit pricey at $30 per night. At least when we stayed, our car stayed in a secure in-hotel garage, and when we needed to retrieve it to head out for dinner on Saturday night and then upon check-out, they had our car ready within 5 minutes. Check-in was quick. The front desk was courteous and did not let on that my partner had a birthday surprise (champagne and chocolate truffles) waiting in the room. We arrived just in time for the complimentary wine tasting in the lobby. The room was large, clean, and quiet. Everything was in order as we always expect, and the champagne that a friend had ordered was chilling. We left for a show and late dinner, not arriving back at the hotel until midnight. All was quiet, even overlooking Spring Street which connects into I-5. Even the Saturday morning traffic did not disturb. The HVP is within easy walking distance of all that Downtown Seattle has to offer, with 5th Ave being one of the most moderate hills in hilly Downtown. We will definitely return and definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.

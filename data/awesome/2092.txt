My husband and I booked a two night three day stay in an ocean view room. We were not disappointed. Upon arrival we were given a choice on different floors and rooms. Our choice was a first floor room with a balcony. Our room sit right above the water. There was a fireplace in the room with a nice updated bathroom. We would definitely return to the Edgewater. The only drawback is the high fee for the parking.

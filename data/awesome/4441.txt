My husband and I got married at Secrets Maroma in an intimate wedding with close family and friends. Before booking, we saw that everyone had great things to say about the resort! I cannot stress enough how much all our expectations were exceeded! Everyone enjoyed themselves, the scenery was breathtaking, the staff was super friendly and extremely accommodating, food was excellent, the drinks were nonstop, and there were plenty of activities for our group to do, beach volleyball being one of our favorites! Special thanks to Val, our wedding coordinator, Roger, and the countless staff that took care of us on our special day! Needless-to-say, we'll be booking another trip there soon, but not soon enough! Wish the snowstorm that hit the midwest strategically kept us in Mexico! Kudos to everyone at Secrets Maroma! See you soon!!!! ;) Your friends ~ Dan & Anne

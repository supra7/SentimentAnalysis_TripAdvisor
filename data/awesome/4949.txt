We have been traveling among the more upscale Adult Only resorts in this part of Mexico for quiet a bit and Secrets Maroma Beach is definitely among the top 2 destinations. The ocean experience is top notch with not a single rock or sea-weed in the water and an absolutely beautiful sandy beach. The restaurants are very upscale and service is very professional and timely. The rooms are clean and spacious with beautifully appointed accommodation; however, construction does allow for some outside noise. Swimming pools are vast and finding space in the shade or in the sun is never a problem for any time of day. Interestingly, evening entertainment in this hotel is also quiet good and compares more to a cruise experience rather than a typical resort.

Secrets Maroma was fantastic. From the moment we arrived until the minute that we left we felt like we had stepped into paradise. My wife and I traveled with a group of 19 for the marriage of two of our friends and stayed from Monday through Sunday. Arrival was a very easy process and we were welcomed with Champagne and a cool towel. The check in process was quick and the lobby area is very elegant. When we arrived at our swim out suite we were blown away. The room was great and the swim out portion was awesome. We were very pleased that we had a semi-private pool. The pool was only accessible from the 9 lower rooms in our building and our party had 6 of those rooms. The dining options are many and though you can get food 24 hours a day don't expect many 5 star meals. The food is good but its not great and some meals left a lot of us hungry and we ended up going to a second dinner. The standout things on the menus would be the lobster tacos and the carving stations that roam around the resort during the day. The beach is phenomenal, clear water, white sand and plenty of space so you dont feel crowded. Bar service at the beach is very good and there are plenty of chairs around the beach. Our only complaint with the entire experience would be that our personal concierge, who was supposed to be available from 9-5 was missing in action for all but our first day there. Since we were there to be in a wedding we did have a need for some help on a few things and we were unsuccessful in getting in touch with our concierge. Our next trip to Mexico will definitely be back to Secrets Maroma Beach. I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.

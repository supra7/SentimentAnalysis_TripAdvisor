The service and friendly demeanor of the entire staff is second to none! The hotel and entire grounds are immaculate. We weren't on the beach the first time for a minute before a friendly staff member asked for our drink requests! Several minor suggestions: we stayed in a junior swim-out suite but probably wouldn't during a future stay. The water was quite cold in the swim-out pool and since it's quite shaded for semi-privacy, it wasn't super enjoyable during the low 80 degree days. I didn't notice hardly any guests using their swim-out pools. During the hot summer months, it might be more enjoyable though. The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that snorkeling is listed as part of the all-inclusive activities. However, we had to pay approx $45 each for a 1 hour snorkeling trip out the reef about a mile off shore. This was sponsored by the watersport activity group who is onsite but charges extra for their water activities which are not included in your hotel stay (jet skis, etc.). The snorkeling trip was fun and our guide was friendly and professional, although we didn't see quite as much as I had hoped (not sure if that was pure bad luck or if we should have chosen a different tour). I can't say enough about the beach itself - the beautiful white powder sand never gets hot (at least in March) and the beach itself is very clean. And the entire staff was exceptional!

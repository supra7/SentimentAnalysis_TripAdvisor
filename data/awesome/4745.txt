We traveled with a group of 10 close friends and had a wonderful time. So much in fact, our group added more for next years visit. The food was AMAZING! We tried a lot of different things during this trip and was pleased with everything!!! While there, the entire group visited the spa for couples massages and it was great. The entertainment crew was also amazing. How often do you go on vacation and people call you by name? They were very friendly and made our stay very fun, exciting and relaxing. We all loved this place and will definately be back next year for a return visit~~~this time with a bigger group of friends

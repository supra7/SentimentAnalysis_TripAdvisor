My husband and I went for a getaway, just the two of us. We fell in love with this hotel. Everything was wonderful, the staff was great. We felt very welcomed. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see. The location is great with lots of restaurants in walking distance. This hotel is beautifully updated. We look forward to our next visit.

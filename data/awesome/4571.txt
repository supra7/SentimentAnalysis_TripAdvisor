Never been to Mexico before. Never been a Secrets resort. Never been to an all inclusive. We'll be back to all three. We took the USAIRWAYS vacations recommendation to try this resort for a little R&R and it met and exceeeded our expectations in every way. The facility is very nice. Great rooms, pools, restaurants. The beach is incredible as is the spa. But what set this resort apart was the quality of the staff. Everywhere you went you were asked, with a smile, if you needed anything. Their response was consistently -- "my pleasure." The activities and evening programs kept you busy, if you wanted, or you could just lounge and be pampered. A great vacation for this 40 something couple who wanted to relax and be pampered. Mission accomplished.

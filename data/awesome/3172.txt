We took a Park'n'Fly package which allows us to stay 1 night and park our vehicle for up to 7 days. This was right by the SeaTac Airport, whereby they had a shuttle that would come every 20 mins, and the valet would park the vehicle while we off traveling. The Front staff were friendly and efficient in getting us checked in and taken care of. Even got free cookies - wasn't expecting that. The building has unique architecture which can prove to be challenging for some to find their rooms. Use the map the front desk provide and you will have no issues. Our room was nice and clean and on the back side (away from street traffic), plus only heard planes when we has the sliding door opened. We didn't have a chance to use the pool, although enticing. We were able to grab a quick bite and coffee at the convenience Starbucks in the lobby on our way out to our flight. We would gladly stay here again!

My fiance and I were in town for a wedding and did not want to break the bank. Thanks to a write-up in the Lonely Plant, we discovered the Moore Hotel. The rate was unbelieveable and the hotel was centrally located to many of Seattle's renowned attractions (Pike's Place market is only two blocks). The hotel was quaint and charming and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We convinced four friends of ours to also stay at the Moore, and they were delighted with their spacious suite. Street noise was not a problem for us and we found the surrounding neighborhood to be nice and safe, with plenty of good restaurants. We all will definitely stay at the Moore Hotel again when we return to Seattle!

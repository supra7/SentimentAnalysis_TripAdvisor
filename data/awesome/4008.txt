We chose the hotel for our honeymoon because of the excellent review on Tripadvisor, but when we got there we saw it was even better than we thought. The rooms are fantastic, luxurious, clean, new and romantic, all made of Italian marble. The bed is huge and very comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The food and room service 24 hours are excellent. The pools are very beautiful and the beach has a amazing hot and colored water. And in the end, the price worth. I believe this is one of the best hotels in Mexico and also around the world. Perfect place for couples, and they don't acept childrens. We'll be back on the next anniversary. The hotel is very large and extensive, so, I recommend that people who are not going to the beach and the pool twice a day to choose a room near the reception, which is the central point, and where are the best restaurants, the outputs for the rides , and computers with free internet. Just a reminder, attention to insects, be sure to take and pass three times a day repellents. Just another warning, that does not refer to the hotel: do not buy jewelry anywhere, especially in Playa del Carmen. We were victims of store Magna Plata, located on 5ta. Av between Calle 16 y constituents. I bought a supposedly silver ring, with sapphires and emerald for $ 350,00, and soon after, in my country, we found that the ring was simply made of ordinary metal, zirconium and green glass. I'm trying to cancel the purchase on my credit card.

May 23rd 2008 we stayed before our Alaskan cruise. Found online and researched the hotel. The best choice for location to Pikes Market and downtown and best value in town by far. We stayed on the 3rd floor, great room-size perfect; daughter loved the clawfoot bathtub. Thought the room was well done and the bathroom was a good size. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Easy to find and reach from the airport. We stored luggage in the morning and came back to check in. Same the next day before leaving-we stored and checked out and then went off walking again. Would stay again when visiting town.

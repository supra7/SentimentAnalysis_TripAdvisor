My husband and I have been married almost 30 years and have been on quite a few vacations during our marriage. However, our vacation in Cancun while staying at Secrets Maroma was the best! From the time we arrived at the hotel we were treated like royalty. Our suite was very elegant...we had two jacuzzi's; one on our balcony overlooking the ocean! The resort offered several top-notch restaurants and also offered room service 24 hours a day! The food was beyond delicious and the tropical drinks over the top. The staff was so gracious and was on hand to help with any request. My favorite part of the stay was the St. Valentine's Day dinner by the pool. It was so romantic! They served a five-course meal which included steak and lobster. As we dined, we were entertained by piano music (the piano floated on top of the pool). If you ever want to be totally spoiled, this resort is for you. It is not the least expensive by any means, but is truly the BEST!

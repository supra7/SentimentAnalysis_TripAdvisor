This was my first experience with Hotel Monaco and I was more than pleased. It was a little piece of heaven each and every day of my stay in Seattle. Loved, loved, loved my chitah bathrobe. The staff could not have more pleasant and helpful. My bed was like sleeping on a cloud...I will definitely be back

This is a truly lovely hotel. The staff was excellent. Greg, the bartender in Olivers Lounge, is a show unto himself. Go and have a martini just to watch him work. Hes unstoppable; a fabulous worker and fun to watch. The hotel is clean, the beds comfortable, and the ambience is relaxing and romantic. I wouldnt recommend this for families but definitely for a romantic getaway or a peaceful business trip. The only issue I had is that there was a small closet in our deluxe room and the bathroom was tight (e.g., the toilet roll holder was practically in my eye!). There was room for a small toiletry cabinet, but they didnt embellish, so there was no counter space. Aside from these issues, some of which are easy fixes, I would absolutely recommend this hotel. Excellent location, too!

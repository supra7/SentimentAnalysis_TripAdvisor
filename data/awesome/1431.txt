I slept wonderful here! I love down comforters and double sheets! My kids loved the indoor pool, and the morning hot chocolate. They left upscale shower samples, not your typical off brands. We got room service for dinner both nights, it wasn't terribly expensive and it actually tasted very good. The parking does cost 21 bucks, but parking is just expensive in Seattle. We got a great deal on the room, so I didn't feel so bad about the extras. We also paid extra for internet in the room, but for ten bucks you get all day internet and long distance phone calls. I would definitely stay here again!

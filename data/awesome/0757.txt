Close to almost everything! I walked everywhere!. It's just a few blocks to Nordstroms, Art Museum, ferries and more. It was fun to walk out the door and be at the market too. We loved the deck, the room was nice and clean and the bed was the best! The chocolates on the turndown were so good! We would definately stay here again. Also we had a wonderful meal at Le Campagne and the waiter was the best.

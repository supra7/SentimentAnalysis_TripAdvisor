Inn at The Market is the absolute most fantastic place to stay in Seattle for many reasons...great location to many of the attractions / Pike's Market / Puget Sound views are beautiful from rooms/and roof top garden!!! Close proximity for walking to waterfront for dining / shopping / great restaurant right on location with Campagne!!!!! Just a quaint hotel that feels much more intimate than the big-chain hotels in the area! The entire staff are professional/friendly/helpful with anything you may need! We will be back next year....again (our third time!).

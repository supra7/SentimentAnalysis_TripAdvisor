I'm a weekly traveller and prefer Kimpton over any other hotels when they have a property where I'm going. Their rooms are always well appointed and the vibe in the lobby is cool. It's hard to beat their wine receptions, and their dining options are first rate. My only knock on last week's room in Seattle was that the desk was a little small. I was able to get everything done that I needed to by spreading out on the bed (not ideal but a minor complaint in the scheme of things). Everything else about my stay was perfect!

We stayed there with our friends for 2 nights. The room was very clean and nice, and the deep bathtub was my favorite. Starbucks coffee is in the room, of course. Most of the stuff are very friendly, and free wifi at the lobby was helpful to find restaurants. I could use my ipad without any problem! The lobby is not too big and very clean, so it's very comfortable. Location couldn't be better... Everywhere is walking distance - Pike Market, The original Starbucks, Seattle museum, the monorail station to the space needle....etc etc.... For ladies, it may be difficult to go straight to the destination though.... because the hotel location is TOO GOOD. There are so many shops around the hotel. BR, Gap, Old navy, Nordstrom, Macys, H&Ms....etc etc. We booked two rooms next each other but we didn't have any issue of the noise. It was very quiet. I definitely go back to Sheraton Seattle!

The staff at the front desk at the Seattle Westin were all extremely helpful and efficient, but Casey King saved my stay. He went the extra mile to help me resolve an issue with my room that had nothing to do with the hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Westin and its many amenities thanks to Casey.

We got a decent price on a standard room with a king bed ($175 before taxes) and stayed a night just after Christmas. The service was impeccablefrom bell hops (do they still call them that?) to the concierge (Sean was really helpful). The decor was gorgeous and the location was perfect-close to shops and restaurants. Excellent hotel- highly recommended!

The main reason for our trip was to see the Mariners play baseball. Yes I'm being serious. We arrived early and they already had our room ready. We paid $20 more per night and up-graded to the ocean view. Man was it worth it. We slept with the window open every night and never got cold with the blankets they provide. Happy hour in the hotel bar is a must,(great prices.) The shower in the bathroom was nice and they provded the best hotel bar soap I have ever had. I only wish that they sold it in the store or online but they dont. The view of the Needle at night was amazing. Someone else posted they heard trains all night. I however never heard a train while I was trying to sleep. If I ever return to Seattle I will be staying at the Edgewater, no questions asked.

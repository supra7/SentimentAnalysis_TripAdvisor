My wife and I stayed at the Inn at the Market for three nights in the second week in August and wished it could have been longer. After a long day of driving up the Oregon coast we arrived late to a courteous staff and found in our room a complimentary bottle of wine. I had booked a city view room but found I had been upgraded to a partial water view. The room was superb, not extremely large but very luxurious. The bed and linens were great though the pillows are very soft. The bathroom is nicely updated and always very clean. I did have some trouble with the shower as the showerhead was a little low but not everyone will have the same issue. The soaps and shampoos are on par with other fine hotels weve stayed at. The staff was professional, helpful and provided good advice on how to get places. The Inn provides numerous snacks and drinks in the room for purchase which didnt seem overpriced, wireless internet is free, and the complimentary New York or Los Angeles Times is a great touch. Its been mentioned in just about every review but the location cannot be beat and it worth the price of the room. It allows you to go to the market before it gets busy, and is close walking distance to everything but the Space Needle and Safeco. The rooftop deck will make you realize that youve spent your money wisely as you get to enjoy what makes Seattle a great city. I would advise going to Piroshky Piroshky for breakfast and Beechers Cheeses for lunch as they are right around the corner and taking both up to the rooftop deck to enjoy a great view and better meal. Overall we were greatly impressed with the luxury and professionalism of the Inn at the Market, would recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle and will stay there upon our return.

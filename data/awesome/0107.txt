We arrived late, 10PM, but felt immediately at ease with the hospitable welcome from the front desk. The hotel is centrally located to everything - Pike Market, convention center, downtown shopping, pier, and right next door to the most architecturally interesting library that I have seen. It's been a while since I've been to a Hotel Monaco, but this visit made me want to book another Hotel Monaco at my next destination. The hotel has a modern hip feel to it. It's clean, and quiet.

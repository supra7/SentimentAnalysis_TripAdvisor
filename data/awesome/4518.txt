I keep reading all the same reviews of how great this place is and i totally agree!! We have stayed at the Ritz, Four seasons, Don Cesar and these are all great places to stay but the Mexican people and this resort stand alone in service and entertainment!! We never had a dull moment at secrets and we certainly did not go hungry and my drinks had plenty of booze in them, You need to be specific and they will happily give you what you want.Not much else to say except if you want five star stay at secrets Maroma!! We may be back next November it was that much fun...

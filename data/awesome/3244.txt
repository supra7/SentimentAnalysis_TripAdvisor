My family needed a hotel room for Thursday May 18, 2006. I walked into the lobby and was greeted with a warm inviting woman. I asked if they had rooms available and she responded yes. The staff was friendly and helpful. We went to our room and it was small but very comfortable. The bed was a pillow -top mattress with down comforter and 6 pillows. The sheets were extremely soft. We had a view of the lake. Later that night we went to the Lounge inside the hotel where they have several computers with free internet access. The waitress was very accomadating while I was researching more vacation plans. She offered crayons and paper to the my daughters and served them each milk (that I ordered) in nice plastic cups with straws and lids. The airport shuttle leaves every 15 minutes and it only takes about 3 minutes to get to the airport. Very convienent when you are flying out at 6:40 am. I highly reccommend this hotel! A gem in the Seatac area. One thing to note, they do charge for parking.

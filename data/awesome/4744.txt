We had our wedding at Secrets Maroma Beach from 7/7-7/12/2010. The staff and hotel were excellent. We really didn't know what we were walking in to but we were pleasantly surprised at every turn. Cecilia our wedding coordinator was fantastic and very attentive. The hotel, rooms, grounds, restaurants, room-service, staff...etc, etc was all very wonderful. The spa is an absolute standout - Ritz-Carlton level of quality. My fiance'/wife and I researched Trip Advisor and other sites extensively prior to booking and the months prior to our trip - all we could say during our stay was "what the hell were the people who complained on Trip Advisor talking about" - they must have been staying at another resort. We had over 25 friends and family attend with us and they were all blown away by this hotel as well.

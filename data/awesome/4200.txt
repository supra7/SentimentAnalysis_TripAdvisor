My husband and I spent a week here for our honeymoon. It was wonderful. The rooms, food, drinks, pools, beach, staff were all great. I did a lot of research before booking here and was not disappointed. Anyone wih a bad review here would probably give a bad review anywhere. I don't think you could ask for anything more of an all inclusive hotel. If you have any worries about booking here let them go. We can not wait to return for our anniversary!

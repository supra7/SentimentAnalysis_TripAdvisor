This resort was perfect in every way. The beach was magnificent, nothing but pure sand, not a piece of wood or stone to be found in or out of the water. BUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Our confirmed reservation for a swim out room was not available when we arrived.After protesting to the manager we finally got our swim out late the next afternoon. In the two weeks we were there we met at least five other couples who had the same problem. I look forward to returning, but not without written assurance from management that this problem will not be repeated.

My wife and I stayed the week of October 3rd - 7th. From the minute we arrived, the Secrets staff treated us like VIPs. We checked into the Preferred Club, met our concierge for the week ("Sandra") and were promptly taken to our suite. Speaking of that suite... WOW. A honeymoon suite in building 17... overlooking the ocean... unreal. The views were awesome (take a look at my pics) The food was very good... the drinks were outstanding and the service was remarkable. I know this is advertised as 'all inclusive' (tips included) but do yourself a favor and TIP everyone. If they provide service... give them a good tip. These people work very hard and a good tip will not only make their day BUT the service will be kicked into overdrive for you. If you are there to relax on the beach... consider renting a private beach cabana for the week. They are located adjacent to the beach bar. Its a very small price to pay for privacy and GREAT service. 'Moises' was our beach butler for the week and he never missed a beat. Again... be sure to TIP these guys. They work so hard. We can't wait to schedule our next vacation at Secrets!!

My husband and I went to Seattle to see a Dave Matthews show, and stayed in the Sheraton (Main Tower/ King) for one night. The Hotel is in an EXCELLENT location. There is no need to rent a car. Get a round trip ticket on The Gray Line bus from the airport and you'll be able to walk or use public transportation for the rest of your trip. We were able to check in early, 11:00 am. I had read other reviews saying to stay in the newer tower, however, I found the old tower very nice and updated. My only regret is that we only stayed one night!

Our first stay at The Edgewater was very pleasant. The view from our room was amazing and the ammenities very nice. Love the clawfoot tub! We would ask for a room facing west next time, as this is the view the Six Seven Restaurant has of the mountains and the bay. Our view was great, but we had half city and half mountain view. We had dinner at the Six Seven Restaurant and enjoyed a breathtaking view and absolutely gorgeous sunset. The artichoke soup was the best I have ever tasted! There is the option to order half portions of the entrees.The half order of the halibut was great! We would definitely stay at The Edgewater again.

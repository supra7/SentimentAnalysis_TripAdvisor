I loved virtually everything about this small, downtown hotel. The decor (modern and sleek but warm), the location, the food (restaurant Lola is divine, try the lamb ravioli), the room (very spacious, every amenity, felt brand new, impeccably clean). My only complaints: the water pressure in the shower was too low, and the water never got hot enough.... and the roadwork outside my window, which sometimes continued until dawn. Truth be told: the upside is so up that despite these issues, I can't imagine wanting to stay anywhere else in Seattle, and will most definitely return!! Didn't even get a chance to try Dahlia or Perfect Pie across the street, which all Seattle-ites I met raved about...

We arrived at the hotel by car and knowingly paid the high valet parking rate (if you don't want to pay it, street park - it's a major city). The Staff were welcoming and the room was available on arrival, despite being early. We passed through the dimly lit hallways (trendy, but I prefer to see) to our room. Spacious room, comfy beds, modern lighting / decor, large flat screen TV, safe, iron & board, small bathroom (shower over bath, not separate). Nice touch was a printer in the room, great for business use. Views are not brilliant, as the hotel is surrounded by other tall buildings. The bar is bustling and trendy, as is the lobby area (free WiFi for guests). Hotel location is great for shops and restaurants. If you are not into trendy style, try the more expensive Fairmont next door. If you like this hotel, I recommend 'Purple' for lunch, a great wine bar just down the road from the hotel and Barolo for dinner (take a cab, it's opposite the Westin but you will need to book).

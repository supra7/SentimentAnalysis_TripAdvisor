This was our second trip in two years to the Riviera Maya. We are in our mid 20's and went with the one hope of finding peace and relaxation. We did and more, although we did find a few minor glitches. I'll start with the bad and go up. We arrived on a Saturday around 11ish, thinking we would arrive and our room would be ready to go. It wasn't till after we waited 4 hours that we realized that check in wasn't until 3. So we spent those 4 hours waiting and sweating until we could get into our room. Although this could have happened anywhere, we had high expectations that the room would be ready when we arrived. Also while we were there, they were doing a filming for promotion so for 2 mornings the pool and beach were closed. We were able to turn lemons into lemonade and booked an excursion and went shopping in Playa, but it seamed as if some of the other guests were a little aggravated by this...especially since they were at 100% occupancy. Finally our last complaint was our swim out suite. We took the advice from other reviews and took our own bug spray, but still the mosquitos were HORRIBLE! Really...really bad! Other than that, the resort was nothing less than wonderful. The food was awesome, the beach and pools were breath taking and the service was top notch. This resort could do something not many places can do. They are able to handle the honeymooners, the young party group, the 40-60 year olds and still make a wonderful time for everyone. We will definately return soon!

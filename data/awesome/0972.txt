I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my partner in september. This hotel is beautiful its an old house which has been converted but has kept so much of its original charm and beauty. When we arrived the receptionist was great she gave us a map and due to the short period of time we where going to be in the city she helped us chose things that we should definately try to see and the quickest and best way to fit them all in. The hotel has a free shuttle service to and from certain tourist attractions and areas which is really handy. The hotel is within walking distance of the harbour, the space needle and pike market. The room we had was huge and had a kitchen area and a small sitting area and a reasonable sized bathroom. The hotel was really clean and although it was full on the days we were there it was really quiet. I loved this hotel and hope to get back to seattle for a longer length of time in the near future and will definately look to stay in this hotel again.

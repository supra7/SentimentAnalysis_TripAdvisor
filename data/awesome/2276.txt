My wife and I checked in after a 4 day drive up the coast enroute from San Francisco to Vancouver. Everything from our check in to departure exceeded our expectations. The room was very nice and the staff was personable, pleasant, helpful and efficient. It is a medium size hotel with great charm and excellently maintained. We recommend it to everyone including family and friends...

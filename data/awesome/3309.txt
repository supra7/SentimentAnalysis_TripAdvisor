Great for business. Near airport, highway, easy to get in and out. Great room service, meal came hot and extra sauce exactly as I requested. Lounge was nice as well. Internet had decent speeds in the evening. Only reason I did not give a perfect rating, bathroom on the 8th floor was a little small, but was ok. Great job to the hotel management. Keep up the good work.

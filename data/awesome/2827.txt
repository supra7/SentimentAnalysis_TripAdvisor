Stayed at the W for the first time last weekend, because we had found an excellent web special. The lobby is currently under renovation (so we missed out on the awesome lounge), we were upgraded as a result. The room was very spacious for two people, had a good sized bathroom with lovely Bliss products. There's also a well-equipped fitness centre, and a car service (which we didn't use but will next time). Our room also had a very generous sofa/window seat with a great view over the harbour.

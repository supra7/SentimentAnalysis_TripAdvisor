I enjoyed my stay at the MarQueen immensely, the reception staff were very polite, professional and helpful. The ambience and scented smell of the reception gave it a very welcoming, warm and homely feel. I stayed in 201 and was right by staircase on first flr so luggage wasnt a problem despite no elevators. Noise from Pesos bar/restaurant outside and Queen Anne avenue was quite excessive, but this was no problem with windows shut. Appreciated opening windows to air con, although AC was quite loud. Bathroom was good, kitchen & breakfast area was large. Microwave, large fridge and coffee machine. No washing liquid and tea towels made using kitchen difficult but appreciated kitchen towels. 10/15 minutes walk from Space Needle. Local Safeway was convenient too.

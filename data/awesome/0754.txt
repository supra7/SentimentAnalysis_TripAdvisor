We had a great 2-night stay at Inn at the Market. We loved the location with many choices for restaurants in walking distance. We recommend the Steelhead Diner right across the street. The room and bed were very nice. The decor is classy and clean. We got a free upgrade to a bigger room with a great view of the Puget sound and Pike Place Market. The room had nice touches to make it comfortable - dimmers on the lighting, nice privacy curtains. Free wireless internet here - always important to me. I hate it when four and five star hotels try to nickel and dime you for such a basic, low-cost service. We really enjoyed the roof-top deck on the 5th floor. We had great weather and it was nice to sit out there with a coffee and snack to enjoy the view. Overall a great, small sized hotel, located in a bustling part of Seattle. We loved it. The rest of my review are tips and critiques to make the place better or your visit more enjoyable: You will probably hear street noise from your room. Expect it. This hotel is located in the heart of the city, so it's not a quiet retreat. I don't recommend bringing a car here. You'll probably have to valet park as there is not much parking nearby. We walked to a lot of places and took taxis to places not too far away. Our biggest complaint was the bathroom. It was a bit cramped and there was not much surface area to set our stuff. The toilet was noisy. The shower was cramped.

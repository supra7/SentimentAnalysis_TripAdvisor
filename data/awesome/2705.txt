I stayed here recently with my new husband for the first three nights of our honeymoon. We had a wonderful time! The first night they upgraded us to the executive suite, where the bathroom was the size of a regular room! They also gave us a bottle of champagne and some chocolates. We got a deal with our booking which included a $20 dining credit to Tulio's with each night, so we ate there one night and really enjoyed the dinner. And every day from 5-6pm they have free wine! The location of the hotel was also excellent. We were able to take public transit from the airport to the hotel. We walked all around the area during our stay: down to Pike Place Market, to various restaurants, and we were even able to walk to the pier for our whale watching tour. I would definitely recommend Hotel Vintage Park!

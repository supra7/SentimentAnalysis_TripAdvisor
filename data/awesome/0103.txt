Wow. What an amazing staff at this hotel. I believe a room is a room and all hotels will sell you a room. What makes a big difference to me is the service provided to you at the hotel. The Hotel Monaco in Seattle has SUPERB service. Truly. The staff is beyond outstanding. Nothing is too big of a deal for the staff at this hotel. It is easy to say "oh well that's just good customer service - but the staff at this hotel gives EXTRAORDINARY customer service to every individual. Example: during the wine reception the staff not only had wine available, but had fresh sangria and water. The staff not only poured what you wanted, but offered other things e.g., pass around appetizers one night, happy hour suggestions, would make dinner reservations while you were drinking wine, etc. The concierge at this hotel was amazing as well! If you have an issue they take care of it IMMEDIATELY (I had an issue with the restaurant twice and the hotel staff was so nice about trying to fix what had gone wrong). I even had the opportunity to meet the General Manager - Mr. Tom - after meeting and talking with him for a bit it was really obvious to see why the hotel staff was so extraordinary. A room is a room, but if you are visiting Seattle, this hotel makes you want to never leave!

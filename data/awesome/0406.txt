I had high expectations of this hotel after reading so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor and seeing photos. The hotel itself in terms of the building and decor were not quite what I expected; it was very understated and minimal. This isn't necessarily bad, just not what I expected. However, everything was impeccably clean. What really sets this hotel apart from many is the outstanding SERVICE that they give. Everyone was exceedingly friendly and any service you could hope for was immediately undertaken. Through their use of earpiece communication they could make sure that information was relayed almost the instant you request it. Being in the high end hospitality industry myself, this is the level of service I expect to see when going to other high end establishments. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and pleasant when bypassing in the hall, not scampering away or hiding behind service trucks. We dined at both Marche and Bacco, their on-site restaurants. Both were very good if not excellent. Bottom line, if you want great service with a clean room and excellent location, this is your hotel. If you relish in the opulence of typical 4- and 5- star hotels, this might not be a great fit for you.

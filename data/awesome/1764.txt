We were looking for a convenient, value-priced hotel for an overnight prior to a recent cruise (May 2010), and found it at the Sixth Avenue Inn. Since we had not previously been to Seattle, we wanted a central location that would allow us to walk to major attractions such as Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. Sixth Avenue Inn is within an easy walk of both. The helpful and friendly staff made our stay there even more enjoyable and memorable. We arrived early and were able to check our luggage in a secure room which allowed us the afternoon to explore the city. Now that service alone is not unexpected in any hotel, but the manner in which it was handled left us feeling welcomed and cared-for. If you are looking for a value-priced lodging to overnight before or after a cruise, I highly recommend the Sixth Avenue Inn.

The Westin in downtown Seattle is a perfect location for any kind of visit. It's steps from Pike Place and a 2.50 ride on the rail from the airport. Shopping is all around you- from a mall to downtown to Pike's. It's comfy, loved the fitness center! It has a great view and a Starbucks is across the street. Okay, it's Seattle- there are StarBucks everywhere! The very first one is a few blocks away. Shop ahead for a deal. Advance rates were the best.

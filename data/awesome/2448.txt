My husband and I needed a room for 1 night before our cruise to Alaska. We wanted to stay in the downtown area but the rates for all the places that I would have wanted to stay at were quite steep, so I took a chance and placed a bid on Priceline. Boy, did we luck out! We took the Light Rail train from the Airport to the end of the line (Westlake Station) and only had to turn the corner and there was the Westin. When we checked in, I asked if there were any rooms with a view and we were given one that had a view of the Space Needle and Pier 66 off in the distance where I could see the docked cruise ships. This hotel is centrally located near shopping, restaurants and walking distance to Pike Place Market and Pier 66. The room/bathroom was clean and the beds very comfortable. The only downside is that there is a fee for internet connection but other than that I was very pleased with our stay at the Westin.

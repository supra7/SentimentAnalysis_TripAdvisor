Le Crystal Hotel made my ten day stay in Montreal simply amazing! Stayed there with two family members in the executive suite which provided enough space for us to move around in very comfortably, and which room service managed to keep tidy and spotless during our stay. It was our first time in Montreal, and the very friendly staff and valet helped with their suggestions on where to go, what to try, etc... The gym helped me stick to my workout regime, and the spa made my nails look brilliant before heading home. Definitely the go to hotel to stay in in Montreal- especially if you're looking for one close to everything.

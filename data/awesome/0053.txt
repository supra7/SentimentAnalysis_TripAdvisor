Oh, ho hum, this is getting really boring. Perfect stay, perfect staff, perfect 5-6 p.m. hosted wine hour, perfect place for our lovely pooch, perfect pillows, etc., etc. The location of the Monaco is just great and, although our puppy wanted some hot toddies at 5:00 p.m., I was the only one permitted to enjoy them. And of course, they are (my favorite word) free, during the hotel's nightly cocktail hour. The next morning, in addition to fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee (yes, there's that word again, free), there was a seasonally-inspired supply of hot-chocolate, which I mixed with marshmallows and a heap of other goodies. Yes, folks, just another perfect two-day stay in a fabulously-run hotel management company, Kimpton Hotels. Would I ever stay somewhere else? Well, maybe if it was FREE!!

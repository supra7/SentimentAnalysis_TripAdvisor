The service was phenomenal! I have never met such nice individuals who go out of their way to make everything perfect. I sincerely do hope the employees receive exceptional pay. Especially the service staff. They were just amazing! LOVED the room! It was very spacious and romantic! The only complaint I have about the room was is smelled of sewer gas, sometimes very strong. The beach was beautiful! The food and drinks were wonderful. We wish the International Buffet was open every evening for supper. Sometimes we didn't have a lot of options. We don't particularly care for seafood, Italian and French foods. The buffet was mind blowing. Everything was excellent and there was such a variety! We were bummed about the prices of the Spa and Excursions. We really did intend on doing both until we seen the prices. And we weren't too psyched about 8 am excursions, we sleep in on vacations. Therefore, we skipped out on something we really wanted to see and do. Absolutely did NOT appreciate being bugged by sellers inside the resort and on the beach, nor during check in. This hotel is too fancy for that kinda bologna. All in all, our stay was "Pure Bliss"! Would stay again.

With my two kids in tow, I walked up to the front desk to try and see if I could check in early. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to but the front desk clerk was so courteous and helpful I am glad I wasn't. He pointed out many areas of interest within walking distance of the hotel, and then called me personally when our room was ready. He also gave my little guy a free movie credit for the night. Room service food was exceptional as well, and seriously, I wish I could have stayed my entire trip there. I would highly recommend it.

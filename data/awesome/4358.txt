We visited Secrets Maroma Beach our 2nd time in 2 years. This resort has us coming back for many reasons. The minute you drive into the resort, you will extremely safe. It is such a long drive once you enter the gates. When you arrive, you can distinguish the difference in customer service from many other resorts we have stayed at in Mexico. They are so friendly, prompt, and very helpful. You can tell they love their job and what they do. The amenities throughout the resort is pure luxury. The rooms are lovely. The decor in the restaurants feels as though you are in a boutique, chic, city in the middle of Europe. The beach is so white and the water on this side of Mexico is so blue. Once again the difference between other resorts we have stayed at down the road do not even compare. The food and drinks were so good. My favorite thing to order in our room for an appetizer each day was the Shrimp Cocktail. It came on a bed of avocados and served with tortilla chips. I loved that they gave you a bottle of champagne when you arrived. It was a perfect drink to have while you were getting ready to go out for the evening. The beach and pool service were wonderful. You never had to leave your lawn chair to get anything. The spa was so beautiful. I had a wonderful 50 min Deep Tissue massage. I was so sad to leave, but will be back. Thank-you for an amazing experience!

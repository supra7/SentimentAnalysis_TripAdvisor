Terrific stay from a very friendly greetings upon our arrival by both the Guest Sevice Agent and the Concierge through and up to our speedy check out and prompt luggage service by the Bellman. Hotel is well maintained and provides excellent housekeeping not too mention superior service. Great Shopping, restaurants and attractions very close to the property. Very fair rates....Not but not least the best coffee in Seattle is served in the lower level of the hotel. We will be back soon.

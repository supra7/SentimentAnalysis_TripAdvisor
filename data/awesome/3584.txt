The hotel is amazing and beautiful. For a U.S. government business traveler using government per diem it is a great price and located within a short walk of many restaurants and entertainment. I received great service and the staff were more than polite. I would stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel without question. Check out their website for great photos of their rooms which are, surprisingly enough, very accurate.

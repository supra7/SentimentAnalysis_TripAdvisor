Beautiful hotel, very friendly staff, excellent conference facilities and super-comfortable room. Great in-hotel restaurant too. Perfect location to check out downtown highlights, walking distance to many places to shop and dine. Just a couple of blocks walk to the monorail station at Nordstrom's and then you're only 2 minutes from the Space Needle and the nearby museums.

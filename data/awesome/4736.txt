We had the best time on our 10th Anniversary. We went to Secrect Maroma at the suggestion of a friend who had been there 2 times with his wife. I can understand why! The service was outstanding. People were very nice and were so welcoming. The hotel was super clean and the rooms were just amazing! We had a swim out room that we used every day if not twice a day. The food was pretty good in some restaurants and outstanding in others. The beaches were clean and kept well. The beach chairs had comforatable cushions and fresh over sized towels. Umbrellas were a plenty. The activities were great! There was beach and pool volleyball, yoga, water aerobics, ping pong, pool, darts, evening shows and dancing. Something for everyone! We have nothing but great things to say about this place! Can't wait to go back!

The Marqueen truly felt like my home away from home for 10 days! It was clean, quiet, and the staff were SO friendly, engaging, and helpful! The location is great, with easy bus access to anywhere in the city and a nice walk to downtown and Seattle Center. Easy Street Records, a great 24-hour market, and great restaurants make staying at this hotel a no-brainer! The continental breakfast was pretty limited, but mattered so little to me since I had a kitchenette and could store/prepare my own breakfast and snacks. I loved Seattle and will visit again! I cannot imagine staying anywhere else but the Marqueen!

This hotel is definitely excellent in value. Previously stayed at a Hilton airport hotel in a Chicago and the setup looks very similar but at cheaper rates! The rooms are nice and big and loved the "park" in the middle. Though, depending on what side of the builidng you are on, there is a train that runs and honks in the middle of the night. Wireless wasn't free but the pool and hot tub was 24 hours. The service could be better. We checked in after 11pm but was locked outside. I had to ring the bell a few times until somebody came to let us in. I asked about how breakfast works and none of the information given was right. It was simply just go and line up and get food. But otherwise, great experience. Would definitely recommend.

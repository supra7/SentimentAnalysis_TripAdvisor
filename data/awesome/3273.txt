After a long night of driving back from Vancouver, I was tired and ready to go to sleep. I decided on the Hampton Inn by Sea-Tac, because I have three requirements when I pick a hotel: Cleanliness, Free Wifi, and Free Parking. This Hampton offers all of these things. I stayed on the fourth floor in a room that clearly was recently remodeled. This was a very very very nice room. I would rate it five star quality. Flat screen TV, Very comfortable bed, trendy bathroom and furniture. No complains what so ever about this hotel. I would suggest any traveler stay here, regardless of the purpose of your visit.

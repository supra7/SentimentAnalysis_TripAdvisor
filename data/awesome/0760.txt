My husband and I stayed at this Hotel for several days. We felt that it was an Awesome place to stay as well as a Great Location! The hotel is right up the street from the Public Market. It makes for easy walking to many of the places in the area where you can eat and also close to the waterfront. The room was nice and the bed (a tempurpedic) was like heaven. I almost hated getting out of it in the mornings! They have a town car and if it is available they will pick you up or take you wherever you might need to go. We used it on the way back to the Amtrak station. I found this out because I had e-mailed them with some questions. I indicated that we were celebrating an Anniversary and the day after we checked in they delivered to us some chocolate covered strawberries, decorated really cute as an Anniversary treat! I thought that was a really nice touch. The Deck on the 5th floor was a nice place to checkout the surrounding area of Seattle. You get a really Great View from the space needle but spending some "down time" on the deck was a nice option for us. We did a lot of walking and really enjoyed our time while we were there. I'd definately stay here again!

I've stayed at many Seattle hotels, and this one is absolutely the best...great staff, unbeatable central location, perfect ambiance. The lounge (Oliver's) is deliciously relaxing whether I'm there with friends or my husband. And you won't find nicer, more efficient people at any hotel; the staff really makes this hotel the outstanding place it is. Try it; you'll love it.

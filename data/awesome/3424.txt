Location is great. Located in Laleli which is a popular shopping area and very close to most popular tourist attractions. The tram station is 3 minutes walk and the Grand Bazaar is 10 minutes walk. Taxi stand is 50m from the hotel. The furniture is new and the beds are so comfortable. The breakfast is excellent. Fantastic selection of seasonal fresh fruits, cheeses and hot meals. My 2 year old son was having so much fun in the roof swimming pool. Everything was perfect and the Hotel staff were going out of their way to assist us. Best value for many and we will ONLY stay in this hotel in future.

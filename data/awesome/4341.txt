Where do I start it was just FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC!!! I have stayed at many all inclusives, particulary in the Caribbean.... This place just stood head and shoulders above all the rest... If I was to start listing everything I loved I would run out of space.. so in very brief.. Service OUTSTANDING.. Rooms lovely (serviced twice a day, we could have had 8 towels if we wanted a day!) Restaurants all fabulous. ( we did go to the two outside ones, the Steak and Sea Food, quite a few times, it was a little more relaxed, and the men can wear dress shorts) the Japanesse Restaurant was fantastic(an experience!) Pool area lovely, however you do have to get up early if you want to nap a prime spot! We were on the Beach all holiday, the waiter service was still as good as sitting around the pool, Beach lovely, was a tiny bit dissapointed in the sea, it was quite cool, ok once you got in!! If I have any negative points, it would just be the Bar on an evening, they usually have live music in the bar from about 18.30-20.30 but most people are eating then, so when you return to the bar after dinner, it's just piped hotel music!! It did lack a tiny bit of atomosphere, it's a shame there was no outside bar with a bit of music.. that is my only complaint during the whole holiday, everything else was just perfect. We will certainly be returning this time next year!

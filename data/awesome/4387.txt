Secrets Maroma Beach is everything we hoped it would be! Unbelievable service and cleanliness, the food was outstanding in every restaurant. Our favorites were the Oceana for their seafood and the breakfast buffet at the World Cafe was excellent! The staff was cheerful and friendly with no exceptions! The entertainment staff made all of the shows very enjoyable! EVERYONE treated us with cheerful enthusiasm and seemed sincerely happy to serve us. That being said, we are middle of the road Americans and have have never been pampered so much in our lives. Thank you, Maroma! We hope to be back soon!

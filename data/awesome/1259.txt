This is the sort of place I almost don't want to tell the rest of the world about. Very affordable and just the basics that you need for a mid-scale urban pedestrian martini-fuelled safari!. The Moore is basically a 100 year old hotel that has been maintained nicely, but not redecorated to keep up with the fashions....it's all nice and clean - no fancy amenities, no bar fridges, no pool or hot-tubs, etc. Our plan was to park the car ( this part is a little tricky) walk to Pike's Place Market, have a great seafood meal (Cutter's - great but not cheap) hit the local pubs - a little jazz or blues....it all worked out perfecto! What we saved on the hotel paid for half the meal...the room had a great view (8th floor facing the ocean) no balcony but huge windows (that open - so careful with kids!!) So close to so many great sites....downtown Seattle is the best walking place!! And the room was quiet.

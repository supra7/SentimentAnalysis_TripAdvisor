I recently stayed at this hotel and really enjoyed it. The room was very clean and the staff were friendly especially in the restaurant. It is a few blocks from the main shopping/business area. If you are coming from the Airport save yourself the cab fare and get the 194 bus for a $1.25. This stops about 100 yards from the hotel

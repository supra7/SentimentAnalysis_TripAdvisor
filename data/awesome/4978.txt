This being our first vacation without the kids in over 10 years we wanted adults only , all inclusive. This was the place to go. The resort had everything you could ask for and more. We had an incredible 5 days filled with sun and fun. We went snorkeling off the beach, took long walks on the beach, so clean and beautiful. We played beach volleyball, water volleyball, had lots of drinks and delicious meals. My favorite was the Barefoot Grill...anything you wanted all day at the pool area. Nightlife was great too...we went to the disco every night , the fire show one night and took a cab to Playa Del Carmen and went to Senor frogs and did lot sof shopping. Maroma Beach is a clean , beautiful beach and Secrets resort is the best kept secret around. The staff was nice and always around to help. I would say to BOOK it now. I can not wait to go back. We felt spoiled and it was like a second honeymoon for us. Thanks you Secrets maroma Beach. ;))) Lisa & Mike Val

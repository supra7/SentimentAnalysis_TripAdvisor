My 6 year old daughter and I stayed here for the week before Christmas. The hotel was great - wonderful staff (especially Chuck!) and the location was awesome - close to everything we needed. Very clean, very safe, very convenient. We will definitely stay here during our next visit to Orlando. Thanks for everything!

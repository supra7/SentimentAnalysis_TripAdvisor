I stayed at the Moore Hotel for 5 nights in early June. The price and location are fantastic. This hotel is within walking distance to many attractions including the market, ferry to Bainbridge Island, art museums, shopping and countless restaurants (including the dahlia bakery--trust me, you need the triple coconut cream pie). Keep in mind that the Moore is an old building. The rooms are simple, neat, clean and have a bit of character (wood trim). The windows look out onto the street, but never was I disturbed by street traffic. The desk staff are incredibly helpful, have good recommendations and are willing to do a bit of searching to help you navigate the city. There is also an attached bar, the Nitelite. This place is fantastic for people watching, attracts an eclectic crowd and has local beer. What more could you ask for? I highly recommend the Moore, a Seattle must!

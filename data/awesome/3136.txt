Wife and I do an annual December trip to Seattle to take in shopping, shows, food, and the city Christmas vibe. Usually stay at the Sheraton, which is no slouch, but saw a special at the Roosevelt for Jacuzzi View Suite. About $50 less than the Sheraton regular room, so had to give it a go. Have always been aware of the Roosevelt and have knocked back more than a couple of martini's at Von's over the years but first time staying there. Awesome, professional, and polite staff; from valet to conceriage to front desk to cleaning staff. The lobby way elegant and decked out with Christmas decorations. Reeks of old school charm you can only find in the older hotels. In spite of concerns from previous reviews, the elevators were fine. The room was huge. His/her robes and slippers. Lot's of stuff other than shampoo and conditioner including bath salts for the jacuzzi. Room was on the northwest corner of the building so had two walls with windows offering natural light. A great view of the city, including the Macy's star. The only complaint would be how much on-street activity I could hear. Especially when the bars closed and you could hear lots of hollering and shouting. I though the window was open. I suspect this is simply because the age of the building and it is not insulated for sound like newer construction. All in all, a 5 star experience. We will return next year.

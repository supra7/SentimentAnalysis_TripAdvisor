First let me start by giving myself credibility. I've worked retail and areas of hospitality for 6 years now. Three in management- and I genuinely bow down to this doubletree by Hilton. Seatac area has no shortage of hotels with easy airport access. The amount of service at the front desk and from all hotel staff for that matter is untouchable. Pule was the gentleman that greeted me at front desk. He was courteous, remembered me from my travel over 6 months ago and created a personalized experience. Everyone knows traveling can be quite an ordeal and these guys really get it! Always have had a clean room ready for me, always attentive and polite service, and always a warm fresh cookie. The little things set hotels apart these days and I will never stay at another hotel in the seatac area. The shuttles are also prompt and quiet. The driver places your luggage on board instead of throwing it carelessly in the back. (as I've experienced in other hotels) I highly reccomend this hotel and am sure everyone will receive as good as service as myself!

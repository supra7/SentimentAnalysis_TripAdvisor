It was our first time to Seattle so we picked the Westin because it looked close enough to everything...and it was! The fish market is within close walking distance as well as some really good shopping. I was pleased with the work out facility and the indoor pool as well. Our room was updated, clean and spacious, with a great view. One thing that always kills me about hotels in cities though is that parking is so expensive. It was $39/night to park.

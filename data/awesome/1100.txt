We stayed her for two nights in May 2011 before setting sail on our Alaska Cruise. This was our first trip to Seattle, and after doing some online research we chose to stay here. Traveling was myself, my husband, my father & mother. We had two Queen rooms that were very spacious, and our room had two queen beds and two bathrooms...LOVED THAT! The beds were very comfortable and the room decor was beautiful and very clean. We ate breakfast both mornings at the onsite restaurant, Andaluca, and highly recommend it. The food was delicious! We enjoyed hanging out in Oliver's as well. The drinks and waitress/bartender were awesome! This hotel is conveniently located downtown within walking distance to many of the major attractions. We walked to Pike Place, the waterfront, aquarium, Macy's, Nordstrom's and even to the Queen Anne district for dinner. This is a true gem in Seattle and we would definitely stay here again! We highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle. We loved everything about this hotel.

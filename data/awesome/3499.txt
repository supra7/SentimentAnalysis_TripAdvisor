This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. Value is exceptional. I had a 1-bedroom suite for the same price as a standard room at the Sheraton a block away; less if you factor in that internet is included. The suite feels like a small apartment. In fact it is a condo-hotel, and you can purchase a suite here to call your own. Rooftop pool is nice. One glitch is I had to wait 15 minutes in line to check in, but after seeing the room (which has a kitchenette and a bathroom the size of a small hotel room), all was forgiven. You will not be disappointed if you stay here... it is reasonably well located on the edge of the CBD, quite luxurious, and very comfortable.

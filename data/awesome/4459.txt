My wife & I stayed at Secrets Maroma in September 2010. I am late in posting my review, but better late then never. I have stayed at just about all of the more popular resort chains throughout the Caribbean & this resort is one of the best that I have been to. Here is my breakdown of Secrets Maroma: Swim Out Suite - Excellent. Nicely furnished with a comfortable king sized bed, Jacuzzi for two, double sinks, LCD TV, & mini bar with beer, water, & soda. You can order liquor & wine as well as food from room service 24/7. The pool off of the patio was awesome at the end of the day & late night. Air conditioning was nice & cold. Beach - Excellent. Private beach with plenty of palapas, powder soft white sand, & crystal clear water. They have a drink service on the beach & also have a menu that you can order your lunch from, which they will bring to you where you are sitting. They also cook fajitas & great burgers on the beach every day. You can also take a short walk to the beach grill & bring food back to where you are sitting. The staff will also bring samples of food to you for you to try if you want. Pool - Nice big infinity pool with swim up bar, but I am not too much of a pool person when I am in the Caribbean. Food - Excellent all around! They have 1 buffet & 6 restaurants, Italian, Mexican, French, Asian, Steak, & Seafood. The Italian restaurant was my favorite & the breakfast buffet was insane. They also have a decent room service menu for every meal 24/7. Bars - They have about 5 bars that all serve top shelf liquor & beer. The drinks where all good. No complaints. Grounds - Beautiful. Staff - Excellent. The entire staff works very hard to make sure that your needs are taken care of at all times. This resort is excellent! I really have no complaints. I like this resort so much that I have added it into my rotation & cannot wait to come back in 2011.

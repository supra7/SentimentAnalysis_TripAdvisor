My only complaint about our stay at the Inn at the Market was that it was too short. I love the location right by the market, with all those restaurants and shops right at your door step. Entire hotel is surprisingly quiet, even the street noise did not bother us at all. Nice and spacious room, huge bathroom and a very comfortable bed.

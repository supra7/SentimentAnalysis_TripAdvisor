This is a nice hotel with good size rooms and very close to the action. It is within walking distance to Safco Field, Pike Place, Capital Hill, Lake Union, Space Needle and the water front. It was nice to be able to park our car for the week and walk everywhere. When we return to Seattle we would stay here again.

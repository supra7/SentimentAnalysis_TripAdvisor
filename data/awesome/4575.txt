We went for our honeymoon, from 20th Sept till the 4th Oct. The first week the weather was pretty rubbish,we knew when we booked it could rain as its hurricane season, second week much better! The hotel was great, we had a normal suite (werent forking out an extra 1000 on what we had already spent!!) Although if we had the money, i think they would be well worth it!! Room was lovely, always clean, fresh towels etc. The bathroom, yes their wasnt much privacy, but it states this clearly in the brochure, and we didnt find it much of a problem. We were usually up pretty early so didnt have a problem getting sun loungers. Wasn't wowed by the beach, it was nice, but have seen nicer in places like Cuba. Food...I am so fussy its terrible. But the food here is great!! I always found something. Loved the Himitsu and Italian and World Cafe great for lunch and breakfast. Ths staff here are fantastic, really couldnt do enough for you, they always say hello etc. Spa was fantastic!!!! Well worth the monsy and the money off vouchers came in well handy!! One annoying thing was the pool volleyball....ole ole ole ole!! Arghhh! Not my idea of relaxing romantic fun!! Overall great honeymoon, 2 weeks just a bit too long xx

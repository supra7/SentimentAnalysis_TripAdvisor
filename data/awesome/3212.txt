I was very impressed with the quality of service I received for my one night stay. My room was in the tower and was nice and quiet. I ordered room service breakfast which was excellent and right on time. Was provided a wake up call and a paper at my door in the morning. Also a warm cookie greeted me a check in as well as a friendly accommodating staff member. I was able to use a computer to do web check in for my early morning flight. Starbucks was waiting for me in the lobby as I left to take my free shuttle. I am a happy camper and will definitely stay again as travel thru Seattle quite often.

We had high expectations based on the Tripadvisor rating and found no disappointments to speak of whatsoever. Most notable was the service and friendliness of staff. Whether at the front desk, the restaurants and bars, room or pool service, everybody went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. Food was not five star but totally satisfying for an all-inclusive. Room service was outstanding. The property and the rooms were clean and well kept. Beach is one of the most beautiful in Mexico but it is weather dependent so plan accordingly. The only downside is that they offer discount coupons at check-in that require you listen to a pitch on time-shares. When will these resorts learn that most people don't want to listen to this?

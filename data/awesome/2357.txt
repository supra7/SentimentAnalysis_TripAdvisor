Stayed here on 12/22 for one night with my family of 5 for some Christmas shopping. Hotel is in the best location for exploring Seattle, with quick access to shopping, monorail, all the sights. We were given a great room on the 43rd floor with an incredible southern view of the city. Staff was very friendly, and gave our young kids crayons and paper to color on during down time in the room. They were very flexible with late check-out the next day so we could extend our shopping and with pool hours as it is currently under renovation (but opened it early Friday morning so the kids could swim). A great stay, and I would highly recommend the Westin for either business or personal travel while in Seattle!

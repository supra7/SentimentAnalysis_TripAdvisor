The staff was exceptional, the food was outstanding, the rooms, beach and pools were straight out of a fantasy. The guest aerobics trainer from Iowa and her husband were also a wonderful additions to the great Entertainment Staff!!! The shows at night were funny, engaging and inclusive of everyone in the audience. The restaurants were great, the Asian themed one was our favorite with a Hibachi entertainment, but the others were just as amazing for the food - Seafood, Steak, Mexican, French, and Italian... all with super selections. We stayed in the main buiding on the top floor so a bit of a walk to the beach, but the views were breathtaking, the sunrise from our king size bed on the balcony was unforgetable.. the gym and spa were also great and on the first floor of our building. I will go back and also recommend this property to anyone traveling to the Riveria Maya without children! One more thing.. their offered excursions to the Ruins, Mayan Encounter, Swiming with Dolphins - ALL OUTSTANDING!

We stayed here on the way home from a holiday visit with family, and were very pleased. Hilton Garden Inn is a name I trust, as all of my experiences with them have been extremely positive. The hotel is fresh, new, and spotlessly clean, and the staff is very warm and friendly; the hostess at the restaurant actually engaged us in conversation. The only drawback--if I can even call it that--was that our room backed up directly to I-95 and we could hear the traffic. This was easily solved by running the fan all night. We will definitely stay here in the future!

The Mayflower is perfectly located within walking distance of all must sees in Seattle. The staff and concierge service could possibly be the most knowledgeable and friendly folks I have had to work with in quite some time. The hotel has this vintage feel from entrance to room. The rooms have size and are very workable for two people. If you need a break the hotel offers a great bar/restaurant for those who are coming back from a long day of touring etc... The mall and monorail are connected to the hotel so getting to the space needle is as simple as going up a few escalators. I highly recommend this Seattle hotel for anyone who is traveling to Seattle for business or pleasure. One can only hope you will enjoy this place as much as I.

I traveled to Secrets for my honeymoon. It was recommended by our travel agent. Secrets Maroma was by far the best hotel I have been to! My husband and I have traveled to many places and this beat all other hotels hands-down. This was my fifth time visiting Mexico, my second visiting the Cancun area...and I would go back to Secrets in a heartbeat. I spent a lot of time reading reviews about Secrets Maroma and I am glad to be writing one for future travelers. Everything about this place was wonderful; the staff went above and beyond, the food was delicious and plentiful, the pool areas were clean and refreshing, and the beach was pristine. This trip will be something my husband and I will never forget. Definitely will be returning to Secrets!

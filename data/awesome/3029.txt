My sister and I came here for my birthday in August and had the BEST stay! What a beautiful hotel! WOW! Amazing service rooms and you are walking distance to all the shops and everything you can imagine. The Sushi restaurant is a little bit pricy but the most AMAZING sushi we have had. The best birthday and the best pricing for downtown Seattle. Highly suggest you stay here!

We booked this hotel on Priceline. It was an excellent hotel. It was close to downtown where we spent most of our time. The hotel staff was very friendly. The room we were in had one queen bed which was very soft and comfortable. The room was very quiet. We did not hear another noise from the hotel the two nights were stayed. I will stay again.

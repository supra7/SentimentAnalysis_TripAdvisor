This is the best hotel in Montreal! The service, the rooms, the Spa and the salted pool in the 12th floor are amazing. We arrived on a Friday afternoon to spend the weekend in beautiful Montreal. One week before the arrival my wife called the hotel Concierge to ask for a reservation at the Europea Restaurant (very close to the hotel). The concierge obliged and the reservation was ready for that Friday. The room assigned to us was big and clean; the big bathroom had everything; the staff is as friendly as you can have anywhere in the world. The location of Le Crystal is unmatched: metro line, banks, shopping, restaurants, parks and plazas all are at a walking distance; even, Old Montreal can be reached by a 15 minutes walk. The only complain I have is the lack a good bar in the hotel. I have been in the nearby Sheraton hotel (no match to Le Crystal) and I enjoy the bar in the lobby. I really think that a bar in the lobby of Le Crystal will add to the great assets of the hotel

We had such a great time at Inn at the Market! My teen daughter's and I were in Seattle for the first time and a very short trip also. We did not rent a car and opted for a car service from the airport that charged $60 for airport pick up. A cab is $50...no brainer! This place is just adorable. From the courtyard with shops and restaurants to the large patio over-looking Pike Market and the harbor, it was perfect. The best part is that it is steps from EVERYTHING! We booked a water view room but got upgraded to a room with a huge private patio. I cannot say enough about the view and what a great place it was to sit morning and night! I really loved my stay here immensely. Comfy beds and pillows(asked for a tempur-pedic pillow and they had them...score!) You will not regret your stay here if your primary activities are in and around the market. Try Lola for dinner. Delicious and casual Mediterranean cuisine. One negative---no pool or fitness center.

Our first visit to Maroma wasn't fantastic, and the GM was kind enough to call us after hearing about our experience and envited us back, to a beautiful honeymoon suite. Our 4 night stay was fabulous, we enjoyed ourselves completly and will be coming back in May with our family. Again, Thank you for your generosity, kindness & making us feel so welcome. Best Regards, Bill and Kelly Tennant

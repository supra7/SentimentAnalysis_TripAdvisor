My review is based on a one night stay as we came in early for an Alaskan cruise. Overall impression was a clean, modern and stylish hotel. Front desk was very helpful and friendly as were the porters who stored the bags for us as we had come in pretty early. Room was nice and so was the bedding. As others have mentioned the bathroom is small but very usable. My only complaint was that I asked to be near the elevator and not right across from it. Wasn't a big deal but would have liked to have been a little further down the hall just to lessen some of the noise (very slight). Ate in Lola's......food was wonderful as was the service. Would recommend this restaurant if you are interested in a slightly Mediterranean type food. If you want to take the Seattle airport transfer that goes to the Warwick.......it is only about 500 -1000 feet from Hotel Andra so if you have wheeled luggage an easy walk. Also, you can catch the Hop on Hop Off bus there so a nice tour of the city. We kind of used it as a bus to get back and forth. Sure there were cheaper options but for us it worked out well. It was a nice stay and would stay there again since it was near shopping, restaurants, Pikes Market, etc.

I have just got back from my honeymoon at the secrets maroma and I had the best time. The hotel is stunning and the service is unbelievable. The staff go beyond their job descriptions to help you and whatever you need they will get you or do it for you. When you're lazing around the pool you have no reason to get up, only to go to the toilet!! They bring you drinks at bedside, fruit skewers and even ice creams to you while you're floating around the pool! The theatre was good and they put on some good entertainment for your stay. The restaurants are excellent, inparticular Himitsu the japanese restaurant where you can have the chef cook your meal infront of you. The rooms are lovely, we had a swim out suite which was amazing for those scorching days when you want to wake up and literally get straight in the pool! The beach was beautiful but we spent most of our time by the pool on the comfy beds! The only thing that we werent happy with was the service Thomson provided for us and we will NEVER use thomson again. We were seperated on our flights even after pre booking our seats online and when we got out there our rep did nothing to help us sort our flights back out. We spent alot of time on the phone and emailing Thomson and nothing was done to help us, just to warn anyone who would like to sit with their partner on the plane journey, Thomson regard sitting one behind eachother as seats together!! Other than that we had a great honeymoon and if you are thinking of booking Secrets Maroma...do it!!! Just don't do it with Thomson!!!

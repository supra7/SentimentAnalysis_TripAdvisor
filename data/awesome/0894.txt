Had a wonderful time My husband and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Royal Suites portion of the Grand Palladium and were very pleased. Here are our thoughts....feel free to email if you have questions about any of the palladium sections. we did a lot of walking around and comparing. FYI-DON'T PUT ANYTHING EXPENSIVE IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE - yes, it seems obvious but we did and unfortunately, by the time we made it back to texas, we realized our camcorder was stolen. the airline has been really nice working with us, but it still stinks.Biggest perks about royal suites compared to other parts of the grand palladium: no kids, guaranteed direct access to the beach/pool and view of the pool, free internet and premium liquor, access to royal gourmet restaurant...overall, generally less crowded with a more mature group of people staying thereBiggest negatives (compared to other parts of the Palladium): the location. most of the a la cartes and the theatres are in the bavaro section...all the way on the other side of the complex. though you could walk it, it might take a good 30 min or more to get over there. there is a tram that stops by the rooms, but it's often full and even then, it takes a long time to get to where you want to go. ______________________________________For those who want more specifics.....Beaches: Fabulous! Probably some of the best we've ever visited. Weather was great and the water was really clear. Yes, you have to play the 'towel game' and reserve a spot at the pool or the beach, but we never had a problem with this. There was always some place on the beach open (and there aren't really any bad spots) or at the pool. Food: we thought it was really good, but we also had realistic expectations. it's similar to what you would find on a cruise. We thought there were plenty of options, and for the most part, we could always find something we liked to eat. We ate at the Royal gourmet, japenese, spanish, and seafood places. They only one we would not give a positive review was the seafood. the service was lacking and slow, not enough menus, the food was way over salted, etc. Plus, even though the lobster was considered 'all-inclusive' at the royal gourmet, it was $33 here. Rooms: We were in the royal jr suite and felt it suited us perfectly. i don't have any complaints. The minifridge was restocked every day, the rooms cleaned every day, we were on the first floor with a balcony facing the pool, we had a jacuzzi tub, a sitting area, nice tv, safe, etc. Activities: we chose to mostly sit on the beach...beautiful and quiet. we went to the shows every night, and though often very cheesy (uh - can we say michael jackson show)...we were really entertained. we went to the spa one day. that was great and the staff was very professional. we went parasailing...way overpriced. wouldn't do it again. we paid $30 to take a boat taxi around the ship wreck, we thought that was pretty cool. we went deep sea fishing with mike's marina. though it was fun, turned out to just be an expensive boat ride because we didn't catch anything. One thing to note....the place shuts down pretty much around 11 unless you want to go to the disco (which was lacking).Tipping: couldn't quite figure this out. we tried to throw down a couple of bucks when we could (like at the restaurants, bars, and spa). It seemed like the only people that expected it were the people we were doing the 'activities' with (e.g. the parasailing and deep sea fishing).Hope this was helpful!

The hotel is really good, rooms are big and confortable as well as the bathroom. Honestly, it was much better than other hotels with higher qualification than 2 stars and a half. The rooms were clean, there is an hairdryer in the bathroom and a coffee machine in the room. Wi-fi internet in the room is compimentary, as well as laundry service in the common area. The service was good, people were never impolite, they help you with what you ask. It is not in the very central zone, but being in the University area means that there are a lot of places to go out for dinner, a coffe or a drink, and the area looked safe. It actually looked much safer tha downtown Seattle. The hotel has a free shuttle service connecting you to both downtown and Seattle center every hour, although it is better to book your place in the shuttle in advance or you risk to have to wait for 1 hour. There is not a very big range of choices for breakfast but it is good. Best: the room and the safe area Least: have to wait for another shuttle (1 hour) to pick me up.

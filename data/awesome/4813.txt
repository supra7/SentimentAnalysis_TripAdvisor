I would thoroughly recommend Secrets Maroma Beach. The resort is amazing with fabulous service. Drinks and food are served to your sun lounger by the pool or beach. The choice of restaurants is fantastic, unfortunately we only had a week and were not able to get around them all. The steak house and staff there were very helpful. I loved the variety of bars, from pool to chilled with games and the more upscale lobby bar. I was surprised at the mix of age groups with a lot of couples on their honeymoon. The resort was very clean and I loved the Iguana's bathing on the rocks by the pool! The resort is quite large yet at times if felt like you were the only people there. The only niggle we had was when leftover food failed to be collected in the secrets box for almost 48 hours, on the 5th phone call it was finally collected. I would also recommend taking your own hairdryer unless you like the one burn setting. Other than that I could not find fault with the resort and would go back in an instant (I wish I was still there!). Oh and despite weather reports from the UK predicting rain for the entire week of our holiday it was in fact glorious weather, very hot with a lovely breeze so don't let weather reports put you off - they lie!!

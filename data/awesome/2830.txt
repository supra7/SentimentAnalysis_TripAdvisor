Went to Seattle for Thanksgiving stayed at the W. Great beds so comfortable, the Ocean and Earth Restaurant had great service and great food. The rooms are a nice size and the staff is very helpful. This was our third time staying at the W and enjoyed it again. This is our favorite place to stay in Seattle.

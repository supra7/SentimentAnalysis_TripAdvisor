I usually try to stay at Starwood hotels because I am a member of their points program. The W Seattle is the hippest Starwood property I have stayed at! From the well decorated rooms, stunning reception, friendly staff, to the wall hung LCD in my guest room... Amazing! I felt pampered just sleeping in the most comfortable bed I have ever had the pleasure of resting on. The mood the the W Seattle creates from the second you Valet your car to the end of the night when you close your eyes is pure chic. Do... Experience W Seattle!

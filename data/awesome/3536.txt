I stayed at Le Crystal last winter with my partner for a week around the New-Year period. I can truly say this gem of a hotel really sets the bar high for other hotels in Montreal. From our arrival the staff was extremely helpful, the room was immaculate, very spacious with an excellent bathroom and the Molten Brown toiletries were very much appreciated. Furthermore, the swimming pool and roof-top hot tub really added something special to our stay. The hotel restaurant, La Coupole too was exceptional. Valery at the concierge desk was really helpful giving us advice on restaurants, bars etc... she really knows her stuff. This hotel is very special and deserves the number one ranking on here. Thank you Le Crystal for making our stay so special.

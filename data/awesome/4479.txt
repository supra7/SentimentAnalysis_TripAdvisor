The primary purpose of my trip was to do a site evaluation for a possible convention in 2012. My wife and I visited Secrets Maroma also to celebrate our 41st anniversary and her February birthday. I was very impressed with the convention facilities for a group of 100 or fewer. Secrets convention space is very good, clean and up to date. I will present this property as an option for our 2011 or 2012 convention. My wife and I stayed a few additional days and wish we could have stayed much longer. The service was outstanding, friendly and second to none. Carlos, our consigner, Kevin and Pablo, the pool attendants were all exceptional and could not do enough to make our stay perfect. This all- inclusive resort has it all; excellent restaurants, terrific service throughout and clean and sanitary facilities anywhere you went. We will be back to Secrets Maroma either with our convention or just my wife and I on holiday. I hate to gloat over Secrets Maroma because people might read this post and it will not be a SECRET much longer. Bill and JoAnn Dallas/ Fort Worth, Texas

I was in Seattle for work and was booked into The Westin Seattle. This hotel was top of the line and had a wonderful staff. Yet the views of downtown Seattle topped everything! The unique design of the hotels 2 towers lets everyone have a wonderful view of this great city. The hotel offers a heated in door pool and a Reebok gym. The location is within walking distance of all major attractions: Pikes Market, shopping and the Space Needle. If you have never been to Seattle I would encourage you to stay at the Westin, I know I will be back.

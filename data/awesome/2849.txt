I've stayed at hotels all over the Seattle Metropolitan area, and the W is by far my favorite. The staff is wonderful, the rooms are fabulous (the most comfortable beds), the amenities are over the top, and you can get pretty much whatever, whenever. The staff is the most professional and the restaurant and bar is great. The location is right in the heat of Seattle and they offer transportation in the city. They have definitely won over my loyalty!

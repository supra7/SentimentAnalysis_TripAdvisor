This is a very friendly small hotel in a gorgeous old building, the staff are very tuned in and helpful, and their smiles are genuine. We got a huge 2 queen room at a bargain price, kitchen and sitting area included. You could go out to eat somewhere great within a couple blocks every night for two weeks and never repeat. We too happened in on the appetizers Thursday evening from 10 Mercer- incredible fig halves on peppered crostini. Despite the busy street, the sealed windows mean its very quiet. Valet parking is easy but it was not hard to find street parking, free from 8p to 8a and then metered in 2 hour allotments. If you want to dine in, the staff will pick up your order from your choice of a couple restaurants or Cafe Ladro for a small service charge. If one had criticisms, the showers, as others have said, are ready for regrouting and recaulking, and the carpet seams in the halls are a bit threadbare in places. The breakfast is weak- but why worry with Cafe Ladro next door for espresso and pastries? We live a couple hours from Seattle and will be back for our next city getaway very soon!

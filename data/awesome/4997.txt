This was our fifth trip to this area of Mexico and have stayed at different "all inclusives" every time. I don't think there is a close second to this place. They make it obvious that they are going to do absolutely everything possible to make your trip great. They are not cutting corners on anything. Every one of the staff seems like they love their job and are happy you selected their resort. The beach is great as is every other aspect of the resort. You will leave this resort feeling like you left friends behind. Our search for the best "all inclusive" in Playacar will stop here. We will definitely come back

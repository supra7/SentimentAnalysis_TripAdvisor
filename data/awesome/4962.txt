We booked six nights at Secrets Capri. We were offered the last two nights of our trip at Maroma. This resort is much larger than Capri and more spread out but the service at this resort is off the charts. We have stayed at four different all inclusive resorts and the service here was the best we have ever had. From the reception and concierge service to the restuarant staff and poolside waiters, any request was met with "no problem". The food was actually better than at Capri and was served more quickly. There is night time activity with nice facilities. The rooms are spectacular. The atmosphere is less intimate than at Capri and there is more of an air of haughtiness at Maroma. But if you are looking for top notch service, privacy, and great fod, Maroma is for you. ONE CAUTION: DO NOT BOOK a penthouse suite. Rooms 1100 through 1102 are directly above the nightclub. The noise is so loud it sounds like there is a speaker in your room. We complained and were moved to another room in a separate building, but if you are looking at booking a penthouse suite, make sure it is not a room above the club.

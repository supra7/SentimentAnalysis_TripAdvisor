Amazing hotel! If you love boutique hotels, that are filled with interesting artwork, stylish decor and a location that is second to none,then this is your new hotel when visiting Seattle! Staff is professional and helpful, rooms are hip and fashionable and the beds are so comfortable! Amazing sushi restaurant that also serves up and incredible breakfast! Wonderful for a couples getaway, business stay, or even playing tourist as I did, with my 17 year old son! We have stayed in many metropolitan hotels, and we did not have any problems with noise, etc. Quick ride from the airport on the Light Rail, and one block from the hotel. Final words, if you are looking for an experience, stay here, if you want typical and boring, stay at a chain.

The hotel was ideally placed near Pike Place Market, great restaurants and entertainment on the water front - all within walking distance. The staff were all most helpful; the rooms most comfortable and the view from the roof garden spectacular! Our other friends in Seattle - 2 couples staying at other hotels - were very envious.

Booked a room a last minute room w/ a travel buddy and couldn't be more pleased. We have been treated like queens. Beds sooo comfy, we walked everywhere, great service. Give Thomas the bartender a raise, he was so friendly and accommodating. It wasn't long til we were engaging and chatting with other travelers from around the world. Love him, and this hotel. Pretty much my go to place in Seattle from here on out!

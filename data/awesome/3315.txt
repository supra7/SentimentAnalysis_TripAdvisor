I would highly recommend this hotel. We used it for both pre and post nights prior to our Princess Alaska Cruise. We were traveling with my parents and our two pre-teen children. The hotel is newly remodled and is soooo close to the airport. And offers free shuttle service. Also, it is 2 blocks away from the new rail system into Seattle. It was $5 to get to downtown on the rail system (which left you blocks from the needle and the market place). They had free computers to access the internet...however, it wasn't the most reliable. We didn't bring our own laptops so I can't comment on that. It was clean and quiet although had lots of people staying there. Our room overlooked the pool and I was afraid it would be really stuffy and smell like chlorine but that was not an issue. The staff at the front desk and resturaunts were friendly and prompt in all requests. We got the breakfast included with our stay. It was sooooo worth the extra amount. It was a hot buffet that would normally be $20 or more per person. It included omletes, seafood, waffles, cerals, yogurts, and fresh fruit plus juice and hot beverage. This is a wonderful place to stay and would highly recommend it.

I surprised my girlfriend with a night at the W to celebrate our anniversary. Although we booked a simple room and obviously werent high-rollers we were still treated as royalty. The valets were great, the staff was friendly and helpful, and when they found out that it was our anniversary they sent up an amazing bottle of champagne. We never had to open a door for ourselves or bother hailing our own cab. This place is well worth the money. The room was nice and the bed was amazing. Thank you Adam S ! He was our W insider and offered us excellent service and plenty of charm. If you are in Seattle for a night, or just want to treat yourself  this is the place to go.

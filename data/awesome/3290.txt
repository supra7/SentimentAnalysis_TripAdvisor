The indoor swimming pool is huge and in the center of the hotel. If you have kids they can swim all they want. In the bar you want Mark as your waiter. He is terrific and makes you feel at home. The restaurants were just remodeled and opened this month, so the staff is getting use to the new menus. Food is very good

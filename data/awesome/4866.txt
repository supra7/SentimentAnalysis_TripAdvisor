This high end all inclussive adults only resort was worth evry penny. The staff was amazing, always happy and couldn't due enough to make your stay the very best. The beach is absolutely beautiful with the pools being no less so. We choose this location to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and we will be back long before our 35th!

We had very high expectations for our resort experience. We went with friends and family. There were 9 of us in our group. We had all done our research and decided to see if everything that was said of this place was true. It was!!! It seemed there were 2-3 people for every guest. The service was unbelievable. The food was incredible. The kindness of the staff and everyone was excellent. All nine of us wanted to stay forever. The water, the beach, the night life, and the service lived up and exceeded any and all of our expectations. I will recommend this piece of paradise to all that will listen to me. It was amazing.

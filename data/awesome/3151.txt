Although I only stayed 2 nights, it felt like home! The staff were extremely courteous, friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this hotel to anyone lucky enough to be staying in the beautiful city of Seattle. The Roosevelt is immaculate in presentation and ideally situated in downtown Seattle. "Vons", the restaurant/bar adjoining the hotel was also excellent, particularly breakfast - the range of food was fantastic and the staff here too were extremely polite. Overall, excellent value for money!

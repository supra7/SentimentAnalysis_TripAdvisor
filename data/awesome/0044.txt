A truly beautiful hotel with the appointments that make it uniquely Kimpton. The Monaco Seattle was fantastic in every sense. The location provided for superior ease - whether to go down to the water, Pike's Place Market or walking distance to great restaurants and bars - perfect after business meetings for dining and exercise. Nearby shopping looked exellent but this was a business trip so I made note for future trips. While so close to many things, the doorman was fantastic and quick to offer assistance in providing car service to the airport upon our departure. The room was spacious and left no detail needed. Warm, soft sheets & covers and a superbly comfortable bed in a very clean room. The suite has plenty of room for two and was quite large for one. A nice set-up for working allowed me to conduct business and spread out. Plush towels and robes with a nicely done bathroom topped it off. The complimentary morning coffee and hot chocolate bar in the lobby was fantastic in the morning as was the wine in the evening. While we missed dining in the restaurant it looked divine and my travel colleague had been several times and sang its praises. The decor was gorgeous - and it completely lent itself to the holiday decorating that was classy and not ostentatious. Service was good and the business center had brand new Mac desktops; I had visited to print our boarding passes. I also poked around on the lower floor and would recommend this hotel for business / corporate meetings as well. A nice surprise after arriving home - the manager followed up with personal email. Kimpton does it right and the Monaco Seattle underlined it yet again. While they have two other hotels in the area that I have heard are great, I will defiitely return to the Monaco as it felt comfortable and elegant - and I felt appreciated as a guest.

My husband and I just returned from Secrets Maroma for the first time. We stayed 5 days and it was absolutely HEAVEN. The resort was so beautiful it was almost unreal. the food was top notch. we really enjoyed the grill by the pool and the breakfast buffet in the world cafe is unlike any we have ever seen!! The beach is really breathtaking and the water is like bath water. We spent about half the time around the pool and half the time at the beach, but next time we would rather be more at the beach just because it really is amazing. We enjoyed swimming and the drinks were great. I would suggest their mojitos, they were awesome! All in all we had the best vacation we could have ever dreamed of. We are already planning on returning next year. Im not sure that any other resort would compare to this one.

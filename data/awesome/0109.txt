We stayed here the night before our Alaska cruise. It is a great hotel and very family friendly. The location is a few blocks from Pike's Market and about a 20 min walk or so from the Space Needle. The staff was very friendly. They allowed us to store our luggage while we did some sightseeing and even called when our room was ready. PS - only negative is that the restaurant was pricey for breakfast

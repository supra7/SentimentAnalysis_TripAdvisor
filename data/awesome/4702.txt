Secrets Maroma Beach is an incredible resort to stay at. Even though the time of year does not always promise the best weather, we have been more than satisfied with the accommodations and the resort staff to be prepared in case of inclement weather. The service is excellent, you will never go thirsty, or hungry for that matter. The food there is incredible. There is a variety in dining selection and no reservations are needed except for the Hibachi grills at HImatsu, the Japanese restaurant. There are many honeymooners, wedding parties, and anniversaries being celebrated too! For those who like the beach, it has the most beautiful beaches. The white sand and blue water provide one of the best beaches we have been too. Again, service on the beach is great and there are activities throughout the day if you choose to participate. The fitness room is small, but if you time it right, it is more than enough for a vacation workout. I cannot say enough about this location/property. We have come to compare anywhere else we travel against Maroma, and so far nothing has come even close.

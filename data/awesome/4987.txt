Totally superlative! The food was terrific! The room beautiful and spacious, had every amenity we needed. The entire layout was spacious and exquisite. I'm totally impressed with the service. EVERY employee we had contact with was gracious and helpful. The spa experience was to DIE for. Such luxury and pampering! Water features and decor throughout very tasteful, nothing gaudy or overdone. The beach was sugary white, well kept and expansive. And the coup de grace was the pools. Ahhhhh.... the lap of luxury. we enjoyed some of the entrtainment offered, the tequila tasting, yoga classes, evening shows... the ambience is quiet and laid back. not too rowdy. The one and only drawback was the folks we were traveling with from the airport in the Grey Line van, And only becasue THEY kept noisily complaining about not getting a private trip! Not going to let some grumblers mar an otherwise totally impeccable vacation.

The W might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you love style and something different, this could be the place for you. Other reviews have described the striking decor and style of service, so I won't repeat it here. I found the style a bit over the top but still a pleasant change from the corporate sameness of other upscale hotels. The staff was very attentive to meeting all my needs and even remembered my name. The valet promptly delivered the car whenever I needed it, although many attractions are within walking distance (Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the Seattle Art Museum, etc.). We were given a top floor room even though the discount we received only entitled us to floors in the lower half of the hotel. The beds are as comfortable as advertised. The window couch was comfortable and such a great idea one wonders why other hotels haven't copied this idea. The bathroom was excellent. This is a great hotel and if you can get a decent price, take advantage of it.

Overall, our trip was outstanding. The staff and service was wonderful. Everyone was warm and friendly, and really did the best they could to ensure we were enjoying our stay. The cleanliness was spectacular. There were constantly people keeping the place tidy by picking up empty glasses, sweeping sandy walkways, and restocking public areas such as bathrooms and towel supplies. The food was fantastic.It was always warm, fresh, and delicious. We didnt eat a thing we didnt enjoy all week. The only thing about the resort we didnt enjoy was the pool and beach chair reservations. My husband and I would arrive at the pool between 8-830 each morning, and each morning over half the chairs would already be reserved by having a book or a hat tossed on them, and there would be no other guests by the pool yet. Many days we would sit by the pool and it would be noon before the people who reserved chairs next to us would show up. We didn't think it was right for the people to be showing up at nine or ten to not be able to find a lounge by the pool, when people were simply rolling out of bed at 7am to throw a book on a chair, then going back to bed, breakfast, and whatever else, and not returning till noon.

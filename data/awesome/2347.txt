The Westin felt just right for a great visit to Seattle! It was a very clean and comfortable hotel with above average accommodations and amenities. The monorail was just a block away for a quick ride to the Space Needle and the very interesting Pike Place Market at the waterfront was an enjoyable 15 minute walk. The restaurant in the hotel was outstanding, but there were also numerous choices within a short walk. The concierge was a great help in providing guidance, even when it involved competing options.

My partner and I stayed 14 days at the Secrets Maroma back in July 2011 and had a wonderful time. We can safely say this was the best all inclusive holiday resort we have visited by a long shot. The hotel itself was very beautiful and clean. The pool area and general gardens were also very beautiful and well maintained (they've got lots of staff making sure everything is always clean). We had some beautiful views of the sea and beach from our room (building 17 - beach front room on the 1st floor). Our room was very spacious and was perfect for our stay. The beach and sea are absolutely beautiful at Secrets Maroma and definitely worth staying at the resort just for that alone. There are plenty of activities on the beach to keep you busy and if you like to keep active or just like to chill whilst on holiday, there is plenty for everyone to do. The restaurant staff were are very polite and professional. Our favourite restaurant was the Japanese, French and Italian - the food was great in all three particularly the sushi at the Japanese!! The pool/beach staff were more than helpful and always on hand to ensure you always had drinks. All the staff at the resort always went round with a smile on their faces and nothing was ever to much trouble for them. The entertainment staff were also good fun!! If my partner and I decide to visit Mexico again we would definitely visit Secrets Maroma again. I would highly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay. During our stay we decided to take a day trip to Chichen Itza - this is definitely worth visiting if you get a chance to visit this part of Mexico. Amazing to see the pyramids and learn about history. In all this was a great holiday!!

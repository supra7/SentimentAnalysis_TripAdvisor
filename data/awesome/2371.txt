Had a great stay at this Westin in Seattle last week. It couldn't be in a better location and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. It is a very short walk great places to eat as well as Pikes Market and several shopping malls. I walked around late at night and never felt unsafe. I was on the 41st floor and had an amazing view of downtown as well as the sound. If possible try to get a room as high up as you can. Bed was fantastic and the the bathroom was large and very clean. I didn't get to eat in the main restaurant but the breakfast cafe was very good. Seattle is a great town and I will definitley stay at this hotel again the next time I am in town.
